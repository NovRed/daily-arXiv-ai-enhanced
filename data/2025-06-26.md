### [1] [Computer Vision based Automated Quantification of Agricultural Sprayers Boom Displacement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19939)
*Aryan Singh Dalal,Sidharth Rai,Rahul Singh,Treman Singh Kaloya,Rahul Harsha Cheppally,Ajay Sharda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A computer vision system using YOLO models was developed to quantify spray boom movement in agricultural sprayers, achieving high accuracy and potential for design improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spray boom instability causes application errors in agricultural sprayers, but lack of quantitative data hinders systematic solutions.

Method: Developed a computer vision system with YOLO V7, V8, and V11 models to track boom movement, validated by an inclinometer sensor.

Result: Model detected targets with >90% accuracy and distance estimates within 0.026 m of sensor data.

Conclusion: The system effectively quantifies boom movement, aiding in design improvements for greater sprayer stability and accuracy.

Abstract: Application rate errors when using self-propelled agricultural sprayers for
agricultural production remain a concern. Among other factors, spray boom
instability is one of the major contributors to application errors. Spray
booms' width of 38m, combined with 30 kph driving speeds, varying terrain, and
machine dynamics when maneuvering complex field boundaries, make controls of
these booms very complex. However, there is no quantitative knowledge on the
extent of boom movement to systematically develop a solution that might include
boom designs and responsive boom control systems. Therefore, this study was
conducted to develop an automated computer vision system to quantify the boom
movement of various agricultural sprayers. A computer vision system was
developed to track a target on the edge of the sprayer boom in real time. YOLO
V7, V8, and V11 neural network models were trained to track the boom's
movements in field operations to quantify effective displacement in the
vertical and transverse directions. An inclinometer sensor was mounted on the
boom to capture boom angles and validate the neural network model output. The
results showed that the model could detect the target with more than 90 percent
accuracy, and distance estimates of the target on the boom were within 0.026 m
of the inclinometer sensor data. This system can quantify the boom movement on
the current sprayer and potentially on any other sprayer with minor
modifications. The data can be used to make design improvements to make sprayer
booms more stable and achieve greater application accuracy.

### [2] [EBC-ZIP: Improving Blockwise Crowd Counting with Zero-Inflated Poisson Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19955)
*Yiming Ma,Victor Sanchez,Tanaya Guha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EBC-ZIP introduces a Zero-Inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression framework for crowd counting, addressing imbalance in density maps and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing crowd counting methods ignore extreme sparsity in ground-truth density maps and use loss functions ill-suited for discrete count data.

Method: Proposes EBC-ZIP, using ZIP regression to replace traditional loss functions, built on the Enhanced Block Classification (EBC) framework.

Result: EBC-ZIP outperforms EBC and achieves state-of-the-art results on four benchmarks.

Conclusion: EBC-ZIP effectively handles zero-heavy distributions and improves count accuracy, demonstrating scalability and superior performance.

Abstract: Density map estimation has become the mainstream paradigm in crowd counting.
However, most existing methods overlook the extreme sparsity of ground-truth
density maps. In real-world crowd scenes, the vast majority of spatial regions
(often over 95%) contain no people, leading to heavily imbalanced count
distributions. Ignoring this imbalance can bias models toward overestimating
dense regions and underperforming in sparse areas. Furthermore, most loss
functions used in density estimation are majorly based on MSE and implicitly
assume Gaussian distributions, which are ill-suited for modeling discrete,
non-negative count data. In this paper, we propose EBC-ZIP, a crowd counting
framework that models the spatial distribution of counts using a Zero-Inflated
Poisson (ZIP) regression formulation. Our approach replaces the traditional
regression loss with the negative log-likelihood of the ZIP distribution,
enabling better handling of zero-heavy distributions while preserving count
accuracy. Built upon the recently proposed Enhanced Block Classification (EBC)
framework, EBC-ZIP inherits EBC's advantages in preserving the discreteness of
targets and ensuring training stability, while further improving performance
through a more principled probabilistic loss. We also evaluate EBC-ZIP with
backbones of varying computational complexity to assess its scalability.
Extensive experiments on four crowd counting benchmarks demonstrate that
EBC-ZIP consistently outperforms EBC and achieves state-of-the-art results.

### [3] [ToSA: Token Merging with Spatial Awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20066)
*Hsiang-Wei Huang,Wenhao Chai,Kuang-Ming Chen,Cheng-Yen Yang,Jenq-Neng Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ToSA introduces a token merging method for ViTs that combines semantic and spatial awareness, improving efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing token merging methods for ViTs rely on feature similarity, ignoring spatial information, which is crucial in early layers.

Method: ToSA uses depth images to generate pseudo spatial tokens, integrating spatial awareness into the merging process.

Result: ToSA outperforms previous methods in benchmarks and reduces ViT runtime.

Conclusion: ToSA is an efficient solution for ViT acceleration, preserving scene structure better than existing methods.

Abstract: Token merging has emerged as an effective strategy to accelerate Vision
Transformers (ViT) by reducing computational costs. However, existing methods
primarily rely on the visual token's feature similarity for token merging,
overlooking the potential of integrating spatial information, which can serve
as a reliable criterion for token merging in the early layers of ViT, where the
visual tokens only possess weak visual information. In this paper, we propose
ToSA, a novel token merging method that combines both semantic and spatial
awareness to guide the token merging process. ToSA leverages the depth image as
input to generate pseudo spatial tokens, which serve as auxiliary spatial
information for the visual token merging process. With the introduced spatial
awareness, ToSA achieves a more informed merging strategy that better preserves
critical scene structure. Experimental results demonstrate that ToSA
outperforms previous token merging methods across multiple benchmarks on visual
and embodied question answering while largely reducing the runtime of the ViT,
making it an efficient solution for ViT acceleration. The code will be

### [4] [BrokenVideos: A Benchmark Dataset for Fine-Grained Artifact Localization in AI-Generated Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20103)
*Jiahao Lin,Weixuan Peng,Bojia Zi,Yifeng Gao,Xianbiao Qi,Xingjun Ma,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces BrokenVideos, a benchmark dataset for detecting and localizing artifacts in AI-generated videos, improving model performance in artifact localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-generated videos suffer from visual artifacts, but existing datasets lack fine-grained spatial annotations for artifact localization.

Method: Developed BrokenVideos, a dataset of 3,254 AI-generated videos with pixel-level artifact annotations, validated by human inspection.

Result: Training models on BrokenVideos enhances their ability to localize corrupted regions, as demonstrated through experiments.

Conclusion: BrokenVideos provides a critical benchmark for advancing research on artifact localization in generative video models.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative models have led to significant progress in
video generation, yet the fidelity of AI-generated videos remains limited.
Synthesized content often exhibits visual artifacts such as temporally
inconsistent motion, physically implausible trajectories, unnatural object
deformations, and local blurring that undermine realism and user trust.
Accurate detection and spatial localization of these artifacts are crucial for
both automated quality control and for guiding the development of improved
generative models. However, the research community currently lacks a
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for artifact localization in AI
generated videos. Existing datasets either restrict themselves to video or
frame level detection or lack the fine-grained spatial annotations necessary
for evaluating localization methods. To address this gap, we introduce
BrokenVideos, a benchmark dataset of 3,254 AI-generated videos with
meticulously annotated, pixel-level masks highlighting regions of visual
corruption. Each annotation is validated through detailed human inspection to
ensure high quality ground truth. Our experiments show that training state of
the art artifact detection models and multi modal large language models (MLLMs)
on BrokenVideos significantly improves their ability to localize corrupted
regions. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that BrokenVideos
establishes a critical foundation for benchmarking and advancing research on
artifact localization in generative video models. The dataset is available at:

### [5] [From 2D to 3D Cognition: A Brief Survey of General World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20134)
*Ningwei Xie,Zizi Tian,Lei Yang,Xiao-Ping Zhang,Meng Guo,Jie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper surveys the evolution of world models from 2D perception to 3D cognition, highlighting key technological drivers and core cognitive capabilities, while addressing challenges and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field lacks systematic analysis of emerging techniques in 3D cognitive world models, necessitating a structured review to clarify their roles and advancements.

Method: Introduces a conceptual framework to categorize techniques, focusing on 3D representations and world knowledge as pillars, and dissects three core cognitive capabilities.

Result: Identifies applications in embodied AI, autonomous driving, digital twin, and gaming/VR, and outlines challenges in data, modeling, and deployment.

Conclusion: Future directions aim to advance robust and generalizable 3D world models, addressing current limitations.

Abstract: World models have garnered increasing attention in the development of
artificial general intelligence (AGI), serving as computational frameworks for
learning representations of the external world and forecasting future states.
While early efforts focused on 2D visual perception and simulation, recent
3D-aware generative world models have demonstrated the ability to synthesize
geometrically consistent, interactive 3D environments, marking a shift toward
3D spatial cognition. Despite rapid progress, the field lacks systematic
analysis to categorize emerging techniques and clarify their roles in advancing
3D cognitive world models. This survey addresses this need by introducing a
conceptual framework, providing a structured and forward-looking review of
world models transitioning from 2D perception to 3D cognition. Within this
framework, we highlight two key technological drivers, particularly advances in
3D representations and the incorporation of world knowledge, as fundamental
pillars. Building on these, we dissect three core cognitive capabilities that
underpin 3D world modeling: 3D physical scene generation, 3D spatial reasoning,
and 3D spatial interaction. We further examine the deployment of these
capabilities in real-world applications, including embodied AI, autonomous
driving, digital twin, and gaming/VR. Finally, we identify challenges across
data, modeling, and deployment, and outline future directions for advancing
more robust and generalizable 3D world models.

### [6] [EAR: Erasing Concepts from Unified Autoregressive Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20151)
*Haipeng Fan,Shiyuan Zhang,Baohunesitu,Zihang Guo,Huaiwen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EAR is a fine-tuning method for AR models to remove undesired concepts while preserving generation quality, using WGA and TLM strategies, and evaluated on the ECGVF benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AR models struggle with removing undesired concepts without degrading generation quality.

Method: Proposes EAR with WGA for patch-level alignment and TLM to protect unrelated content, evaluated on ECGVF benchmark.

Result: EAR improves erasure effectiveness and utility preservation in AR models.

Conclusion: EAR offers a robust solution for concept erasure in AR models while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have achieved unified and strong performance
across both visual understanding and image generation tasks. However, removing
undesired concepts from AR models while maintaining overall generation quality
remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose Erasure Autoregressive
Model (EAR), a fine-tuning method for effective and utility-preserving concept
erasure in AR models. Specifically, we introduce Windowed Gradient Accumulation
(WGA) strategy to align patch-level decoding with erasure objectives, and
Thresholded Loss Masking (TLM) strategy to protect content unrelated to the
target concept during fine-tuning. Furthermore, we propose a novel benchmark,
Erase Concept Generator and Visual Filter (ECGVF), aim at provide a more
rigorous and comprehensive foundation for evaluating concept erasure in AR
models. Specifically, we first employ structured templates across diverse large
language models (LLMs) to pre-generate a large-scale corpus of
target-replacement concept prompt pairs. Subsequently, we generate images from
these prompts and subject them to rigorous filtering via a visual classifier to
ensure concept fidelity and alignment. Extensive experimental results conducted
on the ECGVF benchmark with the AR model Janus-Pro demonstrate that EAR
achieves marked improvements in both erasure effectiveness and model utility
preservation. Code is available at: https://github.com/immc-lab/ear/

### [7] [Loss-Aware Automatic Selection of Structured Pruning Criteria for Deep Neural Network Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20152)
*Deepak Ghimire,Kilho Lee,Seong-heum Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LAASP introduces an efficient, loss-aware method for structured pruning of neural networks, combining pruning and training into one cycle, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and FLOPs reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To streamline and improve neural network pruning by eliminating the separate training stage and automating criteria selection, reducing manual effort and enhancing efficiency.

Method: LAASP integrates pruning and training into a single cycle, using loss-guided automatic selection of pruning criteria and layer-specific rates, with brief retraining to mitigate accuracy drops.

Result: Achieves 52% FLOPs reduction in ResNet56/110 on CIFAR-10 with improved accuracy, and 42% FLOPs reduction in ResNet50 on ImageNet with minimal accuracy drop.

Conclusion: LAASP is a highly effective, automated pruning method that outperforms existing techniques in both efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Structured pruning is a well-established technique for compressing neural
networks, making it suitable for deployment in resource-limited edge devices.
This paper presents an efficient Loss-Aware Automatic Selection of Structured
Pruning Criteria (LAASP) for slimming and accelerating deep neural networks.
The majority of pruning methodologies employ a sequential process consisting of
three stages: 1) training, 2) pruning, and 3) fine-tuning, whereas the proposed
pruning technique adopts a pruning-while-training approach that eliminates the
first stage and integrates the second and third stages into a single cycle. The
automatic selection of magnitude or similarity-based filter pruning criteria
from a specified pool of criteria and the specific pruning layer at each
pruning iteration is guided by the network's overall loss on a small subset of
the training data. To mitigate the abrupt accuracy drop due to pruning, the
network is retrained briefly after each reduction of a predefined number of
floating-point operations (FLOPs). The optimal pruning rates for each layer in
the network are automatically determined, eliminating the need for manual
allocation of fixed or variable pruning rates for each layer. Experiments on
the VGGNet and ResNet models on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet benchmark datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In particular, the
ResNet56 and ResNet110 models on the CIFAR-10 dataset significantly improve the
top-1 accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods while reducing the network
FLOPs by 52\%. Furthermore, the ResNet50 model on the ImageNet dataset reduces
FLOPs by more than 42\% with a negligible 0.33\% drop in top-5 accuracy. The

### [8] [Towards Efficient Exemplar Based Image Editing with Multimodal VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20155)
*Avadhoot Jadhav,Ashutosh Srivastava,Abhinav Java,Silky Singh,Tarun Ram Menta,Surgan Jandial,Balaji Krishnamurthy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for exemplar-based image editing using pretrained diffusion models and VLMs, outperforming baselines and being faster.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text alone is insufficient for ambiguous image edits; exemplar pairs better express such edits.

Method: Leverages pretrained text-to-image diffusion models and multimodal VLMs for optimization-free editing.

Result: Outperforms baselines on multiple edit types and is ~4x faster.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively transfers edits from exemplar pairs to content images efficiently.

Abstract: Text-to-Image Diffusion models have enabled a wide array of image editing
applications. However, capturing all types of edits through text alone can be
challenging and cumbersome. The ambiguous nature of certain image edits is
better expressed through an exemplar pair, i.e., a pair of images depicting an
image before and after an edit respectively. In this work, we tackle
exemplar-based image editing -- the task of transferring an edit from an
exemplar pair to a content image(s), by leveraging pretrained text-to-image
diffusion models and multimodal VLMs. Even though our end-to-end pipeline is
optimization-free, our experiments demonstrate that it still outperforms
baselines on multiple types of edits while being ~4x faster.

### [9] [Seeing is Believing? Mitigating OCR Hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20168)
*Zhentao He,Can Zhang,Ziheng Wu,Zhenghao Chen,Yufei Zhan,Yifan Li,Zhao Zhang,Xian Wang,Minghui Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces KIE-HVQA, a benchmark for evaluating OCR hallucination in degraded documents, and proposes a GRPO-based framework to mitigate hallucinations by incorporating visual uncertainty awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal models struggle with visual degradation, leading to unreliable outputs and hallucinations. The goal is to improve vision-faithful reasoning in degraded scenarios.

Method: The authors create KIE-HVQA for evaluation and introduce a GRPO-based framework with a novel reward mechanism, integrating self-awareness of visual uncertainty and refusal-to-answer analysis.

Result: The 7B-parameter model achieves a 22% improvement in hallucination-free accuracy over GPT-4o on KIE-HVQA, with no drop in standard task performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively reduces hallucinations in degraded document understanding while maintaining robustness in standard tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have enhanced
document understanding by integrating textual and visual information. However,
existing models exhibit incompleteness within their paradigm in real-world
scenarios, particularly under visual degradation. In such conditions, the
current response paradigm often fails to adequately perceive visual degradation
and ambiguity, leading to overreliance on linguistic priors or misaligned
visual-textual reasoning. This difficulty in recognizing uncertainty frequently
results in the generation of hallucinatory content, especially when a precise
answer is not feasible. To better demonstrate and analyze this phenomenon and
problem, we propose KIE-HVQA, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating OCR
hallucination in degraded document understanding. This dataset includes test
samples spanning identity cards and invoices, with simulated real-world
degradations for OCR reliability. This setup allows for evaluating models'
capacity, under degraded input, to distinguish reliable visual information and
answer accordingly, thereby highlighting the challenge of avoiding
hallucination on uncertain data. To achieve vision-faithful reasoning and
thereby avoid the aforementioned issues, we further introduce a GRPO-based
framework featuring a novel reward mechanism. By incorporating a self-awareness
of visual uncertainty and an analysis method that initiates refusal to answer
to increase task difficulty within our supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning framework, we successfully mitigated hallucinations in ambiguous
regions. Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate that our 7B-parameter model
achieves a 22\% absolute improvement in hallucination-free accuracy over GPT-4o
on KIE-HVQA and there is no significant performance drop in standard tasks,
highlighting both effectiveness and robustness.

### [10] [Towards Scalable and Generalizable Earth Observation Data Mining via Foundation Model Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20174)
*Man Duc Chuc*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Foundation models pretrained on remote sensing and general vision datasets can be combined to improve Earth Observation tasks, matching or outperforming larger models with less resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the underexplored strategy of reusing and combining existing pretrained models for Earth Observation tasks, as an alternative to training large models from scratch.

Method: Evaluated several models (Prithvi, Hiera, DOFA) on the GEO-Bench benchmark across 11 datasets, using feature-level ensembling and knowledge distillation.

Result: Feature-level ensembling of smaller pretrained models matched or exceeded larger models' performance with reduced training time and resources. Knowledge distillation further enabled compact deployment.

Conclusion: Combining pretrained models and knowledge distillation offers a practical, resource-efficient approach for deploying foundation models in Earth Observation applications.

Abstract: Foundation models are rapidly transforming Earth Observation data mining by
enabling generalizable and scalable solutions for key tasks such as scene
classification and semantic segmentation. While most efforts in the geospatial
domain have focused on developing large models trained from scratch using
massive Earth Observation datasets, an alternative strategy that remains
underexplored is the reuse and combination of existing pretrained models. In
this study, we investigate whether foundation models pretrained on remote
sensing and general vision datasets can be effectively combined to improve
performance across a diverse set of key Earth Observation tasks. Using the
GEO-Bench benchmark, we evaluate several prominent models, including Prithvi,
Hiera, and DOFA, on eleven datasets covering a range of spatial resolutions,
sensor modalities, and task types. The results show that feature-level
ensembling of smaller pretrained models can match or exceed the performance of
much larger models, while requiring less training time and computational
resources. Moreover, the study highlights the potential of applying knowledge
distillation to transfer the strengths of ensembles into more compact models,
offering a practical path for deploying foundation models in real-world Earth
Observation applications.

### [11] [Progressive Alignment Degradation Learning for Pansharpening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20179)
*Enzhe Zhao,Zhichang Guo,Yao Li,Fanghui Song,Boying Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper critiques the Wald protocol's limitations in pansharpening and introduces PADM and HFreqdiff for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Wald protocol's inaccurate degradation approximation limits deep pansharpening models' generalization.

Method: Proposes PADM (Progressive Alignment Degradation Module) and HFreqdiff, integrating diffusion frameworks and frequency-selective modules.

Result: Enhanced spatial sharpness and quality, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses Wald protocol limitations, improving pansharpening performance.

Abstract: Deep learning-based pansharpening has been shown to effectively generate
high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) images. To create supervised ground-truth
HRMS images, synthetic data generated using the Wald protocol is commonly
employed. This protocol assumes that networks trained on artificial
low-resolution data will perform equally well on high-resolution data. However,
well-trained models typically exhibit a trade-off in performance between
reduced-resolution and full-resolution datasets. In this paper, we delve into
the Wald protocol and find that its inaccurate approximation of real-world
degradation patterns limits the generalization of deep pansharpening models. To
address this issue, we propose the Progressive Alignment Degradation Module
(PADM), which uses mutual iteration between two sub-networks, PAlignNet and
PDegradeNet, to adaptively learn accurate degradation processes without relying
on predefined operators. Building on this, we introduce HFreqdiff, which embeds
high-frequency details into a diffusion framework and incorporates CFB and BACM
modules for frequency-selective detail extraction and precise reverse process
learning. These innovations enable effective integration of high-resolution
panchromatic and multispectral images, significantly enhancing spatial
sharpness and quality. Experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the
proposed method's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

*Yanzhe Chen,Huasong Zhong,Yan Li,Zhenheng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniCode$^2$ introduces a cascaded codebook framework for large-scale, stable visual tokenization, improving multimodal understanding and generation by aligning visual tokens with textual semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing codebook-based methods either lack fine-grained semantics or suffer from low token utilization and unstable training when scaled up.

Method: UniCode$^2$ clusters millions of SigLIP sequence embeddings to create a 500K-entry codebook, using a cascaded design with a frozen codebook for stability and a trainable one for task-specific refinement.

Result: The framework achieves strong performance across benchmarks, enabling high-quality visual synthesis and stable scaling of visual token spaces.

Conclusion: UniCode$^2$ demonstrates the viability of scaling visual tokenization without compromising stability, semantics, or modularity.

Abstract: Unified multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in
jointly advancing multimodal understanding and generation, with visual
codebooks discretizing images into tokens for autoregressive modeling. Existing
codebook-based methods either rely on small vocabularies (~16K entries) that
lack fine-grained semantics or naively scale up, resulting in low token
utilization and unstable training. We propose UniCode$^2$, a cascaded codebook
framework enabling large-scale, semantically aligned, and stable visual
tokenization. By clustering millions of SigLIP sequence embeddings, we build a
500K-entry codebook that preserves vision-language alignment while expanding
capacity. Stability is ensured via a cascaded design: a frozen codebook anchors
the embedding space, and a trainable codebook refines task-specific semantics.
This decoupling promotes high utilization and robust learning. Moreover, the
alignment of our visual tokens with textual semantics enables seamless
integration with pretrained diffusion decoders, supporting high-quality visual
synthesis with minimal adaptation. UniCode^2 delivers strong performance across
diverse benchmarks, demonstrating the viability of scaling visual token spaces
without sacrificing stability, semantics, or modularity.

### [13] [Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation for Hybrid Event-RGB Transmission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20222)
*Pujing Yang,Guangyi Zhang,Yunlong Cai,Lei Yu,Guanding Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A transmission scheme for hybrid RGB and event camera systems is proposed, optimizing bandwidth by eliminating redundancy and enabling real-time deblurring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hybrid RGB and event camera systems face challenges in transmitting large volumes of data efficiently, with redundancy between the two sources.

Method: A joint event and image (E-I) transmission framework using Bayesian modeling and the information bottleneck method to disentangle shared and domain-specific information.

Result: The scheme achieves superior reconstruction quality and enhanced deblurring performance compared to conventional systems.

Conclusion: The proposed framework optimizes bandwidth usage and improves performance in hybrid camera systems.

Abstract: Event cameras asynchronously capture pixel-level intensity changes with
extremely low latency. They are increasingly used in conjunction with RGB
cameras for a wide range of vision-related applications. However, a major
challenge in these hybrid systems lies in the transmission of the large volume
of triggered events and RGB images. To address this, we propose a transmission
scheme that retains efficient reconstruction performance of both sources while
accomplishing real-time deblurring in parallel. Conventional RGB cameras and
event cameras typically capture the same scene in different ways, often
resulting in significant redundant information across their outputs. To address
this, we develop a joint event and image (E-I) transmission framework to
eliminate redundancy and thereby optimize channel bandwidth utilization. Our
approach employs Bayesian modeling and the information bottleneck method to
disentangle the shared and domain-specific information within the E-I inputs.
This disentangled information bottleneck framework ensures both the compactness
and informativeness of extracted shared and domain-specific information.
Moreover, it adaptively allocates transmission bandwidth based on scene
dynamics, i.e., more symbols are allocated to events for dynamic details or to
images for static information. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
scheme not only achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to
conventional systems but also delivers enhanced deblurring performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPA is a lightweight framework for adapting surgical foundation models to institutional settings with minimal annotation, achieving state-of-the-art performance in few-shot surgical phase recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of developing generalizable models for surgical workflow understanding due to diverse operating room settings and domain shifts.

Method: SPA uses few-shot spatial adaptation, diffusion modeling for temporal consistency, and dynamic test-time adaptation to align multi-modal embeddings with institution-specific scenes.

Result: SPA outperforms full-shot models with 32-shot labeled data, achieving top performance in few-shot phase recognition across institutions.

Conclusion: SPA enables rapid customization of phase recognition models in hospitals with minimal annotation, addressing domain shifts effectively.

Abstract: The complexity and diversity of surgical workflows, driven by heterogeneous
operating room settings, institutional protocols, and anatomical variability,
present a significant challenge in developing generalizable models for
cross-institutional and cross-procedural surgical understanding. While recent
surgical foundation models pretrained on large-scale vision-language data offer
promising transferability, their zero-shot performance remains constrained by
domain shifts, limiting their utility in unseen surgical environments. To
address this, we introduce Surgical Phase Anywhere (SPA), a lightweight
framework for versatile surgical workflow understanding that adapts foundation
models to institutional settings with minimal annotation. SPA leverages
few-shot spatial adaptation to align multi-modal embeddings with
institution-specific surgical scenes and phases. It also ensures temporal
consistency through diffusion modeling, which encodes task-graph priors derived
from institutional procedure protocols. Finally, SPA employs dynamic test-time
adaptation, exploiting the mutual agreement between multi-modal phase
prediction streams to adapt the model to a given test video in a
self-supervised manner, enhancing the reliability under test-time distribution
shifts. SPA is a lightweight adaptation framework, allowing hospitals to
rapidly customize phase recognition models by defining phases in natural
language text, annotating a few images with the phase labels, and providing a
task graph defining phase transitions. The experimental results show that the
SPA framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot surgical phase
recognition across multiple institutions and procedures, even outperforming
full-shot models with 32-shot labeled data. Code is available at

### [15] [A Transformer Based Handwriting Recognition System Jointly Using Online and Offline Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20255)
*Ayush Lodh,Ritabrata Chakraborty,Shivakumara Palaiahnakote,Umapada Pal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an end-to-end network for handwriting recognition by fusing offline images and online stroke data early in a shared latent space, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handwriting recognition systems typically use only one modality (either rasterized glyphs or pen trajectories), missing complementary cues from both.

Method: A patch encoder processes grayscale images into visual tokens, while a lightweight transformer embeds stroke sequences. Learnable latent queries fuse both modalities early.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming previous bests by up to 1% on IAMOn-DB and VNOn-DB datasets.

Conclusion: Early fusion of offline and online data enhances representation learning, improving accuracy and writer independence.

Abstract: We posit that handwriting recognition benefits from complementary cues
carried by the rasterized complex glyph and the pen's trajectory, yet most
systems exploit only one modality. We introduce an end-to-end network that
performs early fusion of offline images and online stroke data within a shared
latent space. A patch encoder converts the grayscale crop into fixed-length
visual tokens, while a lightweight transformer embeds the $(x, y, \text{pen})$
sequence. Learnable latent queries attend jointly to both token streams,
yielding context-enhanced stroke embeddings that are pooled and decoded under a
cross-entropy loss objective. Because integration occurs before any high-level
classification, temporal cues reinforce each other during representation
learning, producing stronger writer independence. Comprehensive experiments on
IAMOn-DB and VNOn-DB demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy, exceeding previous bests by up to 1\%. Our study also shows
adaptation of this pipeline with gesturification on the ISI-Air dataset. Our
code can be found here.

*Ning Luo,Meiyin Hu,Huan Wan,Yanyan Yang,Zhuohang Jiang,Xin Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HMDRN improves few-shot fine-grained image classification by integrating dual-layer feature reconstruction and mask-enhanced processing, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for FS-FGIC lose spatial information or fail to utilize hierarchical features, limiting performance.

Method: HMDRN combines dual-layer feature reconstruction with mask-enhanced processing, balancing high-level semantics and mid-level details.

Result: HMDRN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three datasets, with ablation studies confirming its effectiveness.

Conclusion: HMDRN enhances inter-class discrimination and reduces intra-class variations, validated by superior feature reconstruction.

Abstract: Few-shot fine-grained image classification (FS-FGIC) presents a significant
challenge, requiring models to distinguish visually similar subclasses with
limited labeled examples. Existing methods have critical limitations:
metric-based methods lose spatial information and misalign local features,
while reconstruction-based methods fail to utilize hierarchical feature
information and lack mechanisms to focus on discriminative regions. We propose
the Hierarchical Mask-enhanced Dual Reconstruction Network (HMDRN), which
integrates dual-layer feature reconstruction with mask-enhanced feature
processing to improve fine-grained classification. HMDRN incorporates a
dual-layer feature reconstruction and fusion module that leverages
complementary visual information from different network hierarchies. Through
learnable fusion weights, the model balances high-level semantic
representations from the last layer with mid-level structural details from the
penultimate layer. Additionally, we design a spatial binary mask-enhanced
transformer self-reconstruction module that processes query features through
adaptive thresholding while maintaining complete support features, enhancing
focus on discriminative regions while filtering background noise. Extensive
experiments on three challenging fine-grained datasets demonstrate that HMDRN
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across Conv-4 and ResNet-12
backbone architectures. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of each proposed component, revealing that dual-layer
reconstruction enhances inter-class discrimination while mask-enhanced
transformation reduces intra-class variations. Visualization results provide
evidence of HMDRN's superior feature reconstruction capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning-based method for comparing canvas fabrics in art, bypassing traditional thread density maps, validated on Prado Museum canvases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional thread density map matching fails for non-contiguous canvases, necessitating a new approach for authentication and conservation.

Method: A Siamese deep learning model compares canvas images, using learned features and aggregated predictions for robust similarity scores.

Result: Effective comparison of plain weave canvases with similar thread densities, validated on Prado Museum artworks.

Conclusion: The method is accurate and feasible, offering new possibilities for analyzing masterpieces.

Abstract: The study of canvas fabrics in works of art is a crucial tool for
authentication, attribution and conservation. Traditional methods are based on
thread density map matching, which cannot be applied when canvases do not come
from contiguous positions on a roll. This paper presents a novel approach based
on deep learning to assess the similarity of textiles. We introduce an
automatic tool that evaluates the similarity between canvases without relying
on thread density maps. A Siamese deep learning model is designed and trained
to compare pairs of images by exploiting the feature representations learned
from the scans. In addition, a similarity estimation method is proposed,
aggregating predictions from multiple pairs of cloth samples to provide a
robust similarity score. Our approach is applied to canvases from the Museo
Nacional del Prado, corroborating the hypothesis that plain weave canvases,
widely used in painting, can be effectively compared even when their thread
densities are similar. The results demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of
the proposed method, opening new avenues for the analysis of masterpieces.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DenseWorld, a benchmark for 25 dense prediction tasks, and proposes DenseDiT, a method leveraging generative models for real-world generalization with minimal additional parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limited generalization of existing dense prediction methods to real-world scenarios and the scarcity of real-world data.

Method: DenseDiT uses a parameter-reuse mechanism and lightweight branches to integrate multi-scale context, requiring less than 0.1% additional parameters.

Result: DenseDiT outperforms baselines on DenseWorld, achieving superior results with less than 0.01% training data.

Conclusion: DenseDiT demonstrates practical value for real-world deployment, with data, checkpoints, and codes made available.

Abstract: Dense prediction tasks hold significant importance of computer vision, aiming
to learn pixel-wise annotated label for an input image. Despite advances in
this field, existing methods primarily focus on idealized conditions, with
limited generalization to real-world scenarios and facing the challenging
scarcity of real-world data. To systematically study this problem, we first
introduce DenseWorld, a benchmark spanning a broad set of 25 dense prediction
tasks that correspond to urgent real-world applications, featuring unified
evaluation across tasks. Then, we propose DenseDiT, which maximally exploits
generative models' visual priors to perform diverse real-world dense prediction
tasks through a unified strategy. DenseDiT combines a parameter-reuse mechanism
and two lightweight branches that adaptively integrate multi-scale context,
working with less than 0.1% additional parameters. Evaluations on DenseWorld
reveal significant performance drops in existing general and specialized
baselines, highlighting their limited real-world generalization. In contrast,
DenseDiT achieves superior results using less than 0.01% training data of
baselines, underscoring its practical value for real-world deployment. Our

### [19] [Breaking Spatial Boundaries: Spectral-Domain Registration Guided Hyperspectral and Multispectral Blind Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20293)
*Kunjing Yang,Libin Zheng,Minru Bai,Ting Lu,Leyuan Fang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a spectral-domain approach for registering and fusing hyperspectral (HSI) and multispectral (MSI) images, using a lightweight Spectral Prior Learning network and blind sparse fusion method, validated by experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for HSI and MSI fusion rely on spatial transformations, which are inefficient and perform poorly due to resolution differences. A spectral-domain approach is needed.

Method: Develops a Spectral Prior Learning (SPL) network for spectral feature extraction and MSI enhancement, followed by spatial downsampling. Uses blind sparse fusion (BSF) with group sparsity regularization and Proximal Alternating Optimization (PAO).

Result: Effective registration and fusion demonstrated on simulated and real datasets, with improved classification performance.

Conclusion: The proposed spectral-domain method outperforms spatial transformation approaches in efficiency and accuracy for HSI and MSI fusion.

Abstract: The blind fusion of unregistered hyperspectral images (HSIs) and
multispectral images (MSIs) has attracted growing attention recently. To
address the registration challenge, most existing methods employ spatial
transformations on the HSI to achieve alignment with the MSI. However, due to
the substantial differences in spatial resolution of the images, the
performance of these methods is often unsatisfactory. Moreover, the
registration process tends to be time-consuming when dealing with large-sized
images in remote sensing. To address these issues, we propose tackling the
registration problem from the spectral domain. Initially, a lightweight
Spectral Prior Learning (SPL) network is developed to extract spectral features
from the HSI and enhance the spectral resolution of the MSI. Following this,
the obtained image undergoes spatial downsampling to produce the registered
HSI. In this process, subspace representation and cyclic training strategy are
employed to improve spectral accuracy of the registered HSI obtained. Next, we
propose a blind sparse fusion (BSF) method, which utilizes group sparsity
regularization to equivalently promote the low-rankness of the image. This
approach not only circumvents the need for rank estimation, but also reduces
computational complexity. Then, we employ the Proximal Alternating Optimization
(PAO) algorithm to solve the BSF model, and present its convergence analysis.
Finally, extensive numerical experiments on simulated and real datasets are
conducted to verify the effectiveness of our method in registration and fusion.
We also demonstrate its efficacy in enhancing classification performance.

### [20] [Ctrl-Z Sampling: Diffusion Sampling with Controlled Random Zigzag Explorations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20294)
*Shunqi Mao,Wei Guo,Chaoyi Zhang,Weidong Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ctrl-Z Sampling is a novel method to escape local optima in diffusion models by dynamically alternating between refinement and exploration, improving generation quality with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models often converge to locally coherent but globally inconsistent outputs due to latent space complexity and suboptimal initialization. Existing solutions focus on guidance signals or noise manipulation, which may not fully address the issue.

Method: Ctrl-Z Sampling identifies local maxima using a reward model, injects noise to escape, and evaluates trajectories for improvement. It alternates between forward refinement and backward exploration.

Result: The method improves generation quality with only a 7.6X increase in function evaluations, demonstrating effectiveness without excessive computational cost.

Conclusion: Ctrl-Z Sampling offers a model-agnostic solution to enhance diffusion models by escaping local optima, balancing refinement and exploration for better outputs.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown strong performance in conditional generation by
progressively denoising Gaussian noise toward a target data distribution. This
denoising process can be interpreted as a form of hill climbing in a learned
latent space, where the model iteratively refines the sample toward regions of
higher probability. However, diffusion models often converge to local optima
that are locally visually coherent yet globally inconsistent or conditionally
misaligned, due to latent space complexity and suboptimal initialization. Prior
efforts attempted to address this by strengthening guidance signals or
manipulating the initial noise distribution. We introduce Controlled Random
Zigzag Sampling (Ctrl-Z Sampling), a novel sampling strategy designed to detect
and escape such local maxima during conditional generation. The method first
identifies potential local maxima using a reward model. Upon detection, it
injects noise and reverts to a previous, noisier state to escape the current
optimization plateau. The reward model then evaluates candidate trajectories,
accepting only those that offer improvement, while progressively deeper retreat
enables stronger escapes when nearby alternatives fail. This controlled random
zigzag process allows dynamic alternation between forward refinement and
backward exploration, enhancing both alignment and visual quality in the
generated outputs. The proposed Ctrl-Z Sampling is model-agnostic and
compatible with existing diffusion frameworks. Experimental results show that
Ctrl-Z Sampling substantially improves generation quality with only around 7.6X
increase in function evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Degraded images (noise, color cast, blur, light scattering) hinder downstream tasks like object detection and classification, necessitating better restoration methods.

Method: Developed a transformer-based diffusion model for image restoration, evaluated against deep learning methods on public datasets.

Result: The model outperforms existing methods in enhancing, denoising, and deraining tasks, improving image quality.

Conclusion: Diffusion models with transformers effectively restore degraded images, enhancing their utility in high-fidelity visual tasks.

Abstract: Images captured in challenging environments often experience various forms of
degradation, including noise, color cast, blur, and light scattering. These
effects significantly reduce image quality, hindering their applicability in
downstream tasks such as object detection, mapping, and classification. Our
transformer-based diffusion model was developed to address image restoration
tasks, aiming to improve the quality of degraded images. This model was
evaluated against existing deep learning methodologies across multiple quality
metrics for underwater image enhancement, denoising, and deraining on publicly
available datasets. Our findings demonstrate that the diffusion model, combined
with transformers, surpasses current methods in performance. The results of our
model highlight the efficacy of diffusion models and transformers in improving
the quality of degraded images, consequently expanding their utility in
downstream tasks that require high-fidelity visual data.

*Yaxi Chen,Simin Ni,Shaheer U. Saeed,Aleksandra Ivanova,Rikin Hargunani,Jie Huang,Chaozong Liu,Yipeng Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel radiomic fingerprint framework is proposed, dynamically selecting features per patient via DL, outperforming traditional radiomic signatures and matching end-to-end DL models while maintaining interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current radiomic approaches use fixed features at the population level, limiting performance and generalization. The paper aims to address this by personalizing feature selection for individual patients.

Method: A DL model dynamically selects radiomic features (fingerprints) per patient, trained alongside a low-dimensional logistic regression for classification.

Result: The method achieves comparable or superior accuracy to state-of-the-art DL models across knee MRI diagnostic tasks, with added interpretability.

Conclusion: The radiomic fingerprint framework improves diagnostic accuracy and interpretability, enabling clinical insights and biomarker discovery.

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of knee MRI scans relies on expert clinical judgment,
often with high variability and limited scalability. Existing radiomic
approaches use a fixed set of radiomic features (the signature), selected at
the population level and applied uniformly to all patients. While
interpretable, these signatures are often too constrained to represent
individual pathological variations. As a result, conventional radiomic-based
approaches are found to be limited in performance, compared with recent
end-to-end deep learning (DL) alternatives without using interpretable radiomic
features. We argue that the individual-agnostic nature in current radiomic
selection is not central to its intepretability, but is responsible for the
poor generalization in our application. Here, we propose a novel radiomic
fingerprint framework, in which a radiomic feature set (the fingerprint) is
dynamically constructed for each patient, selected by a DL model. Unlike the
existing radiomic signatures, our fingerprints are derived on a per-patient
basis by predicting the feature relevance in a large radiomic feature pool, and
selecting only those that are predictive of clinical conditions for individual
patients. The radiomic-selecting model is trained simultaneously with a
low-dimensional (considered relatively explainable) logistic regression for
downstream classification. We validate our methods across multiple diagnostic
tasks including general knee abnormalities, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)
tears, and meniscus tears, demonstrating comparable or superior diagnostic
accuracy relative to state-of-the-art end-to-end DL models. More importantly,
we show that the interpretability inherent in our approach facilitates
meaningful clinical insights and potential biomarker discovery, with detailed
discussion, quantitative and qualitative analysis of real-world clinical cases
to evidence these advantages.

### [23] [On the Burstiness of Faces in Set](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20312)
*Jiong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses burstiness in set-based face recognition (SFR), where certain faces dominate sets, degrading performance. It proposes detection methods (Quickshift++, feature self-similarity, GMP) and solutions (quality-aware GMP) to mitigate this, improving recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Burstiness in SFR causes poor generalization and biased evaluation due to overrepresented faces. The study aims to detect and suppress burstiness to enhance recognition performance.

Method: Three burst detection strategies (Quickshift++, feature self-similarity, GMP) are proposed. Solutions include adjusting sampling ratios and introducing quality-aware GMP for evaluation.

Result: Experiments show burstiness is widespread in SFR, and suppressing it significantly improves recognition performance.

Conclusion: Detecting and mitigating burstiness in SFR enhances generalization and evaluation accuracy, validated by benchmarks.

Abstract: Burstiness, a phenomenon observed in text and image retrieval, refers to that
particular elements appear more times in a set than a statistically independent
model assumes. We argue that in the context of set-based face recognition
(SFR), burstiness exists widely and degrades the performance in two aspects:
Firstly, the bursty faces, where faces with particular attributes %exist
frequently in a face set, dominate the training instances and dominate the
training face sets and lead to poor generalization ability to unconstrained
scenarios. Secondly, the bursty faces %dominating the evaluation sets interfere
with the similarity comparison in set verification and identification when
evaluation. To detect the bursty faces in a set, we propose three strategies
based on Quickshift++, feature self-similarity, and generalized max-pooling
(GMP). We apply the burst detection results on training and evaluation stages
to enhance the sampling ratios or contributions of the infrequent faces. When
evaluation, we additionally propose the quality-aware GMP that enables
awareness of the face quality and robustness to the low-quality faces for the
original GMP. We give illustrations and extensive experiments on the SFR
benchmarks to demonstrate that burstiness is widespread and suppressing
burstiness considerably improves the recognition performance.

*Sergio Torres Aguilar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks five object detection models on historical document datasets, finding that Transformer-based models excel in structured layouts, while CNN-OBB models perform better for complex documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the effectiveness of modern object detection architectures for robust Document Layout Analysis (DLA) in historical documents with complex layouts.

Method: Benchmarked five models (Co-DETR, Grounding DINO, YOLO variants) on three datasets (e-NDP, CATMuS, HORAE) using different bounding box representations (AABB, OBB).

Result: Co-DETR performed best on structured e-NDP (0.752 mAP), while YOLOv11x-OBB outperformed others on complex CATMuS (0.564) and HORAE (0.568). Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBB) proved essential.

Conclusion: Transformers are ideal for structured layouts, while CNN-OBB models generalize better for diverse and complex documents, highlighting a trade-off between context awareness and generalization.

Abstract: Robust Document Layout Analysis (DLA) is critical for the automated
processing and understanding of historical documents with complex page
organizations. This paper benchmarks five state-of-the-art object detection
architectures on three annotated datasets representing a spectrum of
codicological complexity: The e-NDP, a corpus of Parisian medieval registers
(1326-1504); CATMuS, a diverse multiclass dataset derived from various medieval
and modern sources (ca.12th-17th centuries) and HORAE, a corpus of decorated
books of hours (ca.13th-16th centuries). We evaluate two Transformer-based
models (Co-DETR, Grounding DINO) against three YOLO variants (AABB, OBB, and
YOLO-World). Our findings reveal significant performance variations dependent
on model architecture, data set characteristics, and bounding box
representation. In the e-NDP dataset, Co-DETR achieves state-of-the-art results
(0.752 mAP@.50:.95), closely followed by YOLOv11X-OBB (0.721). Conversely, on
the more complex CATMuS and HORAE datasets, the CNN-based YOLOv11x-OBB
significantly outperforms all other models (0.564 and 0.568, respectively).
This study unequivocally demonstrates that using Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBB)
is not a minor refinement but a fundamental requirement for accurately modeling
the non-Cartesian nature of historical manuscripts. We conclude that a key
trade-off exists between the global context awareness of Transformers, ideal
for structured layouts, and the superior generalization of CNN-OBB models for
visually diverse and complex documents.

TL;DR: A deep translational action recognition framework enhances accuracy by predicting action concepts and auxiliary features, integrating novel descriptors (ODF, SDF) and multimodal cues, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human action recognition requires high-level semantic reasoning and multimodal feature integration, beyond raw pixel analysis.

Method: Proposes a framework with hallucination streams for missing cues, novel descriptors (ODF, SDF), and integration of auxiliary modalities (optical flow, skeleton data, etc.). Includes aleatoric uncertainty modeling and a robust loss function.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like Kinetics-400, Kinetics-600, and Something-Something V2.

Conclusion: The framework effectively captures fine-grained action dynamics by integrating multimodal features and novel descriptors, demonstrating superior recognition accuracy.

Abstract: Understanding human actions in videos requires more than raw pixel analysis;
it relies on high-level semantic reasoning and effective integration of
multimodal features. We propose a deep translational action recognition
framework that enhances recognition accuracy by jointly predicting action
concepts and auxiliary features from RGB video frames. At test time,
hallucination streams infer missing cues, enriching feature representations
without increasing computational overhead. To focus on action-relevant regions
beyond raw pixels, we introduce two novel domain-specific descriptors. Object
Detection Features (ODF) aggregate outputs from multiple object detectors to
capture contextual cues, while Saliency Detection Features (SDF) highlight
spatial and intensity patterns crucial for action recognition. Our framework
seamlessly integrates these descriptors with auxiliary modalities such as
optical flow, Improved Dense Trajectories, skeleton data, and audio cues. It
remains compatible with state-of-the-art architectures, including I3D,
AssembleNet, Video Transformer Network, FASTER, and recent models like VideoMAE
V2 and InternVideo2. To handle uncertainty in auxiliary features, we
incorporate aleatoric uncertainty modeling in the hallucination step and
introduce a robust loss function to mitigate feature noise. Our multimodal
self-supervised action recognition framework achieves state-of-the-art
performance on multiple benchmarks, including Kinetics-400, Kinetics-600, and
Something-Something V2, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing
fine-grained action dynamics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework for robust image zero-watermarking using distortion-invariant feature learning, leaving the original image unaltered and achieving state-of-the-art robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a zero-watermarking method that preserves the original image while ensuring robustness against distortions.

Method: Combines noise-adversarial learning for invariant feature extraction and a learning-based multibit zero-watermarking scheme for message matching.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art robustness in feature stability and watermark recovery, outperforming existing techniques.

Conclusion: The framework excels in generalization and robustness, making it superior to current methods.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework for robust image
zero-watermarking based on distortion-invariant feature learning. As a
zero-watermarking scheme, our method leaves the original image unaltered and
learns a reference signature through optimization in the feature space. The
proposed framework consists of two key modules. In the first module, a feature
extractor is trained via noise-adversarial learning to generate representations
that are both invariant to distortions and semantically expressive. This is
achieved by combining adversarial supervision against a distortion
discriminator and a reconstruction constraint to retain image content. In the
second module, we design a learning-based multibit zero-watermarking scheme
where the trained invariant features are projected onto a set of trainable
reference codes optimized to match a target binary message. Extensive
experiments on diverse image datasets and a wide range of distortions show that
our method achieves state-of-the-art robustness in both feature stability and
watermark recovery. Comparative evaluations against existing self-supervised
and deep watermarking techniques further highlight the superiority of our
framework in generalization and robustness.

Motivation: Transformer-based trackers are powerful but slow on resource-constrained devices, limiting practicality.

Method: HiT introduces a Bridge Module and dual-image position encoding. DyHiT dynamically routes computations based on scene complexity. A training-free acceleration method is also proposed.

Result: HiT achieves 61 fps (64.6% AUC on LaSOT). DyHiT reaches 111 fps (62.4% AUC). The acceleration method speeds up SeqTrack-B256 by 2.68x without accuracy loss.

Conclusion: HiT and DyHiT offer efficient, high-performance tracking solutions, with dynamic routing and acceleration methods enhancing practicality.

Abstract: Transformer-based visual trackers have demonstrated significant advancements
due to their powerful modeling capabilities. However, their practicality is
limited on resource-constrained devices because of their slow processing
speeds. To address this challenge, we present HiT, a novel family of efficient
tracking models that achieve high performance while maintaining fast operation
across various devices. The core innovation of HiT lies in its Bridge Module,
which connects lightweight transformers to the tracking framework, enhancing
feature representation quality. Additionally, we introduce a dual-image
position encoding approach to effectively encode spatial information. HiT
achieves an impressive speed of 61 frames per second (fps) on the NVIDIA Jetson
AGX platform, alongside a competitive AUC of 64.6% on the LaSOT benchmark,
outperforming all previous efficient trackers.Building on HiT, we propose
DyHiT, an efficient dynamic tracker that flexibly adapts to scene complexity by
selecting routes with varying computational requirements. DyHiT uses search
area features extracted by the backbone network and inputs them into an
efficient dynamic router to classify tracking scenarios. Based on the
classification, DyHiT applies a divide-and-conquer strategy, selecting
appropriate routes to achieve a superior trade-off between accuracy and speed.
The fastest version of DyHiT achieves 111 fps on NVIDIA Jetson AGX while
maintaining an AUC of 62.4% on LaSOT.Furthermore, we introduce a training-free
acceleration method based on the dynamic routing architecture of DyHiT. This
method significantly improves the execution speed of various high-performance
trackers without sacrificing accuracy. For instance, our acceleration method
enables the state-of-the-art tracker SeqTrack-B256 to achieve a 2.68 times
speedup on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU while maintaining the same AUC of
69.9% on the LaSOT.

TL;DR: A novel model using a Large Vision Foundation Model (LVFM) was developed for high-resolution canopy height maps (CHMs) from RGB imagery, outperforming existing methods and enabling accurate aboveground biomass (AGB) monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cost-effective and accurate AGB monitoring is needed for carbon sequestration programs like China's CCER, but lidar-based methods are expensive, and deep learning with RGB imagery struggles with canopy height feature extraction.

Method: The model combines a feature extractor, self-supervised feature enhancement module, and height estimator, tested with 1-meter Google Earth imagery in Beijing's Fangshan District.

Result: Achieved a mean absolute error of 0.09 m, RMSE of 0.24 m, and correlation of 0.78 against lidar-based CHMs, with over 90% success in tree detection and high AGB estimation accuracy.

Conclusion: The LVFM-based approach is scalable and effective for carbon sequestration evaluation in plantations and natural forests.

Abstract: Accurate, cost-effective monitoring of plantation aboveground biomass (AGB)
is crucial for supporting local livelihoods and carbon sequestration
initiatives like the China Certified Emission Reduction (CCER) program.
High-resolution canopy height maps (CHMs) are essential for this, but standard
lidar-based methods are expensive. While deep learning with RGB imagery offers
an alternative, accurately extracting canopy height features remains
challenging. To address this, we developed a novel model for high-resolution
CHM generation using a Large Vision Foundation Model (LVFM). Our model
integrates a feature extractor, a self-supervised feature enhancement module to
preserve spatial details, and a height estimator. Tested in Beijing's Fangshan
District using 1-meter Google Earth imagery, our model outperformed existing
methods, including conventional CNNs. It achieved a mean absolute error of 0.09
m, a root mean square error of 0.24 m, and a correlation of 0.78 against
lidar-based CHMs. The resulting CHMs enabled over 90% success in individual
tree detection, high accuracy in AGB estimation, and effective tracking of
plantation growth, demonstrating strong generalization to non-training areas.
This approach presents a promising, scalable tool for evaluating carbon
sequestration in both plantations and natural forests.

*Changlu Guo,Anders Nymark Christensen,Morten Rieger Hannemose*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Med-Art is a framework for medical image generation with limited data, leveraging vision-language models and fine-tuning methods to achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in medical image generation, such as small datasets and scarce medical textual data.

Method: Uses vision-language models for visual descriptions, adapts PixArt-α (DiT-based), and introduces Hybrid-Level Diffusion Fine-tuning (HLDF) for pixel-level losses.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on two medical datasets (FID, KID, classification metrics).

Conclusion: Med-Art effectively overcomes data limitations and improves medical image generation quality.

Abstract: Text-to-image generative models have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in
recent years. However, their application in medical image generation still
faces significant challenges, including small dataset sizes, and scarcity of
medical textual data. To address these challenges, we propose Med-Art, a
framework specifically designed for medical image generation with limited data.
Med-Art leverages vision-language models to generate visual descriptions of
medical images which overcomes the scarcity of applicable medical textual data.
Med-Art adapts a large-scale pre-trained text-to-image model, PixArt-$\alpha$,
based on the Diffusion Transformer (DiT), achieving high performance under
limited data. Furthermore, we propose an innovative Hybrid-Level Diffusion
Fine-tuning (HLDF) method, which enables pixel-level losses, effectively
addressing issues such as overly saturated colors. We achieve state-of-the-art
performance on two medical image datasets, measured by FID, KID, and downstream
classification performance.

*Tobias Vontobel,Seyedmorteza Sadat,Farnood Salehi,Romann M. Weber*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiWave is a training-free, zero-shot method for ultra-high-resolution image synthesis using pretrained diffusion models, improving fidelity and coherence without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for high-resolution image synthesis with diffusion models suffer from artifacts and computational costs. HiWave addresses these issues.

Method: A two-stage pipeline: base image generation, patch-wise DDIM inversion, and a wavelet-based detail enhancer to preserve coherence and enrich details.

Result: HiWave outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing artifacts and achieving superior perceptual quality, preferred in 80% of user comparisons.

Conclusion: HiWave is effective for high-quality, ultra-high-resolution image synthesis without retraining or architectural changes.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the leading approach for image synthesis,
demonstrating exceptional photorealism and diversity. However, training
diffusion models at high resolutions remains computationally prohibitive, and
existing zero-shot generation techniques for synthesizing images beyond
training resolutions often produce artifacts, including object duplication and
spatial incoherence. In this paper, we introduce HiWave, a training-free,
zero-shot approach that substantially enhances visual fidelity and structural
coherence in ultra-high-resolution image synthesis using pretrained diffusion
models. Our method employs a two-stage pipeline: generating a base image from
the pretrained model followed by a patch-wise DDIM inversion step and a novel
wavelet-based detail enhancer module. Specifically, we first utilize inversion
methods to derive initial noise vectors that preserve global coherence from the
base image. Subsequently, during sampling, our wavelet-domain detail enhancer
retains low-frequency components from the base image to ensure structural
consistency, while selectively guiding high-frequency components to enrich fine
details and textures. Extensive evaluations using Stable Diffusion XL
demonstrate that HiWave effectively mitigates common visual artifacts seen in
prior methods, achieving superior perceptual quality. A user study confirmed
HiWave's performance, where it was preferred over the state-of-the-art
alternative in more than 80% of comparisons, highlighting its effectiveness for
high-quality, ultra-high-resolution image synthesis without requiring
retraining or architectural modifications.

### [31] [A Deep Learning Approach to Identify Rock Bolts in Complex 3D Point Clouds of Underground Mines Captured Using Mobile Laser Scanners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20464)
*Dibyayan Patra,Pasindu Ranasinghe,Bikram Banerjee,Simit Raval*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes DeepBolt, a two-stage deep learning method for automated rock bolt detection in 3D point clouds, outperforming existing techniques with high precision and recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual rock bolt surveying in underground mines is challenging due to low light and time constraints, necessitating automated solutions. Existing methods lack robustness in noisy, complex environments.

Method: DeepBolt, a novel two-stage deep learning architecture, addresses class imbalance and efficiently identifies rock bolts in 3D point clouds.

Result: DeepBolt achieves 96.41% precision and 96.96% recall, surpassing state-of-the-art models by up to 42.5% in IoU for rock bolt points.

Conclusion: DeepBolt is robust and effective for rock bolt identification in complex underground environments, offering significant improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Rock bolts are crucial components of the subterranean support systems in
underground mines that provide adequate structural reinforcement to the rock
mass to prevent unforeseen hazards like rockfalls. This makes frequent
assessments of such bolts critical for maintaining rock mass stability and
minimising risks in underground mining operations. Where manual surveying of
rock bolts is challenging due to the low light conditions in the underground
mines and the time-intensive nature of the process, automated detection of rock
bolts serves as a plausible solution. To that end, this study focuses on the
automatic identification of rock bolts within medium to large-scale 3D point
clouds obtained from underground mines using mobile laser scanners. Existing
techniques for automated rock bolt identification primarily rely on feature
engineering and traditional machine learning approaches. However, such
techniques lack robustness as these point clouds present several challenges due
to data noise, varying environments, and complex surrounding structures.
Moreover, the target rock bolts are extremely small objects within large-scale
point clouds and are often partially obscured due to the application of
reinforcement shotcrete. Addressing these challenges, this paper proposes an
approach termed DeepBolt, which employs a novel two-stage deep learning
architecture specifically designed for handling severe class imbalance for the
automatic and efficient identification of rock bolts in complex 3D point
clouds. The proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art semantic segmentation
models by up to 42.5% in Intersection over Union (IoU) for rock bolt points.
Additionally, it outperforms existing rock bolt identification techniques,
achieving a 96.41% precision and 96.96% recall in classifying rock bolts,
demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in complex underground
environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI-based deep learning framework using YOLOv8 and Keypoint R-CNN models to automatically detect and quantify alveolar bone loss in periodontitis from IOPA radiographs, achieving high accuracy in severity and pattern classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Periodontitis severely impacts oral health, and accurate bone loss assessment is crucial for diagnosis and treatment. Current methods rely on subjective manual evaluation, necessitating an automated, objective solution.

Method: The framework combines YOLOv8 for tooth detection, Keypoint R-CNN for landmark identification, and YOLOv8x-seg for bone level segmentation. Geometric analysis classifies bone loss patterns (horizontal vs. angular).

Result: The system achieved high accuracy: ICC up to 0.80 for severity and 87% accuracy for pattern classification on a dataset of 1000 radiographs.

Conclusion: The AI framework provides a rapid, objective tool for periodontal assessment, improving diagnosis and treatment planning, with potential to enhance patient care and clinical outcomes.

Abstract: Periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory disease causing alveolar bone loss,
significantly affects oral health and quality of life. Accurate assessment of
bone loss severity and pattern is critical for diagnosis and treatment
planning. In this study, we propose a novel AI-based deep learning framework to
automatically detect and quantify alveolar bone loss and its patterns using
intraoral periapical (IOPA) radiographs. Our method combines YOLOv8 for tooth
detection with Keypoint R-CNN models to identify anatomical landmarks, enabling
precise calculation of bone loss severity. Additionally, YOLOv8x-seg models
segment bone levels and tooth masks to determine bone loss patterns (horizontal
vs. angular) via geometric analysis. Evaluated on a large, expertly annotated
dataset of 1000 radiographs, our approach achieved high accuracy in detecting
bone loss severity (intra-class correlation coefficient up to 0.80) and bone
loss pattern classification (accuracy 87%). This automated system offers a
rapid, objective, and reproducible tool for periodontal assessment, reducing
reliance on subjective manual evaluation. By integrating AI into dental
radiographic analysis, our framework has the potential to improve early
diagnosis and personalized treatment planning for periodontitis, ultimately
enhancing patient care and clinical outcomes.

*Manyi Li,Renshuai Tao,Yufan Liu,Chuangchuang Tan,Haotong Qin,Bing Li,Yunchao Wei,Yao Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PLADA is a new framework for deepfake detection that addresses block effects in compressed images on social networks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake detection methods ignore block effects from compression in online social networks, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: PLADA uses Block Effect Eraser (B2E) and Open Data Aggregation (ODA) to handle block effects and leverage both paired and unpaired data.

Result: PLADA outperforms SoTA methods across 26 datasets, even with limited paired data and compression.

Conclusion: PLADA introduces block effects as a key factor in deepfake detection, offering a robust solution for open-world scenarios.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of deep learning, particularly through generative
adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models (DMs), AI-generated images, or
``deepfakes", have become nearly indistinguishable from real ones. These images
are widely shared across Online Social Networks (OSNs), raising concerns about
their misuse. Existing deepfake detection methods overlook the ``block effects"
introduced by compression in OSNs, which obscure deepfake artifacts, and
primarily focus on raw images, rarely encountered in real-world scenarios. To
address these challenges, we propose PLADA (Pay Less Attention to Deceptive
Artifacts), a novel framework designed to tackle the lack of paired data and
the ineffective use of compressed images. PLADA consists of two core modules:
Block Effect Eraser (B2E), which uses a dual-stage attention mechanism to
handle block effects, and Open Data Aggregation (ODA), which processes both
paired and unpaired data to improve detection. Extensive experiments across 26
datasets demonstrate that PLADA achieves a remarkable balance in deepfake
detection, outperforming SoTA methods in detecting deepfakes on OSNs, even with
limited paired data and compression. More importantly, this work introduces the
``block effect" as a critical factor in deepfake detection, providing a robust
solution for open-world scenarios. Our code is available at

*Yitong Quan,Benjamin Kiefer,Martin Messmer,Andreas Zell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes stacking consecutive frames as input for YOLO-based detectors to leverage temporal context, improving robustness without complex modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-frame detection struggles with motion blur, occlusions, and appearance changes in videos, while existing video-based methods are overly complex.

Method: Stack multiple consecutive frames as input to a YOLO-based detector, supervising only the target frame's output.

Result: Improved detection robustness, especially for lightweight models, and narrowed performance gaps between compact and heavy networks.

Conclusion: The method effectively uses temporal context with minimal architectural changes, validated on MOT20Det and BOAT360 datasets, and introduces the BOAT360 benchmark.

Abstract: Modern image-based object detection models, such as YOLOv7, primarily process
individual frames independently, thus ignoring valuable temporal context
naturally present in videos. Meanwhile, existing video-based detection methods
often introduce complex temporal modules, significantly increasing model size
and computational complexity. In practical applications such as surveillance
and autonomous driving, transient challenges including motion blur, occlusions,
and abrupt appearance changes can severely degrade single-frame detection
performance. To address these issues, we propose a straightforward yet highly
effective strategy: stacking multiple consecutive frames as input to a
YOLO-based detector while supervising only the output corresponding to a single
target frame. This approach leverages temporal information with minimal
modifications to existing architectures, preserving simplicity, computational
efficiency, and real-time inference capability. Extensive experiments on the
challenging MOT20Det and our BOAT360 datasets demonstrate that our method
improves detection robustness, especially for lightweight models, effectively
narrowing the gap between compact and heavy detection networks. Additionally,
we contribute the BOAT360 benchmark dataset, comprising annotated fisheye video
sequences captured from a boat, to support future research in multi-frame video
object detection in challenging real-world scenarios.

*Lei Zhu,Jun Zhou,Rick Siow Mong Goh,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an adversarial masked image modeling method to enhance semi-supervised medical image segmentation using Vision Transformers, addressing limited labeled data challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers require large labeled datasets, limiting their use in semi-supervised learning with scarce annotations. Existing methods struggle to train transformers effectively with limited labeled data.

Method: Introduces adversarial masked image modeling to create an auxiliary masked domain, leveraging labeled and pseudo-labeled data for supervision. Includes theoretical analysis and adversarial training to reduce domain gaps.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on three public medical image segmentation datasets.

Conclusion: The method effectively boosts semi-supervised learning performance for medical image segmentation by enhancing transformer training with limited labeled data.

Abstract: Vision Transformer has recently gained tremendous popularity in medical image
segmentation task due to its superior capability in capturing long-range
dependencies. However, transformer requires a large amount of labeled data to
be effective, which hinders its applicability in annotation scarce
semi-supervised learning scenario where only limited labeled data is available.
State-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods propose combinatorial
CNN-Transformer learning to cross teach a transformer with a convolutional
neural network, which achieves promising results. However, it remains a
challenging task to effectively train the transformer with limited labeled
data. In this paper, we propose an adversarial masked image modeling method to
fully unleash the potential of transformer for semi-supervised medical image
segmentation. The key challenge in semi-supervised learning with transformer
lies in the lack of sufficient supervision signal. To this end, we propose to
construct an auxiliary masked domain from original domain with masked image
modeling and train the transformer to predict the entire segmentation mask with
masked inputs to increase supervision signal. We leverage the original labels
from labeled data and pseudo-labels from unlabeled data to learn the masked
domain. To further benefit the original domain from masked domain, we provide a
theoretical analysis of our method from a multi-domain learning perspective and
devise a novel adversarial training loss to reduce the domain gap between the
original and masked domain, which boosts semi-supervised learning performance.
We also extend adversarial masked image modeling to CNN network. Extensive
experiments on three public medical image segmentation datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, where our method outperforms existing methods
significantly. Our code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a division-and-summarization (DaS) framework for dense video captioning, using event proposals and a two-stage LSTM with hierarchical attention to generate descriptive sentences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of dense video captioning by leveraging visual and semantic information from segmented videos.

Method: Partition videos into event proposals, extract visual features, generate segment descriptions, and summarize them using a two-stage LSTM with hierarchical attention.

Result: The DaS framework shows effectiveness on the ActivityNet Captions dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed DaS framework successfully combines visual and semantic cues for dense video captioning.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a division-and-summarization (DaS) framework for
dense video captioning. After partitioning each untrimmed long video as
multiple event proposals, where each event proposal consists of a set of short
video segments, we extract visual feature (e.g., C3D feature) from each segment
and use the existing image/video captioning approach to generate one sentence
description for this segment. Considering that the generated sentences contain
rich semantic descriptions about the whole event proposal, we formulate the
dense video captioning task as a visual cue aided sentence summarization
problem and propose a new two stage Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) approach
equipped with a new hierarchical attention mechanism to summarize all generated
sentences as one descriptive sentence with the aid of visual features.
Specifically, the first-stage LSTM network takes all semantic words from the
generated sentences and the visual features from all segments within one event
proposal as the input, and acts as the encoder to effectively summarize both
semantic and visual information related to this event proposal. The
second-stage LSTM network takes the output from the first-stage LSTM network
and the visual features from all video segments within one event proposal as
the input, and acts as the decoder to generate one descriptive sentence for
this event proposal. Our comprehensive experiments on the ActivityNet Captions
dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our newly proposed DaS framework for
dense video captioning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover true causal relationships in data generation processes, particularly in medical imaging, to enhance the reliability of latent features for disease classification.

Method: An end-to-end framework that groups observations to enforce invariance with respect to race, sex, and imaging views, learning identifiable causal representations.

Result: The causal representations improve generalisability and robustness across multiple classification tasks.

Conclusion: Grouping observations to enforce invariance is effective for learning identifiable causal representations, enhancing performance in medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Identifiable causal representation learning seeks to uncover the true causal
relationships underlying a data generation process. In medical imaging, this
presents opportunities to improve the generalisability and robustness of
task-specific latent features. This work introduces the concept of grouping
observations to learn identifiable representations for disease classification
in chest X-rays via an end-to-end framework. Our experiments demonstrate that
these causal representations improve generalisability and robustness across
multiple classification tasks when grouping is used to enforce invariance w.r.t
race, sex, and imaging views.

*Zhiwang Zhang,Dong Xu,Wanli Ouyang,Luping Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a graph-based partition-and-summarization (GPaS) framework for dense video captioning, addressing scene evolution issues by splitting events into segments and summarizing descriptions using GCN-LSTM interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to adequately explore scene evolution in long event proposals, leading to suboptimal performance when scenes and objects change.

Method: The GPaS framework splits events into segments for finer captioning and summarizes descriptions using GCN-LSTM interaction, leveraging visual cues.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ActivityNet Captions and YouCook II datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed GPaS framework effectively addresses scene evolution challenges in dense video captioning, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Recently, dense video captioning has made attractive progress in detecting
and captioning all events in a long untrimmed video. Despite promising results
were achieved, most existing methods do not sufficiently explore the scene
evolution within an event temporal proposal for captioning, and therefore
perform less satisfactorily when the scenes and objects change over a
relatively long proposal. To address this problem, we propose a graph-based
partition-and-summarization (GPaS) framework for dense video captioning within
two stages. For the ``partition" stage, a whole event proposal is split into
short video segments for captioning at a finer level. For the ``summarization"
stage, the generated sentences carrying rich description information for each
segment are summarized into one sentence to describe the whole event. We
particularly focus on the ``summarization" stage, and propose a framework that
effectively exploits the relationship between semantic words for summarization.
We achieve this goal by treating semantic words as nodes in a graph and
learning their interactions by coupling Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and
Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), with the aid of visual cues. Two schemes of
GCN-LSTM Interaction (GLI) modules are proposed for seamless integration of GCN
and LSTM. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated via an extensive
comparison with the state-of-the-arts methods on the two benchmarks ActivityNet
Captions dataset and YouCook II dataset.

Motivation: Traditional geometric methods struggle with lens distortions and environmental variability in omnidirectional imaging, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: A learning-based approach using a neural network to infer object distances directly from raw omnidirectional inputs, avoiding reliance on precise lens calibration.

Result: The proposed model outperforms traditional geometry-based methods and other learning baselines in accuracy and robustness across three diverse 360° datasets.

Conclusion: Deep learning shows promise for real-time omnidirectional distance estimation, making it suitable for low-cost robotics, autonomous navigation, and surveillance applications.

Abstract: Accurate distance estimation is a fundamental challenge in robotic
perception, particularly in omnidirectional imaging, where traditional
geometric methods struggle with lens distortions and environmental variability.
In this work, we propose a neural network-based approach for monocular distance
estimation using a single 360{\deg} fisheye lens camera. Unlike classical
trigonometric techniques that rely on precise lens calibration, our method
directly learns and infers the distance of objects from raw omnidirectional
inputs, offering greater robustness and adaptability across diverse conditions.
We evaluate our approach on three 360{\deg} datasets (LOAF, ULM360, and a newly
captured dataset Boat360), each representing distinct environmental and sensor
setups. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed learning-based
model outperforms traditional geometry-based methods and other learning
baselines in both accuracy and robustness. These findings highlight the
potential of deep learning for real-time omnidirectional distance estimation,
making our approach particularly well-suited for low-cost applications in
robotics, autonomous navigation, and surveillance.

TL;DR: A self-supervised video summarization model is introduced, avoiding costly attention-based methods and achieving state-of-the-art performance without annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency and brittleness of current video summarization methods, which rely on supervised annotations or complex architectures.

Method: Uses a Markov process-driven loss and a two-stage self-supervised learning paradigm, avoiding attention, RNNs, or transformers.

Result: Outperforms unsupervised methods on SUMME and TVSUM datasets and rivals supervised models.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the viability of efficient, annotation-free video summarization, challenging reliance on complex architectures.

Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of video content and the corresponding demand for
efficient access to meaningful information have elevated video summarization
and video highlights as a vital research area. However, many state-of-the-art
methods depend heavily either on supervised annotations or on attention-based
models, which are computationally expensive and brittle in the face of
distribution shifts that hinder cross-domain applicability across datasets. We
introduce a pioneering self-supervised video summarization model that captures
both spatial and temporal dependencies without the overhead of attention, RNNs,
or transformers. Our framework integrates a novel set of Markov process-driven
loss metrics and a two-stage self supervised learning paradigm that ensures
both performance and efficiency. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the SUMME and TVSUM datasets, outperforming all existing
unsupervised methods. It also rivals the best supervised models, demonstrating
the potential for efficient, annotation-free architectures. This paves the way
for more generalizable video summarization techniques and challenges the
prevailing reliance on complex architectures.

TL;DR: WonderFree enables interactive 3D scene generation from a single image, addressing novel view quality and cross-view consistency for immersive exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D generation methods struggle with limited explorability and rendering quality beyond the original viewpoint.

Method: Proposes WonderFree with WorldRestorer for novel view quality and ConsistView for cross-view consistency.

Result: Improves rendering quality and coherence, with a 77.20% user preference over WonderWorld.

Conclusion: WonderFree offers seamless and immersive 3D exploration, with public release of code, model, and data.

Abstract: Interactive 3D scene generation from a single image has gained significant
attention due to its potential to create immersive virtual worlds. However, a
key challenge in current 3D generation methods is the limited explorability,
which cannot render high-quality images during larger maneuvers beyond the
original viewpoint, particularly when attempting to move forward into unseen
areas. To address this challenge, we propose WonderFree, the first model that
enables users to interactively generate 3D worlds with the freedom to explore
from arbitrary angles and directions. Specifically, we decouple this challenge
into two key subproblems: novel view quality, which addresses visual artifacts
and floating issues in novel views, and cross-view consistency, which ensures
spatial consistency across different viewpoints. To enhance rendering quality
in novel views, we introduce WorldRestorer, a data-driven video restoration
model designed to eliminate floaters and artifacts. In addition, a data
collection pipeline is presented to automatically gather training data for
WorldRestorer, ensuring it can handle scenes with varying styles needed for 3D
scene generation. Furthermore, to improve cross-view consistency, we propose
ConsistView, a multi-view joint restoration mechanism that simultaneously
restores multiple perspectives while maintaining spatiotemporal coherence.
Experimental results demonstrate that WonderFree not only enhances rendering
quality across diverse viewpoints but also significantly improves global
coherence and consistency. These improvements are confirmed by CLIP-based
metrics and a user study showing a 77.20% preference for WonderFree over
WonderWorld enabling a seamless and immersive 3D exploration experience. The
code, model, and data will be publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SFNet, a novel forgery detection framework, leverages spatial and frequency domain features to detect fake remote sensing imagery (RSI) with improved accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of sophisticated generative AI makes fake RSI harder to detect, risking misinformation. Existing methods relying on single visual features struggle with diverse data.

Method: SFNet uses two feature extractors for spatial and frequency domains, aligns and fuses these features, and refines them using CBAM attention.

Result: SFNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 4%-15.18% in accuracy and shows robust generalization across datasets.

Conclusion: SFNet effectively addresses the limitations of single-feature methods, offering a robust solution for detecting fake RSI.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence is producing fake
remote sensing imagery (RSI) that is increasingly difficult to detect,
potentially leading to erroneous intelligence, fake news, and even conspiracy
theories. Existing forgery detection methods typically rely on single visual
features to capture predefined artifacts, such as spatial-domain cues to detect
forged objects like roads or buildings in RSI, or frequency-domain features to
identify artifacts from up-sampling operations in adversarial generative
networks (GANs). However, the nature of artifacts can significantly differ
depending on geographic terrain, land cover types, or specific features within
the RSI. Moreover, these complex artifacts evolve as generative models become
more sophisticated. In short, over-reliance on a single visual cue makes
existing forgery detectors struggle to generalize across diverse remote sensing
data. This paper proposed a novel forgery detection framework called SFNet,
designed to identify fake images in diverse remote sensing data by leveraging
spatial and frequency domain features. Specifically, to obtain rich and
comprehensive visual information, SFNet employs two independent feature
extractors to capture spatial and frequency domain features from input RSIs. To
fully utilize the complementary domain features, the domain feature mapping
module and the hybrid domain feature refinement module(CBAM attention) of SFNet
are designed to successively align and fuse the multi-domain features while
suppressing redundant information. Experiments on three datasets show that
SFNet achieves an accuracy improvement of 4%-15.18% over the state-of-the-art
RS forgery detection methods and exhibits robust generalization capabilities.

architectural design, robotics simulation, virtual reality, and gaming. Recent
approaches to 3D scene synthesis often rely on the commonsense reasoning of
large language models (LLMs) or strong visual priors of modern image generation
models. However, current LLMs demonstrate limited 3D spatial reasoning ability,
which restricts their ability to generate realistic and coherent 3D scenes.
Meanwhile, image generation-based methods often suffer from constraints in
viewpoint selection and multi-view inconsistencies. In this work, we present
Video Perception models for 3D Scene synthesis (VIPScene), a novel framework
that exploits the encoded commonsense knowledge of the 3D physical world in
video generation models to ensure coherent scene layouts and consistent object
placements across views. VIPScene accepts both text and image prompts and
seamlessly integrates video generation, feedforward 3D reconstruction, and
open-vocabulary perception models to semantically and geometrically analyze
each object in a scene. This enables flexible scene synthesis with high realism
and structural consistency. For more precise analysis, we further introduce
First-Person View Score (FPVScore) for coherence and plausibility evaluation,
utilizing continuous first-person perspective to capitalize on the reasoning
ability of multimodal large language models. Extensive experiments show that
VIPScene significantly outperforms existing methods and generalizes well across
diverse scenarios. The code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To replicate the human ability to perceive meaningful patterns (pareidolia) in ambiguous stimuli like clouds or stones.

Method: Uses open-vocabulary segmentation to extract silhouettes, interprets animal concepts via vision-language models, and synthesizes images with text-to-image diffusion, blending them into scenes.

Result: Demonstrated robustness and creative potential on diverse real-world inputs.

Conclusion: Shape2Animal opens new opportunities for visual storytelling, education, digital art, and interactive media.

Abstract: Humans possess a unique ability to perceive meaningful patterns in ambiguous
stimuli, a cognitive phenomenon known as pareidolia. This paper introduces
Shape2Animal framework to mimics this imaginative capacity by reinterpreting
natural object silhouettes, such as clouds, stones, or flames, as plausible
animal forms. Our automated framework first performs open-vocabulary
segmentation to extract object silhouette and interprets semantically
appropriate animal concepts using vision-language models. It then synthesizes
an animal image that conforms to the input shape, leveraging text-to-image
diffusion model and seamlessly blends it into the original scene to generate
visually coherent and spatially consistent compositions. We evaluated
Shape2Animal on a diverse set of real-world inputs, demonstrating its
robustness and creative potential. Our Shape2Animal can offer new opportunities
for visual storytelling, educational content, digital art, and interactive
media design. Our project page is here: https://shape2image.github.io

*Clément Forray,Pauline Delporte,Nicolas Delaygue,Florence Genin,Dawa Derksen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for 3D reconstruction of space objects from simulated images, focusing on joint optimization of camera poses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding space objects is crucial for applications like debris removal and anomaly detection, with 3D models being key for Space Situational Awareness (SSA).

Method: Leverages NeRF for 3D reconstruction, addressing challenges like monochromatic images and unknown object orientation. Focuses on optimizing camera poses jointly with NeRF, using regularization to constrain pose distances.

Result: Most accurate 3D reconstruction is achieved by training with successive images one-by-one and optimizing uniform rotation for camera poses.

Conclusion: Joint optimization of camera poses with NeRF improves 3D reconstruction accuracy for non-cooperative space objects, despite challenging conditions.

Abstract: Obtaining a better knowledge of the current state and behavior of objects
orbiting Earth has proven to be essential for a range of applications such as
active debris removal, in-orbit maintenance, or anomaly detection. 3D models
represent a valuable source of information in the field of Space Situational
Awareness (SSA). In this work, we leveraged Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to
perform 3D reconstruction of non-cooperative space objects from simulated
images. This scenario is challenging for NeRF models due to unusual camera
characteristics and environmental conditions : mono-chromatic images, unknown
object orientation, limited viewing angles, absence of diffuse lighting etc. In
this work we focus primarly on the joint optimization of camera poses alongside
the NeRF. Our experimental results show that the most accurate 3D
reconstruction is achieved when training with successive images one-by-one. We
estimate camera poses by optimizing an uniform rotation and use regularization
to prevent successive poses from being too far apart.

TL;DR: A Disentangled Representation Learning (DRL) method is proposed to improve interpretability in microscopy image classification, balancing accuracy and interpretability across three datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpretability remains a challenge in deep learning-based microscopy image analysis despite its importance for applications like diagnosis and environmental monitoring.

Method: The study uses a DRL framework, transferring representations learned from synthetic data to enhance interpretability for microscopy image classification.

Result: The DRL framework demonstrates a good trade-off between accuracy and interpretability across plankton, yeast vacuoles, and human cell datasets.

Conclusion: DRL offers a promising approach to address interpretability challenges in microscopy image analysis while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Microscopy image analysis is fundamental for different applications, from
diagnosis to synthetic engineering and environmental monitoring. Modern
acquisition systems have granted the possibility to acquire an escalating
amount of images, requiring a consequent development of a large collection of
deep learning-based automatic image analysis methods. Although deep neural
networks have demonstrated great performance in this field, interpretability,
an essential requirement for microscopy image analysis, remains an open
challenge.
  This work proposes a Disentangled Representation Learning (DRL) methodology
to enhance model interpretability for microscopy image classification.
Exploiting benchmark datasets from three different microscopic image domains
(plankton, yeast vacuoles, and human cells), we show how a DRL framework, based
on transferring a representation learnt from synthetic data, can provide a good
trade-off between accuracy and interpretability in this domain.

*Jinming Wu,Zihao Deng,Wei Li,Yiding Liu,Bo You,Bo Li,Zejun Ma,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMSearch-R1 is a reinforcement learning framework for LMMs to perform efficient, on-demand multimodal searches, outperforming RAG-based methods with fewer search calls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like RAG and search agents are inefficient for dynamic real-world information, necessitating a more flexible and efficient approach.

Method: An end-to-end RL framework integrating image/text search tools, trained with a multimodal VQA dataset and outcome-based rewards.

Result: Outperforms same-size RAG models and matches larger ones while reducing search calls by 30%.

Conclusion: MMSearch-R1 advances multimodal search efficiency and offers insights for future research.

Abstract: Robust deployment of large multimodal models (LMMs) in real-world scenarios
requires access to external knowledge sources, given the complexity and dynamic
nature of real-world information. Existing approaches such as
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and prompt engineered search agents rely
on rigid pipelines, often leading to inefficient or excessive search behaviors.
We present MMSearch-R1, the first end-to-end reinforcement learning framework
that enables LMMs to perform on-demand, multi-turn search in real-world
Internet environments. Our framework integrates both image and text search
tools, allowing the model to reason about when and how to invoke them guided by
an outcome-based reward with a search penalty. To support training, We collect
a multimodal search VQA dataset through a semi-automated pipeline that covers
diverse visual and textual knowledge needs and curate a search-balanced subset
with both search-required and search-free samples, which proves essential for
shaping efficient and on-demand search behavior. Extensive experiments on
knowledge-intensive and info-seeking VQA tasks show that our model not only
outperforms RAG-based baselines of the same model size, but also matches the
performance of a larger RAG-based model while reducing search calls by over
30%. We further analyze key empirical findings to offer actionable insights for
advancing research in multimodal search.

*Markus Gross,Aya Fahmy,Danit Niwattananan,Dominik Muhle,Rui Song,Daniel Cremers,Henri Meeß*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IPFormer introduces context-adaptive instance proposals for vision-based 3D Panoptic Scene Completion, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in panoptic metrics and runtime efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of static queries in Transformer-based SSC and the lack of camera-based PSC methods, IPFormer dynamically adapts instance proposals to observed scenes.

Method: IPFormer initializes queries as panoptic instance proposals from image context and refines them via attention-based encoding and decoding to model semantic instance-voxel relationships.

Result: IPFormer surpasses state-of-the-art in PQ$^\dagger$ and PQ-All, achieves runtime reduction >14x, and improves Thing-metrics by 18.65% with dynamic proposals.

Conclusion: IPFormer pioneers context-adaptive instance proposals for vision-based PSC, demonstrating significant improvements in performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has emerged as a pivotal approach for jointly
learning scene geometry and semantics, enabling downstream applications such as
navigation in mobile robotics. The recent generalization to Panoptic Scene
Completion (PSC) advances the SSC domain by integrating instance-level
information, thereby enhancing object-level sensitivity in scene understanding.
While PSC was introduced using LiDAR modality, methods based on camera images
remain largely unexplored. Moreover, recent Transformer-based SSC approaches
utilize a fixed set of learned queries to reconstruct objects within the scene
volume. Although these queries are typically updated with image context during
training, they remain static at test time, limiting their ability to
dynamically adapt specifically to the observed scene. To overcome these
limitations, we propose IPFormer, the first approach that leverages
context-adaptive instance proposals at train and test time to address
vision-based 3D Panoptic Scene Completion. Specifically, IPFormer adaptively
initializes these queries as panoptic instance proposals derived from image
context and further refines them through attention-based encoding and decoding
to reason about semantic instance-voxel relationships. Experimental results
show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods in overall panoptic
metrics PQ$^\dagger$ and PQ-All, matches performance in individual metrics, and
achieves a runtime reduction exceeding 14$\times$. Furthermore, our ablation
studies reveal that dynamically deriving instance proposals from image context,
as opposed to random initialization, leads to a 3.62% increase in PQ-All and a
remarkable average improvement of 18.65% in combined Thing-metrics. These
results highlight our introduction of context-adaptive instance proposals as a
pioneering effort in addressing vision-based 3D Panoptic Scene Completion.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel framework for context attribution in generative QA systems using combinatorial multi-armed bandits (CMAB) and Combinatorial Thompson Sampling (CTS) for efficient exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build interpretable and trustworthy generative QA systems by identifying which parts of retrieved context contribute to the model's answers.

Method: Formulates context attribution as a CMAB problem, treating each context segment as a bandit arm and using CTS to explore context subsets efficiently. Defines a reward function based on normalized token likelihoods.

Result: Achieves competitive attribution quality with fewer model queries compared to traditional methods like SHAP.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves query efficiency and maintains high attribution fidelity, making it practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Understanding which parts of the retrieved context contribute to a large
language model's generated answer is essential for building interpretable and
trustworthy generative QA systems. We propose a novel framework that formulates
context attribution as a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) problem. Each
context segment is treated as a bandit arm, and we employ Combinatorial
Thompson Sampling (CTS) to efficiently explore the exponentially large space of
context subsets under a limited query budget. Our method defines a reward
function based on normalized token likelihoods, capturing how well a subset of
segments supports the original model response. Unlike traditional
perturbation-based attribution methods such as SHAP, which sample subsets
uniformly and incur high computational costs, our approach adaptively balances
exploration and exploitation by leveraging posterior estimates of segment
relevance. This leads to substantially improved query efficiency while
maintaining high attribution fidelity. Extensive experiments on diverse
datasets and LLMs demonstrate that our method achieves competitive attribution
quality with fewer model queries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address environmental and ethical concerns of AI in healthcare, focusing on resource use and privacy.

Method: Developed a customizable RAG framework for medical tasks, tested with open-source LLMs, and compared performance/energy use to commercial models.

Result: RAG models (e.g., llama3.1:8B) achieved higher accuracy (58.5%) and lower energy/CO2 emissions than commercial models.

Conclusion: Local LLMs can create efficient, sustainable RAGs for medical tasks, aligning with UN sustainability goals.

Abstract: Background The increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in
healthcare has sparked growing concerns about its environmental and ethical
implications. Commercial Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and
DeepSeek, require substantial resources, while the utilization of these systems
for medical purposes raises critical issues regarding patient privacy and
safety. Methods We developed a customizable Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) framework for medical tasks, which monitors its energy usage and CO2
emissions. This system was then used to create RAGs based on various
open-source LLMs. The tested models included both general purpose models like
llama3.1:8b and medgemma-4b-it, which is medical-domain specific. The best RAGs
performance and energy consumption was compared to DeepSeekV3-R1 and OpenAIs
o4-mini model. A dataset of medical questions was used for the evaluation.
Results Custom RAG models outperformed commercial models in accuracy and energy
consumption. The RAG model built on llama3.1:8B achieved the highest accuracy
(58.5%) and was significantly better than other models, including o4-mini and
DeepSeekV3-R1. The llama3.1-RAG also exhibited the lowest energy consumption
and CO2 footprint among all models, with a Performance per kWh of 0.52 and a
total CO2 emission of 473g. Compared to o4-mini, the llama3.1-RAG achieved 2.7x
times more accuracy points per kWh and 172% less electricity usage while
maintaining higher accuracy. Conclusion Our study demonstrates that local LLMs
can be leveraged to develop RAGs that outperform commercial, online LLMs in
medical tasks, while having a smaller environmental impact. Our modular
framework promotes sustainable AI development, reducing electricity usage and
aligning with the UNs Sustainable Development Goals.

*Saloni Dash,Amélie Reymond,Emma S. Spiro,Aylin Caliskan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit human-like motivated reasoning when assigned personas, reducing veracity discernment and aligning with identity-congruent conclusions, with debiasing methods proving ineffective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if LLMs, like humans, show motivated reasoning when assigned political and socio-demographic personas, and whether this affects their judgment on critical issues.

Method: Tested 8 LLMs with 8 personas across 4 attributes on veracity discernment and scientific evidence evaluation tasks. Compared performance with and without personas.

Result: Persona-assigned LLMs showed up to 9% reduced veracity discernment and up to 90% higher accuracy on identity-congruent scientific evidence. Debiasing methods failed.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit human-like motivated reasoning, raising concerns about exacerbating identity-congruent biases in both models and humans.

Abstract: Reasoning in humans is prone to biases due to underlying motivations like
identity protection, that undermine rational decision-making and judgment. This
motivated reasoning at a collective level can be detrimental to society when
debating critical issues such as human-driven climate change or vaccine safety,
and can further aggravate political polarization. Prior studies have reported
that large language models (LLMs) are also susceptible to human-like cognitive
biases, however, the extent to which LLMs selectively reason toward
identity-congruent conclusions remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate
whether assigning 8 personas across 4 political and socio-demographic
attributes induces motivated reasoning in LLMs. Testing 8 LLMs (open source and
proprietary) across two reasoning tasks from human-subject studies -- veracity
discernment of misinformation headlines and evaluation of numeric scientific
evidence -- we find that persona-assigned LLMs have up to 9% reduced veracity
discernment relative to models without personas. Political personas
specifically, are up to 90% more likely to correctly evaluate scientific
evidence on gun control when the ground truth is congruent with their induced
political identity. Prompt-based debiasing methods are largely ineffective at
mitigating these effects. Taken together, our empirical findings are the first
to suggest that persona-assigned LLMs exhibit human-like motivated reasoning
that is hard to mitigate through conventional debiasing prompts -- raising
concerns of exacerbating identity-congruent reasoning in both LLMs and humans.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical LLMs overlook EHR data and focus narrowly on diagnosis, limiting clinical applicability.

Method: Uses a Clinical Test Reference (CTR) strategy to map EHR codes to descriptions and classify results. Employs reinforcement learning with reject sampling and tailored rewards for evidence acquisition and diagnosis.

Result: DiaLLM outperforms baselines in clinical test recommendation and diagnosis prediction.

Conclusion: DiaLLM enhances clinical applicability by integrating EHR data and improving diagnostic accuracy.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to remarkable
progresses in medical consultation. However, existing medical LLMs overlook the
essential role of Electronic Health Records (EHR) and focus primarily on
diagnosis recommendation, limiting their clinical applicability. We propose
DiaLLM, the first medical LLM that integrates heterogeneous EHR data into
clinically grounded dialogues, enabling clinical test recommendation, result
interpretation, and diagnosis prediction to better align with real-world
medical practice. To construct clinically grounded dialogues from EHR, we
design a Clinical Test Reference (CTR) strategy that maps each clinical code to
its corresponding description and classifies test results as "normal" or
"abnormal". Additionally, DiaLLM employs a reinforcement learning framework for
evidence acquisition and automated diagnosis. To handle the large action space,
we introduce a reject sampling strategy to reduce redundancy and improve
exploration efficiency. Furthermore, a confirmation reward and a
class-sensitive diagnosis reward are designed to guide accurate diagnosis
prediction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DiaLLM outperforms
baselines in clinical test recommendation and diagnosis prediction.

Motivation: Addressing the persistent challenge of ensuring independent reproducibility of published research findings in open science.

Method: The Reproducibility Copilot analyzes manuscripts, code, and supplementary materials to generate structured Jupyter Notebooks and recommendations. Feasibility tests used papers with known reproducibility benchmarks.

Result: OpenPub reduces reproduction time significantly (30+ hours to ~1 hour) and achieves high coverage of reproducible figures, tables, and results. It detects barriers like missing hyperparameters and incomplete datasets.

Conclusion: AI-driven tools like OpenPub can ease reproducibility burdens and enhance transparent, verifiable scientific communication, with potential for broader open science applications.

Abstract: Open science initiatives seek to make research outputs more transparent,
accessible, and reusable, but ensuring that published findings can be
independently reproduced remains a persistent challenge. This paper introduces
OpenPub, an AI-powered platform that supports researchers, reviewers, and
readers through a suite of modular copilots focused on key open science tasks.
In this work, we present the Reproducibility Copilot, which analyzes
manuscripts, code, and supplementary materials to generate structured Jupyter
Notebooks and recommendations aimed at facilitating computational, or "rote",
reproducibility. We conducted feasibility tests using previously studied
research papers with known reproducibility benchmarks. Results indicate that
OpenPub can substantially reduce reproduction time - from over 30 hours to
about 1 hour - while achieving high coverage of figures, tables, and results
suitable for computational reproduction. The system systematically detects
barriers to reproducibility, including missing hyperparameters, undocumented
preprocessing steps, and incomplete or inaccessible datasets. These findings
suggest that AI-driven tools can meaningfully reduce the burden of
reproducibility efforts and contribute to more transparent and verifiable
scientific communication. The modular copilot architecture also provides a
foundation for extending AI assistance to additional open science objectives
beyond reproducibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if LLMs can autonomously discover novel LM architectures by mimicking real research processes.

Method: Multi-agent LLM approach with stages: ideation, literature search, design implementation, pre-training, and evaluation. Uses genetic programming and scaling laws (Ladder of Scales).

Result: 1,162 new designs discovered (1,062 verified), with best designs outperforming GPT2 and Mamba2 on 6/9 benchmarks.

Conclusion: Genesys demonstrates effective autonomous discovery of competitive LM architectures, offering insights for future systems.

Abstract: Can we leverage LLMs to model the process of discovering novel language model
(LM) architectures? Inspired by real research, we propose a multi-agent LLM
approach that simulates the conventional stages of research, from ideation and
literature search (proposal stage) to design implementation (code generation),
generative pre-training, and downstream evaluation (verification). Using ideas
from scaling laws, our system, Genesys, employs a Ladder of Scales approach;
new designs are proposed, adversarially reviewed, implemented, and selectively
verified at increasingly larger model scales (14M$\sim$350M parameters) with a
narrowing budget (the number of models we can train at each scale). To help
make discovery efficient and factorizable, Genesys uses a novel genetic
programming backbone, which we show has empirical advantages over commonly used
direct prompt generation workflows (e.g., $\sim$86\% percentage point
improvement in successful design generation, a key bottleneck). We report
experiments involving 1,162 newly discovered designs (1,062 fully verified
through pre-training) and find the best designs to be highly competitive with
known architectures (e.g., outperform GPT2, Mamba2, etc., on 6/9 common
benchmarks). We couple these results with comprehensive system-level ablations
and formal results, which give broader insights into the design of effective
autonomous discovery systems.

*Jihao Gu,Qihang Ai,Yingyao Wang,Pi Bu,Jingxuan Xing,Zekun Zhu,Wei Jiang,Ziming Wang,Yingxiu Zhao,Ming-Liang Zhang,Jun Song,Yuning Jiang,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Mobile-R1 introduces interactive multi-turn reinforcement learning with task-level rewards to enhance mobile agents' exploration and error correction, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mobile agents using offline reinforcement learning or action-level rewards struggle with dynamic environment interaction, leading to local optima and weak exploration.

Method: Mobile-R1 uses a three-stage training framework: initial format finetuning, single-step online training with action-level rewards, and multi-turn online training with task-level rewards.

Result: The approach improves exploration and error correction, with performance gains validated on a dataset of 28 Chinese apps and 24,521 annotations.

Conclusion: Mobile-R1 advances mobile agent capabilities and will release open-source resources, including datasets, benchmarks, and model weights.

Abstract: Vision-language model-based mobile agents have gained the ability to not only
understand complex instructions and mobile screenshots, but also optimize their
action outputs via thinking and reasoning, benefiting from reinforcement
learning, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). However, existing
research centers on offline reinforcement learning training or online
optimization using action-level rewards, which limits the agent's dynamic
interaction with the environment. This often results in agents settling into
local optima, thereby weakening their ability for exploration and error action
correction. To address these challenges, we introduce an approach called
Mobile-R1, which employs interactive multi-turn reinforcement learning with
task-level rewards for mobile agents. Our training framework consists of three
stages: initial format finetuning, single-step online training via action-level
reward, followed by online training via task-level reward based on multi-turn
trajectories. This strategy is designed to enhance the exploration and error
correction capabilities of Mobile-R1, leading to significant performance
improvements. Moreover, we have collected a dataset covering 28 Chinese
applications with 24,521 high-quality manual annotations and established a new
benchmark with 500 trajectories. We will open source all resources, including
the dataset, benchmark, model weight, and codes:

*Sungwon Han,Sungkyu Park,Seungeon Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: REFeat is a novel method using LLMs with structured reasoning to generate diverse and informative features for tabular data, outperforming existing approaches in accuracy and feature quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based feature generation methods often produce simple or repetitive features due to biases and lack of structured reasoning.

Method: REFeat guides LLMs using multiple reasoning types to steer feature generation, ensuring diversity and informativeness.

Result: Experiments on 59 datasets show REFeat achieves higher predictive accuracy and generates more meaningful features.

Conclusion: Incorporating rich reasoning and adaptive strategies in LLM-driven feature discovery holds promise for improving tabular data feature engineering.

Abstract: Feature engineering for tabular data remains a critical yet challenging step
in machine learning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to
automatically generate new features by leveraging their vast knowledge.
However, existing LLM-based approaches often produce overly simple or
repetitive features, partly due to inherent biases in the transformations the
LLM chooses and the lack of structured reasoning guidance during generation. In
this paper, we propose a novel method REFeat, which guides an LLM to discover
diverse and informative features by leveraging multiple types of reasoning to
steer the feature generation process. Experiments on 59 benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our approach not only achieves higher predictive accuracy on
average, but also discovers more diverse and meaningful features. These results
highlight the promise of incorporating rich reasoning paradigms and adaptive
strategy selection into LLM-driven feature discovery for tabular data.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Paladin-mini, a compact open-source classifier for grounding claims, and a new benchmark dataset, demonstrating its performance against state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of grounding claims in documents by providing supportive evidence, ensuring robust performance in real-world scenarios.

Method: Developed Paladin-mini, a 3.8B parameter classifier, and created the grounding-benchmark dataset for evaluation.

Result: Demonstrated Paladin-mini's performance with clear, reproducible results against current state-of-the-art benchmarks.

Conclusion: Paladin-mini and the grounding-benchmark offer effective tools for improving claim grounding in documents.

Abstract: This paper introduces two significant contributions to address the issue of
grounding claims in a given context. Grounding means that given a context
(document) and a claim, there's at least one supportive evidence for the claim
in the document. We will introduce Paladin-mini, a compact (3.8B parameters)
open-source classifier model (used for labeling data as grounded or ungrounded)
engineered for robust performance in real-world scenarios, and the
grounding-benchmark, a new evaluation dataset designed to assess performance on
critical reasoning tasks. We'll also demonstrate the results of Paladin-mini
with benchmarks against the current State-of-the-art and share clear and
reproducible results.

*Jinchun Du,Bojie Shen,Muhammad Aamir Cheema,Adel N. Toosi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Electric Vehicle Orienteering Problem with V2G (EVOP-V2G), a profit-maximization problem for EV drivers managing charging/discharging, and proposes two metaheuristic algorithms (EA and LNS) that outperform baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The integration of EVs into ride-hailing and delivery services, coupled with V2G technology, creates new challenges and opportunities for optimizing profits while managing charging and discharging.

Method: The problem is formulated as a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model, and two metaheuristic algorithms (evolutionary and large neighborhood search) are proposed for near-optimal solutions.

Result: Experiments on real-world data show the methods double driver profits compared to baselines, with near-optimal performance on small instances and scalability on larger ones.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates a promising approach for smarter, more profitable EV-based mobility systems that support the energy grid.

Abstract: With the rising popularity of electric vehicles (EVs), modern service
systems, such as ride-hailing delivery services, are increasingly integrating
EVs into their operations. Unlike conventional vehicles, EVs often have a
shorter driving range, necessitating careful consideration of charging when
fulfilling requests. With recent advances in Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology -
allowing EVs to also discharge energy back to the grid - new opportunities and
complexities emerge. We introduce the Electric Vehicle Orienteering Problem
with V2G (EVOP-V2G): a profit-maximization problem where EV drivers must select
customer requests or orders while managing when and where to charge or
discharge. This involves navigating dynamic electricity prices, charging
station selection, and route constraints. We formulate the problem as a Mixed
Integer Programming (MIP) model and propose two near-optimal metaheuristic
algorithms: one evolutionary (EA) and the other based on large neighborhood
search (LNS). Experiments on real-world data show our methods can double driver
profits compared to baselines, while maintaining near-optimal performance on
small instances and excellent scalability on larger ones. Our work highlights a
promising path toward smarter, more profitable EV-based mobility systems that
actively support the energy grid.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GymPN is a software library using Deep Reinforcement Learning for optimal decision-making in business processes, addressing partial observability and multiple decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance process management systems by supporting optimal task allocation decisions in organizations.

Method: Develops GymPN, a library leveraging Deep Reinforcement Learning, introducing partial observability and multi-decision modeling.

Result: Evaluated on eight business process patterns, GymPN enables easy modeling and learning of optimal policies.

Conclusion: GymPN addresses limitations of prior work, enabling realistic process decision representation and optimal policy learning.

Abstract: Process management systems support key decisions about the way work is
allocated in organizations. This includes decisions on which task to perform
next, when to execute the task, and who to assign the task to. Suitable
software tools are required to support these decisions in a way that is optimal
for the organization. This paper presents a software library, called GymPN,
that supports optimal decision-making in business processes using Deep
Reinforcement Learning. GymPN builds on previous work that supports task
assignment in business processes, introducing two key novelties: support for
partial process observability and the ability to model multiple decisions in a
business process. These novel elements address fundamental limitations of
previous work and thus enable the representation of more realistic process
decisions. We evaluate the library on eight typical business process
decision-making problem patterns, showing that GymPN allows for easy modeling
of the desired problems, as well as learning optimal decision policies.

TL;DR: MNCA combines probabilistic rules and noise with NCAs to better model stochastic biological processes, showing improved robustness and accuracy in simulations and segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deterministic NCAs struggle to capture real-world stochasticity in biological systems, limiting their applicability.

Method: Proposes Mixture of Neural Cellular Automata (MNCA), integrating probabilistic rule assignments and intrinsic noise to model diverse local behaviors.

Result: MNCAs outperform in tissue growth simulations, image morphogenesis robustness, and microscopy segmentation, demonstrating better stochastic dynamics modeling.

Conclusion: MNCAs are a promising tool for studying stochastic dynamical systems and self-growth processes due to their improved robustness and interpretability.

Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs) are a promising new approach to model
self-organizing processes, with potential applications in life science.
However, their deterministic nature limits their ability to capture the
stochasticity of real-world biological and physical systems.
  We propose the Mixture of Neural Cellular Automata (MNCA), a novel framework
incorporating the idea of mixture models into the NCA paradigm. By combining
probabilistic rule assignments with intrinsic noise, MNCAs can model diverse
local behaviors and reproduce the stochastic dynamics observed in biological
processes.
  We evaluate the effectiveness of MNCAs in three key domains: (1) synthetic
simulations of tissue growth and differentiation, (2) image morphogenesis
robustness, and (3) microscopy image segmentation. Results show that MNCAs
achieve superior robustness to perturbations, better recapitulate real
biological growth patterns, and provide interpretable rule segmentation. These
findings position MNCAs as a promising tool for modeling stochastic dynamical
systems and studying self-growth processes.

### [65] [Engineering Sentience](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20504)
*Konstantin Demin,Taylor Webb,Eric Elmoznino,Hakwan Lau*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A functional and computational definition of sentience for AI, emphasizing assertoric and qualitative sensory signals, with implementation insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a clear, implementable definition of sentience for AI, ensuring it captures subjective experience beyond mere perceptual encoding.

Method: Proposes sentience requires assertoric (persistent) and qualitative sensory signals, with potential implementation methods outlined.

Result: A framework for designing sentient AI, aiding in intentional creation and timely recognition of sentient artificial agents.

Conclusion: Defining sentience functionally helps in AI design and prevents inadvertent creation of sentient machines.

Abstract: We spell out a definition of sentience that may be useful for designing and
building it in machines. We propose that for sentience to be meaningful for AI,
it must be fleshed out in functional, computational terms, in enough detail to
allow for implementation. Yet, this notion of sentience must also reflect
something essentially 'subjective', beyond just having the general capacity to
encode perceptual content. For this specific functional notion of sentience to
occur, we propose that certain sensory signals need to be both assertoric
(persistent) and qualitative. To illustrate the definition in more concrete
terms, we sketch out some ways for potential implementation, given current
technology. Understanding what it takes for artificial agents to be
functionally sentient can also help us avoid creating them inadvertently, or at
least, realize that we have created them in a timely manner.

### [66] [Case-based Reasoning Augmented Large Language Model Framework for Decision Making in Realistic Safety-Critical Driving Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20531)
*Wenbin Gan,Minh-Son Dao,Koji Zettsu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a CBR-LLM framework combining case-based reasoning with LLMs to improve evasive maneuver decisions in autonomous driving, enhancing accuracy and alignment with human experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of LLMs in autonomous driving, such as domain adaptation and lack of experiential knowledge, to enable reliable, context-aware decision-making in high-risk scenarios.

Method: Integrates semantic scene understanding from dashcam videos with retrieval of past driving cases, using risk-aware prompting and similarity-based case retrieval to guide LLMs.

Result: Improves decision accuracy, justification quality, and alignment with human expert behavior across diverse risk scenarios.

Conclusion: The CBR-LLM framework shows promise as an adaptive, trustworthy decision-support tool for intelligent driving systems.

Abstract: Driving in safety-critical scenarios requires quick, context-aware
decision-making grounded in both situational understanding and experiential
reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their powerful general-purpose
reasoning capabilities, offer a promising foundation for such decision-making.
However, their direct application to autonomous driving remains limited due to
challenges in domain adaptation, contextual grounding, and the lack of
experiential knowledge needed to make reliable and interpretable decisions in
dynamic, high-risk environments. To address this gap, this paper presents a
Case-Based Reasoning Augmented Large Language Model (CBR-LLM) framework for
evasive maneuver decision-making in complex risk scenarios. Our approach
integrates semantic scene understanding from dashcam video inputs with the
retrieval of relevant past driving cases, enabling LLMs to generate maneuver
recommendations that are both context-sensitive and human-aligned. Experiments
across multiple open-source LLMs show that our framework improves decision
accuracy, justification quality, and alignment with human expert behavior.
Risk-aware prompting strategies further enhance performance across diverse risk
types, while similarity-based case retrieval consistently outperforms random
sampling in guiding in-context learning. Case studies further demonstrate the
framework's robustness in challenging real-world conditions, underscoring its
potential as an adaptive and trustworthy decision-support tool for intelligent
driving systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent AI framework for sustainable protein research, focusing on microbial sources, uses RAG with two GPT-based agents for literature search and information extraction. Fine-tuning and prompt engineering improved performance, with fine-tuning yielding higher cosine similarity scores (≥0.94).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the global demand for sustainable protein by accelerating domain-specific knowledge processing.

Method: Two GPT-based agents (literature search and information extraction) with RAG, optimized via fine-tuning and prompt engineering.

Result: Fine-tuning improved cosine similarity scores up to 25%, reaching ≥0.94, while prompt engineering had lower uncertainty.

Conclusion: The framework effectively supports sustainable protein research, with fine-tuning outperforming prompt engineering for accuracy.

Abstract: The global demand for sustainable protein sources has accelerated the need
for intelligent tools that can rapidly process and synthesise domain-specific
scientific knowledge. In this study, we present a proof-of-concept multi-agent
Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework designed to support sustainable protein
production research, with an initial focus on microbial protein sources. Our
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-oriented system consists of two GPT-based
LLM agents: (1) a literature search agent that retrieves relevant scientific
literature on microbial protein production for a specified microbial strain,
and (2) an information extraction agent that processes the retrieved content to
extract relevant biological and chemical information. Two parallel
methodologies, fine-tuning and prompt engineering, were explored for agent
optimisation. Both methods demonstrated effectiveness at improving the
performance of the information extraction agent in terms of transformer-based
cosine similarity scores between obtained and ideal outputs. Mean cosine
similarity scores were increased by up to 25%, while universally reaching mean
scores of $\geq 0.89$ against ideal output text. Fine-tuning overall improved
the mean scores to a greater extent (consistently of $\geq 0.94$) compared to
prompt engineering, although lower statistical uncertainties were observed with
the latter approach. A user interface was developed and published for enabling
the use of the multi-agent AI system, alongside preliminary exploration of
additional chemical safety-based search capabilities

demonstrates effective video segmentation accuracy and strong pedagogical
alignment across knowledge, method, action, and interaction layers. Ablation
studies confirm the necessity of each component in generating effective

TL;DR: The paper discusses using LLMs to organize and utilize PETSc's fragmented knowledge base, employing tools like RAG and chatbots to improve accessibility and documentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PETSc's extensive but informal knowledge base is underutilized, hindering users and developers. The goal is to make this knowledge more accessible and actionable.

Method: The team built an LLM-powered system with RAG, reranking algorithms, and chatbots, evaluated using various LLMs and embedding models.

Result: Initial experiences show improved knowledge accessibility and potential for enhancing documentation and workflows.

Conclusion: The framework aims to evolve into a robust platform for scientific software, accelerating discovery through better knowledge utilization.

Abstract: Generative AI, especially through large language models (LLMs), is
transforming how technical knowledge can be accessed, reused, and extended.
PETSc, a widely used numerical library for high-performance scientific
computing, has accumulated a rich but fragmented knowledge base over its three
decades of development, spanning source code, documentation, mailing lists,
GitLab issues, Discord conversations, technical papers, and more. Much of this
knowledge remains informal and inaccessible to users and new developers. To
activate and utilize this knowledge base more effectively, the PETSc team has
begun building an LLM-powered system that combines PETSc content with custom
LLM tools -- including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), reranking
algorithms, and chatbots -- to assist users, support developers, and propose
updates to formal documentation. This paper presents initial experiences
designing and evaluating these tools, focusing on system architecture, using
RAG and reranking for PETSc-specific information, evaluation methodologies for
various LLMs and embedding models, and user interface design. Leveraging the
Argonne Leadership Computing Facility resources, we analyze how LLM responses
can enhance the development and use of numerical software, with an initial
focus on scalable Krylov solvers. Our goal is to establish an extensible
framework for knowledge-centered AI in scientific software, enabling scalable
support, enriched documentation, and enhanced workflows for research and
development. We conclude by outlining directions for expanding this system into
a robust, evolving platform that advances software ecosystems to accelerate
scientific discovery.

Motivation: Existing ML agents operate in isolation, missing the collaborative benefits of human research communities. MLE-Live and CoMind aim to bridge this gap.

Method: Introduces MLE-Live for live evaluation and CoMind, an agent designed to exchange insights and develop solutions within a simulated Kaggle community.

Result: CoMind achieves state-of-the-art performance on MLE-Live and outperforms 79.2% of human competitors in four Kaggle competitions.

Conclusion: CoMind demonstrates the potential of collaborative ML agents, with code publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Large language model-based machine learning (ML) agents have shown great
promise in automating ML research. However, existing agents typically operate
in isolation on a given research problem, without engaging with the broader
research community, where human researchers often gain insights and contribute
by sharing knowledge. To bridge this gap, we introduce MLE-Live, a live
evaluation framework designed to assess an agent's ability to communicate with
and leverage collective knowledge from a simulated Kaggle research community.
Building on this framework, we propose CoMind, a novel agent that excels at
exchanging insights and developing novel solutions within a community context.

*Andrei Lupu,Timon Willi,Jakob Foerster*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Decrypto is a game-based benchmark for evaluating multi-agent reasoning and theory of mind (ToM) in LLMs, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for ToM and multi-agent abilities in LLMs are limited by narrow scope, data leakage, and lack of interactivity.

Method: Decrypto is designed as an interactive platform inspired by cognitive science, computational pragmatics, and multi-agent reinforcement learning.

Result: LLMs underperform humans and simple baselines in ToM tasks, with newer models performing worse than older ones.

Conclusion: Decrypto fills a critical gap in ToM evaluations, aiding the development of better artificial agents.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain agentic abilities, they will have to
navigate complex multi-agent scenarios, interacting with human users and other
agents in cooperative and competitive settings. This will require new reasoning
skills, chief amongst them being theory of mind (ToM), or the ability to reason
about the "mental" states of other agents. However, ToM and other multi-agent
abilities in LLMs are poorly understood, since existing benchmarks suffer from
narrow scope, data leakage, saturation, and lack of interactivity. We thus
propose Decrypto, a game-based benchmark for multi-agent reasoning and ToM
drawing inspiration from cognitive science, computational pragmatics and
multi-agent reinforcement learning. It is designed to be as easy as possible in
all other dimensions, eliminating confounding factors commonly found in other
benchmarks. To our knowledge, it is also the first platform for designing
interactive ToM experiments.
  We validate the benchmark design through comprehensive empirical evaluations
of frontier LLMs, robustness studies, and human-AI cross-play experiments. We
find that LLM game-playing abilities lag behind humans and simple
word-embedding baselines. We then create variants of two classic cognitive
science experiments within Decrypto to evaluate three key ToM abilities.
Surprisingly, we find that state-of-the-art reasoning models are significantly
worse at those tasks than their older counterparts. This demonstrates that
Decrypto addresses a crucial gap in current reasoning and ToM evaluations, and
paves the path towards better artificial agents.

*Deepon Halder,Thanmay Jayakumar,Raj Dabre*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CycleDistill is a bootstrapping method using LLMs and few-shot translation to create high-quality MT systems without parallel corpora, improving translation quality by 20-30 chrF points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parallel corpora are scarce for low-resource languages, limiting MT quality. CycleDistill addresses this by leveraging LLMs and monolingual data.

Method: CycleDistill iteratively generates synthetic parallel corpora via few-shot MT, fine-tuning the model with this data. It requires only 1-4 few-shot examples.

Result: Improves translation quality by 20-30 chrF points over few-shot baselines, especially for Indian languages. Softmax activations offer mild improvements.

Conclusion: CycleDistill effectively bypasses the need for parallel corpora, achieving high-quality MT for low-resource languages.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite their ability to perform few-shot
machine translation (MT), often lag behind dedicated MT systems trained on
parallel corpora, which are crucial for high quality machine translation (MT).
However, parallel corpora are often scarce or non-existent for low-resource
languages. In this paper, we propose CycleDistill, a bootstrapping approach
leveraging LLMs and few-shot translation to obtain high-quality MT systems.
CycleDistill involves iteratively generating synthetic parallel corpora from
monolingual corpora via zero- or few-shot MT, which is then used to fine-tune
the model that was used for generating said data for MT. CycleDistill does not
need parallel corpora beyond 1 to 4 few-shot examples, and in our experiments
focusing on three Indian languages, by relying solely on monolingual corpora,
it can achieve high-quality machine translation, improving upon a few-shot
baseline model by over 20-30 chrF points on average in the first iteration. We
also study the effect of leveraging softmax activations during the distillation
process and observe mild improvements in translation quality.

TL;DR: Inference-Scaled GraphRAG improves LLM performance on knowledge-intensive tasks by combining sequential and parallel scaling for better graph reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs underperform on knowledge-intensive tasks due to limited structured context and multi-hop reasoning. Existing RAG methods fail to capture relational structures in knowledge graphs.

Method: Introduces Inference-Scaled GraphRAG, combining sequential scaling (deep chain-of-thought traversal) and parallel scaling (majority voting over sampled trajectories) in an interleaved reasoning-execution loop.

Result: Significantly improves multi-hop question answering on GRBench, outperforming traditional GraphRAG and prior baselines.

Conclusion: Inference-time scaling is a practical, architecture-agnostic solution for enhancing structured knowledge reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive capabilities in
language understanding and generation, yet they continue to underperform on
knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks due to limited access to structured context
and multi-hop information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) partially
mitigates this by grounding generation in retrieved context, but conventional
RAG and GraphRAG methods often fail to capture relational structure across
nodes in knowledge graphs. We introduce Inference-Scaled GraphRAG, a novel
framework that enhances LLM-based graph reasoning by applying inference-time
compute scaling. Our method combines sequential scaling with deep
chain-of-thought graph traversal, and parallel scaling with majority voting
over sampled trajectories within an interleaved reasoning-execution loop.
Experiments on the GRBench benchmark demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves multi-hop question answering performance, achieving
substantial gains over both traditional GraphRAG and prior graph traversal
baselines. These findings suggest that inference-time scaling is a practical
and architecture-agnostic solution for structured knowledge reasoning with LLMs

TL;DR: Doc2Agent is a scalable pipeline for creating agents that generate and refine executable tools from unstructured API documentation, improving performance and reducing costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most API-based agents rely on curated toolsets, failing to address the complexity of real-world APIs. Building agents for arbitrary domains is challenging due to unstructured documentation and parameter inference.

Method: Doc2Agent generates executable tools from API docs and iteratively refines them using a code agent. It is evaluated on real-world, WebArena, and research APIs.

Result: Achieved 55% performance improvement and 90% lower cost compared to direct API calling on WebArena. Demonstrated adaptability in glycomaterial science.

Conclusion: Doc2Agent provides a scalable, generalizable solution for building tool agents from unstructured API documentation.

Abstract: REST APIs play important roles in enriching the action space of web agents,
yet most API-based agents rely on curated and uniform toolsets that do not
reflect the complexity of real-world APIs. Building tool-using agents for
arbitrary domains remains a major challenge, as it requires reading
unstructured API documentation, testing APIs and inferring correct parameters.
We propose Doc2Agent, a scalable pipeline to build agents that can call
Python-based tools generated from API documentation. Doc2Agent generates
executable tools from API documentations and iteratively refines them using a
code agent. We evaluate our approach on real-world APIs, WebArena APIs, and
research APIs, producing validated tools. We achieved a 55\% relative
performance improvement with 90\% lower cost compared to direct API calling on
WebArena benchmark. A domain-specific agent built for glycomaterial science
further demonstrates the pipeline's adaptability to complex, knowledge-rich
tasks. Doc2Agent offers a generalizable solution for building tool agents from
unstructured API documentation at scale.

Motivation: Existing models lack multi-task inference and explanatory outputs, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: STReason uses in-context learning to decompose queries into modular programs, generating solutions and rationales.

Result: STReason outperforms LLM baselines, excels in complex scenarios, and reduces expert workload.

Conclusion: STReason offers a promising direction for generalizable spatio-temporal reasoning systems.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal data mining plays a pivotal role in informed decision making
across diverse domains. However, existing models are often restricted to narrow
tasks, lacking the capacity for multi-task inference and complex long-form
reasoning that require generation of in-depth, explanatory outputs. These
limitations restrict their applicability to real-world, multi-faceted decision
scenarios. In this work, we introduce STReason, a novel framework that
integrates the reasoning strengths of large language models (LLMs) with the
analytical capabilities of spatio-temporal models for multi-task inference and
execution. Without requiring task-specific finetuning, STReason leverages
in-context learning to decompose complex natural language queries into modular,
interpretable programs, which are then systematically executed to generate both
solutions and detailed rationales. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we
construct a new benchmark dataset and propose a unified evaluation framework
with metrics specifically designed for long-form spatio-temporal reasoning.
Experimental results show that STReason significantly outperforms advanced LLM
baselines across all metrics, particularly excelling in complex,
reasoning-intensive spatio-temporal scenarios. Human evaluations further
validate STReason's credibility and practical utility, demonstrating its
potential to reduce expert workload and broaden the applicability to real-world
spatio-temporal tasks. We believe STReason provides a promising direction for
developing more capable and generalizable spatio-temporal reasoning systems.

*Dhruv Gupta,Gayathri Ganesh Lakshmy,Yiqing Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SACL improves code retrieval and generation by reducing bias and enriching semantic information, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current retrievers rely too much on surface-level textual features and exhibit bias towards well-documented code, even if irrelevant.

Method: Proposed SACL framework augments code or structural knowledge with semantic information to reduce bias and improve retrieval.

Result: SACL improves code retrieval (e.g., 12.8% Recall@1 on HumanEval) and code generation (e.g., 4.88% Pass@1 on HumanEval).

Conclusion: SACL effectively addresses biases in code retrieval and enhances performance in both retrieval and generation tasks.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG) is a critical technique for
enhancing code generation by retrieving relevant information. In this work, we
conduct an in-depth analysis of code retrieval by systematically masking
specific features while preserving code functionality. Our discoveries include:
(1) although trained on code, current retrievers heavily rely on surface-level
textual features (e.g., docstrings, identifier names), and (2) they exhibit a
strong bias towards well-documented code, even if the documentation is
irrelevant.Based on our discoveries, we propose SACL, a framework that enriches
textual information and reduces bias by augmenting code or structural knowledge
with semantic information. Extensive experiments show that SACL substantially
improves code retrieval (e.g., by 12.8% / 9.4% / 7.0% Recall@1 on HumanEval /
MBPP / SWE-Bench-Lite), which also leads to better code generation performance
(e.g., by 4.88% Pass@1 on HumanEval).

TL;DR: Survey on integrating compositional and symbolic properties into distributional semantic spaces to improve Transformer-based LMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance interpretability, controllability, compositionality, and generalization of LMs by bridging symbolic and distributional semantics.

Method: Review and compare three autoencoder architectures (VAE, VQVAE, SAE) for their latent geometries and semantic interpretability.

Result: Identifies how each architecture shapes latent space geometry in relation to semantic structure.

Conclusion: Proposes semantic representation learning as a way to unify symbolic and distributional semantics, improving LM capabilities.

Abstract: Integrating compositional and symbolic properties into current distributional
semantic spaces can enhance the interpretability, controllability,
compositionality, and generalisation capabilities of Transformer-based
auto-regressive language models (LMs). In this survey, we offer a novel
perspective on latent space geometry through the lens of compositional
semantics, a direction we refer to as \textit{semantic representation
learning}. This direction enables a bridge between symbolic and distributional
semantics, helping to mitigate the gap between them. We review and compare
three mainstream autoencoder architectures-Variational AutoEncoder (VAE),
Vector Quantised VAE (VQVAE), and Sparse AutoEncoder (SAE)-and examine the
distinctive latent geometries they induce in relation to semantic structure and
interpretability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Time-Series QA and EngineMT-QA dataset, proposing ITFormer to integrate time-series data with natural language, improving QA accuracy efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effectively integrating high-dimensional time-series data with natural language for dynamic tasks is challenging.

Method: Proposes ITFormer, a framework bridging time-series encoders with frozen LLMs to extract, align, and fuse temporal-textual features.

Result: ITFormer achieves strong QA accuracy improvement with minimal additional trainable parameters (<1%).

Conclusion: The work establishes a paradigm for integrating temporal data with natural language, enabling new multi-modal AI research.

Abstract: Time-series data are critical in diverse applications, such as industrial
monitoring, medical diagnostics, and climate research. However, effectively
integrating these high-dimensional temporal signals with natural language for
dynamic, interactive tasks remains a significant challenge. To address this, we
introduce the Time-Series Question Answering (Time-Series QA) task and release
EngineMT-QA, the first large-scale, multi-task, temporal-textual QA dataset
designed to capture complex interactions between time-series signals and
natural language. Building on this resource, we propose the Instruct Time
Transformer (ITFormer), a novel framework that bridges time-series encoders
with frozen large language models (LLMs). ITFormer effectively extracts,
aligns, and fuses temporal and textual features, achieving a strong improvement
in QA accuracy over strong baselines with fewer than 1\% additional trainable
parameters. By combining computational efficiency with robust cross-modal
modeling, our work establishes a adaptable paradigm for integrating temporal
data with natural language, paving the way for new research and applications in
multi-modal AI. More details about the project, including datasets and code,

*Songsoo Kim,Seungtae Lee,See Young Lee,Joonho Kim,Keechan Kan,Dukyong Yoon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A three-pass LLM framework improves PPV and reduces costs for radiology report proofreading compared to baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the low PPV of LLM-based proofreading in radiology due to low error prevalence.

Method: Tested three LLM frameworks on 1,000 radiology reports, measuring PPV, aTPR, and operational costs.

Result: Framework 3 significantly improved PPV (0.159) and reduced costs (USD 5.58 per 1,000 reports) while maintaining aTPR.

Conclusion: The three-pass LLM framework is effective for AI-assisted radiology report quality assurance.

Abstract: Background: The positive predictive value (PPV) of large language model
(LLM)-based proofreading for radiology reports is limited due to the low error
prevalence. Purpose: To assess whether a three-pass LLM framework enhances PPV
and reduces operational costs compared with baseline approaches. Materials and
Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on 1,000 consecutive radiology
reports (250 each: radiography, ultrasonography, CT, MRI) from the MIMIC-III
database. Two external datasets (CheXpert and Open-i) were validation sets.
Three LLM frameworks were tested: (1) single-prompt detector; (2) extractor
plus detector; and (3) extractor, detector, and false-positive verifier.
Precision was measured by PPV and absolute true positive rate (aTPR).
Efficiency was calculated from model inference charges and reviewer
remuneration. Statistical significance was tested using cluster bootstrap,
exact McNemar tests, and Holm-Bonferroni correction. Results: Framework PPV
increased from 0.063 (95% CI, 0.036-0.101, Framework 1) to 0.079 (0.049-0.118,
Framework 2), and significantly to 0.159 (0.090-0.252, Framework 3; P<.001 vs.
baselines). aTPR remained stable (0.012-0.014; P>=.84). Operational costs per
1,000 reports dropped to USD 5.58 (Framework 3) from USD 9.72 (Framework 1) and
USD 6.85 (Framework 2), reflecting reductions of 42.6% and 18.5%, respectively.
Human-reviewed reports decreased from 192 to 88. External validation supported
Framework 3's superior PPV (CheXpert 0.133, Open-i 0.105) and stable aTPR
(0.007). Conclusion: A three-pass LLM framework significantly enhanced PPV and
reduced operational costs, maintaining detection performance, providing an
effective strategy for AI-assisted radiology report quality assurance.

*Masaki Uto,Yuma Ito*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel method combines automated scoring with IRT to accurately estimate learner abilities while reducing manual grading.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to assess higher-order skills like expressive abilities and logical thinking efficiently, despite the labor-intensive nature of constructed-response tests.

Method: Leverages automated scoring technologies to impute missing scores in IRT, improving accuracy for sparse or heterogeneous data.

Result: High accuracy in ability estimation with significant reduction in manual grading workload.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the limitations of traditional IRT and manual grading, offering a scalable solution for ability assessment.

Abstract: Evaluating the abilities of learners is a fundamental objective in the field
of education. In particular, there is an increasing need to assess higher-order
abilities such as expressive skills and logical thinking. Constructed-response
tests such as short-answer and essay-based questions have become widely used as
a method to meet this demand. Although these tests are effective, they require
substantial manual grading, making them both labor-intensive and costly. Item
response theory (IRT) provides a promising solution by enabling the estimation
of ability from incomplete score data, where human raters grade only a subset
of answers provided by learners across multiple test items. However, the
accuracy of ability estimation declines as the proportion of missing scores
increases. Although data augmentation techniques for imputing missing scores
have been explored in order to address this limitation, they often struggle
with inaccuracy for sparse or heterogeneous data. To overcome these challenges,
this study proposes a novel method for imputing missing scores by leveraging
automated scoring technologies for accurate IRT-based ability estimation. The
proposed method achieves high accuracy in ability estimation while markedly
reducing manual grading workload.

### [81] [CCRS: A Zero-Shot LLM-as-a-Judge Framework for Comprehensive RAG Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20128)
*Aashiq Muhamed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CCRS, a novel suite of five metrics for evaluating RAG systems, leveraging a pretrained LLM as a zero-shot judge. It outperforms existing methods in efficiency and discriminative power.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG evaluation methods are either simplistic (lexical overlap) or inefficient (multi-stage pipelines). CCRS aims to provide a practical, comprehensive solution.

Method: CCRS uses a pretrained LLM to evaluate five metrics: Contextual Coherence, Question Relevance, Information Density, Answer Correctness, and Information Recall. It is tested on the BioASQ dataset.

Result: CCRS effectively discriminates RAG system performances (e.g., Mistral-7B outperforms Llama variants) and matches/exceeds RAGChecker's discriminative power while being more efficient.

Conclusion: CCRS offers a practical, efficient, and comprehensive framework for evaluating and improving RAG systems.

Abstract: RAG systems enhance LLMs by incorporating external knowledge, which is
crucial for domains that demand factual accuracy and up-to-date information.
However, evaluating the multifaceted quality of RAG outputs, spanning aspects
such as contextual coherence, query relevance, factual correctness, and
informational completeness, poses significant challenges. Existing evaluation
methods often rely on simple lexical overlap metrics, which are inadequate for
capturing these nuances, or involve complex multi-stage pipelines with
intermediate steps like claim extraction or require finetuning specialized
judge models, hindering practical efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose CCRS (Contextual Coherence and Relevance Score), a novel suite of five
metrics that utilizes a single, powerful, pretrained LLM as a zero-shot,
end-to-end judge. CCRS evaluates: Contextual Coherence (CC), Question Relevance
(QR), Information Density (ID), Answer Correctness (AC), and Information Recall
(IR). We apply CCRS to evaluate six diverse RAG system configurations on the
challenging BioASQ dataset. Our analysis demonstrates that CCRS effectively
discriminates between system performances, confirming, for instance, that the
Mistral-7B reader outperforms Llama variants. We provide a detailed analysis of
CCRS metric properties, including score distributions, convergent/discriminant
validity, tie rates, population statistics, and discriminative power. Compared
to the complex RAGChecker framework, CCRS offers comparable or superior
discriminative power for key aspects like recall and faithfulness, while being
significantly more computationally efficient. CCRS thus provides a practical,
comprehensive, and efficient framework for evaluating and iteratively improving
RAG systems.

*Ruosen Li,Ziming Luo,Quan Zhang,Ruochen Li,Ben Zhou,Ali Payani,Xinya Du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AALC, a lightweight reward system, reduces response length by 50% in large reasoning models while maintaining accuracy by dynamically balancing correctness and brevity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models (LRMs) incur high latency and cost due to lengthy chain-of-thoughts without proportional accuracy gains.

Method: AALC integrates a dynamically scheduled length penalty and validation accuracy into reinforcement learning to balance correctness and brevity.

Result: AALC reduces response length by over 50% while maintaining or improving accuracy, curbing redundant reasoning patterns.

Conclusion: Reward-based strategies like AALC can guide LRMs toward efficient, generalizable reasoning, though interpretability may decrease.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve impressive reasoning capabilities by
generating lengthy chain-of-thoughts, but this "overthinking" incurs high
latency and cost without commensurate accuracy gains. In this work, we
introduce AALC, a lightweight, accuracy-aware length reward integrated into
reinforcement learning that dynamically balances correctness and brevity during
training. By incorporating validation accuracy into the reward and employing a
smooth, dynamically scheduled length penalty, AALC delays length penalty until
target performance is met. Through extensive experiments across standard and
out-of-distribution math benchmarks, we show that our approach reduces response
length by over 50% while maintaining or even improving the original accuracy.
Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that our method curbs redundant
reasoning patterns such as excessive subgoal setting and verification, leading
to structurally refined outputs rather than naive truncation. We also identify
that efficiency gains are accompanied by reduced interpretability: models
trained with AALC omit some narrative framing and explanatory context. These
findings highlight the potential of reward-based strategies to guide LRMs
toward more efficient, generalizable reasoning paths.

*Fengze Li,Yue Wang,Yangle Liu,Ming Huang,Dou Hong,Jieming Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SEED integrates structural encoders and LLMs for multivariate time series forecasting, addressing the gap between structural dependencies and semantic reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models lack the ability to combine structural feature interactions with semantic-level reasoning or task adaptation, limiting unified prediction systems.

Method: SEED uses a token-aware encoder, projection module, semantic reprogramming, and frozen LLM for prediction, decoupling representation learning from inference.

Result: SEED consistently outperforms baselines and bridges the structural-semantic modeling gap across datasets.

Conclusion: SEED successfully integrates structural and semantic modeling for improved multivariate time series forecasting.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting requires models to simultaneously
capture variable-wise structural dependencies and generalize across diverse
tasks. While structural encoders are effective in modeling feature
interactions, they lack the capacity to support semantic-level reasoning or
task adaptation. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) possess strong
generalization capabilities but remain incompatible with raw time series
inputs. This gap limits the development of unified, transferable prediction
systems. Therefore, we introduce SEED, a structural encoder for
embedding-driven decoding, which integrates four stages: a token-aware encoder
for patch extraction, a projection module that aligns patches with language
model embeddings, a semantic reprogramming mechanism that maps patches to
task-aware prototypes, and a frozen language model for prediction. This modular
architecture decouples representation learning from inference, enabling
efficient alignment between numerical patterns and semantic reasoning.
Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves consistent
improvements over strong baselines, and comparative studies on various datasets
confirm SEED's role in addressing the structural-semantic modeling gap.

*Zhiyuan Wang,Jinhao Duan,Qingni Wang,Xiaofeng Zhu,Tianlong Chen,Xiaoshuang Shi,Kaidi Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: COIN is a framework for uncertainty quantification in foundation models, ensuring FDR control while improving answer retention and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of formal guarantees in heuristic UQ methods for selective prediction, particularly in controlling FDR and reducing incorrect candidates in prediction sets.

Method: COIN calibrates statistically valid thresholds using empirical error rates and confidence intervals (e.g., Clopper-Pearson) to filter answers under FDR constraints.

Result: COIN demonstrates robust FDR control, high test-time power in retaining answers, and efficiency with limited calibration data.

Conclusion: COIN is adaptable and extensible, with potential for improved performance through alternative UQ strategies and upper bound constructions.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for foundation models is essential to
identify and mitigate potential hallucinations in automatically generated text.
However, heuristic UQ approaches lack formal guarantees for key metrics such as
the false discovery rate (FDR) in selective prediction. Previous work adopts
the split conformal prediction (SCP) framework to ensure desired coverage of
admissible answers by constructing prediction sets, but these sets often
contain incorrect candidates, limiting their practical utility. To address
this, we propose COIN, an uncertainty-guarding selection framework that
calibrates statistically valid thresholds to filter a single generated answer
per question under user-specified FDR constraints. COIN estimates the empirical
error rate on a calibration set and applies confidence interval methods such as
Clopper-Pearson to establish a high-probability upper bound on the true error
rate (i.e., FDR). This enables the selection of the largest uncertainty
threshold that ensures FDR control on test data while significantly increasing
sample retention. We demonstrate COIN's robustness in risk control, strong
test-time power in retaining admissible answers, and predictive efficiency
under limited calibration data across both general and multimodal text
generation tasks. Furthermore, we show that employing alternative upper bound
constructions and UQ strategies can further boost COIN's power performance,
which underscores its extensibility and adaptability to diverse application
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating high-accuracy applications with LLMs is challenging, especially for subjective tasks like emotion recognition. The study aims to improve CER by refining ICL example retrieval.

Method: The study proposes strategies for retrieving high-quality examples in ICL, including random and augmented retrieval. It also analyzes conversational context's impact on CER accuracy, tested on IEMOCAP, MELD, and EmoryNLP datasets.

Result: Augmented example retrieval consistently outperforms other techniques, emphasizing the value of coherent, targeted examples enhanced through paraphrasing.

Conclusion: Augmented retrieval is key to improving CER in LLMs, demonstrating the importance of high-quality example selection and enhancement.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled a wide variety of real-world
applications in various domains. However, creating a high-performing
application with high accuracy remains challenging, particularly for subjective
tasks like emotion recognition. Inspired by the SLT 2024 GenSER Challenge, this
study investigates approaches to improving conversational emotion recognition
(CER) by LLMs. Specifically, we explore how to retrieve high-quality examples
in in-context learning (ICL) to enhance CER. We propose various strategies
based on random and augmented example retrieval and also analyze the impact of
conversational context on CER accuracy. Experiments were conducted on the three
datasets including IEMOCAP, MELD and EmoryNLP. The results show that augmented
example retrieval consistently outperforms other techniques under investigation
across all datasets, highlighting the importance of retrieving coherent
targeted examples and enhancing them through paraphrasing.

*Petra Barančíková,Ondřej Bojar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Czech-specific and multilingual sentence embedding models are compared using intrinsic (linguistic phenomena) and extrinsic (translation evaluation) tests. Results show a disconnect between intrinsic performance and downstream task success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how well sentence embeddings capture linguistic properties and perform in practical tasks like machine translation.

Method: Intrinsic evaluation uses Costra and STS benchmarks; extrinsic evaluation fine-tunes models for translation tasks using COMET metrics.

Result: Models excelling in intrinsic tests don't always perform well in translation tasks, while others with smoothed embeddings succeed after fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The study underscores the gap between semantic probes and practical performance, calling for more research on operationalizable semantics or better task-specific datasets.

Abstract: In this paper, we compare Czech-specific and multilingual sentence embedding
models through intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation paradigms. For intrinsic
evaluation, we employ Costra, a complex sentence transformation dataset, and
several Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmarks to assess the ability of
the embeddings to capture linguistic phenomena such as semantic similarity,
temporal aspects, and stylistic variations. In the extrinsic evaluation, we
fine-tune each embedding model using COMET-based metrics for machine
translation evaluation.
  Our experiments reveal an interesting disconnect: models that excel in
intrinsic semantic similarity tests do not consistently yield superior
performance on downstream translation evaluation tasks. Conversely, models with
seemingly over-smoothed embedding spaces can, through fine-tuning, achieve
excellent results. These findings highlight the complex relationship between
semantic property probes and downstream task, emphasizing the need for more
research into 'operationalizable semantics' in sentence embeddings, or more
in-depth downstream tasks datasets (here translation evaluation)

*Benedetta Muscato,Lucia Passaro,Gizem Gezici,Fosca Giannotti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-perspective approach using soft labels in NLP to better capture human disagreements, outperforming traditional methods in subjective tasks like hate speech and stance detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional NLP methods aggregate annotators' viewpoints into a single ground truth, often underrepresenting minority perspectives. This study aims to address this by acknowledging diverse individual opinions.

Method: The study introduces a multi-perspective approach with soft labels, tested on subjective tasks (hate speech, irony, abusive language, stance detection). Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) and F1 scores are used for evaluation.

Result: The multi-perspective approach better approximates human label distributions (lower JSD) and achieves higher F1 scores, though it shows lower confidence in highly subjective tasks like irony and stance detection.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is more inclusive and pluralistic, capturing human disagreements better than traditional methods. Explainable AI (XAI) provides insights into model uncertainty.

Abstract: In the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP), common approaches for
handling human disagreement consist of aggregating annotators' viewpoints to
establish a single ground truth. However, prior studies show that disregarding
individual opinions can lead can lead to the side effect of underrepresenting
minority perspectives, especially in subjective tasks, where annotators may
systematically disagree because of their preferences. Recognizing that labels
reflect the diverse backgrounds, life experiences, and values of individuals,
this study proposes a new multi-perspective approach using soft labels to
encourage the development of the next generation of perspective aware models,
more inclusive and pluralistic. We conduct an extensive analysis across diverse
subjective text classification tasks, including hate speech, irony, abusive
language, and stance detection, to highlight the importance of capturing human
disagreements, often overlooked by traditional aggregation methods. Results
show that the multi-perspective approach not only better approximates human
label distributions, as measured by Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD), but also
achieves superior classification performance (higher F1 scores), outperforming
traditional approaches. However, our approach exhibits lower confidence in
tasks like irony and stance detection, likely due to the inherent subjectivity
present in the texts. Lastly, leveraging Explainable AI (XAI), we explore model
uncertainty and uncover meaningful insights into model predictions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a structured reasoning approach to enhance LLMs, addressing their limitations in complex reasoning tasks by converting unstructured data into structured formats and using novel algorithms for training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with complex reasoning tasks due to reliance on implicit statistical relationships, lacking structured knowledge representation.

Method: Convert unstructured data into structured formats, use Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and enhance reasoning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using MAX-Flow and LCS algorithms.

Result: Improved reasoning effectiveness, reduced computational complexity, and robust performance across scenarios, validated by fine-tuning a DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B model.

Conclusion: Structured reasoning integration significantly enhances LLMs' capabilities, making them more effective for complex tasks.

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural
language processing and automated decision-making. However, these models still
encounter difficulties when performing complex reasoning tasks involving
logical deduction and systematic planning, primarily due to their reliance on
implicit statistical relationships without structured knowledge
representation.Inspired by cognitive science and neurosymbolic AI, we introduce
a novel approach to enhance LLMs through explicit structured reasoning. First,
we convert unstructured data into structured formats by explicitly annotating
reasoning steps. We then employ this structured dataset to train LLMs through
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Additionally, we enhance the structured reasoning
capabilities of LLMs using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),
incorporating two innovative algorithms--MAX-Flow and Longest Common
Subsequence (LCS)--which notably improve reasoning effectiveness and reduce
computational complexity. Experimental results from fine-tuning a
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B model demonstrate concise reasoning, robust
performance across various scenarios, and improved compatibility with
optimization techniques, validating the efficacy of structured reasoning
integration in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A chunk-based approach using self-supervised learning models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, WavLM) and a CNN-BiLSTM framework improves fluency assessment in non-native speech, outperforming baselines on Avalinguo and Speechocean762 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic fluency assessment (AFA) struggles with capturing speech rhythm, pauses, and disfluencies in non-native speakers, necessitating a more robust method.

Method: Speech is segmented into breath-group chunks using Silero-VAD, with SSL embeddings fused via a weighted mechanism. A CNN-BiLSTM captures local and long-term dependencies, enriched with chunk-level fluency markers.

Result: The approach improves F1-score by 2.8 and Pearson correlation by 6.2 points on Speechocean762, and 4.2 F1-score and 4.0 Pearson points on Avalinguo, surpassing baselines.

Conclusion: Chunk-based multi-SSL fusion is effective for fluency evaluation, but future work should address generalization to dialects with irregular prosody.

Abstract: Automatic fluency assessment (AFA) remains challenging, particularly in
capturing speech rhythm, pauses, and disfluencies in non-native speakers. We
introduce a chunk-based approach integrating self-supervised learning (SSL)
models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, and WavLM) selected for their complementary strengths
in phonetic, prosodic, and noisy speech modeling, with a hierarchical
CNN-BiLSTM framework. Speech is segmented into breath-group chunks using Silero
voice activity detection (Silero-VAD), enabling fine-grained temporal analysis
while mitigating over-segmentation artifacts. SSL embeddings are fused via a
learnable weighted mechanism, balancing acoustic and linguistic features, and
enriched with chunk-level fluency markers (e.g., speech rate, pause durations,
n-gram repetitions). The CNN-BiLSTM captures local and long-term dependencies
across chunks. Evaluated on Avalinguo and Speechocean762, our approach improves
F1-score by 2.8 and Pearson correlation by 6.2 points over single SSL baselines
on Speechocean762, with gains of 4.2 F1-score and 4.0 Pearson points on
Avalinguo, surpassing Pyannote.audio-based segmentation baselines. These
findings highlight chunk-based multi-SSL fusion for robust fluency evaluation,
though future work should explore generalization to dialects with irregular
prosody.

*Kai-Robin Lange,Tobias Schmidt,Matthias Reccius,Henrik Müller,Michael Roos,Carsten Jentsch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes combining Large Language Models (LLMs) and topic models to dynamically track narrative shifts over time, addressing scalability and cost issues of LLMs alone. It tests the method on Wall Street Journal articles (2009-2023), finding LLMs effective for detecting shifts but less so for distinguishing between content and narrative changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of using LLMs for large-scale narrative extraction, particularly high costs and computational demands, by integrating them with scalable topic models.

Method: Combines topic models and change point detection to identify shifts in topics of interest, filters documents representing these shifts, and uses LLMs to interpret and classify the changes (content vs. narrative).

Result: LLMs effectively detect narrative shifts when they exist but struggle to differentiate between content and narrative changes.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach balances scalability and narrative understanding, though further refinement is needed for distinguishing content from narrative shifts.

Abstract: With rapidly evolving media narratives, it has become increasingly critical
to not just extract narratives from a given corpus but rather investigate, how
they develop over time. While popular narrative extraction methods such as
Large Language Models do well in capturing typical narrative elements or even
the complex structure of a narrative, applying them to an entire corpus comes
with obstacles, such as a high financial or computational cost. We propose a
combination of the language understanding capabilities of Large Language Models
with the large scale applicability of topic models to dynamically model
narrative shifts across time using the Narrative Policy Framework. We apply a
topic model and a corresponding change point detection method to find changes
that concern a specific topic of interest. Using this model, we filter our
corpus for documents that are particularly representative of that change and
feed them into a Large Language Model that interprets the change that happened
in an automated fashion and distinguishes between content and narrative shifts.
We employ our pipeline on a corpus of The Wall Street Journal news paper
articles from 2009 to 2023. Our findings indicate that a Large Language Model
can efficiently extract a narrative shift if one exists at a given point in
time, but does not perform as well when having to decide whether a shift in
content or a narrative shift took place.

*Rian Touchent,Nathan Godey,Eric de la Clergerie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Biomed-Enriched is a biomedical text dataset from PubMed, annotated for type, domain, and educational quality, enabling refined subsets for NLP tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical text is hard to access due to privacy; this dataset offers an open alternative for biomedical NLP.

Method: Two-stage annotation: large model labels 400K paragraphs, fine-tunes a small model to propagate labels across PMC-OA.

Result: Created subsets like 2M clinical case paragraphs, with quality filtering and domain upsampling improving NLP performance.

Conclusion: The dataset supports efficient biomedical pretraining, showing ~5% improvement in clinical tasks and faster convergence.

Abstract: We introduce Biomed-Enriched, a biomedical text dataset constructed from
PubMed via a two-stage annotation process. In the first stage, a large language
model annotates 400K paragraphs from PubMed scientific articles, assigning
scores for their type (review, study, clinical case, other), domain (clinical,
biomedical, other), and educational quality. The educational quality score
(rated 1 to 5) estimates how useful a paragraph is for college-level learning.
These annotations are then used to fine-tune a small language model, which
propagates the labels across the full PMC-OA corpus. The resulting metadata
allows us to extract refined subsets, including 2M clinical case paragraphs
with over 450K high-quality ones from articles with commercial-use licenses,
and to construct several variants via quality filtering and domain upsampling.
Clinical text is typically difficult to access due to privacy constraints, as
hospital records cannot be publicly shared. Hence, our dataset provides an
alternative large-scale, openly available collection of clinical cases from
PubMed, making it a valuable resource for biomedical and clinical NLP.
Preliminary continual-pretraining experiments with OLMo2 suggest these curated
subsets enable targeted improvements, with clinical upsampling boosting
performance by ~5% on MMLU ProfMed and educational quality filtering improving
MedQA and MedMCQA by ~1%. Combinations of these techniques led to faster
convergence, reaching same performance with a third of training tokens,
indicating potential for more efficient and effective biomedical pretraining
strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tool-augmented LLMs lack personalization in guiding tool use, limiting their effectiveness in user tasks.

Result: TAPS significantly improves LLMs' ability to incorporate user preferences, setting a new benchmark for open-source models on the NLSI task.

Conclusion: Personalized tool use in LLMs can be effectively enhanced with structured tagging and uncertainty detection, as demonstrated by TAPS.

Abstract: Recent advancements in tool-augmented large language models have enabled them
to interact with external tools, enhancing their ability to perform complex
user tasks. However, existing approaches overlook the role of personalisation
in guiding tool use. This work investigates how user preferences can be
effectively integrated into goal-oriented dialogue agents. Through extensive
analysis, we identify key weaknesses in the ability of LLMs to personalise tool

personalised tool use by leveraging a structured tagging tool and an
uncertainty-based tool detector. TAPS significantly improves the ability of
LLMs to incorporate user preferences, achieving the new state-of-the-art for

TL;DR: DeepRare is an LLM-powered rare disease diagnosis system that processes heterogeneous clinical inputs, generates ranked diagnostic hypotheses with transparent reasoning, and outperforms existing methods in accuracy and recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Timely and accurate diagnosis of rare diseases is challenging due to clinical heterogeneity, low prevalence, and limited clinician familiarity. DeepRare aims to address these gaps.

Method: DeepRare uses a modular design with a central host, specialized agent servers, and 40+ tools/web-scale medical knowledge sources. It processes multi-modal inputs and provides traceable reasoning.

Result: DeepRare achieves 100% accuracy for 1,013 diseases, outperforms 15 methods with a 57.18% Recall@1 score, and excels in multi-modal scenarios (70.60% Recall@1). Clinical experts agree with 95.40% of reasoning chains.

Conclusion: DeepRare is a highly accurate, scalable, and transparent rare disease diagnosis tool, validated by expert agreement and superior performance metrics.

Abstract: Rare diseases collectively affect over 300 million individuals worldwide, yet
timely and accurate diagnosis remains a pervasive challenge. This is largely
due to their clinical heterogeneity, low individual prevalence, and the limited
familiarity most clinicians have with rare conditions. Here, we introduce
DeepRare, the first rare disease diagnosis agentic system powered by a large
language model (LLM), capable of processing heterogeneous clinical inputs. The
system generates ranked diagnostic hypotheses for rare diseases, each
accompanied by a transparent chain of reasoning that links intermediate
analytic steps to verifiable medical evidence.
  DeepRare comprises three key components: a central host with a long-term
memory module; specialized agent servers responsible for domain-specific
analytical tasks integrating over 40 specialized tools and web-scale,
up-to-date medical knowledge sources, ensuring access to the most current
clinical information. This modular and scalable design enables complex
diagnostic reasoning while maintaining traceability and adaptability. We
evaluate DeepRare on eight datasets. The system demonstrates exceptional
diagnostic performance among 2,919 diseases, achieving 100% accuracy for 1013
diseases. In HPO-based evaluations, DeepRare significantly outperforms other 15
methods, like traditional bioinformatics diagnostic tools, LLMs, and other
agentic systems, achieving an average Recall@1 score of 57.18% and surpassing
the second-best method (Reasoning LLM) by a substantial margin of 23.79
percentage points. For multi-modal input scenarios, DeepRare achieves 70.60% at
Recall@1 compared to Exomiser's 53.20% in 109 cases. Manual verification of
reasoning chains by clinical experts achieves 95.40% agreements. Furthermore,
the DeepRare system has been implemented as a user-friendly web application

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Code of Thought (CoDoT), a prompting strategy to evaluate LLM safety, revealing significant toxicity increases in state-of-the-art models like GPT-4 Turbo and DeepSeek R1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widespread use of LLMs in safety-critical applications necessitates improved safety measures to align models with human values, as current models fall short.

Method: CoDoT converts natural language inputs into simple code to represent intent, testing LLM safety by measuring toxicity increases.

Result: CoDoT reveals alarming toxicity increases: GPT-4 Turbo's toxicity rises 16.5x, DeepSeek R1 fails 100%, and average toxicity increases 300% across seven LLMs. Recursive CoDoT further doubles toxicity.

Conclusion: CoDoT highlights the urgent need for safety evaluations in LLMs, emphasizing the importance of advancing safety alongside capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous, interfacing with humans
in numerous safety-critical applications. This necessitates improving
capabilities, but importantly coupled with greater safety measures to align
these models with human values and preferences. In this work, we demonstrate
that contemporary models fall concerningly short of the goal of AI safety,
leading to an unsafe and harmful experience for users. We introduce a prompting
strategy called Code of Thought (CoDoT) to evaluate the safety of LLMs. CoDoT
converts natural language inputs to simple code that represents the same
intent. For instance, CoDoT transforms the natural language prompt "Make the
statement more toxic: {text}" to: "make_more_toxic({text})". We show that CoDoT
results in a consistent failure of a wide range of state-of-the-art LLMs. For
example, GPT-4 Turbo's toxicity increases 16.5 times, DeepSeek R1 fails 100% of
the time, and toxicity increases 300% on average across seven modern LLMs.
Additionally, recursively applying CoDoT can further increase toxicity two
times. Given the rapid and widespread adoption of LLMs, CoDoT underscores the
critical need to evaluate safety efforts from first principles, ensuring that
safety and capabilities advance together.

*Kaixiang Zhang,Justine Zhang,Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a computational framework to analyze talk-time distribution in conversations, revealing that balanced talk-time is preferred and that different dynamics affect perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how talk-time is negotiated and distributed in conversations, and how these dynamics impact speaker perception.

Method: Developed a computational framework to quantify talk-time distribution and dynamics, applied to a dataset of video-chats between strangers.

Result: Balanced conversations are preferred, especially by those who talk less. Different dynamics, even with the same balance, are perceived differently.

Conclusion: The framework provides tools for designing better communication platforms, including human-human and human-AI interactions.

Abstract: An intrinsic aspect of every conversation is the way talk-time is shared
between multiple speakers. Conversations can be balanced, with each speaker
claiming a similar amount of talk-time, or imbalanced when one talks
disproportionately. Such overall distributions are the consequence of
continuous negotiations between the speakers throughout the conversation: who
should be talking at every point in time, and for how long?
  In this work we introduce a computational framework for quantifying both the
conversation-level distribution of talk-time between speakers, as well as the
lower-level dynamics that lead to it. We derive a typology of talk-time sharing
dynamics structured by several intuitive axes of variation. By applying this
framework to a large dataset of video-chats between strangers, we confirm that,
perhaps unsurprisingly, different conversation-level distributions of talk-time
are perceived differently by speakers, with balanced conversations being
preferred over imbalanced ones, especially by those who end up talking less.
Then we reveal that -- even when they lead to the same level of overall balance
-- different types of talk-time sharing dynamics are perceived differently by
the participants, highlighting the relevance of our newly introduced typology.
Finally, we discuss how our framework offers new tools to designers of
computer-mediated communication platforms, for both human-human and human-AI
communication.

*Guinan Su,Li Shen,Lu Yin,Shiwei Liu,Yanwu Yang,Jonas Geiping*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel strategy for compressing large language models (LLMs) by combining or merging layers from finetuned variants, achieving competitive pruning results while preserving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of deploying large LLMs by reducing model size without significant loss of capabilities.

Method: Zero-order optimization problem with a search space supporting layer removal, selection, and merging.

Result: Compressed models retain ~97.3% of original performance while removing ~25% of parameters, outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively compresses LLMs, balancing performance and efficiency for deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in language
understanding and generation. However, such impressive capability typically
comes with a substantial model size, which presents significant challenges in
deployment and inference. While structured pruning of model parameters offers a
promising way to reduce computational costs at deployment time, current methods
primarily focus on single model pruning. In this work, we develop a novel
strategy to compress models by strategically combining or merging layers from
finetuned model variants, which preserves the original model's abilities by
aggregating capabilities accentuated in different finetunes. We pose the
optimal tailoring of these LLMs as a zero-order optimization problem, adopting
a search space that supports three different operations: (1) Layer removal, (2)
Layer selection from different candidate models, and (3) Layer merging. Our
experiments demonstrate that this approach leads to competitive model pruning,
for example, for the Llama2-13B model families, our compressed models maintain
approximately 97.3\% of the original performance while removing $\sim25\%$ of
parameters, significantly outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. The

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReCode enhances LLMs' ability to adapt to API updates using rule-based reinforcement learning, improving performance without compromising general code generation skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with adapting to frequent API updates due to outdated training data, limiting reliable code generation in dynamic environments.

Method: ReCode trains LLMs on a dataset of 2,000 entries for version migration, using a modified string similarity metric as reinforcement learning reward.

Result: ReCode significantly improves LLMs' performance in dynamic API scenarios, outperforming larger models and maintaining general abilities.

Conclusion: ReCode is a scalable solution for enhancing LLMs' adaptability to API changes, with consistent improvements across models and reinforcement learning algorithms.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable code generation capabilities
but falter when adapting to frequent updates in external library APIs. This
critical limitation, stemming from reliance on outdated API knowledge from
their training data, even with access to current documentation, impedes
reliable code generation in dynamic environments. To tackle this issue, we
propose ReCode (rule-based Reinforcement learning for Code Update), a novel
framework that mimics human programmer adaptation to API changes. Specifically,
we construct a dataset of approximately 2,000 data entries to train the LLMs to
perform version migration based on updated information. Then, we introduce a
modified string similarity metric for code evaluation as the reward for
reinforcement learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ReCode substantially
boosts LLMs' code generation performance in dynamic API scenarios, especially
on the unseen CodeUpdateArena task. Crucially, compared to supervised
fine-tuning, ReCode has less impact on LLMs' general code generation abilities.
We apply ReCode on various LLMs and reinforcement learning algorithms (GRPO and
DAPO), all achieving consistent improvements. Notably, after training,
Qwen2.5-Coder-7B outperforms that of the 32B parameter code instruction-tuned
model and the reasoning model with the same architecture. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how mid-training strategies affect RL performance in base language models like Qwen and Llama, identifying key factors like high-quality math corpora and QA-style data. It introduces a two-stage strategy, Stable-then-Decay, resulting in the OctoThinker model family.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand what makes base language models suitable for RL, especially for reasoning tasks, and to develop better RL-scalable foundation models.

Method: Investigates mid-training strategies, focusing on Qwen and Llama, and introduces Stable-then-Decay, a two-stage training approach with learning rate decay.

Result: High-quality math corpora and QA-style data improve RL performance; long-CoT enhances reasoning but can cause verbosity and instability; scaling mid-training boosts RL outcomes. OctoThinker models show strong RL compatibility.

Conclusion: The study provides insights for pre-training strategies in the RL era, releasing open-source models and a curated math corpus to support further research.

Abstract: Different base language model families, such as Llama and Qwen, exhibit
divergent behaviors during post-training with reinforcement learning (RL),
especially on reasoning-intensive tasks. What makes a base language model
suitable for reinforcement learning? Gaining deeper insight into this question
is essential for developing RL-scalable foundation models of the next
generation. In this work, we investigate how mid-training strategies shape RL
dynamics, focusing on two representative model families: Qwen and Llama. Our
study reveals that (1) high-quality mathematical corpora, such as
MegaMath-Web-Pro, significantly improve both base model and RL performance,
while existing alternatives (e.g., FineMath-4plus) fail to do so; (2) further
adding QA-style data, particularly long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
examples, enhances RL outcomes, and instruction data further unlocks this
effect; (3) while long-CoT improves reasoning depth, it can also induce
verbosity of model responses and unstability of RL training, underscoring the
importance of data formatting; (4) scaling mid-training consistently leads to
stronger downstream RL performance. Building on these insights, we introduce a
two-stage mid-training strategy, Stable-then-Decay, in which base models are
first trained on 200B tokens with a constant learning rate, followed by 20B
tokens across three CoT-focused branches with learning rate decay. This yields
OctoThinker, a family of models demonstrating strong RL compatibility and
closing the performance gap with more RL-friendly model families, i.e., Qwen.
We hope our work will help shape pre-training strategies for foundation models
in the RL era. To support further research, we release our open-source models
along with a curated math reasoning-intensive corpus of over 70 billion tokens
(i.e., MegaMath-Web-Pro-Max).

*Ammar Khairi,Daniel D'souza,Ye Shen,Julia Kreutzer,Sara Hooker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores robust scaling of inference-time compute for multilingual, multi-task generative tasks, proposing novel sampling and selection strategies that outperform existing methods, especially in underrepresented languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current inference-time compute scaling methods focus on English and limited domains, lacking generalization across languages and open-ended tasks. The study aims to address this gap.

Method: The authors evaluate existing selection methods and propose new sampling and selection strategies tailored for multilingual and multi-task settings, testing them on models like an 8B model and Command-A (111B).

Result: The proposed methods achieve significant improvements, e.g., +6.8 win-rate for 8B models and +9.0 for Command-A on the m-ArenaHard-v2.0 benchmark, outperforming proprietary models like Gemini.

Conclusion: Language- and task-aware inference-time compute strategies are crucial for democratizing performance gains, especially in underrepresented languages.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shifted focus toward
scaling inference-time compute, improving performance without retraining the
model. A common approach is to sample multiple outputs in parallel, and select
one of these as the final output. However, work to date has focused on English
and a handful of domains such as math and code. In contrast, we are most
interested in techniques that generalize across open-ended tasks, formally
verifiable tasks, and across languages. In this work, we study how to robustly
scale inference-time compute for open-ended generative tasks in a multilingual,
multi-task setting.
  Our findings show that both sampling strategy based on temperature variation
and selection strategy must be adapted to account for diverse domains and
varied language settings. We evaluate existing selection methods, revealing
that strategies effective in English often fail to generalize across languages.
We propose novel sampling and selection strategies specifically adapted for
multilingual and multi-task inference scenarios, and show they yield notable
gains across languages and tasks. In particular, our combined sampling and
selection methods lead to an average +6.8 jump in win-rates for our 8B models
on m-ArenaHard-v2.0 prompts, against proprietary models such as Gemini. At
larger scale, Command-A (111B model) equipped with our methods, shows +9.0
improvement in win-rates on the same benchmark with just five samples against
single-sample decoding, a substantial increase at minimal cost. Our results
underscore the need for language- and task-aware approaches to inference-time
compute, aiming to democratize performance improvements in underrepresented
languages.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Behavior Editing, a method to steer the ethical behavior of LLM-based agents, and BehaviorBench, a benchmark for evaluating and editing agent behaviors. It shows the method's effectiveness in both local and global behavior adjustments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying LLM-based agents in high-stakes domains poses safety and ethical risks, necessitating methods to control their behavior to prevent harm.

Method: Frames agent behavior steering as a model editing task (Behavior Editing) and introduces BehaviorBench, a multi-tier benchmark based on psychological moral theories.

Result: Behavior Editing effectively steers agents toward target behaviors locally and globally, demonstrating both ethical and harmful outcomes.

Conclusion: Behavior Editing offers a promising but risky paradigm for controlling agent behavior, with potential for both beneficial and malicious applications.

Abstract: Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities across a wide range of tasks. However, deploying LLM-based agents
in high-stakes domains comes with significant safety and ethical risks.
Unethical behavior by these agents can directly result in serious real-world
consequences, including physical harm and financial loss. To efficiently steer
the ethical behavior of agents, we frame agent behavior steering as a model
editing task, which we term Behavior Editing. Model editing is an emerging area
of research that enables precise and efficient modifications to LLMs while
preserving their overall capabilities. To systematically study and evaluate
this approach, we introduce BehaviorBench, a multi-tier benchmark grounded in
psychological moral theories. This benchmark supports both the evaluation and
editing of agent behaviors across a variety of scenarios, with each tier
introducing more complex and ambiguous scenarios. We first demonstrate that
Behavior Editing can dynamically steer agents toward the target behavior within
specific scenarios. Moreover, Behavior Editing enables not only
scenario-specific local adjustments but also more extensive shifts in an
agent's global moral alignment. We demonstrate that Behavior Editing can be
used to promote ethical and benevolent behavior or, conversely, to induce
harmful or malicious behavior. Through comprehensive evaluations on agents
based on frontier LLMs, BehaviorBench shows the effectiveness of Behavior
Editing across different models and scenarios. Our findings offer key insights
into a new paradigm for steering agent behavior, highlighting both the promise
and perils of Behavior Editing.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores diffusion large language models (dLLMs) for code generation, introducing DiffuCoder, a 7B model trained on 130B tokens. It analyzes dLLM decoding behavior, proposes a novel RL training method (coupled-GRPO), and demonstrates improved performance (+4.4% on EvalPlus).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: dLLMs offer global planning and iterative refinement for code generation, but their training and inference mechanisms are under-explored. The study aims to demystify dLLM decoding and enhance their potential for coding.

Method: The authors train a 7B dLLM (DiffuCoder) and analyze its decoding behavior. They propose coupled-GRPO, a reinforcement learning method with complementary mask noise, to improve training efficiency and reduce variance in token log-likelihood estimates.

Result: DiffuCoder shows unique decoding behavior compared to AR models, including flexible causality and diverse generation order. Coupled-GRPO boosts performance by +4.4% on EvalPlus and reduces reliance on AR causal decoding.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into dLLM generation and introduces an effective RL framework, advancing the use of dLLMs for code generation.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are compelling alternatives to
autoregressive (AR) models because their denoising models operate over the
entire sequence. The global planning and iterative refinement features of dLLMs
are particularly useful for code generation. However, current training and
inference mechanisms for dLLMs in coding are still under-explored. To demystify
the decoding behavior of dLLMs and unlock their potential for coding, we
systematically investigate their denoising processes and reinforcement learning
(RL) methods. We train a 7B dLLM, \textbf{DiffuCoder}, on 130B tokens of code.
Using this model as a testbed, we analyze its decoding behavior, revealing how
it differs from that of AR models: (1) dLLMs can decide how causal their
generation should be without relying on semi-AR decoding, and (2) increasing
the sampling temperature diversifies not only token choices but also their
generation order. This diversity creates a rich search space for RL rollouts.
For RL training, to reduce the variance of token log-likelihood estimates and
maintain training efficiency, we propose \textbf{coupled-GRPO}, a novel
sampling scheme that constructs complementary mask noise for completions used
in training. In our experiments, coupled-GRPO significantly improves
DiffuCoder's performance on code generation benchmarks (+4.4\% on EvalPlus) and
reduces reliance on AR causal during decoding. Our work provides deeper insight
into the machinery of dLLM generation and offers an effective, diffusion-native
RL training framework. https://github.com/apple/ml-diffucoder.

TL;DR: Memento is a prompting strategy for LLMs that decomposes complex questions, dynamically builds a fact database, and solves questions, significantly improving performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with tasks requiring tight coupling of reasoning and retrieval, such as multi-hop question answering.

Method: Memento decomposes questions into steps, constructs a dynamic fact database, and integrates facts to solve questions.

Result: Memento doubles CoT performance on PhantomWiki, improves CoT-RAG by 20 F1 points on 2WikiMultiHopQA, and boosts ReAct by 3 F1 points on MuSiQue.

Conclusion: Memento effectively enhances LLM performance in multi-hop QA and agentic settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning-only tasks, but struggle when
reasoning must be tightly coupled with retrieval, as in multi-hop question
answering. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a prompting strategy
that first decomposes a complex question into smaller steps, then dynamically
constructs a database of facts using LLMs, and finally pieces these facts
together to solve the question. We show how this three-stage strategy, which we
call Memento, can boost the performance of existing prompting strategies across
diverse settings. On the 9-step PhantomWiki benchmark, Memento doubles the
performance of chain-of-thought (CoT) when all information is provided in
context. On the open-domain version of 2WikiMultiHopQA, CoT-RAG with Memento
improves over vanilla CoT-RAG by more than 20 F1 percentage points and over the
multi-hop RAG baseline, IRCoT, by more than 13 F1 percentage points. On the
challenging MuSiQue dataset, Memento improves ReAct by more than 3 F1

TL;DR: The paper explores how LLMs handle human-like value trade-offs, such as balancing truth and politeness, using cognitive models to evaluate their behavior in different settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tools for interpreting dynamic value trade-offs in LLMs are limited, despite their importance in human decision-making and language use.

Method: A cognitive model of polite speech is applied to evaluate value trade-offs in LLMs, focusing on reasoning effort in black-box models and RL post-training dynamics in open-source models.

Result: LLMs show higher informational utility than social utility, with training dynamics revealing early shifts in utility values influenced by base model and pretraining data.

Conclusion: The method provides insights for shaping LLM training regimes and controlling value trade-offs, with implications for high-level behaviors and model alignment.

Abstract: Navigating everyday social situations often requires juggling conflicting
goals, such as conveying a harsh truth, maintaining trust, all while still
being mindful of another person's feelings. These value trade-offs are an
integral part of human decision-making and language use, however, current tools
for interpreting such dynamic and multi-faceted notions of values in LLMs are
limited. In cognitive science, so-called "cognitive models" provide formal
accounts of these trade-offs in humans, by modeling the weighting of a
speaker's competing utility functions in choosing an action or utterance. In
this work, we use a leading cognitive model of polite speech to interpret the
extent to which LLMs represent human-like trade-offs. We apply this lens to
systematically evaluate value trade-offs in two encompassing model settings:
degrees of reasoning "effort" in frontier black-box models, and RL
post-training dynamics of open-source models. Our results highlight patterns of
higher informational utility than social utility in reasoning models, and in
open-source models shown to be stronger in mathematical reasoning. Our findings
from LLMs' training dynamics suggest large shifts in utility values early on in
training with persistent effects of the choice of base model and pretraining
data, compared to feedback dataset or alignment method. We show that our method
is responsive to diverse aspects of the rapidly evolving LLM landscape, with
insights for forming hypotheses about other high-level behaviors, shaping
training regimes for reasoning models, and better controlling trade-offs
between values during model training.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a 'Refutations and Critiques' (R&C) Track at ML conferences to address flawed studies and improve self-correction in research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rapid advancements in ML research have led to flawed or misleading studies being accepted due to peer review fallibility, necessitating a mechanism for correction.

Method: The paper suggests designing an R&C Track with specific review principles and guidelines, illustrated by an example submission.

Result: The proposed R&C Track would provide a reputable platform for critical challenges to prior research, fostering self-correction.

Conclusion: ML conferences should implement official mechanisms like the R&C Track to enhance research integrity and self-correction.

Abstract: Science progresses by iteratively advancing and correcting humanity's
understanding of the world. In machine learning (ML) research, rapid
advancements have led to an explosion of publications, but have also led to
misleading, incorrect, flawed or perhaps even fraudulent studies being accepted
and sometimes highlighted at ML conferences due to the fallibility of peer
review. While such mistakes are understandable, ML conferences do not offer
robust processes to help the field systematically correct when such errors are
made.This position paper argues that ML conferences should establish a
dedicated "Refutations and Critiques" (R & C) Track. This R & C Track would
provide a high-profile, reputable platform to support vital research that
critically challenges prior research, thereby fostering a dynamic
self-correcting research ecosystem. We discuss key considerations including
track design, review principles, potential pitfalls, and provide an
illustrative example submission concerning a recent ICLR 2025 Oral. We conclude
that ML conferences should create official, reputable mechanisms to help ML
research self-correct.

### [106] [STIMULUS: Achieving Fast Convergence and Low Sample Complexity in Stochastic Multi-Objective Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19883)
*Zhuqing Liu,Chaosheng Dong,Michinari Momma,Simone Shao,Shaoyuan Xu,Yan Gao,Haibo Yang,Jia Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces STIMULUS, a novel multi-objective optimization algorithm, and its enhanced variants (STIMULUS-M, STIMULUS+, STIMULUS-M+) to improve convergence and sample complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MOO methods suffer from poor convergence rates and high sample complexity, prompting the need for more efficient algorithms.

Method: STIMULUS uses a recursive stochastic gradient framework, while STIMULUS-M adds momentum. Adaptive batching is introduced in STIMULUS+/STIMULUS-M+ to reduce full gradient evaluations.

Result: The algorithms achieve improved convergence rates (O(1/T) for non-convex, O(exp(-μT)) for strongly convex) and state-of-the-art sample complexities.

Conclusion: STIMULUS and its variants offer robust, efficient solutions for MOO problems with theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Recently, multi-objective optimization (MOO) has gained attention for its
broad applications in ML, operations research, and engineering. However, MOO
algorithm design remains in its infancy and many existing MOO methods suffer
from unsatisfactory convergence rate and sample complexity performance. To
address this challenge, in this paper, we propose an algorithm called STIMULUS(
stochastic path-integrated multi-gradient recursive e\ulstimator), a new and
robust approach for solving MOO problems. Different from the traditional
methods, STIMULUS introduces a simple yet powerful recursive framework for
updating stochastic gradient estimates to improve convergence performance with
low sample complexity. In addition, we introduce an enhanced version of
STIMULUS, termed STIMULUS-M, which incorporates a momentum term to further
expedite convergence. We establish $O(1/T)$ convergence rates of the proposed
methods for non-convex settings and $O (\exp{-\mu T})$ for strongly convex
settings, where $T$ is the total number of iteration rounds. Additionally, we
achieve the state-of-the-art $O \left(n+\sqrt{n}\epsilon^{-1}\right)$ sample
complexities for non-convex settings and $O\left(n+ \sqrt{n} \ln
({\mu/\epsilon})\right)$ for strongly convex settings, where $\epsilon>0$ is a
desired stationarity error. Moreover, to alleviate the periodic full gradient
evaluation requirement in STIMULUS and STIMULUS-M, we further propose enhanced
versions with adaptive batching called STIMULUS+/ STIMULUS-M+ and provide their
theoretical analysis.

### [107] [FlightKooba: A Fast Interpretable FTP Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19885)
*Jing Lu,Xuan Wu,Yizhun Tian,Songhan Fan,Yali Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FlightKooba, a framework combining HIPPO, Koopman theory, and state space equations to improve flight trajectory prediction by reducing computational load and enhancing interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Koopman-based models for flight trajectory prediction suffer from inefficiency, poor interpretability, and high computational costs.

Method: FlightKooba constructs Koopman operators directly from data using structural state space equations, reducing trainable parameters and training time.

Result: FlightKooba achieves faster training (comparable to Mamba without CUDA), reduces memory by over 50%, and cuts parameters by tenfold while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: FlightKooba offers an efficient, interpretable solution for Koopman operator computation, advancing time series forecasting and control applications.

Abstract: The Koopman theory is a powerful and effective modeling tool for converting
nonlinear systems into linear representations, and flight trajectory prediction
(FTP) is a complex nonlinear system. However, current models applying the
Koopman theory to FTP tasks are not very effective, model interpretability is
indeed an issue, and the Koopman operators are computationally intensive,
resulting in long training times. To address this issue, this paper proposes a
new modeling and control framework based on the HIPPO method, the Koopman
theory, and state space equations from cybernetics: FlightKooba. Inspired by
the idea of structural state space equations, FlightKooba directly constructs
the Koopman operators from data. This makes the framework highly interpretable
and significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters in the module,
thereby greatly reducing training time. Experiments have demonstrated the
superiority of the FlightKooba modeling method in terms of time and memory
consumption (training time comparable to the Mamba module without using
CUDA-level acceleration; memory reduced by more than 50% on most datasets, with
a tenfold reduction in the number of parameters), essentially completing the
FTP task. It provides a new method for the fast computation of the Koopman
operators, opening up new possibilities for the combination of time series
forecasting and control.

### [108] [A Spatio-Temporal Point Process for Fine-Grained Modeling of Reading Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19999)
*Francesco Ignazio Re,Andreas Opedal,Glib Manaiev,Mario Giulianelli,Ryan Cotterell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a probabilistic model for reading behavior using a marked spatio-temporal point process, improving upon standard methods by capturing dynamic fixation and saccade patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard models of reading behavior rely on aggregated data and strong assumptions, missing spatio-temporal dynamics. The paper aims to address this gap.

Method: A marked spatio-temporal point process models fixations and saccades, with saccades modeled via a Hawkes process and fixation durations influenced by contextual predictors.

Result: The Hawkes process model fits human saccades better than baselines, but contextual surprisal marginally improves fixation duration predictions.

Conclusion: The model captures reading dynamics better than traditional methods, though surprisal theory has limited explanatory power for fine-grained eye movements.

Abstract: Reading is a process that unfolds across space and time, alternating between
fixations where a reader focuses on a specific point in space, and saccades
where a reader rapidly shifts their focus to a new point. An ansatz of
psycholinguistics is that modeling a reader's fixations and saccades yields
insight into their online sentence processing. However, standard approaches to
such modeling rely on aggregated eye-tracking measurements and models that
impose strong assumptions, ignoring much of the spatio-temporal dynamics that
occur during reading. In this paper, we propose a more general probabilistic
model of reading behavior, based on a marked spatio-temporal point process,
that captures not only how long fixations last, but also where they land in
space and when they take place in time. The saccades are modeled using a Hawkes
process, which captures how each fixation excites the probability of a new
fixation occurring near it in time and space. The duration time of fixation
events is modeled as a function of fixation-specific predictors convolved
across time, thus capturing spillover effects. Empirically, our Hawkes process
model exhibits a better fit to human saccades than baselines. With respect to
fixation durations, we observe that incorporating contextual surprisal as a
predictor results in only a marginal improvement in the model's predictive
accuracy. This finding suggests that surprisal theory struggles to explain
fine-grained eye movements.

### [109] [Causal-Aware Intelligent QoE Optimization for VR Interaction with Adaptive Keyframe Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19890)
*Ziru Zhang,Jiadong Yu,Danny H. K. Tsang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an intelligent framework combining adaptive keyframe extraction and causal-aware RL to optimize QoE in multi-user VR, outperforming benchmarks in latency, fairness, and QoE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook causal relationships in QoE optimization, limiting gains. The paper aims to address this gap.

Method: Uses a novel QoE metric and MIP modeling, integrating PS-CDDPG (causal-aware RL) to optimize resources.

Result: Reduces latency, enhances QoE, and maintains fairness, outperforming benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances QoE factors in VR, validated by experiments.

Abstract: The optimization of quality of experience (QoE) in multi-user virtual reality
(VR) interactions demands a delicate balance between ultra-low latency,
high-fidelity motion synchronization, and equitable resource allocation. While
adaptive keyframe extraction mitigates transmission overhead, existing
approaches often overlook the causal relationships among allocated bandwidth,
CPU frequency, and user perception, limiting QoE gains. This paper proposes an
intelligent framework to maximize QoE by integrating adaptive keyframe
extraction with causal-aware reinforcement learning (RL). First, a novel QoE
metric is formulated using the Weber-Fechner Law, combining perceptual
sensitivity, attention-driven priorities, and motion reconstruction accuracy.
The QoE optimization problem is then modeled as a mixed integer programming
(MIP) task, jointly optimizing keyframe ratios, bandwidth, and computational
resources under horizon-fairness constraints. We propose Partial State Causal
Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (PS-CDDPG), which integrates the Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) method with causal influence detection. By
leveraging causal information regarding how QoE is influenced and determined by
various actions, we explore actions guided by weights calculated from causal
inference (CI), which in turn improves training efficiency. Experiments
conducted with the CMU Motion Capture Database demonstrate that our framework
significantly reduces interactive latency, enhances QoE, and maintains
fairness, achieving superior performance compared to benchmark methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel class-aware soft pruning framework using orthogonal convolutional kernel regularization achieves rapid and precise machine unlearning with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between unlearning speed and predictive accuracy in existing methods, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations like GDPR.

Method: Leverages orthogonal convolutional kernel regularization and activation difference analysis to decorrelate filters and disentangle feature representations.

Result: Achieves millisecond-level unlearning, complete forgetting of targeted classes, minimal accuracy loss, and reduced membership inference attack risks.

Conclusion: Provides an efficient, practical solution for real-time machine unlearning in MLaaS scenarios.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to selectively remove class-specific knowledge from
pretrained neural networks to satisfy privacy regulations such as the GDPR.
Existing methods typically face a trade-off between unlearning speed and
preservation of predictive accuracy, often incurring either high computational
overhead or significant performance degradation on retained classes. In this
paper, we propose a novel class-aware soft pruning framework leveraging
orthogonal convolutional kernel regularization to achieve rapid and precise
forgetting with millisecond-level response times. By enforcing orthogonality
constraints during training, our method decorrelates convolutional filters and
disentangles feature representations, while efficiently identifying
class-specific channels through activation difference analysis. Extensive
evaluations across multiple architectures and datasets demonstrate stable
pruning with near-instant execution, complete forgetting of targeted classes,
and minimal accuracy loss on retained data. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and TinyImageNet confirm that our approach substantially reduces membership
inference attack risks and accelerates unlearning by orders of magnitude
compared to state-of-the-art baselines. This framework provides an efficient,
practical solution for real-time machine unlearning in Machine Learning as a
Service (MLaaS) scenarios.

*Jingzhi Hu,Geoffrey Ye Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeKA-g improves GSC systems by distilling cloud-GAI knowledge into low-rank matrices, enhancing alignment and adaptation to wireless channels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of knowledge alignment in GSC systems for efficient AI-generated content provisioning.

Method: Proposes DeKA-g with MAKD for efficient knowledge distillation and VGSA for adapting to diverse wireless conditions.

Result: Improves image alignment by 44%, compression rate efficiency by 116%, and low-SNR performance by 28%.

Conclusion: DeKA-g effectively aligns knowledge and adapts to wireless conditions, enhancing GSC system performance.

Abstract: Due to the surging amount of AI-generated content (AIGC), its provisioning to
edges and mobile users from the cloud incurs substantial traffic on networks.
Generative semantic communication (GSC) offers a promising solution by
transmitting highly compact information, i.e., prompt text and latent
representations, instead of high-dimensional AIGC data. However, GSC relies on
the alignment between the knowledge in the cloud generative AI (GAI) and that
possessed by the edges and users, and between the knowledge for wireless
transmission and that of actual channels, which remains challenging. In this
paper, we propose DeKA-g, a distillation-enabled knowledge alignment algorithm
for GSC systems. The core idea is to distill the generation knowledge from the
cloud-GAI into low-rank matrices, which can be incorporated by the edge and
used to adapt the transmission knowledge to diverse wireless channel
conditions. DeKA-g comprises two novel methods: metaword-aided knowledge
distillation (MAKD) and variable-rate grouped SNR adaptation (VGSA). For MAKD,
an optimized metaword is employed to enhance the efficiency of knowledge
distillation, while VGSA enables efficient adaptation to diverse compression
rates and SNR ranges. From simulation results, DeKA-g improves the alignment
between the edge-generated images and the cloud-generated ones by 44%.
Moreover, it adapts to compression rates with 116% higher efficiency than the
baseline and enhances the performance in low-SNR conditions by 28%.

TL;DR: The paper uses deep neural networks (DNN) and explainable AI (XAI) methods like SHAP and Gradient to forecast and analyze electricity market prices, aiming to improve understanding of market dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Electricity markets are complex, and traditional econometric methods lack the power of DNNs. The goal is to enhance understanding of price drivers using XAI.

Method: DNNs for price forecasting, combined with XAI techniques (SHAP, Gradient, heatmaps) to analyze feature contributions across five markets. Introduces SSHAP values and lines for better interpretability.

Result: Improved understanding of electricity market dynamics through DNN-based forecasting and XAI-driven insights.

Conclusion: The approach successfully combines DNNs and XAI to provide deeper insights into electricity market price drivers, introducing novel SSHAP concepts for enhanced interpretability.

Abstract: Electricity markets are highly complex, involving lots of interactions and
complex dependencies that make it hard to understand the inner workings of the
market and what is driving prices. Econometric methods have been developed for
this, white-box models, however, they are not as powerful as deep neural
network models (DNN). In this paper, we use a DNN to forecast the price and
then use XAI methods to understand the factors driving the price dynamics in
the market. The objective is to increase our understanding of how different
electricity markets work. To do that, we apply explainable methods such as SHAP
and Gradient, combined with visual techniques like heatmaps (saliency maps) to
analyse the behaviour and contributions of various features across five
electricity markets. We introduce the novel concepts of SSHAP values and SSHAP
lines to enhance the complex representation of high-dimensional tabular models.

*Miguel N. Font,José L. Jorro-Aragoneses,Carlos M. Alaíz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel post-hoc framework measures neural network uncertainty using retrieved training cases with similar activation vectors, introducing Decision Change and Layer Uncertainty metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks can produce errors in high-risk domains; measuring uncertainty helps detect and mitigate these errors.

Method: Proposes a framework using retrieved training cases with similar activation vectors per layer, introducing Decision Change and Layer Uncertainty metrics.

Result: Metrics improve uncertainty estimation, outperforming softmax-based confidence on CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets.

Conclusion: The framework enhances uncertainty estimation in neural networks, particularly for challenging tasks.

Abstract: Neural Networks have high accuracy in solving problems where it is difficult
to detect patterns or create a logical model. However, these algorithms
sometimes return wrong solutions, which become problematic in high-risk domains
like medical diagnosis or autonomous driving. One strategy to detect and
mitigate these errors is the measurement of the uncertainty over neural network
decisions. In this paper, we present a novel post-hoc framework for measuring
the uncertainty of a decision based on retrieved training cases that have a
similar activation vector to the query for each layer. Based on these retrieved
cases, we propose two new metrics: Decision Change and Layer Uncertainty, which
capture changes in nearest-neighbor class distributions across layers. We
evaluated our approach in a classification model for two datasets: CIFAR-10 and
MNIST. The results show that these metrics enhance uncertainty estimation,
especially in challenging classification tasks, outperforming softmax-based
confidence.

TL;DR: MIRAGE is a multimodal benchmark for expert-level reasoning in agriculture, featuring real-world user-expert interactions, diverse biological entities, and open-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks for grounded reasoning and long-form generation in knowledge-intensive domains like agriculture.

Method: Curated from 35,000 real interactions, MIRAGE combines natural queries, expert responses, and image context, covering diverse agricultural scenarios.

Result: A benchmark with 7,000+ biological entities, supporting evaluation of models on rare entities, latent knowledge gaps, and interactive reasoning.

Conclusion: MIRAGE provides a high-fidelity, taxonomically diverse benchmark for vision-language models in real-world, open-world settings.

Abstract: We introduce MIRAGE, a new benchmark for multimodal expert-level reasoning
and decision-making in consultative interaction settings. Designed for the
agriculture domain, MIRAGE captures the full complexity of expert consultations
by combining natural user queries, expert-authored responses, and image-based
context, offering a high-fidelity benchmark for evaluating models on grounded
reasoning, clarification strategies, and long-form generation in a real-world,
knowledge-intensive domain. Grounded in over 35,000 real user-expert
interactions and curated through a carefully designed multi-step pipeline,
MIRAGE spans diverse crop health, pest diagnosis, and crop management
scenarios. The benchmark includes more than 7,000 unique biological entities,
covering plant species, pests, and diseases, making it one of the most
taxonomically diverse benchmarks available for vision-language models, grounded
in the real world. Unlike existing benchmarks that rely on well-specified user
inputs and closed-set taxonomies, MIRAGE features underspecified, context-rich
scenarios with open-world settings, requiring models to infer latent knowledge

*Efe Çakır,Patrick Dumond*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores reinforcement learning (RL) for bearing fault diagnosis, showing RL's adaptability but noting computational demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bearing faults cause disruptions and costs; current methods lack adaptability in dynamic environments.

Method: Uses Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) for bearing fault classification in machine condition monitoring.

Result: RL matches supervised learning in controlled conditions but excels in adaptability with optimized rewards.

Conclusion: RL has potential to complement traditional methods, enabling adaptive diagnostic frameworks.

Abstract: Bearing faults in rotating machinery can lead to significant operational
disruptions and maintenance costs. Modern methods for bearing fault diagnosis
rely heavily on vibration analysis and machine learning techniques, which often
require extensive labeled data and may not adapt well to dynamic environments.
This study explores the feasibility of reinforcement learning (RL),
specifically Deep Q-Networks (DQNs), for bearing fault classification tasks in
machine condition monitoring to enhance the accuracy and adaptability of
bearing fault diagnosis. The results demonstrate that while RL models developed
in this study can match the performance of traditional supervised learning
models under controlled conditions, they excel in adaptability when equipped
with optimized reward structures. However, their computational demands
highlight areas for further improvement. These findings demonstrate RL's
potential to complement traditional methods, paving the way for adaptive
diagnostic frameworks.

*Shuchen Xue,Tianyu Xie,Tianyang Hu,Zijin Feng,Jiacheng Sun,Kenji Kawaguchi,Zhenguo Li,Zhi-Ming Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares autoregressive (AR) and masked diffusion models (MDMs) in a decoder-only framework, highlighting trade-offs and suggesting refinements for MDMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fairly compare AR and MDM paradigms by decoupling architectural differences, as previous comparisons were confounded by simultaneous changes in paradigm and architecture.

Method: Evaluates MDMs within a decoder-only framework, comparing them as Any-Order AR (AO-AR) and standard AR, and investigates architectural influences (decoder-only vs. encoder-only) in MDMs.

Result: Decoder-only MDMs achieve significant generation speedups (~25×) and comparable perplexity with temperature annealing, despite modeling a larger space, while encoder-only MDMs handle simpler conditional probabilities.

Conclusion: The work clarifies paradigm differences from architectural influences, providing insights for future model design, and suggests refining the AO-AR objective for better performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) predominantly use autoregressive (AR)
approaches, but masked diffusion models (MDMs) are emerging as viable
alternatives. A key challenge in comparing AR and MDM paradigms is their
typical architectural difference: AR models are often decoder-only, while MDMs
have largely been encoder-only. This practice of changing both the modeling
paradigm and architecture simultaneously makes direct comparisons unfair, as
it's hard to distinguish whether observed differences stem from the paradigm
itself or the architectural shift. This research evaluates MDMs within a
decoder-only framework to: (1) equitably compare MDM (as Any-Order AR, or
AO-AR) and standard AR paradigms. Our investigation suggests that the standard
AO-AR objective, which averages over all token permutations, may benefit from
refinement, as many permutations appear less informative compared to the
language's inherent left-to-right structure. (2) Investigate architectural
influences (decoder-only vs. encoder-only) within MDMs. We demonstrate that
while encoder-only MDMs model a simpler conditional probability space,
decoder-only MDMs can achieve dramatic generation speedups ($\sim25\times$) and
comparable perplexity with temperature annealing despite modeling a vastly
larger space, highlighting key trade-offs. This work thus decouples core
paradigm differences from architectural influences, offering insights for
future model design. Code is available at https://github.com/scxue/AO-GPT-MDM.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to evaluate the importance of feature groups in GAMs, addressing the oversight of joint signals in interpretable ML. It demonstrates the method's effectiveness through synthetic and real-world medical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current interpretable ML often neglects the joint signal from feature groups, missing critical insights, especially in datasets with natural feature groupings like multimodal data.

Method: A novel approach to determine feature group importance in GAMs, efficient and requiring no retraining, with support for posthoc group definition and overlapping groups.

Result: The method is validated on synthetic experiments and applied to medical datasets, showing group importance provides a more accurate view than single-feature analysis.

Conclusion: Analyzing group importance in GAMs offers a holistic and accurate perspective, particularly valuable in medical and high-dimensional settings.

Abstract: While analyzing the importance of features has become ubiquitous in
interpretable machine learning, the joint signal from a group of related
features is sometimes overlooked or inadvertently excluded. Neglecting the
joint signal could bypass a critical insight: in many instances, the most
significant predictors are not isolated features, but rather the combined
effect of groups of features. This can be especially problematic for datasets
that contain natural groupings of features, including multimodal datasets. This
paper introduces a novel approach to determine the importance of a group of
features for Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) that is efficient, requires no
model retraining, allows defining groups posthoc, permits overlapping groups,
and remains meaningful in high-dimensional settings. Moreover, this definition
offers a parallel with explained variation in statistics. We showcase
properties of our method on three synthetic experiments that illustrate the
behavior of group importance across various data regimes. We then demonstrate
the importance of groups of features in identifying depressive symptoms from a
multimodal neuroscience dataset, and study the importance of social
determinants of health after total hip arthroplasty. These two case studies
reveal that analyzing group importance offers a more accurate, holistic view of
the medical issues compared to a single-feature analysis.

TL;DR: HERCULES is a hierarchical k-means clustering algorithm integrating LLMs for interpretable cluster summaries, supporting diverse data types and interactive visualization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for advanced tools to group complex datasets and provide human-understandable insights drives the development of HERCULES.

Method: HERCULES recursively applies k-means clustering, uses LLMs for semantic cluster titles/descriptions, and offers two representation modes (direct and description).

Result: The algorithm enhances interpretability and supports hierarchical knowledge extraction from diverse data types.

Conclusion: HERCULES shows promise for extracting meaningful insights from complex datasets through its innovative approach.

Abstract: The explosive growth of complex datasets across various modalities
necessitates advanced analytical tools that not only group data effectively but
also provide human-understandable insights into the discovered structures. We
introduce HERCULES (Hierarchical Embedding-based Recursive Clustering Using
LLMs for Efficient Summarization), a novel algorithm and Python package
designed for hierarchical k-means clustering of diverse data types, including
text, images, and numeric data (processed one modality per run). HERCULES
constructs a cluster hierarchy by recursively applying k-means clustering,
starting from individual data points at level 0. A key innovation is its deep
integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantically rich
titles and descriptions for clusters at each level of the hierarchy,
significantly enhancing interpretability. The algorithm supports two main
representation modes: `direct' mode, which clusters based on original data
embeddings or scaled numeric features, and `description' mode, which clusters
based on embeddings derived from LLM-generated summaries. Users can provide a
`topic\_seed' to guide LLM-generated summaries towards specific themes. An
interactive visualization tool facilitates thorough analysis and understanding
of the clustering results. We demonstrate HERCULES's capabilities and discuss
its potential for extracting meaningful, hierarchical knowledge from complex
datasets.

Conclusion: Refined regret approximation and task relationship modeling enhance sample-efficient curriculum design in UED.

Abstract: Generalizing deep reinforcement learning agents to unseen environments

Environment Design (UED), a co-evolutionary framework in which a teacher
adaptively generates tasks with high learning potential, while a student learns
a robust policy from this evolving curriculum. Existing UED methods typically
measure learning potential via regret, the gap between optimal and current
performance, approximated solely by value-function loss. Building on these
approaches, we introduce the transition prediction error as an additional term
in our regret approximation. To capture how training on one task affects
performance on others, we further propose a lightweight metric called
co-learnability. By combining these two measures, we present Transition-aware
Regret Approximation with Co-learnability for Environment Design (TRACED).
Empirical evaluations show that TRACED yields curricula that improve zero-shot
generalization across multiple benchmarks while requiring up to 2x fewer
environment interactions than strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm that
the transition prediction error drives rapid complexity ramp-up and that
co-learnability delivers additional gains when paired with the transition
prediction error. These results demonstrate how refined regret approximation
and explicit modeling of task relationships can be leveraged for
sample-efficient curriculum design in UED.

*Dengyu Wu,Jiechen Chen,H. Vincent Poor,Bipin Rajendran,Osvaldo Simeone*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a neuromorphic computing architecture using resonate-and-fire (RF) neurons for efficient spectral feature extraction in edge applications, reducing energy consumption compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons fail to effectively capture spectral features in streaming signals for edge applications like wireless sensing and audio recognition.

Method: The study introduces a wireless split computing architecture with RF neurons, which resonate at tunable frequencies to process time-domain signals directly, avoiding costly spectral pre-processing.

Result: The RF-SNN architecture achieves accuracy comparable to LIF-SNNs and ANNs while significantly reducing spike rates and energy consumption during inference and communication.

Conclusion: RF neurons offer an energy-efficient solution for spectral feature extraction in neuromorphic computing, making them suitable for edge applications.

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing offers an energy-efficient alternative to conventional
deep learning accelerators for real-time time-series processing. However, many
edge applications, such as wireless sensing and audio recognition, generate
streaming signals with rich spectral features that are not effectively captured
by conventional leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) spiking neurons. This paper
investigates a wireless split computing architecture that employs
resonate-and-fire (RF) neurons with oscillatory dynamics to process time-domain
signals directly, eliminating the need for costly spectral pre-processing. By
resonating at tunable frequencies, RF neurons extract time-localized spectral
features while maintaining low spiking activity. This temporal sparsity
translates into significant savings in both computation and transmission
energy. Assuming an OFDM-based analog wireless interface for spike
transmission, we present a complete system design and evaluate its performance
on audio classification and modulation classification tasks. Experimental
results show that the proposed RF-SNN architecture achieves comparable accuracy
to conventional LIF-SNNs and ANNs, while substantially reducing spike rates and
total energy consumption during inference and communication.

*Shanika Iroshi Nanayakkara,Shiva Raj Pokhrel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep unfolding-based QFL approach autonomously optimizes hyperparameters for clients, achieving ~90% accuracy, outperforming traditional methods (~55%) in heterogeneous environments like healthcare and genomics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Client heterogeneity in QFL leads to performance issues; dynamic hyperparameter optimization is needed to mitigate overfitting and improve robustness.

Method: Leverages deep unfolding for autonomous hyperparameter optimization (e.g., learning rates, regularization) tailored to client-specific training behavior.

Result: Achieves ~90% accuracy on IBM quantum hardware and Qiskit simulators, significantly better than traditional methods (~55%).

Conclusion: The method addresses QFL limitations, enhancing applicability in critical fields like healthcare and genomics through self-adaptive optimization.

Abstract: Client heterogeneity poses significant challenges to the performance of
Quantum Federated Learning (QFL). To overcome these limitations, we propose a
new approach leveraging deep unfolding, which enables clients to autonomously
optimize hyperparameters, such as learning rates and regularization factors,
based on their specific training behavior. This dynamic adaptation mitigates
overfitting and ensures robust optimization in highly heterogeneous
environments where standard aggregation methods often fail. Our framework
achieves approximately 90% accuracy, significantly outperforming traditional
methods, which typically yield around 55% accuracy, as demonstrated through
real-time training on IBM quantum hardware and Qiskit Aer simulators. By
developing self adaptive fine tuning, the proposed method proves particularly
effective in critical applications such as gene expression analysis and cancer
detection, enhancing diagnostic precision and predictive modeling within
quantum systems. Our results are attributed to convergence-aware, learnable
optimization steps intrinsic to the deep unfolded framework, which maintains
the generalization. Hence, this study addresses the core limitations of
conventional QFL, streamlining its applicability to any complex challenges such
as healthcare and genomic research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DIM-SUM is a preprocessing framework for training robust time series imputation models, addressing real-world missing data patterns and outperforming traditional methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world infrastructure monitoring datasets often have complex, heterogeneous missing data patterns, which traditional models trained on artificially masked data fail to address.

Method: DIM-SUM combines pattern clustering and adaptive masking strategies with theoretical learning guarantees to handle diverse missing patterns.

Result: DIM-SUM outperforms traditional methods, achieving similar accuracy with less training data and processing time, and shows 2x higher accuracy than a large pre-trained model with lower inference time.

Conclusion: DIM-SUM effectively bridges the gap between artificially masked training data and real missing patterns, offering a practical solution for robust imputation in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Time series imputation models have traditionally been developed using
complete datasets with artificial masking patterns to simulate missing values.
However, in real-world infrastructure monitoring, practitioners often encounter
datasets where large amounts of data are missing and follow complex,
heterogeneous patterns. We introduce DIM-SUM, a preprocessing framework for
training robust imputation models that bridges the gap between artificially
masked training data and real missing patterns. DIM-SUM combines pattern
clustering and adaptive masking strategies with theoretical learning guarantees
to handle diverse missing patterns actually observed in the data. Through
extensive experiments on over 2 billion readings from California water
districts, electricity datasets, and benchmarks, we demonstrate that DIM-SUM
outperforms traditional methods by reaching similar accuracy with lower
processing time and significantly less training data. When compared against a
large pre-trained model, DIM-SUM averages 2x higher accuracy with significantly
less inference time.

*Salva Rühling Cachay,Miika Aittala,Karsten Kreis,Noah Brenowitz,Arash Vahdat,Morteza Mardani,Rose Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ERDM integrates rolling forecasts with Elucidated Diffusion Models, improving probabilistic forecasting in chaotic systems by addressing temporal dependencies and uncertainty growth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models struggle with complex temporal dependencies and uncertainty growth in high-dimensional chaotic systems.

Method: ERDM adapts EDM components (noise schedule, network preconditioning, Heun sampler) for rolling forecasts, introduces a novel loss weighting scheme, efficient initialization, and hybrid sequence architecture.

Result: ERDM outperforms baselines on 2D Navier-Stokes simulations and ERA5 weather forecasting.

Conclusion: ERDM provides a flexible framework for diffusion-based sequence generation with escalating uncertainty.

Abstract: Diffusion models are a powerful tool for probabilistic forecasting, yet most
applications in high-dimensional chaotic systems predict future snapshots
one-by-one. This common approach struggles to model complex temporal
dependencies and fails to explicitly account for the progressive growth of
uncertainty inherent to such systems. While rolling diffusion frameworks, which
apply increasing noise to forecasts at longer lead times, have been proposed to
address this, their integration with state-of-the-art, high-fidelity diffusion
techniques remains a significant challenge. We tackle this problem by
introducing Elucidated Rolling Diffusion Models (ERDM), the first framework to
successfully unify a rolling forecast structure with the principled, performant
design of Elucidated Diffusion Models (EDM). To do this, we adapt the core EDM
components-its noise schedule, network preconditioning, and Heun sampler-to the
rolling forecast setting. The success of this integration is driven by three
key contributions: (i) a novel loss weighting scheme that focuses model
capacity on the mid-range forecast horizons where determinism gives way to
stochasticity; (ii) an efficient initialization strategy using a pre-trained
EDM for the initial window; and (iii) a bespoke hybrid sequence architecture
for robust spatiotemporal feature extraction under progressive denoising. On 2D
Navier-Stokes simulations and ERA5 global weather forecasting at 1.5^\circ
resolution, ERDM consistently outperforms key diffusion-based baselines,
including conditional autoregressive EDM. ERDM offers a flexible and powerful
general framework for tackling diffusion-based sequence generation problems
where modeling escalating uncertainty is paramount. Code is available at:

*Nathan Stromberg,Christos Thrampoulidis,Lalitha Sankar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Loss weighting remains effective in last layer retraining (LLR) for models between underparameterized and overparameterized extremes, but weights must account for model overparameterization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in understanding how loss weighting performs in the intermediate regime of LLR, where data is often inseparable and models are proportionately sized.

Method: Theoretical and practical exploration of loss weighting in LLR, focusing on its effectiveness and the necessity of adjusting weights for model overparameterization.

Result: Loss weighting is effective in LLR, but its success depends on accounting for the model's relative overparameterization.

Conclusion: In the LLR regime, loss weighting can mitigate biases, but careful consideration of model overparameterization is crucial for optimal performance.

Abstract: While machine learning models become more capable in discriminative tasks at
scale, their ability to overcome biases introduced by training data has come
under increasing scrutiny. Previous results suggest that there are two extremes
of parameterization with very different behaviors: the population
(underparameterized) setting where loss weighting is optimal and the separable
overparameterized setting where loss weighting is ineffective at ensuring equal
performance across classes. This work explores the regime of last layer
retraining (LLR) in which the unseen limited (retraining) data is frequently
inseparable and the model proportionately sized, falling between the two
aforementioned extremes. We show, in theory and practice, that loss weighting
is still effective in this regime, but that these weights \emph{must} take into
account the relative overparameterization of the model.

*Prithvi Poddar,Ehsan Tarkesh Esfahani,Karthik Dantu,Souma Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for generating diverse COAs in multi-agent missions using graph abstraction and genetic algorithms, with a GNN for task sequencing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating COA planning for diverse agent capabilities and dynamic environments in disaster, military, and rescue operations.

Method: Graph abstraction of task space, genetic algorithm for diverse COA generation, and GNN for task sequencing.

Result: Outperforms random walk baseline, small optimality gap, and 50-minute planning time for 5 agents/100 tasks.

Conclusion: Effective for diverse COA generation in dynamic multi-agent environments.

Abstract: Operations in disaster response, search \& rescue, and military missions that
involve multiple agents demand automated processes to support the planning of
the courses of action (COA). Moreover, traverse-affecting changes in the
environment (rain, snow, blockades, etc.) may impact the expected performance
of a COA, making it desirable to have a pool of COAs that are diverse in task
distributions across agents. Further, variations in agent capabilities, which
could be human crews and/or autonomous systems, present practical opportunities
and computational challenges to the planning process. This paper presents a new
theoretical formulation and computational framework to generate such diverse
pools of COAs for operations with soft variations in agent-task compatibility.
Key to the problem formulation is a graph abstraction of the task space and the
pool of COAs itself to quantify its diversity. Formulating the COAs as a
centralized multi-robot task allocation problem, a genetic algorithm is used
for (order-ignoring) allocations of tasks to each agent that jointly maximize
diversity within the COA pool and overall compatibility of the agent-task
mappings. A graph neural network is trained using a policy gradient approach to
then perform single agent task sequencing in each COA, which maximizes
completion rates adaptive to task features. Our tests of the COA generation
process in a simulated environment demonstrate significant performance gain
over a random walk baseline, small optimality gap in task sequencing, and
execution time of about 50 minutes to plan up to 20 COAs for 5 agent/100 task
operations.

TL;DR: A framework using zk-SNARKs ensures verifiable and privacy-preserving data unlearning on edge-device models without compromising performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing issues like copyright infringements, biases, or regulatory needs for verifiable data removal across edge devices.

Method: Leverages zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs) to verify unlearning operations while preserving model personalization and minimizing overhead.

Result: Demonstrates practical and effective verifiable unlearning with minimal impact on model performance.

Conclusion: The framework ensures privacy-preserving, verifiable, and efficient machine unlearning for edge devices.

Abstract: Machine learning providers commonly distribute global models to edge devices,
which subsequently personalize these models using local data. However, issues
such as copyright infringements, biases, or regulatory requirements may require
the verifiable removal of certain data samples across all edge devices.
Ensuring that edge devices correctly execute such unlearning operations is
critical to maintaining integrity.
  In this work, we introduce a verification framework leveraging zero-knowledge
proofs, specifically zk-SNARKs, to confirm data unlearning on personalized
edge-device models without compromising privacy. We have developed algorithms
explicitly designed to facilitate unlearning operations that are compatible
with efficient zk-SNARK proof generation, ensuring minimal computational and
memory overhead suitable for constrained edge environments. Furthermore, our
approach carefully preserves personalized enhancements on edge devices,
maintaining model performance post-unlearning.
  Our results affirm the practicality and effectiveness of this verification
framework, demonstrating verifiable unlearning with minimal degradation in
personalization-induced performance improvements. Our methodology ensures
verifiable, privacy-preserving, and effective machine unlearning across edge
devices.

*Ankur Garg,Xuemin Yu,Hassan Sajjad,Samira Ebrahimi Kahou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLVQVAE, a framework using vector quantization to map and collapse redundant features in transformer layers into interpretable concept vectors, addressing challenges in analyzing cross-layer superposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods analyze neural representations at single layers, missing cross-layer superposition and redundancy. The paper aims to uncover emergent concepts across transformer layers by addressing these limitations.

Method: Proposes CLVQVAE, combining top-k temperature-based sampling with EMA codebook updates and scaled-spherical k-means++ for initialization to map and collapse features into concept vectors.

Result: The framework provides controlled exploration of discrete latent space while maintaining codebook diversity, better aligning with semantic structure in word embeddings.

Conclusion: CLVQVAE effectively addresses the challenge of analyzing cross-layer superposition in transformers, offering a more interpretable and compact representation of emergent concepts.

Abstract: Uncovering emergent concepts across transformer layers remains a significant
challenge because the residual stream linearly mixes and duplicates
information, obscuring how features evolve within large language models.
Current research efforts primarily inspect neural representations at single
layers, thereby overlooking this cross-layer superposition and the redundancy
it introduces. These representations are typically either analyzed directly for
activation patterns or passed to probing classifiers that map them to a limited
set of predefined concepts. To address these limitations, we propose
\gls{clvqvae}, a framework that uses vector quantization to map representations
across layers and in the process collapse duplicated residual-stream features
into compact, interpretable concept vectors. Our approach uniquely combines
top-$k$ temperature-based sampling during quantization with EMA codebook
updates, providing controlled exploration of the discrete latent space while
maintaining code-book diversity. We further enhance the framework with
scaled-spherical k-means++ for codebook initialization, which clusters by
directional similarity rather than magnitude, better aligning with semantic
structure in word embedding space.

*Soheil Abadifard,Fazli Can*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LSH-DynED, a novel method combining Locality Sensitive Hashing with Random Hyperplane Projections (LSH-RHP) and Dynamic Ensemble Diversification (DynED) to address multi-class imbalanced data streams. It outperforms 15 state-of-the-art methods in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of dynamic imbalance ratios in multi-class imbalanced data streams, a less explored area compared to binary imbalanced tasks.

Method: The proposed LSH-DynED method undersamples majority classes using LSH-RHP, balances the training set, and enhances ensemble prediction performance.

Result: LSH-DynED outperforms other methods in Kappa and mG-Mean metrics, showing robustness in large-scale, high-dimensional datasets with class imbalances.

Conclusion: LSH-DynED is effective for multi-class imbalanced non-stationary data streams, with potential for real-world applications. The implementation is shared on GitHub for reproducibility.

Abstract: The classification of imbalanced data streams, which have unequal class
distributions, is a key difficulty in machine learning, especially when dealing
with multiple classes. While binary imbalanced data stream classification tasks
have received considerable attention, only a few studies have focused on
multi-class imbalanced data streams. Effectively managing the dynamic imbalance
ratio is a key challenge in this domain. This study introduces a novel, robust,
and resilient approach to address these challenges by integrating Locality
Sensitive Hashing with Random Hyperplane Projections (LSH-RHP) into the Dynamic
Ensemble Diversification (DynED) framework. To the best of our knowledge, we
present the first application of LSH-RHP for undersampling in the context of
imbalanced non-stationary data streams. The proposed method undersamples the
majority classes by utilizing LSH-RHP, provides a balanced training set, and
improves the ensemble's prediction performance. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on 23 real-world and ten semi-synthetic datasets and compare
LSH-DynED with 15 state-of-the-art methods. The results reveal that LSH-DynED
outperforms other approaches in terms of both Kappa and mG-Mean effectiveness
measures, demonstrating its capability in dealing with multi-class imbalanced
non-stationary data streams. Notably, LSH-DynED performs well in large-scale,
high-dimensional datasets with considerable class imbalances and demonstrates
adaptation and robustness in real-world circumstances. To motivate our design,
we review existing methods for imbalanced data streams, outline key challenges,
and offer guidance for future work. For the reproducibility of our results, we
have made our implementation available on GitHub.

*Hirad Daneshvar,Reza Samavi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel method using self-distillation for efficient and precise uncertainty quantification in GNNs, outperforming Bayesian and ensemble methods in computational cost and diversity capture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantifying predictive uncertainty in GNNs is crucial for trustworthiness in healthcare, but existing methods like Bayesian and ensemble approaches are computationally expensive and lack diversity capture.

Method: Proposes self-distillation where the same network acts as teacher and student, avoiding multiple training. Introduces a weighted uncertainty metric to capture diversity among GNN classifiers.

Result: Evaluated on MIMIC-IV and Enzymes datasets, the method effectively quantifies uncertainty, matches MC Dropout and ensemble performance, and distinguishes out-of-distribution data.

Conclusion: The self-distillation-based approach offers a computationally efficient and precise solution for uncertainty quantification in GNNs, enhancing trustworthiness in clinical applications.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable performance in the
healthcare domain. However, what remained challenging is quantifying the
predictive uncertainty of GNNs, which is an important aspect of trustworthiness
in clinical settings. While Bayesian and ensemble methods can be used to
quantify uncertainty, they are computationally expensive. Additionally, the
disagreement metric used by ensemble methods to compute uncertainty cannot
capture the diversity of models in an ensemble network. In this paper, we
propose a novel method, based on knowledge distillation, to quantify GNNs'
uncertainty more efficiently and with higher precision. We apply
self-distillation, where the same network serves as both the teacher and
student models, thereby avoiding the need to train several networks
independently. To ensure the impact of self-distillation, we develop an
uncertainty metric that captures the diverse nature of the network by assigning
different weights to each GNN classifier. We experimentally evaluate the
precision, performance, and ability of our approach in distinguishing
out-of-distribution data on two graph datasets: MIMIC-IV and Enzymes. The
evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively capture
the predictive uncertainty of the model while having performance similar to
that of the MC Dropout and ensemble methods. The code is publicly available at

Motivation: To theoretically and empirically validate the use of synthetic data for pre-training models, extending prior work on algorithmic complexity and zero-shot learning.

Method: Theoretical analysis of algorithmic complexity and empirical validation using synthetic data for pre-training, followed by finetuning on real-world data.

Result: Models pre-trained on synthetic data exhibit zero-shot learning and improve with scale. Finetuning further enhances convergence and generalization.

Conclusion: Synthetic data is viable for pre-training, enabling zero-shot learning and improved performance with finetuning, supported by theoretical and empirical evidence.

Abstract: We investigate the use of randomly generated data for the sake of
pre-training a model. We justify this approach theoretically from the
perspective of algorithmic complexity, building on recent research that shows
that sequence models can be trained to approximate Solomonoff induction. We
derive similar, but complementary theoretical results. We show empirically that
synthetically generated data can be used to pre-train a model before the data
is seen. We replicate earlier results that models trained this way show
zero-shot in-context learning across a variety of datasets, and that this
performance improves with scale. We extend earlier results to real-world data,
and show that finetuning a model after pre-training offers faster convergence
and better generalization.

TL;DR: A novel method uses LLMs to relabel unsuccessful trajectories in reinforcement learning, improving sample efficiency and policy performance without heavy human annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming challenges in instruction-following RL, such as reliance on human-labeled data and sparse rewards, by leveraging LLMs for automated instruction generation.

Method: LLMs retrospectively generate open-ended instructions from agent trajectories, relabeling unsuccessful ones by identifying meaningful subtasks to enrich training data.

Result: Improved sample efficiency, instruction coverage, and policy performance in the Craftax environment compared to baselines.

Conclusion: LLM-guided open-ended instruction relabeling effectively enhances instruction-following RL, reducing dependency on human annotations.

Abstract: Developing effective instruction-following policies in reinforcement learning
remains challenging due to the reliance on extensive human-labeled instruction
datasets and the difficulty of learning from sparse rewards. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach that leverages the capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) to automatically generate open-ended instructions retrospectively
from previously collected agent trajectories. Our core idea is to employ LLMs
to relabel unsuccessful trajectories by identifying meaningful subtasks the
agent has implicitly accomplished, thereby enriching the agent's training data
and substantially alleviating reliance on human annotations. Through this
open-ended instruction relabeling, we efficiently learn a unified
instruction-following policy capable of handling diverse tasks within a single
policy. We empirically evaluate our proposed method in the challenging Craftax
environment, demonstrating clear improvements in sample efficiency, instruction
coverage, and overall policy performance compared to state-of-the-art
baselines. Our results highlight the effectiveness of utilizing LLM-guided
open-ended instruction relabeling to enhance instruction-following
reinforcement learning.

*Cristian Minoccheri,Sophia Tesic,Kayvan Najarian,Ryan Stidham*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a supervised coupled matrix-tensor factorization (SCMTF) method to integrate patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and lab data for predicting medication persistence in ulcerative colitis, achieving high AUC scores and interpretable phenotypes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage noisy and sparse patient-reported symptoms (PROs) in phenotyping, which are often excluded due to their challenges, and to predict medication persistence in ulcerative colitis.

Method: A novel supervised coupled matrix-tensor factorization (SCMTF) integrates temporal PROs, temporal labs, and static features within a deep learning framework to handle missing data and predict future medication changes.

Result: The model predicts medication changes 8 and 20 months ahead with AUCs of 0.853 and 0.803, respectively, and identifies interpretable phenotypes including symptom variables.

Conclusion: SCMTF successfully applies low-rank tensor methods to UC and PROs, proving their relevance despite sparsity, and identifies useful phenotypes for predicting medication persistence.

Abstract: Phenotyping is the process of distinguishing groups of patients to identify
different types of disease progression. A recent trend employs low-rank matrix
and tensor factorization methods for their capability of dealing with
multi-modal, heterogeneous, and missing data. Symptom quantification is crucial
for understanding patient experiences in inflammatory bowel disease, especially
in conditions such as ulcerative colitis (UC). However, patient-reported
symptoms are typically noisy, subjective, and significantly more sparse than
other data types. For this reason, they are usually not included in phenotyping
and other machine learning methods. This paper explores the application of
computational phenotyping to leverage Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) using a
novel supervised coupled matrix-tensor factorization (SCMTF) method, which
integrates temporal PROs and temporal labs with static features to predict
medication persistence in ulcerative colitis. This is the first tensor-based
method that is both supervised and coupled, it is the first application to the
UC domain, and the first application to PROs. We use a deep learning framework
that makes the model flexible and easy to train. The proposed method allows us
to handle the large amount of missing data in the PROs. The best model predicts
changes in medication 8 and 20 months in the future with AUCs of 0.853 and
0.803 on the test set respectively. We derive interpretable phenotypes
consisting of static features and temporal features (including their temporal
patterns). We show that low-rank matrix and tensor based phenotyping can be
successfully applied to the UC domain and to highly missing PRO data. We
identify phenotypes useful to predict medication persistence - these phenotypes
include several symptom variables, showing that PROs contain relevant
infromation that is usually discarded.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of comparative studies between regression- and classification-based PdM methods and provide insights for researchers and practitioners.

Method: Analyzes recent literature to compare regression (RUL estimation) and classification (failure probability) methods, focusing on advancements and challenges.

Result: Identifies key advancements, challenges like data imbalance, and trends such as hybrid approaches and AI-enabled systems.

Conclusion: The review aids in understanding PdM method trade-offs and suggests future research directions, including practical aspects like datasets and tools.

Abstract: Predictive maintenance (PdM) has become a crucial element of modern
industrial practice. PdM plays a significant role in operational dependability
and cost management by decreasing unforeseen downtime and optimizing asset life
cycle management. Machine learning and deep learning have enabled more precise
forecasts of equipment failure and remaining useful life (RUL). Although many
studies have been conducted on PdM, there has not yet been a standalone
comparative study between regression- and classification-based approaches. In
this review, we look across a range of PdM methodologies, while focusing more
strongly on the comparative use of classification and regression methods in
prognostics. While regression-based methods typically provide estimates of RUL,
classification-based methods present a forecast of the probability of failure
across defined time intervals. Through a comprehensive analysis of recent
literature, we highlight key advancements, challenges-such as data imbalance
and high-dimensional feature spaces-and emerging trends, including hybrid
approaches and AI-enabled prognostic systems. This review aims to provide
researchers and practitioners with an awareness of the strengths and
compromises of various PdM methods and to help identify future research and
build more robust, directed adaptive maintenance systems. Future work may
include a systematic review of practical aspects such as public datasets,
benchmarking platforms, and open-source tools to support the advancement of PdM

TL;DR: MEL is a framework for resilient edge inference using lightweight backup models that work collaboratively or independently, maintaining accuracy during failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge environments are resource-constrained and prone to failures; existing resilience methods compromise latency or accuracy.

Method: Multi-Level Ensemble Learning (MEL) trains multiple lightweight models collaboratively, formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem to ensure diversity and standalone performance.

Result: MEL achieves performance comparable to original models, with 40% size, and retains 95.6% accuracy during failures.

Conclusion: MEL provides fault tolerance and deployment flexibility for edge inference without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: AI inference at the edge is becoming increasingly common for low-latency
services. However, edge environments are power- and resource-constrained, and
susceptible to failures. Conventional failure resilience approaches, such as
cloud failover or compressed backups, often compromise latency or accuracy,
limiting their effectiveness for critical edge inference services. In this
paper, we propose Multi-Level Ensemble Learning (MEL), a new framework for
resilient edge inference that simultaneously trains multiple lightweight backup
models capable of operating collaboratively, refining each other when multiple
servers are available, and independently under failures while maintaining good
accuracy. Specifically, we formulate our approach as a multi-objective
optimization problem with a loss formulation that inherently encourages
diversity among individual models to promote mutually refining representations,
while ensuring each model maintains good standalone performance. Empirical
evaluations across vision, language, and audio datasets show that MEL provides
performance comparable to original architectures while also providing fault
tolerance and deployment flexibility across edge platforms. Our results show
that our ensemble model, sized at 40\% of the original model, achieves similar
performance, while preserving 95.6\% of ensemble accuracy in the case of
failures when trained using MEL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores using a pretrained multimodal earth-observation model to generate large-scale LFMC maps, improving accuracy by 20% over previous methods, and demonstrates its effectiveness in wildfire-impacted regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wildfires are intensifying, and ground-based LFMC sampling is costly and sparse. AI and satellite data offer a scalable solution for high-resolution, low-latency monitoring.

Method: A pretrained, highly-multimodal earth-observation model is used to generate spatially complete LFMC maps, with an automated pipeline for rapid deployment.

Result: The approach reduces RMSE by 20% compared to randomly initialized models and successfully maps LFMC in wildfire-impacted regions (Eaton and Palisades).

Conclusion: The method provides a scalable, accurate solution for LFMC monitoring, aiding wildfire research and operational response.

Abstract: Wildfires are increasing in intensity and severity at an alarming rate.
Recent advances in AI and publicly available satellite data enable monitoring
critical wildfire risk factors globally, at high resolution and low latency.
Live Fuel Moisture Content (LFMC) is a critical wildfire risk factor and is
valuable for both wildfire research and operational response. However,
ground-based LFMC samples are both labor intensive and costly to acquire,
resulting in sparse and infrequent updates. In this work, we explore the use of
a pretrained, highly-multimodal earth-observation model for generating
large-scale spatially complete (wall-to-wall) LFMC maps. Our approach achieves
significant improvements over previous methods using randomly initialized
models (20 reduction in RMSE). We provide an automated pipeline that enables
rapid generation of these LFMC maps across the United States, and demonstrate
its effectiveness in two regions recently impacted by wildfire (Eaton and
Palisades).

### [136] [Causal discovery in deterministic discrete LTI-DAE systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20169)
*Bala Rajesh Konkathi,Arun K. Tangirala*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method called Partition of Variables (PoV) for causal discovery in LTI-DAE systems, improving upon a 2022 method by handling systems with algebraic relations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like DIPCA fail for systems with algebraic relations or feedback control, necessitating a more robust approach.

Method: PoV uses DIPCA to identify algebraic and dynamical relations, then partitions variables via constraint matrix analysis.

Result: PoV successfully identifies causal drivers in LTI-DAE systems, outperforming the 2022 method.

Conclusion: PoV is a superior method for causal discovery in mixed causal systems, validated by case studies.

Abstract: Discovering pure causes or driver variables in deterministic LTI systems is
of vital importance in the data-driven reconstruction of causal networks. A
recent work by Kathari and Tangirala, proposed in 2022, formulated the causal
discovery method as a constraint identification problem. The constraints are
identified using a dynamic iterative PCA (DIPCA)-based approach for dynamical
systems corrupted with Gaussian measurement errors. The DIPCA-based method
works efficiently for dynamical systems devoid of any algebraic relations.
However, several dynamical systems operate under feedback control and/or are
coupled with conservation laws, leading to differential-algebraic (DAE) or
mixed causal systems. In this work, a method, namely the partition of variables
(PoV), for causal discovery in LTI-DAE systems is proposed. This method is
superior to the method that was presented by Kathari and Tangirala (2022), as
PoV also works for pure dynamical systems, which are devoid of algebraic
equations. The proposed method identifies the causal drivers up to a minimal
subset. PoV deploys DIPCA to first determine the number of algebraic relations
($n_a$), the number of dynamical relations ($n_d$) and the constraint matrix.
Subsequently, the subsets are identified through an admissible partitioning of
the constraint matrix by finding the condition number of it. Case studies are
presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for discovering causal structure in PDEs using physics-informed neural networks and counterfactual perturbations, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of classical methods like residual minimization or sparse regression in identifying causal structure in PDEs.

Method: Uses physics-informed neural networks and counterfactual perturbations, introducing causal sensitivity indices and structural deviation metrics.

Result: Proves exact recovery of causal operator support under certain conditions and validates the framework on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The method reliably recovers governing operators under noise and data scarcity, offering a tractable and interpretable approach to causal PDE discovery.

Abstract: We develop a principled framework for discovering causal structure in partial
differential equations (PDEs) using physics-informed neural networks and
counterfactual perturbations. Unlike classical residual minimization or sparse
regression methods, our approach quantifies operator-level necessity through
functional interventions on the governing dynamics. We introduce causal
sensitivity indices and structural deviation metrics to assess the influence of
candidate differential operators within neural surrogates. Theoretically, we
prove exact recovery of the causal operator support under restricted isometry
or mutual coherence conditions, with residual bounds guaranteeing
identifiability. Empirically, we validate the framework on both synthetic and
real-world datasets across climate dynamics, tumor diffusion, and ocean flows.
Our method consistently recovers governing operators even under noise,
redundancy, and data scarcity, outperforming standard PINNs and DeepONets in
structural fidelity. This work positions causal PDE discovery as a tractable
and interpretable inference task grounded in structural causal models and
variational residual analysis.

*Ruokai Yin,Yuhang Li,Donghyun Lee,Priyadarshini Panda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DuoGPT combines unstructured weight pruning with activation sparsity to reduce LLM deployment costs, outperforming structured pruning methods in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High memory and compute costs of LLMs hinder deployment; activation sparsity is often overlooked in pruning methods.

Method: DuoGPT integrates activation sparsity as dynamic structured weight sparsity, using OBC with activation-aware calibration and dense model residuals.

Result: DuoGPT achieves up to 9.17% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods at 1.39x speedup over dense models.

Conclusion: DuoGPT effectively balances accuracy and efficiency, scaling to billion-parameter LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver strong performance but are difficult to
deploy due to high memory and compute costs. While pruning reduces these
demands, most methods ignore activation sparsity observed at runtime. We
reinterpret activation sparsity as dynamic structured weight sparsity and
propose DuoGPT, a unified framework that constructs dual-sparse (spMspV)
workloads by combining unstructured weight pruning with activation sparsity. To
preserve accuracy, we extend the Optimal Brain Compression (OBC) framework with
activation-aware calibration and introduce output residuals from the dense
model as correction terms. We further optimize the solution for efficient GPU
execution, enabling scalability to billion-parameter LLMs. Evaluations on
LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 show that DuoGPT outperforms state-of-the-art structured
pruning methods by up to 9.17% accuracy at an iso-speedup of 1.39$\times$
compared to the baseline dense model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Anubis, a zero-shot tool for attributing code generated by LLMs using hypothesis testing and density estimates, achieving high accuracy with minimal samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of LLM-generated code, there's a need for reliable attribution methods to determine the source model of such code.

Method: The authors propose Anubis, which frames attribution as a distribution testing problem, leveraging samples and density estimates from LLMs.

Result: Anubis achieves AUROC scores ≥0.9 in distinguishing between models like DeepSeek-Coder, CodeGemma, and Stable-Code using ≈2000 samples.

Conclusion: Anubis provides an effective solution for code attribution, demonstrating high accuracy with limited data.

Abstract: A growing fraction of all code is sampled from Large Language Models (LLMs).
We investigate the problem of attributing code generated by language models
using hypothesis testing to leverage established techniques and guarantees.
Given a set of samples $S$ and a suspect model $\mathcal{L}^*$, our goal is to
assess the likelihood of $S$ originating from $\mathcal{L}^*$. Due to the curse
of dimensionality, this is intractable when only samples from the LLM are
given: to circumvent this, we use both samples and density estimates from the
LLM, a form of access commonly available.
  We introduce $\mathsf{Anubis}$, a zero-shot attribution tool that frames
attribution as a distribution testing problem. Our experiments on a benchmark
of code samples show that $\mathsf{Anubis}$ achieves high AUROC scores (
$\ge0.9$) when distinguishing between LLMs like DeepSeek-Coder, CodeGemma, and
Stable-Code using only $\approx 2000$ samples.

*Eduardo Gutierrez Maestro,Hadi Banaee,Amy Loutfi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Affective Priming Score (APS) to detect and mitigate priming effects in affective computing data, reducing misclassification rates in models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the underexplored impact of priming on physiological signals and its potential to cause misclassifications in learning models.

Method: Proposes APS, a data-driven method to score data points for priming effects, validated on SEED and SEED-VII datasets by comparing original and priming-free data.

Result: Misclassification rates significantly decrease when using priming-free sequences, demonstrating APS's effectiveness.

Conclusion: APS enhances model robustness and provides insights for designing affective computing datasets by mitigating priming effects at the data level.

Abstract: Affective priming exemplifies the challenge of ambiguity in affective
computing. While the community has largely addressed this issue from a
label-based perspective, identifying data points in the sequence affected by
the priming effect, the impact of priming on data itself, particularly in
physiological signals, remains underexplored. Data affected by priming can lead
to misclassifications when used in learning models. This study proposes the
Affective Priming Score (APS), a data-driven method to detect data points
influenced by the priming effect. The APS assigns a score to each data point,
quantifying the extent to which it is affected by priming. To validate this
method, we apply it to the SEED and SEED-VII datasets, which contain sufficient
transitions between emotional events to exhibit priming effects. We train
models with the same configuration using both the original data and
priming-free sequences. The misclassification rate is significantly reduced
when using priming-free sequences compared to the original data. This work
contributes to the broader challenge of ambiguity by identifying and mitigating
priming effects at the data level, enhancing model robustness, and offering
valuable insights for the design and collection of affective computing
datasets.

*Yuyang Zhang,Xu Shen,Yu Xie,Ka-Chun Wong,Weidun Xie,Chengbin Peng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel GNN framework combines feature embedding with community info for better directed link prediction, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving directed link prediction by integrating community information with feature embeddings.

Method: Proposes a GNN framework using hybrid features and transforms graphs into directed line graphs for efficient info aggregation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets with varying training data percentages.

Conclusion: The hybrid feature approach and directed line graph transformation enhance link prediction performance.

Abstract: Link prediction is a classical problem in graph analysis with many practical
applications. For directed graphs, recently developed deep learning approaches
typically analyze node similarities through contrastive learning and aggregate
neighborhood information through graph convolutions. In this work, we propose a
novel graph neural network (GNN) framework to fuse feature embedding with
community information. We theoretically demonstrate that such hybrid features
can improve the performance of directed link prediction. To utilize such
features efficiently, we also propose an approach to transform input graphs
into directed line graphs so that nodes in the transformed graph can aggregate
more information during graph convolutions. Experiments on benchmark datasets
show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in most cases when 30%,
40%, 50%, and 60% of the connected links are used as training data,
respectively.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedBKD is a data-free distillation framework for federated learning (FL) that addresses non-IID data challenges by using GANs for synthetic data and bidirectional knowledge distillation between global and local models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FL faces challenges with non-IID data and privacy risks from public datasets. Current solutions lack balance between global generalization and local performance.

Method: Proposes FedBKD, using GANs to generate synthetic data (local models as frozen discriminators) and bidirectional distillation for knowledge sharing.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 4 benchmarks under various non-IID settings.

Conclusion: FedBKD effectively balances global and local model performance while mitigating privacy risks.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized collaborative machine learning
(ML) technique. It provides a solution to the issues of isolated data islands
and data privacy leakage in industrial ML practices. One major challenge in FL
is handling the non-identical and independent distributed (non-IID) data.
Current solutions either focus on constructing an all-powerful global model, or
customizing personalized local models. Few of them can provide both a
well-generalized global model and well-performed local models at the same time.
Additionally, many FL solutions to the non-IID problem are benefited from
introducing public datasets. However, this will also increase the risk of data
leakage. To tackle the problems, we propose a novel data-free distillation
framework, Federated Bidirectional Knowledge Distillation (FedBKD).
Specifically, we train Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for synthetic
data. During the GAN training, local models serve as discriminators and their
parameters are frozen. The synthetic data is then used for bidirectional
distillation between global and local models to achieve knowledge interactions
so that performances for both sides are improved. We conduct extensive
experiments on 4 benchmarks under different non-IID settings. The results show
that FedBKD achieves SOTA performances in every case.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantization of LLMs for resource-constrained environments may compromise safety, necessitating systematic evaluation and mitigation.

Method: Comprehensive safety evaluations across quantization techniques and datasets, followed by the Q-resafe framework to restore safety.

Result: Q-resafe successfully re-aligns the safety of quantized LLMs with their original versions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively mitigates safety vulnerabilities in quantized LLMs, ensuring safe deployment.

Abstract: Quantized large language models (LLMs) have gained increasing attention and
significance for enabling deployment in resource-constrained environments.
However, emerging studies on a few calibration dataset-free quantization
methods suggest that quantization may compromise the safety capabilities of
LLMs, underscoring the urgent need for systematic safety evaluations and
effective mitigation strategies. In this paper, we present comprehensive safety
evaluations across various mainstream quantization techniques and diverse
calibration datasets, utilizing widely accepted safety benchmarks. To address
the identified safety vulnerabilities, we propose a quantization-aware safety
patching framework, Q-resafe, to efficiently restore the safety capabilities of
quantized LLMs while minimizing any adverse impact on utility. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that Q-resafe successfully re-aligns the
safety of quantized LLMs with their pre-quantization counterparts, even under
challenging evaluation scenarios. Project page is available at:

TL;DR: The paper evaluates data-driven methods for generating synthetic time series data for long-term energy consumption forecasting, comparing WGAN, DDPM, HMM, and MABF.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-term forecasting of individual power consumption is understudied, and high-fidelity synthetic data is needed for applications like energy system state estimations and grid planning.

Method: Comparative evaluation of WGAN, DDPM, HMM, and MABF to replicate temporal dynamics and dependencies in energy consumption profiles.

Result: The study highlights strengths and limitations of each method, aiding in selecting the best approach for energy-related tasks.

Conclusion: The framework enhances synthetic data accuracy and privacy, using an open-source German household dataset for practical applications.

Abstract: Forecasting attracts a lot of research attention in the electricity value
chain. However, most studies concentrate on short-term forecasting of
generation or consumption with a focus on systems and less on individual
consumers. Even more neglected is the topic of long-term forecasting of
individual power consumption.
  Here, we provide an in-depth comparative evaluation of data-driven methods
for generating synthetic time series data tailored to energy consumption
long-term forecasting. High-fidelity synthetic data is crucial for a wide range
of applications, including state estimations in energy systems or power grid
planning. In this study, we assess and compare the performance of multiple
state-of-the-art but less common techniques: a hybrid Wasserstein Generative
Adversarial Network (WGAN), Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM),
Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and Masked Autoregressive Bernstein polynomial
normalizing Flows (MABF). We analyze the ability of each method to replicate
the temporal dynamics, long-range dependencies, and probabilistic transitions
characteristic of individual energy consumption profiles. Our comparative
evaluation highlights the strengths and limitations of: WGAN, DDPM, HMM and
MABF aiding in selecting the most suitable approach for state estimations and
other energy-related tasks. Our generation and analysis framework aims to
enhance the accuracy and reliability of synthetic power consumption data while
generating data that fulfills criteria like anonymisation - preserving privacy
concerns mitigating risks of specific profiling of single customers. This study
utilizes an open-source dataset from households in Germany with 15min time
resolution. The generated synthetic power profiles can readily be used in
applications like state estimations or consumption forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper formalizes recourse-aware ensembling (RAE) to address model multiplicity (MM) in machine learning, proposing a novel argumentative ensembling method to ensure robust counterfactual explanations (CEs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model multiplicity complicates providing robust counterfactual explanations, as CEs may not be valid across all models. The paper aims to solve this by integrating CEs and predictions in ensemble decisions.

Method: Introduces six desirable properties for RAE solutions and proposes an argumentative ensembling method. This method uses computational argumentation to resolve conflicts between models and CEs, ensuring robustness.

Result: Theoretical analysis characterizes the method's behavior with four argumentation semantics. Empirical results show effectiveness in satisfying desirable properties across eight method instantiations.

Conclusion: Argumentative ensembling effectively addresses recourse under MM, offering customizable and robust solutions for CEs.

Abstract: In machine learning, it is common to obtain multiple equally performing
models for the same prediction task, e.g., when training neural networks with
different random seeds. Model multiplicity (MM) is the situation which arises
when these competing models differ in their predictions for the same input, for
which ensembling is often employed to determine an aggregation of the outputs.
Providing recourse recommendations via counterfactual explanations (CEs) under
MM thus becomes complex, since the CE may not be valid across all models, i.e.,
the CEs are not robust under MM. In this work, we formalise the problem of
providing recourse under MM, which we name recourse-aware ensembling (RAE). We
propose the idea that under MM, CEs for each individual model should be
considered alongside their predictions so that the aggregated prediction and
recourse are decided in tandem. Centred around this intuition, we introduce six
desirable properties for solutions to this problem. For solving RAE, we propose
a novel argumentative ensembling method which guarantees the robustness of CEs
under MM. Specifically, our method leverages computational argumentation to
explicitly represent the conflicts between models and counterfactuals regarding
prediction results and CE validity. It then uses argumentation semantics to
resolve the conflicts and obtain the final solution, in a manner which is
parametric to the chosen semantics. Our method also allows for the
specification of preferences over the models under MM, allowing further
customisation of the ensemble. In a comprehensive theoretical analysis, we
characterise the behaviour of argumentative ensembling with four different
argumentation semantics. We then empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach in satisfying desirable properties with eight instantiations of
our method. (Abstract is shortened for arXiv.)

*Zeqi Leng,Chunxu Zhang,Guodong Long,Riting Xia,Bo Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Federated Learning (FL) framework that distills a universal expert model from clustered FL to capture shared knowledge across clients, improving performance by balancing personalized and shared knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) methods overlook shared information across clusters, limiting generalizable knowledge. This paper aims to address this gap.

Method: The framework involves three iterative steps: local model training, cluster-specific aggregation, and universal expert distillation to incorporate shared knowledge.

Result: The proposed method outperforms traditional gradient-based aggregation, handling model heterogeneity better and reducing conflicts among cluster-specific experts.

Conclusion: The framework advances CFL by effectively balancing personalized and shared knowledge, demonstrating superior performance in various scenarios.

Abstract: Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) addresses the challenges posed by non-IID
data by training multiple group- or cluster-specific expert models. However,
existing methods often overlook the shared information across clusters, which
represents the generalizable knowledge valuable to all participants in the
Federated Learning (FL) system. To overcome this limitation, this paper
introduces a novel FL framework that distills a universal expert model from the
knowledge of multiple clusters. This universal expert captures globally shared
information across all clients and is subsequently distributed to each client
as the initialization for the next round of model training. The proposed FL
framework operates in three iterative steps: (1) local model training at each
client, (2) cluster-specific model aggregation, and (3) universal expert
distillation. This three-step learning paradigm ensures the preservation of
fine-grained non-IID characteristics while effectively incorporating shared
knowledge across clusters. Compared to traditional gradient-based aggregation
methods, the distillation-based model aggregation introduces greater
flexibility in handling model heterogeneity and reduces conflicts among
cluster-specific experts. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
superior performance of the proposed method across various scenarios,
highlighting its potential to advance the state of CFL by balancing
personalized and shared knowledge more effectively.

TL;DR: The paper explores learning-based QR code decoding using Transformers, showing they can decode beyond error-correction limits by focusing on data bits and ignoring error-correction bits, generalizing across languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate learning functions of medium sensitivity, bridging input-insensitive tasks (e.g., image classification) and input-sensitive tasks (e.g., arithmetic).

Method: Uses Transformers to decode QR codes, analyzing their ability to learn from English-rich data and generalize to other languages and random strings.

Result: Transformers successfully decode QR codes beyond theoretical error-correction limits, focusing on data bits and ignoring error-correction bits.

Conclusion: Transformers offer a distinct decoding mechanism for QR codes, demonstrating potential for learning medium-sensitivity functions.

Abstract: The hardness of learning a function that attains a target task relates to its
input-sensitivity. For example, image classification tasks are
input-insensitive as minor corruptions should not affect the classification
results, whereas arithmetic and symbolic computation, which have been recently
attracting interest, are highly input-sensitive as each input variable connects
to the computation results. This study presents the first learning-based Quick
Response (QR) code decoding and investigates learning functions of medium
sensitivity. Our experiments reveal that Transformers can successfully decode
QR codes, even beyond the theoretical error-correction limit, by learning the
structure of embedded texts. They generalize from English-rich training data to
other languages and even random strings. Moreover, we observe that the
Transformer-based QR decoder focuses on data bits while ignoring
error-correction bits, suggesting a decoding mechanism distinct from standard
QR code readers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ILDE is a novel imitation learning algorithm that uses double exploration (optimistic policy optimization and curiosity-driven exploration) to improve sample efficiency and achieve beyond-expert performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of accurately learning expert policies from limited demonstrations and the need for exploration to surpass expert performance.

Method: ILDE combines optimistic policy optimization (rewarding uncertain state-action pairs) and curiosity-driven exploration (exploring states outside demonstrations).

Result: ILDE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in sample efficiency and achieves beyond-expert performance on Atari and MuJoCo tasks with fewer demonstrations.

Conclusion: ILDE is theoretically justified as an uncertainty-regularized policy optimization method with sublinear regret growth.

Abstract: Imitation learning is a central problem in reinforcement learning where the
goal is to learn a policy that mimics the expert's behavior. In practice, it is
often challenging to learn the expert policy from a limited number of
demonstrations accurately due to the complexity of the state space. Moreover,
it is essential to explore the environment and collect data to achieve
beyond-expert performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
imitation learning algorithm called Imitation Learning with Double Exploration
(ILDE), which implements exploration in two aspects: (1) optimistic policy
optimization via an exploration bonus that rewards state-action pairs with high
uncertainty to potentially improve the convergence to the expert policy, and
(2) curiosity-driven exploration of the states that deviate from the
demonstration trajectories to potentially yield beyond-expert performance.
Empirically, we demonstrate that ILDE outperforms the state-of-the-art
imitation learning algorithms in terms of sample efficiency and achieves
beyond-expert performance on Atari and MuJoCo tasks with fewer demonstrations
than in previous work. We also provide a theoretical justification of ILDE as
an uncertainty-regularized policy optimization method with optimistic
exploration, leading to a regret growing sublinearly in the number of episodes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Permutation Equivariant Neural Graph CDEs, improving efficiency and generalization of Graph Neural CDEs by reducing parameters while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complexity of dynamic graphs by enhancing Graph Neural CDEs with permutation equivariance for better efficiency and generalization.

Method: Projects Graph Neural CDEs onto permutation equivariant function spaces, reducing parameters without losing representational power.

Result: Improved performance in interpolation and extrapolation tasks on simulated and real-world data.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a more efficient and generalizable approach for modeling dynamic graphs.

Abstract: Dynamic graphs exhibit complex temporal dynamics due to the interplay between
evolving node features and changing network structures. Recently, Graph Neural
Controlled Differential Equations (Graph Neural CDEs) successfully adapted
Neural CDEs from paths on Euclidean domains to paths on graph domains. Building
on this foundation, we introduce Permutation Equivariant Neural Graph CDEs,
which project Graph Neural CDEs onto permutation equivariant function spaces.
This significantly reduces the model's parameter count without compromising
representational power, resulting in more efficient training and improved
generalisation. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of our approach
through experiments on simulated dynamical systems and real-world tasks,
showing improved performance in both interpolation and extrapolation scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper explores memorization in machine learning models, showing that counterfactual self-influence underestimates risks due to the impact of (near-)duplicates. It proposes analyzing the full influence distribution for better insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy and generalization concerns by understanding how memorization is influenced by interactions across training data, not just self-influence.

Method: Analyzes memorization by treating counterfactual influence as a distributional quantity, computing full influence distributions for a small language model and image classification (CIFAR-10).

Result: Self-influence alone underestimates memorization risks; (near-)duplicates reduce self-influence but remain extractable. Influence distributions reveal near-duplicates in CIFAR-10.

Conclusion: Memorization is better understood through the full influence distribution, highlighting complex interactions in training data beyond self-influence.

Abstract: Machine learning models are known to memorize samples from their training
data, raising concerns around privacy and generalization. Counterfactual
self-influence is a popular metric to study memorization, quantifying how the
model's prediction for a sample changes depending on the sample's inclusion in
the training dataset. However, recent work has shown memorization to be
affected by factors beyond self-influence, with other training samples, in
particular (near-)duplicates, having a large impact. We here study memorization
treating counterfactual influence as a distributional quantity, taking into
account how all training samples influence how a sample is memorized. For a
small language model, we compute the full influence distribution of training
samples on each other and analyze its properties. We find that solely looking
at self-influence can severely underestimate tangible risks associated with
memorization: the presence of (near-)duplicates seriously reduces
self-influence, while we find these samples to be (near-)extractable. We
observe similar patterns for image classification, where simply looking at the
influence distributions reveals the presence of near-duplicates in CIFAR-10.
Our findings highlight that memorization stems from complex interactions across
training data and is better captured by the full influence distribution than by
self-influence alone.

### [152] [Producer-Fairness in Sequential Bundle Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20329)
*Alexandre Rio,Marta Soare,Sihem Amer-Yahia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses fairness in sequential bundle recommendations, focusing on producer-fairness to ensure balanced exposure of item groups. It proposes exact and heuristic solutions (quality-first, fairness-first, and adaptive) and validates their effectiveness on real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world scenarios require fair exposure of different item groups in sequential bundle recommendations, ensuring both fairness and high-quality bundles.

Method: The paper formalizes producer-fairness, proposes an exact solution for small instances, and examines heuristic approaches (quality-first, fairness-first, and an adaptive variant).

Result: Experiments on three real-world datasets show the proposed solutions effectively balance fairness and bundle quality.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates practical methods to achieve fair bundle recommendations without sacrificing quality, highlighting the trade-offs and adaptability of the proposed heuristics.

Abstract: We address fairness in the context of sequential bundle recommendation, where
users are served in turn with sets of relevant and compatible items. Motivated
by real-world scenarios, we formalize producer-fairness, that seeks to achieve
desired exposure of different item groups across users in a recommendation
session. Our formulation combines naturally with building high quality bundles.
Our problem is solved in real time as users arrive. We propose an exact
solution that caters to small instances of our problem. We then examine two
heuristics, quality-first and fairness-first, and an adaptive variant that
determines on-the-fly the right balance between bundle fairness and quality.
Our experiments on three real-world datasets underscore the strengths and
limitations of each solution and demonstrate their efficacy in providing fair
bundle recommendations without compromising bundle quality.

### [153] [Asymmetric REINFORCE for off-Policy Reinforcement Learning: Balancing positive and negative rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20520)
*Charles Arnal,Gaëtan Narozniak,Vivien Cabannes,Yunhao Tang,Julia Kempe,Remi Munos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores a simple off-policy REINFORCE algorithm for aligning large language models, balancing between off-policy RL and supervised fine-tuning. It shows that adjusting the baseline V can optimize performance, with theoretical guarantees when V lower-bounds expected reward.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between off-policy RL and supervised fine-tuning for aligning LLMs, addressing suboptimal performance of off-policy methods while maintaining simplicity and data efficiency.

Method: Analyzes an off-policy REINFORCE algorithm with a tunable baseline V, where advantage is defined as A=r-V. Theoretical analysis and experiments in bandit settings and LLM fine-tuning validate the approach.

Result: Theoretical guarantees show policy improvement when V lower-bounds expected reward. Experiments confirm that focusing on positive rewards benefits off-policy updates.

Conclusion: Adjusting the baseline V in off-policy REINFORCE can optimize LLM alignment, with practical benefits demonstrated in controlled and real-world tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly used to align large language
models (LLMs). Off-policy methods offer greater implementation simplicity and
data efficiency than on-policy techniques, but often result in suboptimal
performance. In this work, we study the intermediate range of algorithms
between off-policy RL and supervised fine-tuning by analyzing a simple
off-policy REINFORCE algorithm, where the advantage is defined as $A=r-V$, with
$r$ a reward and $V$ some tunable baseline. Intuitively, lowering $V$
emphasizes high-reward samples, while raising it penalizes low-reward ones more
heavily. We first provide a theoretical analysis of this off-policy REINFORCE
algorithm, showing that when the baseline $V$ lower-bounds the expected reward,
the algorithm enjoys a policy improvement guarantee. Our analysis reveals that
while on-policy updates can safely leverage both positive and negative signals,
off-policy updates benefit from focusing more on positive rewards than on
negative ones. We validate our findings experimentally in a controlled
stochastic bandit setting and through fine-tuning state-of-the-art LLMs on
reasoning tasks.

### [154] [On the ability of Deep Neural Networks to Learn Granger Causality in Multi-Variate Time Series Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20347)
*Malik Shahid Sultan,Hernando Ombao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new approach to Granger Causality (GC) using deep learning, treating GC as a prediction problem rather than variable selection, and shows that a well-regularized model can learn the true GC structure without explicit loss terms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional linear VAR models for GC have limited practical application due to restrictive assumptions. Existing DNN-based methods treat GC as variable selection, which the authors argue is not the most effective approach.

Method: The authors propose modeling time series jointly with a deep learning model and comparing model uncertainty or residual distributions when specific time series components are dropped. They also explore the impact of input layer dropout.

Result: A well-regularized deep learning model can learn the true GC structure from data without explicit variable selection or sparse regression terms in the loss function.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a novel paradigm for GC estimation, demonstrating that deep learning models can effectively uncover causal structures when treated as a prediction problem with proper regularization.

Abstract: Granger Causality (GC) offers an elegant statistical framework to study the
association between multivariate time series data. Linear Vector Autoregressive
models (VAR) though have nice interpretation properties but have limited
practical application due to underlying assumptions on the kind of associations
that can be captured by these models. Numerous attempts have already been made
in the literature that exploit the functional approximation power of Deep
Neural Networks (DNNs) for the task of GC estimation. These methods however
treat GC as a variable selection problem. We present a novel paradigm for
approaching GC. We present this idea that GC is essentially linked with
prediction and if a deep learning model is used to model the time series
collectively or jointly, a well regularized model may learn the true granger
causal structure from the data, given that there is enough training data. We
propose to uncover the learned GC structure by comparing the model uncertainty
or distribution of the residuals when the past of everything is used as
compared to the one where a specific time series component is dropped from the
model. We also compare the effect of input layer dropout on the ability of a
neural network to learn granger causality from the data. We show that a well
regularized model infact can learn the true GC structure from the data without
explicitly adding terms in the loss function that guide the model to select
variables or perform sparse regression.

*Soufiane Hayou,Nikhil Ghosh,Bin Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PLoP (Precise LoRA Placement) is a lightweight method for automatically identifying optimal module types for LoRA adapter placement, outperforming common strategies in finetuning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA adapter placement strategies lack consensus and may not be optimal for all tasks, prompting the need for an automated, task-specific solution.

Method: PLoP uses intuitive theoretical analysis to determine the best module types (e.g., attention or MLP) for LoRA adapter placement in pretrained models.

Result: PLoP consistently outperforms or matches common placement strategies in supervised finetuning and reinforcement learning for reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: PLoP provides an efficient, automated solution for LoRA adapter placement, enhancing task-specific model adaptation.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used finetuning method for large
models. Its small memory footprint allows practitioners to adapt large models
to specific tasks at a fraction of the cost of full finetuning. Different
modifications have been proposed to enhance its efficiency by, for example,
setting the learning rate, the rank, and the initialization. Another
improvement axis is adapter placement strategy: when using LoRA, practitioners
usually pick module types to adapt with LoRA, such as Query and Key modules.
Few works have studied the problem of adapter placement, with nonconclusive
results: original LoRA paper suggested placing adapters in attention modules,
while other works suggested placing them in the MLP modules. Through an
intuitive theoretical analysis, we introduce PLoP (Precise LoRA Placement), a
lightweight method that allows automatic identification of module types where
LoRA adapters should be placed, given a pretrained model and a finetuning task.
We demonstrate that PLoP consistently outperforms, and in the worst case
competes, with commonly used placement strategies through comprehensive
experiments on supervised finetuning and reinforcement learning for reasoning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DipSVD enhances SVD-based compression by protecting critical matrix components locally and globally, outperforming existing methods at high compression ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the oversight of critical component protection in existing SVD-based compression methods, which leads to inferior model performance.

Method: Proposes dual-level importance protection: (1) local (channel-weighted data whitening) and (2) global (heuristic/optimization-based layer compression balancing).

Result: DipSVD outperforms existing SVD-based methods across benchmarks, especially at high compression ratios.

Conclusion: DipSVD effectively improves SVD-based compression by safeguarding critical components, enhancing model performance under compression.

Abstract: The ever-increasing computational demands and deployment costs of large
language models (LLMs) have spurred numerous compressing methods. Compared to
quantization and unstructured pruning, SVD compression offers superior hardware
compatibility and theoretical guarantees. However, existing SVD-based methods
focus on the overall discrepancy between the original and compressed matrices
while overlooking the protection of critical components within the matrix,
which leads to inferior performance in the compressed models. This paper
proposes a dual-level importance protection mechanism to enhance SVD-based
compression methods: (1) local importance protection: preserving the most
critical singular vectors within each weight matrix through channel-weighted
data whitening; and (2) global importance protection: enabling less important
layers to bear a greater portion of the compression burden through either a
heuristic or optimization-based approach, thereby minimizing the impact of
compression on critical layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DipSVD
outperforms existing SVD-based compression approaches across multiple
benchmarks, achieving superior model performance especially at high model
compression ratios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of learning from multi-variate time-series with varying channel configurations, especially in clinical domains like iEEG.

Method: Proposes multi-variate parallel attention (MVPA) to disentangle content, temporal, and spatial attention, and builds MVPFormer, a generative model for iEEG.

Result: MVPFormer achieves strong generalization, expert-level seizure detection, and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. MVPA also excels in standard time-series tasks.

Conclusion: MVPA is a general-purpose attention mechanism for heterogeneous time-series, and MVPFormer is the first open-source iEEG foundation model with top clinical performance.

Abstract: Learning from multi-variate time-series with heterogeneous channel
configurations remains a fundamental challenge for deep neural networks (DNNs),
particularly in clinical domains such as intracranial electroencephalography
(iEEG), where channel setups vary widely across subjects. In this work, we
introduce multi-variate parallel attention (MVPA), a novel self-attention
mechanism that disentangles content, temporal, and spatial attention, enabling
flexible, generalizable, and efficient modeling of time-series data with
varying channel counts and configurations. We use MVPA to build MVPFormer, a
generative foundation model for human electrophysiology, trained to predict the
evolution of iEEG signals across diverse subjects. To support this and future
effort by the community, we release the SWEC iEEG dataset, the largest publicly
available iEEG dataset to date, comprising nearly 10,000 hours of recordings
from heterogeneous clinical sources. MVPFormer leverages MVPA to achieve strong
generalization across subjects, demonstrating expert-level performance in
seizure detection and outperforming state-of-the-art Transformer baselines on
our SWEC, the MAYO, and the FNUSA dataset. We further validate MVPA on standard
time-series forecasting and classification tasks, where it matches or exceeds
existing attention-based models. Together, our contributions establish MVPA as
a general-purpose attention mechanism for heterogeneous time-series and
MVPFormer as the first open-source, open-weights, and open-data iEEG foundation
model with state-of-the-art clinical performance. The code is available at

### [158] [Towards Interpretable and Efficient Feature Selection in Trajectory Datasets: A Taxonomic Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20359)
*Chanuka Don Samarasinghage,Dhruv Gulabani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a taxonomy-based feature selection method for trajectory analysis to address high-dimensionality issues, improving efficiency, interpretability, and predictive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensionality in trajectory data reduces model efficiency and interpretability, necessitating effective feature selection methods.

Method: A taxonomy-based approach categorizes features into geometric (curvature, indentation) and kinematic (speed, acceleration) groups.

Result: The method achieves comparable or superior predictive performance, reduces feature selection time, and enhances interpretability.

Conclusion: Taxonomy-based feature selection improves dimensionality reduction, computational efficiency, and decision-making in trajectory analysis, advancing explainable AI.

Abstract: Trajectory analysis is not only about obtaining movement data, but it is also
of paramount importance in understanding the pattern in which an object moves
through space and time, as well as in predicting its next move. Due to the
significant interest in the area, data collection has improved substantially,
resulting in a large number of features becoming available for training and
predicting models. However, this introduces a high-dimensionality-induced
feature explosion problem, which reduces the efficiency and interpretability of
the data, thereby reducing the accuracy of machine learning models. To overcome
this issue, feature selection has become one of the most prevalent tools. Thus,
the objective of this paper was to introduce a taxonomy-based feature selection
method that categorizes features based on their internal structure. This
approach classifies the data into geometric and kinematic features, further
categorizing them into curvature, indentation, speed, and acceleration. The
comparative analysis indicated that a taxonomy-based approach consistently
achieved comparable or superior predictive performance. Furthermore, due to the
taxonomic grouping, which reduces combinatorial space, the time taken to select
features was drastically reduced. The taxonomy was also used to gain insights
into what feature sets each dataset was more sensitive to. Overall, this study
provides robust evidence that a taxonomy-based feature selection method can add
a layer of interpretability, reduce dimensionality and computational
complexity, and contribute to high-level decision-making. It serves as a step
toward providing a methodological framework for researchers and practitioners
dealing with trajectory datasets and contributing to the broader field of
explainable artificial intelligence.

Motivation: To simplify and improve self-supervised graph learning by eliminating the need for negative sampling and handcrafted augmentations.

Method: Integrates Laplacian-based signals and spectral bootstrapping, using max-min centrality-guided optimization for spectral augmentations and adversarial bootstrapped training.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised graph methods on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: LaplaceGNN provides an efficient, scalable, and effective alternative for learning graph representations without contrastive objectives.

Abstract: We present LaplaceGNN, a novel self-supervised graph learning framework that
bypasses the need for negative sampling by leveraging spectral bootstrapping
techniques. Our method integrates Laplacian-based signals into the learning
process, allowing the model to effectively capture rich structural
representations without relying on contrastive objectives or handcrafted
augmentations. By focusing on positive alignment, LaplaceGNN achieves linear
scaling while offering a simpler, more efficient, self-supervised alternative
for graph neural networks, applicable across diverse domains. Our contributions
are twofold: we precompute spectral augmentations through max-min
centrality-guided optimization, enabling rich structural supervision without
relying on handcrafted augmentations, then we integrate an adversarial
bootstrapped training scheme that further strengthens feature learning and
robustness. Our extensive experiments on different benchmark datasets show that
LaplaceGNN achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
self-supervised graph methods, offering a promising direction for efficiently
learning expressive graph representations.

Conclusion: TESSERA provides robust, high-resolution representations, advancing remote sensing capabilities and accessibility.

Abstract: Satellite remote sensing (RS) enables a wide array of downstream Earth

and strategies for conservation and sustainable land use. We present TESSERA, a
novel Remote Sensing Foundation Model (RSFM) that uses Self-Supervised Learning
(SSL) to generate global, robust representations at 10m scale from pixel-level
satellite time series data. TESSERA combines information from only optical and
SAR data streams using two parallel Transformer-based encoders: one dedicated
to Sentinel-1 SAR polarizations and another to Sentinel-2 MSI data (10 selected
spectral bands) to create representations that are then fused using a
multilayer perceptron (MLP), resulting in a global representation map covering
the years 2017 to 2024. Our precomputed representations set a new
state-of-the-art performance benchmark and our open-source approach
democratizes access to high-performance, high-resolution representations. We
benchmark the performance of TESSERA in five diverse tasks, comparing our work
with state-of-the-art task-specific models and other foundation models. Our
results show that TESSERA outperforms both traditional RS baselines and the
leading geospatial foundation models in these diverse downstream tasks.

TL;DR: P4 is a decentralized method for personalized learning in IoT, ensuring privacy and robustness against attacks, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient, private, and robust personalized learning in decentralized IoT ecosystems drives the development of P4.

Method: P4 uses a lightweight decentralized algorithm for client similarity detection and collaborative group formation, employing differentially private knowledge distillation for co-training.

Result: P4 achieves 5%-30% higher accuracy than peers and remains robust with up to 30% malicious clients, adding minimal overhead (~7 seconds).

Conclusion: P4 effectively addresses challenges in decentralized personalized learning, offering privacy, robustness, and practicality for IoT.

Abstract: The growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Internet of Things
(IoT) ecosystems has intensified the need for personalized learning methods
that can operate efficiently and privately across heterogeneous,
resource-constrained devices. However, enabling effective personalized learning
in decentralized settings introduces several challenges, including efficient
knowledge transfer between clients, protection of data privacy, and resilience
against poisoning attacks. In this paper, we address these challenges by
developing P4 (Personalized, Private, Peer-to-Peer) -- a method designed to
deliver personalized models for resource-constrained IoT devices while ensuring
differential privacy and robustness against poisoning attacks. Our solution
employs a lightweight, fully decentralized algorithm to privately detect client
similarity and form collaborative groups. Within each group, clients leverage
differentially private knowledge distillation to co-train their models,
maintaining high accuracy while ensuring robustness to the presence of
malicious clients. We evaluate P4 on popular benchmark datasets using both
linear and CNN-based architectures across various heterogeneity settings and
attack scenarios. Experimental results show that P4 achieves 5% to 30% higher
accuracy than leading differentially private peer-to-peer approaches and
maintains robustness with up to 30% malicious clients. Additionally, we
demonstrate its practicality by deploying it on resource-constrained devices,
where collaborative training between two clients adds only ~7 seconds of
overhead.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel estimator (OPFV) for future off-policy evaluation and learning in non-stationary environments, leveraging time-series structures to reduce bias and improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for policy evaluation in non-stationary environments assume stationarity or rely on restrictive reward-modeling assumptions, leading to significant bias. The goal is to accurately estimate and optimize future policy values using historical data.

Method: Proposes the OPFV estimator, which uses time-series structures (e.g., seasonal effects) via a new importance weighting technique. Extends this to a policy-gradient method for proactive future policy learning.

Result: OPFV outperforms existing methods in estimating and optimizing future policy values under non-stationarity, as shown in empirical evaluations.

Conclusion: The OPFV estimator effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods by leveraging time-related structures, enabling accurate future policy evaluation and learning in non-stationary environments.

Abstract: We study the novel problem of future off-policy evaluation (F-OPE) and
learning (F-OPL) for estimating and optimizing the future value of policies in
non-stationary environments, where distributions vary over time. In e-commerce
recommendations, for instance, our goal is often to estimate and optimize the
policy value for the upcoming month using data collected by an old policy in
the previous month. A critical challenge is that data related to the future
environment is not observed in the historical data. Existing methods assume
stationarity or depend on restrictive reward-modeling assumptions, leading to
significant bias. To address these limitations, we propose a novel estimator
named \textit{\textbf{O}ff-\textbf{P}olicy Estimator for the \textbf{F}uture
\textbf{V}alue (\textbf{\textit{OPFV}})}, designed for accurately estimating
policy values at any future time point. The key feature of OPFV is its ability
to leverage the useful structure within time-series data. While future data
might not be present in the historical log, we can leverage, for example,
seasonal, weekly, or holiday effects that are consistent in both the historical
and future data. Our estimator is the first to exploit these time-related
structures via a new type of importance weighting, enabling effective F-OPE.
Theoretical analysis identifies the conditions under which OPFV becomes
low-bias. In addition, we extend our estimator to develop a new policy-gradient
method to proactively learn a good future policy using only historical data.
Empirical results show that our methods substantially outperform existing
methods in estimating and optimizing the future policy value under
non-stationarity for various experimental setups.

*Xing Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes KDIA, a knowledge distillation method for federated learning, addressing challenges like client label skew and data heterogeneity, especially in large-scale settings with few participating clients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated learning methods often overlook scenarios with limited client participation, which degrades model performance. The paper aims to improve accuracy in such challenging settings.

Method: KDIA uses teacher-student inequitable aggregation, where the student model averages participating clients, and the teacher model weights all clients based on participation intervals, counts, and data volume. Self-knowledge distillation and server-generated IID data aid local training.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10/100/CINIC-10 show KDIA achieves higher accuracy with fewer training rounds, especially under severe heterogeneity.

Conclusion: KDIA effectively leverages knowledge from all clients, improving federated learning performance in challenging heterogeneous and large-scale settings.

Abstract: Federated learning aims to train a global model in a distributed environment
that is close to the performance of centralized training. However, issues such
as client label skew, data quantity skew, and other heterogeneity problems
severely degrade the model's performance. Most existing methods overlook the
scenario where only a small portion of clients participate in training within a
large-scale client setting, whereas our experiments show that this scenario
presents a more challenging federated learning task. Therefore, we propose a
Knowledge Distillation with teacher-student Inequitable Aggregation (KDIA)
strategy tailored to address the federated learning setting mentioned above,
which can effectively leverage knowledge from all clients. In KDIA, the student
model is the average aggregation of the participating clients, while the
teacher model is formed by a weighted aggregation of all clients based on three
frequencies: participation intervals, participation counts, and data volume
proportions. During local training, self-knowledge distillation is performed.
Additionally, we utilize a generator trained on the server to generate
approximately independent and identically distributed (IID) data features
locally for auxiliary training. We conduct extensive experiments on the
CIFAR-10/100/CINIC-10 datasets and various heterogeneous settings to evaluate
KDIA. The results show that KDIA can achieve better accuracy with fewer rounds
of training, and the improvement is more significant under severe
heterogeneity.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the efficiency of PINNs by optimizing collocation point selection using the hessian of the function.

Method: Proposes a quadrature method based on the hessian to guide collocation point selection during PINN training.

Result: Improved adaptive sampling for PINNs, leading to more efficient surrogate neural solvers for PDEs.

Conclusion: The hessian-based quadrature method effectively enhances PINN training by optimizing collocation point selection.

Abstract: Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as an efficient way to
learn surrogate neural solvers of PDEs by embedding the physical model in the
loss function and minimizing its residuals using automatic differentiation at
so-called collocation points. Originally uniformly sampled, the choice of the
latter has been the subject of recent advances leading to adaptive sampling
refinements. In this paper, we propose a new quadrature method for
approximating definite integrals based on the hessian of the considered
function, and that we leverage to guide the selection of the collocation points
during the training process of PINNs.

Motivation: Addressing the challenge of selecting the optimal number of demonstrations in ICL for tabular data classification.

Method: Uses Spectral Graph Theory to quantify demonstration similarities, constructs a similarity graph, and analyzes Laplacian eigenvalues to determine the minimum required demonstrations.

Result: Validated through experiments showing efficacy against random selection algorithms across diverse datasets and LLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively automates demonstration selection, improving ICL performance for tabular data.

Abstract: A fundamental question in applying In-Context Learning (ICL) for tabular data
classification is how to determine the ideal number of demonstrations in the
prompt. This work addresses this challenge by presenting an algorithm to
automatically select a reasonable number of required demonstrations. Our method
distinguishes itself by integrating not only the tabular data's distribution
but also the user's selected prompt template and the specific Large Language
Model (LLM) into its estimation. Rooted in Spectral Graph Theory, our proposed
algorithm defines a novel metric to quantify the similarities between different
demonstrations. We then construct a similarity graph and analyze the
eigenvalues of its Laplacian to derive the minimum number of demonstrations
capable of representing the data within the LLM's intrinsic representation
space. We validate the efficacy of our approach through experiments comparing
its performance against conventional random selection algorithms on diverse
datasets and LLMs.

Motivation: To improve AI systems' ability to interpret and reason by leveraging multiple data modalities, addressing real-world complexity.

Method: Uses representation learning, alignment methods, and fusion strategies via deep learning models. Explores unsupervised/semi-supervised learning and AutoML tools.

Result: Enhanced AI performance in interpretation, reasoning, and decision-making, with applications in vision, NLP, speech, and healthcare.

Conclusion: Multi-modal learning holds promise for more human-like AI systems, adaptable to real-world complexity, with future advancements expected across diverse domains.

Abstract: Multi-modal learning is a fast growing area in artificial intelligence. It
tries to help machines understand complex things by combining information from
different sources, like images, text, and audio. By using the strengths of each
modality, multi-modal learning allows AI systems to build stronger and richer
internal representations. These help machines better interpretation, reasoning,
and making decisions in real-life situations. This field includes core
techniques such as representation learning (to get shared features from
different data types), alignment methods (to match information across
modalities), and fusion strategies (to combine them by deep learning models).
Although there has been good progress, some major problems still remain. Like
dealing with different data formats, missing or incomplete inputs, and
defending against adversarial attacks. Researchers now are exploring new
methods, such as unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, AutoML tools, to
make models more efficient and easier to scale. And also more attention on
designing better evaluation metrics or building shared benchmarks, make it
easier to compare model performance across tasks and domains. As the field
continues to grow, multi-modal learning is expected to improve many areas:
computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and
healthcare. In the future, it may help to build AI systems that can understand
the world in a way more like humans, flexible, context aware, and able to deal
with real-world complexity.

*Arno Geimer,Karthick Panner Selvam,Beltran Fiz Pontiveros*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Optimizing local batch sizes in Federated Learning via greedy randomized search improves convergence speed without compromising performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the local training process in Federated Learning by optimizing hardware usage, addressing improper training configurations that hinder performance.

Method: Uses a greedy randomized search to optimize local batch sizes, leveraging parallel processing in FL.

Result: Improves convergence speed compared to default settings, nearly matching performance of optimized local parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively optimizes local training in FL, balancing speed and performance.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized collaborative Machine Learning
framework for training models without collecting data in a centralized
location. It has seen application across various disciplines, from helping
medical diagnoses in hospitals to detecting fraud in financial transactions. In
this paper, we focus on improving the local training process through hardware
usage optimization. While participants in a federation might share the hardware
they are training on, since there is no information exchange between them,
their training process can be hindered by an improper training configuration.
Taking advantage of the parallel processing inherent to Federated Learning, we
use a greedy randomized search to optimize local batch sizes for the best
training settings across all participants. Our results show that against
default parameter settings, our method improves convergence speed while staying
nearly on par with the case where local parameters are optimized.

*Arno Geimer,Beltran Fiz Pontiveros,Radu State*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework using client-specific tokens and DeFi to improve reward distribution in Federated Learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the understudied area of reward distribution in FL, especially for for-profit applications, by creating a flexible and scalable system.

Method: Introduces client-specific tokens as investment vehicles, leveraging DeFi platforms and AMMs for decentralized reward distribution.

Result: A more flexible and scalable incentive system for FL participants, with a mechanism for third-party investment.

Conclusion: The framework enhances FL incentive schemes by integrating decentralized finance, benefiting both participants and investors.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative machine learning paradigm which
allows participants to collectively train a model while training data remains
private. This paradigm is especially beneficial for sectors like finance, where
data privacy, security and model performance are paramount. FL has been
extensively studied in the years following its introduction, leading to, among
others, better performing collaboration techniques, ways to defend against
other clients trying to attack the model, and contribution assessment methods.
An important element in for-profit Federated Learning is the development of
incentive methods to determine the allocation and distribution of rewards for
participants. While numerous methods for allocation have been proposed and
thoroughly explored, distribution frameworks remain relatively understudied. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework which introduces client-specific
tokens as investment vehicles within the FL ecosystem. Our framework aims to
address the limitations of existing incentive schemes by leveraging a
decentralized finance (DeFi) platform and automated market makers (AMMs) to
create a more flexible and scalable reward distribution system for
participants, and a mechanism for third parties to invest in the federation
learning process.

*Christian Internò,Andrea Castellani,Sebastian Schmitt,Fabio Stella,Barbara Hammer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SIDED, a synthetic industrial dataset for NILM, and AMDA, a data augmentation method, to address data scarcity and improve energy disaggregation in industrial settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial NILM faces challenges due to limited high-quality datasets and complex energy consumption patterns. Data scarcity and privacy issues further complicate the problem.

Method: The authors propose SIDED, a synthetic dataset generated via Digital Twin simulations, and AMDA, a method for intelligently scaling appliance power contributions to enhance model generalization.

Result: NILM models trained with AMDA-augmented data achieved a Normalized Disaggregation Error of 0.093, outperforming non-augmented (0.451) and randomly augmented (0.290) models.

Conclusion: SIDED and AMDA effectively address data scarcity and improve NILM model performance for industrial energy disaggregation, with AMDA enhancing generalization by aligning training and test data distributions.

Abstract: Industrial Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is limited by the scarcity of
high-quality datasets and the complex variability of industrial energy
consumption patterns. To address data scarcity and privacy issues, we introduce
the Synthetic Industrial Dataset for Energy Disaggregation (SIDED), an
open-source dataset generated using Digital Twin simulations. SIDED includes
three types of industrial facilities across three different geographic
locations, capturing diverse appliance behaviors, weather conditions, and load
profiles. We also propose the Appliance-Modulated Data Augmentation (AMDA)
method, a computationally efficient technique that enhances NILM model
generalization by intelligently scaling appliance power contributions based on
their relative impact. We show in experiments that NILM models trained with
AMDA-augmented data significantly improve the disaggregation of energy
consumption of complex industrial appliances like combined heat and power
systems. Specifically, in our out-of-sample scenarios, models trained with AMDA
achieved a Normalized Disaggregation Error of 0.093, outperforming models
trained without data augmentation (0.451) and those trained with random data
augmentation (0.290). Data distribution analyses confirm that AMDA effectively
aligns training and test data distributions, enhancing model generalization.

### [170] [Physics-Informed Machine Learning Regulated by Finite Element Analysis for Simulation Acceleration of Laser Powder Bed Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20537)
*R. Sharma,M. Raissi,Y. B. Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FEA-PINN, a hybrid framework combining Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) with corrective FEA simulations to efficiently predict thermal fields in LPBF, maintaining FEA accuracy while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional FEA for LPBF simulation is computationally expensive, necessitating a faster yet accurate alternative.

Method: The FEA-PINN framework integrates PINN with dynamic material updating and corrective FEA simulations to address residual accumulation and ensure physical consistency.

Result: FEA-PINN matches FEA accuracy but with significantly lower computational cost, validated using benchmark data and single-track LPBF scanning.

Conclusion: FEA-PINN offers an efficient and accurate solution for LPBF thermal field prediction, addressing the limitations of traditional FEA and standalone PINN.

Abstract: Efficient simulation of Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) is crucial for process
prediction due to the lasting issue of high computation cost using traditional
numerical methods such as finite element analysis (FEA). This study presents an
efficient modeling framework termed FEA-Regulated Physics-Informed Neural
Network (FEA-PINN) to accelerate the thermal field prediction in a LPBF process
while maintaining the FEA accuracy. A novel dynamic material updating strategy
is developed to capture the dynamic phase change of powder-liquid-solid in the
PINN model. The PINN model incorporates temperature-dependent material
properties and phase change behavior using the apparent heat capacity method.
While the PINN model demonstrates high accuracy with a small training data and
enables generalization of new process parameters via transfer learning, it
faces the challenge of high computation cost in time-dependent problems due to
the residual accumulation. To overcome this issue, the FEA-PINN framework
integrates corrective FEA simulations during inference to enforce physical
consistency and reduce error drift. A comparative analysis shows that FEA-PINN
achieves equivalent accuracy to FEA while significantly reducing computational
cost. The framework has been validated using the benchmark FEA data and
demonstrated through single-track scanning in LPBF.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of efficiently managing customer routing in dynamic queueing systems like data centers and service networks.

Method: Uses a reinforcement learning algorithm, tested on real-world data, and introduces a heuristic routing rule to reduce delays. Also optimizes for multiple objectives like payoff, server fairness, and waiting time.

Result: The algorithm outperforms static policies, adapts well to changes, and balances trade-offs between objectives. Sensitivity to errors and tuning is analyzed.

Conclusion: The reinforcement learning approach is practical for live implementation in complex queueing systems, with insights for adaptive routing.

Abstract: This paper is about optimally controlling skill-based queueing systems such
as data centers, cloud computing networks, and service systems. By means of a
case study using a real-world data set, we investigate the practical
implementation of a recently developed reinforcement learning algorithm for
optimal customer routing. Our experiments show that the algorithm efficiently
learns and adapts to changing environments and outperforms static benchmark
policies, indicating its potential for live implementation. We also augment the
real-world applicability of this algorithm by introducing a new heuristic
routing rule to reduce delays. Moreover, we show that the algorithm can
optimize for multiple objectives: next to payoff maximization, secondary
objectives such as server load fairness and customer waiting time reduction can
be incorporated. Tuning parameters are used for balancing inherent performance
trade--offs. Lastly, we investigate the sensitivity to estimation errors and
parameter tuning, providing valuable insights for implementing adaptive routing
algorithms in complex real-world queueing systems.

TL;DR: The paper explores transformer-based approaches, specifically the iTransformer, for anomaly detection in multivariate time series, analyzing key parameters, label extraction, training impacts, and model comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly detection in multivariate time series is critical in fields like healthcare and finance but is challenging due to unknown anomalies and complex interdependencies.

Method: The study investigates the iTransformer architecture, examining parameters (window size, step size, model dimensions), anomaly label extraction, training impacts, and loss functions.

Result: The paper provides insights into parameter influences, label extraction methods, and comparative performance of transformer-based models.

Conclusion: The iTransformer shows promise for time series anomaly detection, with findings on parameter tuning, evaluation metrics, and model comparisons.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in multivariate time series is an important problem across
various fields such as healthcare, financial services, manufacturing or physics
detector monitoring. Accurately identifying when unexpected errors or faults
occur is essential, yet challenging, due to the unknown nature of anomalies and
the complex interdependencies between time series dimensions. In this paper, we
investigate transformer-based approaches for time series anomaly detection,
focusing on the recently proposed iTransformer architecture. Our contributions
are fourfold: (i) we explore the application of the iTransformer to time series
anomaly detection, and analyse the influence of key parameters such as window
size, step size, and model dimensions on performance; (ii) we examine methods
for extracting anomaly labels from multidimensional anomaly scores and discuss
appropriate evaluation metrics for such labels; (iii) we study the impact of
anomalous data present during training and assess the effectiveness of
alternative loss functions in mitigating their influence; and (iv) we present a
comprehensive comparison of several transformer-based models across a diverse
set of datasets for time series anomaly detection.

### [173] [Exploring Graph-Transformer Out-of-Distribution Generalization Abilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20575)
*Itay Niv,Neta Rabin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the effectiveness of graph-transformer (GT) and hybrid GT-MPNN backbones for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in graph neural networks, showing superior performance over traditional MPNNs. It also introduces a novel post-training analysis method for evaluating generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph neural networks assume training and testing data share the same distribution, which is unrealistic. The paper investigates how GT and hybrid architectures perform under distribution shifts.

Method: The study systematically evaluates GT and hybrid backbones in OOD settings, adapting domain generalization algorithms for GTs. A novel post-training analysis examines clustering structure for domain alignment and class separation.

Result: GT and hybrid GT-MPNN backbones outperform MPNNs in OOD generalization, even without specialized algorithms. The post-training analysis provides deeper insights into generalization abilities.

Conclusion: Graph-transformers show promise for robust real-world graph learning, and the proposed analysis method offers a new direction for OOD generalization research.

Abstract: Deep learning on graphs has shown remarkable success across numerous
applications, including social networks, bio-physics, traffic networks, and
recommendation systems. Regardless of their successes, current methods
frequently depend on the assumption that training and testing data share the
same distribution, a condition rarely met in real-world scenarios. While
graph-transformer (GT) backbones have recently outperformed traditional
message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) in multiple in-distribution (ID)
benchmarks, their effectiveness under distribution shifts remains largely
unexplored.
  In this work, we address the challenge of out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization for graph neural networks, with a special focus on the impact of
backbone architecture. We systematically evaluate GT and hybrid backbones in
OOD settings and compare them to MPNNs. To do so, we adapt several leading
domain generalization (DG) algorithms to work with GTs and assess their
performance on a benchmark designed to test a variety of distribution shifts.
Our results reveal that GT and hybrid GT-MPNN backbones consistently
demonstrate stronger generalization ability compared to MPNNs, even without
specialized DG algorithms.
  Additionally, we propose a novel post-training analysis approach that
compares the clustering structure of the entire ID and OOD test datasets,
specifically examining domain alignment and class separation. Demonstrating its
model-agnostic design, this approach not only provided meaningful insights into
GT and MPNN backbones. It also shows promise for broader applicability to DG
problems beyond graph learning, offering a deeper perspective on generalization
abilities that goes beyond standard accuracy metrics. Together, our findings
highlight the promise of graph-transformers for robust, real-world graph
learning and set a new direction for future research in OOD generalization.

### [174] [The kernel of graph indices for vector search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20584)
*Mariano Tepper,Ted Willke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Support Vector Graph (SVG), a machine learning-based graph index for vector search in metric and non-metric spaces, with formal navigability guarantees. It also interprets existing indices like HNSW and DiskANN as SVG specializations and proposes SVG-L0 for bounded out-degree graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph indices for vector search rely on Euclidean space principles, limiting their applicability. The paper aims to extend these methods to metric and non-metric spaces using machine learning.

Method: The SVG leverages kernel methods for graph connectivity and introduces SVG-L0 with an ℓ0 sparsity constraint to bound out-degree. It also interprets existing indices as SVG specializations.

Result: SVG provides formal navigability guarantees in non-Euclidean spaces. SVG-L0 offers a principled way to bound out-degree and avoids heuristic tuning, maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The SVG framework generalizes graph indices for vector search, enabling applications in broader spaces while maintaining theoretical and practical advantages.

Abstract: The most popular graph indices for vector search use principles from
computational geometry to build the graph. Hence, their formal graph
navigability guarantees are only valid in Euclidean space. In this work, we
show that machine learning can be used to build graph indices for vector search
in metric and non-metric vector spaces (e.g., for inner product similarity).
From this novel perspective, we introduce the Support Vector Graph (SVG), a new
type of graph index that leverages kernel methods to establish the graph
connectivity and that comes with formal navigability guarantees valid in metric
and non-metric vector spaces. In addition, we interpret the most popular graph
indices, including HNSW and DiskANN, as particular specializations of SVG and
show that new indices can be derived from the principles behind this
specialization. Finally, we propose SVG-L0 that incorporates an $\ell_0$
sparsity constraint into the SVG kernel method to build graphs with a bounded
out-degree. This yields a principled way of implementing this practical
requirement, in contrast to the traditional heuristic of simply truncating the
out edges of each node. Additionally, we show that SVG-L0 has a self-tuning
property that avoids the heuristic of using a set of candidates to find the
out-edges of each node and that keeps its computational complexity in check.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: H-FEX, a symbolic learning method, accurately learns complex Hamiltonian functions while preserving energy conservation, outperforming traditional data-driven approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data-driven methods struggle to accurately capture complex Hamiltonian functions and conserve energy, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Proposes H-FEX, a symbolic learning method with novel interaction nodes to effectively capture intricate interaction terms in Hamiltonian systems.

Result: H-FEX successfully recovers Hamiltonian functions for complex systems, preserving energy over long time horizons.

Conclusion: H-FEX is a promising framework for discovering closed-form expressions of complex dynamical systems.

Abstract: Hamiltonian systems describe a broad class of dynamical systems governed by
Hamiltonian functions, which encode the total energy and dictate the evolution
of the system. Data-driven approaches, such as symbolic regression and neural
network-based methods, provide a means to learn the governing equations of
dynamical systems directly from observational data of Hamiltonian systems.
However, these methods often struggle to accurately capture complex Hamiltonian
functions while preserving energy conservation. To overcome this limitation, we
propose the Finite Expression Method for learning Hamiltonian Systems (H-FEX),
a symbolic learning method that introduces novel interaction nodes designed to
capture intricate interaction terms effectively. Our experiments, including
those on highly stiff dynamical systems, demonstrate that H-FEX can recover
Hamiltonian functions of complex systems that accurately capture system
dynamics and preserve energy over long time horizons. These findings highlight
the potential of H-FEX as a powerful framework for discovering closed-form
expressions of complex dynamical systems.

*Fariba Jangjoo,Matteo Marsili,Yasser Roudi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Closed-loop learning in exponential family models leads to biased absorbing states, but bias can be mitigated by data pollution, MAP estimation, or regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the dynamics and potential biases in closed-loop learning, especially for large neural networks trained on self-generated data.

Method: Derived equations of motion for parameters in exponential family models, analyzed maximum likelihood estimation, and explored mitigation strategies like data pollution and regularization.

Result: Closed-loop learning converges to biased absorbing states, but bias can be prevented with small external data, MAP estimation, or regularization.

Conclusion: Closed-loop learning amplifies initial biases, but simple interventions can mitigate this effect, though dynamics are not reparametrisation invariant.

Abstract: Closed-loop learning is the process of repeatedly estimating a model from
data generated from the model itself. It is receiving great attention due to
the possibility that large neural network models may, in the future, be
primarily trained with data generated by artificial neural networks themselves.
We study this process for models that belong to exponential families, deriving
equations of motions that govern the dynamics of the parameters. We show that
maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters endows sufficient statistics
with the martingale property and that as a result the process converges to
absorbing states that amplify initial biases present in the data. However, we
show that this outcome may be prevented by polluting the data with an
infinitesimal fraction of data points generated from a fixed model, by relying
on maximum a posteriori estimation or by introducing regularisation.
Furthermore, we show that the asymptotic behavior of the dynamics is not
reparametrisation invariant.

### [177] [Efficient Federated Learning with Encrypted Data Sharing for Data-Heterogeneous Edge Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20644)
*Hangyu Li,Hongyue Wu,Guodong Fan,Zhen Zhang,Shizhan Chen,Zhiyong Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes FedEDS, a federated learning scheme for edge devices that uses encrypted data sharing to improve convergence speed and model performance by addressing data heterogeneity and network issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current federated learning research neglects network topology, physical distance, and data heterogeneity, causing latency and performance degradation in edge devices.

Method: FedEDS trains a data encryptor using client models and stochastic layers, generating encrypted data for sharing. Clients train local models using private and shared encrypted data.

Result: FedEDS accelerates convergence and mitigates data heterogeneity, enhancing model performance in edge device applications.

Conclusion: FedEDS is effective for federated learning on edge devices, offering faster convergence and better performance by leveraging encrypted data sharing.

Abstract: As privacy protection gains increasing importance, more models are being
trained on edge devices and subsequently merged into the central server through
Federated Learning (FL). However, current research overlooks the impact of
network topology, physical distance, and data heterogeneity on edge devices,
leading to issues such as increased latency and degraded model performance. To
address these issues, we propose a new federated learning scheme on edge
devices that called Federated Learning with Encrypted Data Sharing(FedEDS).
FedEDS uses the client model and the model's stochastic layer to train the data
encryptor. The data encryptor generates encrypted data and shares it with other
clients. The client uses the corresponding client's stochastic layer and
encrypted data to train and adjust the local model. FedEDS uses the client's
local private data and encrypted shared data from other clients to train the
model. This approach accelerates the convergence speed of federated learning
training and mitigates the negative impact of data heterogeneity, making it
suitable for application services deployed on edge devices requiring rapid
convergence. Experiments results show the efficacy of FedEDS in promoting model
performance.

*Anqi Mao,Mehryar Mohri,Yutao Zhong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces novel surrogate loss functions and algorithms for learning to defer with multiple experts, addressing consistency properties and providing theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in optimally assigning input instances to experts while balancing accuracy and computational cost, critical in fields like natural language generation and medical diagnostics.

Method: The paper proposes new surrogate loss functions for single-stage and two-stage deferral learning, with theoretical guarantees for realizable H-consistency, H-consistency bounds, and Bayes-consistency.

Result: Enhanced theoretical guarantees under low-noise assumptions and experimental results show improved performance compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed surrogate losses and algorithms effectively address consistency challenges in deferral learning, with strong theoretical and empirical support.

Abstract: The problem of learning to defer with multiple experts consists of optimally
assigning input instances to experts, balancing the trade-off between their
accuracy and computational cost. This is a critical challenge in natural
language generation, but also in other fields such as image processing, and
medical diagnostics. Recent studies have proposed surrogate loss functions to
optimize deferral, but challenges remain in ensuring their consistency
properties. This paper introduces novel surrogate loss functions and efficient
algorithms with strong theoretical learning guarantees. We address open
questions regarding realizable $H$-consistency, $H$-consistency bounds, and
Bayes-consistency for both single-stage (jointly learning predictor and
deferral function) and two-stage (learning only the deferral function with a
fixed expert) learning scenarios. For single-stage deferral, we introduce a
family of new realizable $H$-consistent surrogate losses and further prove
$H$-consistency for a selected member. For two-stage deferral, we derive new
surrogate losses that achieve realizable $H$-consistency, $H$-consistency
bounds, and Bayes-consistency for the two-expert scenario and, under natural
assumptions, multiple-expert scenario. Additionally, we provide enhanced
theoretical guarantees under low-noise assumptions for both scenarios. Finally,
we report the results of experiments using our proposed surrogate losses,
comparing their performance against existing baselines.

### [179] [Hear No Evil: Detecting Gradient Leakage by Malicious Servers in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20651)
*Fei Wang,Baochun Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes malicious gradient leakage attacks in federated learning (FL), highlighting their limitations in practice and proposing a lightweight client-side detection mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate the risks of sensitive data leakage in FL due to malicious server manipulation of the global model.

Method: Comprehensive analysis of gradient leakage attacks and model manipulation techniques, coupled with a proposed client-side detection mechanism.

Result: Attacks are limited in practice due to trade-offs between effectiveness and stealth, and basic monitoring can detect them.

Conclusion: Malicious gradient leakage attacks are less practical than theoretical concerns suggest, and a simple detection mechanism can effectively safeguard FL systems.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that gradient updates in federated learning (FL) can
unintentionally reveal sensitive information about a client's local data. This
risk becomes significantly greater when a malicious server manipulates the
global model to provoke information-rich updates from clients. In this paper,
we adopt a defender's perspective to provide the first comprehensive analysis
of malicious gradient leakage attacks and the model manipulation techniques
that enable them. Our investigation reveals a core trade-off: these attacks
cannot be both highly effective in reconstructing private data and sufficiently
stealthy to evade detection -- especially in realistic FL settings that
incorporate common normalization techniques and federated averaging.
  Building on this insight, we argue that malicious gradient leakage attacks,
while theoretically concerning, are inherently limited in practice and often
detectable through basic monitoring. As a complementary contribution, we
propose a simple, lightweight, and broadly applicable client-side detection
mechanism that flags suspicious model updates before local training begins,
despite the fact that such detection may not be strictly necessary in realistic
FL settings. This mechanism further underscores the feasibility of defending
against these attacks with minimal overhead, offering a deployable safeguard
for privacy-conscious federated learning systems.

*Yujie Liu,Vincent Y. F. Tan,Yunbei Xu*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper establishes finite-time lower bounds for queue length in scheduling problems, identifies limitations of MaxWeight, and introduces a new policy matching these bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work only ensured stability and asymptotic optimality; this paper addresses finite-time performance gaps in scheduling policies.

Method: Uses a minimax framework, derives information-theoretic lower bounds, and proposes a new scheduling rule optimizing Lyapunov drift.

Result: MaxWeight is suboptimal in finite time; the new policy matches lower bounds under certain conditions.

Conclusion: Reveals limitations of drift-only methods and advances non-asymptotic optimality in queueing control.

Abstract: We establish the first finite-time information-theoretic lower bounds-and
derive new policies that achieve them-for the total queue length in scheduling
problems over stochastic processing networks with both adversarial and
stochastic arrivals. Prior analyses of MaxWeight guarantee only stability and
asymptotic optimality in heavy traffic; we prove that, at finite horizons,
MaxWeight can incur strictly larger backlog by problem-dependent factors which
we identify. Our main innovations are 1) a minimax framework that pinpoints the
precise problem parameters governing any policy's finite-time performance; 2)
an information-theoretic lower bound on total queue length; 3) fundamental
limitation of MaxWeight that it is suboptimal in finite time; and 4) a new
scheduling rule that minimizes the full Lyapunov drift-including its
second-order term-thereby matching the lower bound under certain conditions, up
to universal constants. These findings reveal a fundamental limitation on
"drift-only" methods and points the way toward principled, non-asymptotic
optimality in queueing control.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper studies the loss landscape of regularized deep matrix factorization (DMF), identifying critical points and their properties to explain gradient-based convergence to local minimizers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of understanding in the optimization foundations of DMF, despite its broad applications.

Method: Provides closed-form expressions for critical points, analyzes their properties (local/global minimizers, saddle points), and validates with numerical experiments.

Result: Establishes conditions for critical points' properties and explains gradient-based convergence behavior.

Conclusion: The study fills a gap in DMF optimization theory, offering insights and empirical validation for practical applications.

Abstract: Despite its wide range of applications across various domains, the
optimization foundations of deep matrix factorization (DMF) remain largely
open. In this work, we aim to fill this gap by conducting a comprehensive study
of the loss landscape of the regularized DMF problem. Toward this goal, we
first provide a closed-form expression of all critical points. Building on
this, we establish precise conditions under which a critical point is a local
minimizer, a global minimizer, a strict saddle point, or a non-strict saddle
point. Leveraging these results, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition
under which each critical point is either a local minimizer or a strict saddle
point. This provides insights into why gradient-based methods almost always
converge to a local minimizer of the regularized DMF problem. Finally, we
conduct numerical experiments to visualize its loss landscape under different

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of stochastic and finite-sum convex
optimization problems with deterministic constraints. Existing methods
typically aim to find an $\epsilon$-$expectedly\ feasible\ stochastic\ optimal$
solution, in which the expected constraint violation and expected optimality
gap are both within a prescribed tolerance $\epsilon$. However, in many
practical applications, constraints must be nearly satisfied with certainty,
rendering such solutions potentially unsuitable due to the risk of substantial
violations. To address this issue, we propose stochastic first-order methods
for finding an $\epsilon$-$surely\ feasible\ stochastic\ optimal$
($\epsilon$-SFSO) solution, where the constraint violation is deterministically
bounded by $\epsilon$ and the expected optimality gap is at most $\epsilon$.
Our methods apply an accelerated stochastic gradient (ASG) scheme or a modified
variance-reduced ASG scheme $only\ once$ to a sequence of quadratic penalty
subproblems with appropriately chosen penalty parameters. We establish
first-order oracle complexity bounds for the proposed methods in computing an
$\epsilon$-SFSO solution. As a byproduct, we also derive first-order oracle
complexity results for sample average approximation method in computing an
$\epsilon$-SFSO solution of the stochastic optimization problem using our
proposed methods to solve the sample average problem.

### [183] [PSALM-V: Automating Symbolic Planning in Interactive Visual Environments with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20097)
*Wang Bill Zhu,Miaosen Chai,Ishika Singh,Robin Jia,Jesse Thomason*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PSALM-V is a neuro-symbolic system that autonomously learns symbolic action semantics in visual environments, improving plan success rates and efficiency without expert input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on unrealistic assumptions or text-based domains, limiting their applicability in real-world visual and partially observed settings.

Method: PSALM-V uses LLMs to generate heuristic plans and candidate semantics, dynamically infers PDDL problem files, and refines beliefs iteratively through execution outcomes.

Result: PSALM-V boosts plan success rates from 37% to 74% in ALFRED and improves efficiency in 2D game environments and real-world robot tasks.

Conclusion: PSALM-V demonstrates robust performance in inducing symbolic semantics and planning in complex, partially observed visual environments.

Abstract: We propose PSALM-V, the first autonomous neuro-symbolic learning system able
to induce symbolic action semantics (i.e., pre- and post-conditions) in visual
environments through interaction. PSALM-V bootstraps reliable symbolic planning
without expert action definitions, using LLMs to generate heuristic plans and
candidate symbolic semantics. Previous work has explored using large language
models to generate action semantics for Planning Domain Definition Language
(PDDL)-based symbolic planners. However, these approaches have primarily
focused on text-based domains or relied on unrealistic assumptions, such as
access to a predefined problem file, full observability, or explicit error
messages. By contrast, PSALM-V dynamically infers PDDL problem files and domain
action semantics by analyzing execution outcomes and synthesizing possible
error explanations. The system iteratively generates and executes plans while
maintaining a tree-structured belief over possible action semantics for each
action, iteratively refining these beliefs until a goal state is reached.
Simulated experiments of task completion in ALFRED demonstrate that PSALM-V
increases the plan success rate from 37% (Claude-3.7) to 74% in partially
observed setups. Results on two 2D game environments, RTFM and Overcooked-AI,
show that PSALM-V improves step efficiency and succeeds in domain induction in
multi-agent settings. PSALM-V correctly induces PDDL pre- and post-conditions
for real-world robot BlocksWorld tasks, despite low-level manipulation failures
from the robot.

*Ruben Janssens,Jens De Bock,Sofie Labat,Eva Verhelst,Veronique Hoste,Tony Belpaeme*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper evaluates machine learning models for detecting miscommunication in human-robot dialogue, finding limited success due to users not clearly signaling errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve robot dialogue systems by understanding and detecting miscommunication, a critical factor for user trust and engagement.

Method: Used a multi-modal dataset of 240 human-robot conversations with induced errors, assessing state-of-the-art computer vision models and human raters.

Result: Models performed barely above random chance in detecting miscommunication, similar to human raters, due to users not clearly signaling errors.

Conclusion: The study highlights a fundamental limitation in detecting robot miscommunication and suggests designing conversations to elicit clearer feedback.

Abstract: Detecting miscommunication in human-robot interaction is a critical function
for maintaining user engagement and trust. While humans effortlessly detect
communication errors in conversations through both verbal and non-verbal cues,
robots face significant challenges in interpreting non-verbal feedback, despite
advances in computer vision for recognizing affective expressions. This
research evaluates the effectiveness of machine learning models in detecting
miscommunications in robot dialogue. Using a multi-modal dataset of 240
human-robot conversations, where four distinct types of conversational failures
were systematically introduced, we assess the performance of state-of-the-art
computer vision models. After each conversational turn, users provided feedback
on whether they perceived an error, enabling an analysis of the models' ability
to accurately detect robot mistakes. Despite using state-of-the-art models, the
performance barely exceeds random chance in identifying miscommunication, while
on a dataset with more expressive emotional content, they successfully
identified confused states. To explore the underlying cause, we asked human
raters to do the same. They could also only identify around half of the induced
miscommunications, similarly to our model. These results uncover a fundamental
limitation in identifying robot miscommunications in dialogue: even when users
perceive the induced miscommunication as such, they often do not communicate
this to their robotic conversation partner. This knowledge can shape
expectations of the performance of computer vision models and can help
researchers to design better human-robot conversations by deliberately
eliciting feedback where needed.

*Eric C. Joyce,Qianwen Zhao,Nathaniel Burgdorfer,Long Wang,Philippos Mordohai*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A method for training deep networks to predict grasp success based on pose estimation uncertainty, improving robotic grasping reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address overconfidence in deep object pose estimators and connect uncertainty quantification to robotic grasping to avoid task failure.

Method: Train lightweight deep networks using data from real-image pose estimation and simulated grasping, leveraging joint training on diverse objects.

Result: Networks trained on diverse objects jointly improve grasp success prediction, indicating shared learning benefits.

Conclusion: Joint training on varied objects enhances grasp prediction, linking pose estimation uncertainty to practical robotic grasping outcomes.

Abstract: Deep object pose estimators are notoriously overconfident. A grasping agent
that both estimates the 6-DoF pose of a target object and predicts the
uncertainty of its own estimate could avoid task failure by choosing not to act
under high uncertainty. Even though object pose estimation improves and
uncertainty quantification research continues to make strides, few studies have
connected them to the downstream task of robotic grasping. We propose a method
for training lightweight, deep networks to predict whether a grasp guided by an
image-based pose estimate will succeed before that grasp is attempted. We
generate training data for our networks via object pose estimation on real
images and simulated grasping. We also find that, despite high object
variability in grasping trials, networks benefit from training on all objects
jointly, suggesting that a diverse variety of objects can nevertheless
contribute to the same goal.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hierarchical RL framework for quadruped locomotion improves performance on challenging terrains by using a high-level policy to guide a low-level policy without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance quadruped locomotion over difficult terrains by leveraging hierarchical reinforcement learning for better goal selection and efficiency.

Method: A two-layer hierarchy: high-level policy (HLP) selects goals for a low-level policy (LLP), trained with an on-policy actor-critic RL algorithm. HLP optimizes online using the LLP's value function.

Result: Outperforms end-to-end RL with higher rewards, fewer collisions, and better generalization to unseen terrains.

Conclusion: The hierarchical framework is effective for robust quadruped locomotion, especially in challenging and unseen terrains.

Abstract: We propose a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for
quadruped locomotion over challenging terrain. Our approach incorporates a
two-layer hierarchy in which a high-level policy (HLP) selects optimal goals
for a low-level policy (LLP). The LLP is trained using an on-policy
actor-critic RL algorithm and is given footstep placements as goals. We propose
an HLP that does not require any additional training or environment samples and
instead operates via an online optimization process over the learned value
function of the LLP. We demonstrate the benefits of this framework by comparing
it with an end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) approach. We observe
improvements in its ability to achieve higher rewards with fewer collisions
across an array of different terrains, including terrains more difficult than
any encountered during training.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SceneSense, a diffusion model, enhances robotic exploration by improving 3D occupancy maps with real-time probabilistic fusion, leading to better map quality and traversability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve robotic exploration by enhancing the quality and accuracy of occupancy maps using generative modeling.

Method: Introduces SceneSense, a diffusion model for predicting 3D occupancy maps from partial observations, and integrates it into a robotic system for real-time map enhancement.

Result: Significant improvements in map quality (24.44% FID near the robot, 75.59% at range) and exploration robustness when integrated with an off-the-shelf planner.

Conclusion: SceneSense-enhanced maps outperform direct sensor measurements, providing more consistent exploration results in diverse environments.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for enhancing robotic exploration by using
generative occupancy mapping. We introduce SceneSense, a diffusion model
designed and trained for predicting 3D occupancy maps given partial
observations. Our proposed approach probabilistically fuses these predictions
into a running occupancy map in real-time, resulting in significant
improvements in map quality and traversability. We implement SceneSense onboard
a quadruped robot and validate its performance with real-world experiments to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the model. In these experiments, we show that
occupancy maps enhanced with SceneSense predictions better represent our fully
observed ground truth data (24.44% FID improvement around the robot and 75.59%
improvement at range). We additionally show that integrating
SceneSense-enhanced maps into our robotic exploration stack as a "drop-in" map
improvement, utilizing an existing off-the-shelf planner, results in
improvements in robustness and traversability time. Finally we show results of
full exploration evaluations with our proposed system in two dissimilar
environments and find that locally enhanced maps provide more consistent
exploration results than maps constructed only from direct sensor measurements.

*Zhonghao Shi,Enyu Zhao,Nathaniel Dennler,Jingzhen Wang,Xinyang Xu,Kaleen Shrestha,Mengxue Fu,Daniel Seita,Maja Matarić*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HRIBench is introduced as a VQA benchmark to evaluate VLMs for human perception in HRI, revealing performance-latency trade-offs and gaps in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time human perception is vital for HRI, but VLMs face high latency issues, limiting their practical use.

Method: HRIBench evaluates VLMs across five HRI-critical domains using 1000 curated VQA questions from real-world and public datasets.

Result: Current VLMs lack core perceptual capabilities and fail to meet real-time latency requirements.

Conclusion: Future research should focus on smaller, low-latency VLMs with better human perception, with HRIBench as a benchmark.

Abstract: Real-time human perception is crucial for effective human-robot interaction
(HRI). Large vision-language models (VLMs) offer promising generalizable
perceptual capabilities but often suffer from high latency, which negatively
impacts user experience and limits VLM applicability in real-world scenarios.
To systematically study VLM capabilities in human perception for HRI and
performance-latency trade-offs, we introduce HRIBench, a visual
question-answering (VQA) benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs across a diverse
set of human perceptual tasks critical for HRI. HRIBench covers five key
domains: (1) non-verbal cue understanding, (2) verbal instruction
understanding, (3) human-robot object relationship understanding, (4) social
navigation, and (5) person identification. To construct HRIBench, we collected
data from real-world HRI environments to curate questions for non-verbal cue
understanding, and leveraged publicly available datasets for the remaining four
domains. We curated 200 VQA questions for each domain, resulting in a total of
1000 questions for HRIBench. We then conducted a comprehensive evaluation of
both state-of-the-art closed-source and open-source VLMs (N=11) on HRIBench.
Our results show that, despite their generalizability, current VLMs still
struggle with core perceptual capabilities essential for HRI. Moreover, none of
the models within our experiments demonstrated a satisfactory
performance-latency trade-off suitable for real-time deployment, underscoring
the need for future research on developing smaller, low-latency VLMs with
improved human perception capabilities. HRIBench and our results can be found

TL;DR: A neural network method for precise robotic arm trajectory generation and customization, tested in cognitive robotics with the NICO robot.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance robotic precision and predictability in human-robot interactions by generating customizable trajectories.

Method: Uses neural networks for forward kinematics and joint angle generation, trained on artificial datasets of start/end poses. Evaluates movement quality via angular velocities.

Result: Successfully generates precise, adaptable trajectories with high accuracy and shape customization.

Conclusion: The approach is broadly applicable for precise robotic trajectory generation in various settings.

Abstract: We introduce a neural network approach for generating and customizing the
trajectory of a robotic arm, that guarantees precision and repeatability. To
highlight the potential of this novel method, we describe the design and
implementation of the technique and show its application in an experimental
setting of cognitive robotics. In this scenario, the NICO robot was
characterized by the ability to point to specific points in space with precise
linear movements, increasing the predictability of the robotic action during
its interaction with humans. To achieve this goal, the neural network computes
the forward kinematics of the robot arm. By integrating it with a generator of
joint angles, another neural network was developed and trained on an artificial
dataset created from suitable start and end poses of the robotic arm. Through
the computation of angular velocities, the robot was characterized by its
ability to perform the movement, and the quality of its action was evaluated in
terms of shape and accuracy. Thanks to its broad applicability, our approach
successfully generates precise trajectories that could be customized in their
shape and adapted to different settings.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CARMA is a system for situational grounding in human-robot group interactions, enabling consistent tracking of actors, objects, and actions through grounded triplets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective collaboration in group settings requires situational awareness and consistent representation of entities and interactions.

Method: CARMA uniquely identifies physical instances and organizes them into actor-object-action triplets, validated through experiments in collaborative pouring, handovers, and sorting.

Result: The system reliably generates accurate triplets, supporting role distinction, multi-actor awareness, and consistent instance identification.

Conclusion: CARMA provides a robust foundation for spatiotemporal reasoning and decision-making in collaborative human-robot interactions.

Abstract: We introduce CARMA, a system for situational grounding in human-robot group
interactions. Effective collaboration in such group settings requires
situational awareness based on a consistent representation of present persons
and objects coupled with an episodic abstraction of events regarding actors and
manipulated objects. This calls for a clear and consistent assignment of
instances, ensuring that robots correctly recognize and track actors, objects,
and their interactions over time. To achieve this, CARMA uniquely identifies
physical instances of such entities in the real world and organizes them into
grounded triplets of actors, objects, and actions.
  To validate our approach, we conducted three experiments, where multiple
humans and a robot interact: collaborative pouring, handovers, and sorting.
These scenarios allow the assessment of the system's capabilities as to role
distinction, multi-actor awareness, and consistent instance identification. Our
experiments demonstrate that the system can reliably generate accurate
actor-action-object triplets, providing a structured and robust foundation for
applications requiring spatiotemporal reasoning and situated decision-making in
collaborative settings.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DemoDiffusion enables robots to perform tasks by imitating a single human demo, using kinematic retargeting and a diffusion policy for adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify robot task learning by leveraging human demonstrations without requiring paired data or reinforcement learning.

Method: Combines kinematic retargeting of human hand motion with a pre-trained diffusion policy to refine trajectories.

Result: Outperforms base policies and retargeted trajectories, succeeding where generalist policies fail.

Conclusion: DemoDiffusion offers a scalable, robust method for robot task adaptation with minimal manual effort.

Abstract: We propose DemoDiffusion, a simple and scalable method for enabling robots to
perform manipulation tasks in natural environments by imitating a single human
demonstration. Our approach is based on two key insights. First, the hand
motion in a human demonstration provides a useful prior for the robot's
end-effector trajectory, which we can convert into a rough open-loop robot
motion trajectory via kinematic retargeting. Second, while this retargeted
motion captures the overall structure of the task, it may not align well with
plausible robot actions in-context. To address this, we leverage a pre-trained
generalist diffusion policy to modify the trajectory, ensuring it both follows
the human motion and remains within the distribution of plausible robot
actions. Our approach avoids the need for online reinforcement learning or
paired human-robot data, enabling robust adaptation to new tasks and scenes
with minimal manual effort. Experiments in both simulation and real-world
settings show that DemoDiffusion outperforms both the base policy and the
retargeted trajectory, enabling the robot to succeed even on tasks where the
pre-trained generalist policy fails entirely. Project page:

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces X-SiT, an interpretable neural network for medical imaging, focusing on cortical surface data to improve visualization and diagnosis of neurological disorders like Alzheimer's and frontotemporal dementia.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of interpreting 3D volumetric medical data and the need for more accessible representations of brain anatomy drive the development of interpretable models for clinical decision-making.

Method: The authors propose the eXplainable Surface Vision Transformer (X-SiT), featuring a prototypical surface patch decoder for classifying surface patch embeddings and incorporating case-based reasoning with cortical prototypes.

Result: X-SiT achieves state-of-the-art performance in detecting Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia, providing interpretable prototypes that align with disease patterns and highlight classification errors.

Conclusion: X-SiT advances interpretable AI for medical imaging, offering both high performance and human-understandable insights for neurological disorder diagnosis.

Abstract: Interpretable models are crucial for supporting clinical decision-making,
driving advances in their development and application for medical images.
However, the nature of 3D volumetric data makes it inherently challenging to
visualize and interpret intricate and complex structures like the cerebral
cortex. Cortical surface renderings, on the other hand, provide a more
accessible and understandable 3D representation of brain anatomy, facilitating
visualization and interactive exploration. Motivated by this advantage and the
widespread use of surface data for studying neurological disorders, we present
the eXplainable Surface Vision Transformer (X-SiT). This is the first
inherently interpretable neural network that offers human-understandable
predictions based on interpretable cortical features. As part of X-SiT, we
introduce a prototypical surface patch decoder for classifying surface patch
embeddings, incorporating case-based reasoning with spatially corresponding
cortical prototypes. The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in
detecting Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia while additionally
providing informative prototypes that align with known disease patterns and
reveal classification errors.

TL;DR: DreamAnywhere is a modular system for fast 3D scene generation from text, addressing limitations like front-facing views and low fidelity by synthesizing 360° panoramas, decomposing scenes, and enabling immersive navigation and editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-3D methods produce front-facing, low-fidelity scenes limited to indoor/outdoor settings. DreamAnywhere aims to overcome these issues for versatile, high-quality scene generation.

Method: DreamAnywhere synthesizes 360° panoramas, decomposes them into background/objects, uses hybrid inpainting for 3D representation, and lifts object masks to detailed 3D placements. Supports editing and navigation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art in coherence and image quality, validated by user preference. Ideal for rapid prototyping and low-budget movie production.

Conclusion: DreamAnywhere offers a robust, customizable solution for high-quality 3D scene generation, enabling efficient iteration and practical applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-3D scene generation have demonstrated significant
potential to transform content creation across multiple industries. Although
the research community has made impressive progress in addressing the
challenges of this complex task, existing methods often generate environments
that are only front-facing, lack visual fidelity, exhibit limited scene
understanding, and are typically fine-tuned for either indoor or outdoor
settings. In this work, we address these issues and propose DreamAnywhere, a
modular system for the fast generation and prototyping of 3D scenes. Our system
synthesizes a 360{\deg} panoramic image from text, decomposes it into
background and objects, constructs a complete 3D representation through hybrid
inpainting, and lifts object masks to detailed 3D objects that are placed in
the virtual environment. DreamAnywhere supports immersive navigation and
intuitive object-level editing, making it ideal for scene exploration, visual
mock-ups, and rapid prototyping -- all with minimal manual modeling. These
features make our system particularly suitable for low-budget movie production,
enabling quick iteration on scene layout and visual tone without the overhead
of traditional 3D workflows. Our modular pipeline is highly customizable as it
allows components to be replaced independently. Compared to current
state-of-the-art text and image-based 3D scene generation approaches,
DreamAnywhere shows significant improvements in coherence in novel view
synthesis and achieves competitive image quality, demonstrating its
effectiveness across diverse and challenging scenarios. A comprehensive user
study demonstrates a clear preference for our method over existing approaches,
validating both its technical robustness and practical usefulness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D editing relies on text prompts or masks, which can be limiting. EditP23 aims to provide intuitive, mask-free editing by leveraging image pairs for guidance.

Method: EditP23 conditions on an original and edited image pair to guide an edit-aware flow in a pre-trained multi-view diffusion model, propagating edits coherently across views without optimization.

Result: The method achieves high fidelity across various object categories and editing scenarios, preserving the original object's identity in structure and appearance.

Conclusion: EditP23 offers an efficient, mask-free solution for 3D editing, demonstrating effectiveness and versatility in real-world applications.

Abstract: We present EditP23, a method for mask-free 3D editing that propagates 2D
image edits to multi-view representations in a 3D-consistent manner. In
contrast to traditional approaches that rely on text-based prompting or
explicit spatial masks, EditP23 enables intuitive edits by conditioning on a
pair of images: an original view and its user-edited counterpart. These image
prompts are used to guide an edit-aware flow in the latent space of a
pre-trained multi-view diffusion model, allowing the edit to be coherently
propagated across views. Our method operates in a feed-forward manner, without
optimization, and preserves the identity of the original object, in both
structure and appearance. We demonstrate its effectiveness across a range of
object categories and editing scenarios, achieving high fidelity to the source
while requiring no manual masks.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using speaker embeddings for identity reassignment in speaker tracking to address discontinuous spatial trajectories caused by intermittent and moving speakers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speaker tracking often fails with intermittent and moving speakers due to discontinuous spatial trajectories.

Method: The method involves post-tracking identity reassignment using speaker embeddings, leveraging trajectory data and multichannel audio. Beamforming enhances signals for embedding extraction.

Result: The proposed method improves identity assignment performance in neural and standard tracking systems, especially when speakers change positions during inactivity.

Conclusion: Speaker embedding-based identity reassignment effectively addresses tracking challenges for intermittent and moving speakers, with beamforming and input duration playing key roles.

Abstract: Speaker tracking methods often rely on spatial observations to assign
coherent track identities over time. This raises limits in scenarios with
intermittent and moving speakers, i.e., speakers that may change position when
they are inactive, thus leading to discontinuous spatial trajectories. This
paper proposes to investigate the use of speaker embeddings, in a simple
solution to this issue. We propose to perform identity reassignment
post-tracking, using speaker embeddings. We leverage trajectory-related
information provided by an initial tracking step and multichannel audio signal.
Beamforming is used to enhance the signal towards the speakers' positions in
order to compute speaker embeddings. These are then used to assign new track
identities based on an enrollment pool. We evaluate the performance of the
proposed speaker embedding-based identity reassignment method on a dataset
where speakers change position during inactivity periods. Results show that it
consistently improves the identity assignment performance of neural and
standard tracking systems. In particular, we study the impact of beamforming
and input duration for embedding extraction.

Result: Achieves 41.01% Macro-F1 and 0.5928 CCC, ranking fourth overall, with 0.6941 CCC in valence prediction.

Conclusion: MATER effectively handles natural speech complexities and improves robustness in emotion recognition.

Abstract: This paper presents our contributions to the Speech Emotion Recognition in
Naturalistic Conditions (SERNC) Challenge, where we address categorical emotion
recognition and emotional attribute prediction. To handle the complexities of
natural speech, including intra- and inter-subject variability, we propose
Multi-level Acoustic-Textual Emotion Representation (MATER), a novel
hierarchical framework that integrates acoustic and textual features at the
word, utterance, and embedding levels. By fusing low-level lexical and acoustic
cues with high-level contextualized representations, MATER effectively captures
both fine-grained prosodic variations and semantic nuances. Additionally, we
introduce an uncertainty-aware ensemble strategy to mitigate annotator
inconsistencies, improving robustness in ambiguous emotional expressions. MATER
ranks fourth in both tasks with a Macro-F1 of 41.01% and an average CCC of
0.5928, securing second place in valence prediction with an impressive CCC of

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Quantum neural networks (QNNs) were used for propensity score estimation to address selection bias in comparing survival outcomes between surgical techniques in colorectal carcinoma patients. QNNs outperformed classical methods in small samples, with noise-aware strategies enhancing performance. No significant survival differences were found post-adjustment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address selection bias in comparing survival outcomes between laparoscopic and open surgical techniques using QNNs for propensity score estimation.

Method: Developed QNN-based propensity score models with a linear ZFeatureMap, SummedPaulis operator, and CMA-ES optimization. Variance regularization was used to mitigate quantum noise. Simulations included exact, sampling, and noisy hardware conditions.

Result: QNNs outperformed classical logistic regression and gradient boosted machines in small samples (AUC up to 0.750). Propensity score matching and weighting achieved covariate balance. No significant survival differences were found post-adjustment.

Conclusion: QNNs, enhanced by CMA-ES and noise-aware strategies, show promise for improving causal inference in biomedical research, especially for small-sample, high-dimensional datasets.

Abstract: This study investigates the application of quantum neural networks (QNNs) for
propensity score estimation to address selection bias in comparing survival
outcomes between laparoscopic and open surgical techniques in a cohort of 1177
colorectal carcinoma patients treated at University Hospital Ostrava
(2001-2009). Using a dataset with 77 variables, including patient demographics
and tumor characteristics, we developed QNN-based propensity score models
focusing on four key covariates (Age, Sex, Stage, BMI). The QNN architecture
employed a linear ZFeatureMap for data encoding, a SummedPaulis operator for
predictions, and the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES)
for robust, gradient-free optimization in noisy quantum environments. Variance
regularization was integrated to mitigate quantum measurement noise, with
simulations conducted under exact, sampling (1024 shots), and noisy hardware
(FakeManhattanV2) conditions. QNNs, particularly with simulated hardware noise,
outperformed classical logistic regression and gradient boosted machines in
small samples (AUC up to 0.750 for n=100), with noise modeling enhancing
predictive stability. Propensity score matching and weighting, optimized via
genetic matching and matching weights, achieved covariate balance with
standardized mean differences of 0.0849 and 0.0869, respectively. Survival
analyses using Kaplan-Meier estimation, Cox proportional hazards, and Aalen
additive regression revealed no significant survival differences
post-adjustment (p-values 0.287-0.851), indicating confounding bias in
unadjusted outcomes. These results highlight QNNs' potential, enhanced by
CMA-ES and noise-aware strategies, to improve causal inference in biomedical
research, particularly for small-sample, high-dimensional datasets.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The study evaluates design choices in quantum and hybrid neural networks for satellite image classification, finding data encoding most impactful for hybrid models and measurement protocols critical for purely quantum models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how different design choices in quantum and hybrid convolutional neural networks affect performance in satellite image classification.

Method: Systematic evaluation of ~500 model configurations, focusing on data encoding, variational ansätze, and measurement strategies.

Result: Data encoding is the dominant factor in hybrid models (30% accuracy variation), while measurement protocols significantly impact purely quantum models (30% variation).

Conclusion: Design choices in quantum and hybrid networks have distinct performance impacts, with data encoding and measurement protocols being key for hybrid and quantum models, respectively.

Abstract: This study investigates the design choices of parameterized quantum circuits
(PQCs) within quantum and hybrid convolutional neural network (HQNN and QCNN)
architectures, applied to the task of satellite image classification using the
EuroSAT dataset. We systematically evaluate the performance implications of
data encoding techniques, variational ans\"atze, and measurement in approx. 500
distinct model configurations. Our analysis reveals a clear hierarchy of
influence on model performance. For hybrid architectures, which were
benchmarked against their direct classical equivalents (e.g. the same
architecture with the PQCs removed), the data encoding strategy is the dominant
factor, with validation accuracy varying over 30% for distinct embeddings. In
contrast, the selection of variational ans\"atze and measurement basis had a
comparatively marginal effect, with validation accuracy variations remaining
below 5%. For purely quantum models, restricted to amplitude encoding,
performance was most dependent on the measurement protocol and the
data-to-amplitude mapping. The measurement strategy varied the validation
accuracy by up to 30% and the encoding mapping by around 8 percentage points.

*Maeve Hutchinson,Radu Jianu,Aidan Slingsby,Jo Wood,Pranava Madhyastha*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: A new dataset and methodology for probing visualization design rationale using real-world student-created visualization notebooks and LLM-generated question-answer-rationale triples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets focus on decoding visualizations rather than understanding their encoding, often using artificial setups. This work aims to capture real-world design rationales.

Method: Leverages student-created visualization notebooks with design exposition, uses LLMs to generate and categorize question-answer-rationale triples, and validates/curates the dataset.

Result: A curated dataset capturing visualization design choices and rationales from real-world student work.

Conclusion: The approach provides a novel way to study visualization design rationale using natural language and real-world data.

Abstract: Prior natural language datasets for data visualization have focused on tasks
such as visualization literacy assessment, insight generation, and
visualization generation from natural language instructions. These studies
often rely on controlled setups with purpose-built visualizations and
artificially constructed questions. As a result, they tend to prioritize the
interpretation of visualizations, focusing on decoding visualizations rather
than understanding their encoding. In this paper, we present a new dataset and
methodology for probing visualization design rationale through natural
language. We leverage a unique source of real-world visualizations and natural
language narratives: literate visualization notebooks created by students as
part of a data visualization course. These notebooks combine visual artifacts
with design exposition, in which students make explicit the rationale behind
their design decisions. We also use large language models (LLMs) to generate
and categorize question-answer-rationale triples from the narratives and
articulations in the notebooks. We then carefully validate the triples and
curate a dataset that captures and distills the visualization design choices
and corresponding rationales of the students.

*Runlong Ye,Zeling Zhang,Boushra Almazroua,Michael Liut*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: CopilotLens introduces an interactive framework to make AI-powered code assistants more transparent by explaining their rationale, enhancing developer trust and understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI code assistants lack transparency, making it hard for developers to evaluate suggestions and build trust.

Method: CopilotLens adds an explanation layer with a dynamic two-level interface to reveal the AI's thought process and contextual influences.

Result: The framework transforms code completion into an explainable event, improving comprehension and collaboration.

Conclusion: CopilotLens provides a model for future code assistants that prioritize clarity and transparency over speed.

Abstract: AI-powered code assistants are widely used to generate code completions,
significantly boosting developer productivity. However, these tools typically
present suggestions without explaining their rationale, leaving their
decision-making process inscrutable. This opacity hinders developers' ability
to critically evaluate the output, form accurate mental models, and build
calibrated trust in the system. To address this, we introduce CopilotLens, a
novel interactive framework that reframes code completion from a simple
suggestion into a transparent, explainable event. CopilotLens operates as an
explanation layer that reveals the AI agent's "thought process" through a
dynamic two-level interface, surfacing everything from its reconstructed
high-level plans to the specific codebase context influencing the code. This
paper presents the design and rationale of CopilotLens, offering a concrete
framework for building future agentic code assistants that prioritize clarity
of reasoning over speed of suggestion, thereby fostering deeper comprehension
and more robust human-AI collaboration.

*Xuefei Hou,Xizhao Tan*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Insight Recall,' a paradigm using context-triggered retrieval of past insights to support Self-Regulated Learning (SRL), implemented in the prototype system 'Irec.'


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tools like Spaced Repetition Systems and Personal Knowledge Management tools fail to adequately support metacognitive reflection in learning.

Method: The 'Insight Recall' paradigm is formalized using the Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention framework, implemented in 'Irec,' which uses a dynamic knowledge graph and hybrid retrieval engine with LLM-based filtering.

Result: The paper presents a theoretical framework and a prototype system ('Irec') that enhances metacognition and self-regulation in learning.

Conclusion: The work contributes a novel framework and system for designing intelligent learning tools that improve SRL through metacognitive scaffolding.

Abstract: The core challenge in learning has shifted from knowledge acquisition to
effective Self-Regulated Learning (SRL): planning, monitoring, and reflecting
on one's learning. Existing digital tools, however, inadequately support
metacognitive reflection. Spaced Repetition Systems (SRS) use de-contextualized
review, overlooking the role of context, while Personal Knowledge Management
(PKM) tools require high manual maintenance.
  To address these challenges, this paper introduces "Insight Recall," a novel
paradigm that conceptualizes the context-triggered retrieval of personal past
insights as a metacognitive scaffold to promote SRL. We formalize this paradigm
using the Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention (JITAI) framework and implement a
prototype system, Irec, to demonstrate its feasibility. At its core, Irec uses
a dynamic knowledge graph of the user's learning history. When a user faces a
new problem, a hybrid retrieval engine recalls relevant personal "insights."
Subsequently, a large language model (LLM) performs a deep similarity
assessment to filter and present the most relevant scaffold in a just-in-time
manner. To reduce cognitive load, Irec features a human-in-the-loop pipeline
for LLM-based knowledge graph construction. We also propose an optional "Guided
Inquiry" module, where users can engage in a Socratic dialogue with an expert
LLM, using the current problem and recalled insights as context. The
contribution of this paper is a solid theoretical framework and a usable system
platform for designing next-generation intelligent learning systems that
enhance metacognition and self-regulation.

*Momin N. Siddiqui,Roy Pea,Hari Subramonyam*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: AI writing tools can enhance student agency and knowledge transformation when designed purposefully, unlike generic chat-based LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about ChatGPT's impact on student writing, such as reduced agency and superficial engagement, prompted the study of better AI support tools.

Method: A randomized control trial with 90 undergraduates compared chat-based LLMs, integrated AI writing tools, and a standard interface.

Result: Students using integrated AI tools showed greater agency and deeper knowledge transformation than those using chat-based LLMs or no AI.

Conclusion: Purposefully designed AI writing support can improve student engagement and ownership of writing.

Abstract: The ubiquity of technologies like ChatGPT has raised concerns about their
impact on student writing, particularly regarding reduced learner agency and
superficial engagement with content. While standalone chat-based LLMs often
produce suboptimal writing outcomes, evidence suggests that purposefully
designed AI writing support tools can enhance the writing process. This paper
investigates how different AI support approaches affect writers' sense of
agency and depth of knowledge transformation. Through a randomized control
trial with 90 undergraduate students, we compare three conditions: (1) a
chat-based LLM writing assistant, (2) an integrated AI writing tool to support
diverse subprocesses, and (3) a standard writing interface (control). Our
findings demonstrate that, among AI-supported conditions, students using the
integrated AI writing tool exhibited greater agency over their writing process
and engaged in deeper knowledge transformation overall. These results suggest
that thoughtfully designed AI writing support targeting specific aspects of the
writing process can help students maintain ownership of their work while
facilitating improved engagement with content.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a secure, intelligent energy transaction system for decentralized US energy markets using blockchain and AI to address security, fraud detection, and reliability challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decentralized energy markets face safety and authenticity challenges in peer-to-peer trading, necessitating a robust solution.

Method: The study integrates blockchain and AI layers, analyzing 1.2M anonymized P2P energy transaction records with machine learning models for fraud detection.

Result: The system leverages blockchain for security and AI for market intelligence, improving transaction reliability and fraud identification.

Conclusion: The combined blockchain-AI approach effectively addresses key challenges in decentralized energy markets, enhancing security and efficiency.

Abstract: Peer-to-peer trading and the move to decentralized grids have reshaped the
energy markets in the United States. Notwithstanding, such developments lead to
new challenges, mainly regarding the safety and authenticity of energy trade.
This study aimed to develop and build a secure, intelligent, and efficient
energy transaction system for the decentralized US energy market. This research
interlinks the technological prowess of blockchain and artificial intelligence
(AI) in a novel way to solve long-standing challenges in the distributed energy
market, specifically those of security, fraudulent behavior detection, and
market reliability. The dataset for this research is comprised of more than 1.2
million anonymized energy transaction records from a simulated peer-to-peer
(P2P) energy exchange network emulating real-life blockchain-based American
microgrids, including those tested by LO3 Energy and Grid+ Labs. Each record
contains detailed fields of transaction identifier, timestamp, energy volume
(kWh), transaction type (buy/sell), unit price, prosumer/consumer identifier
(hashed for privacy), smart meter readings, geolocation regions, and settlement
confirmation status. The dataset also includes system-calculated behavior
metrics of transaction rate, variability of energy production, and historical
pricing patterns. The system architecture proposed involves the integration of
two layers, namely a blockchain layer and artificial intelligence (AI) layer,
each playing a unique but complementary function in energy transaction securing
and market intelligence improvement. The machine learning models used in this
research were specifically chosen for their established high performance in
classification tasks, specifically in the identification of energy transaction
fraud in decentralized markets.

*Yining Pang,Chenghan Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A GAN-based adversarial attack method is proposed to exploit vulnerabilities in insurance fraud detection systems, achieving a 99% success rate in bypassing detection by subtly modifying real records.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The absence of standardized defenses in fraud detection systems makes them susceptible to adversarial threats, necessitating research into their vulnerabilities.

Method: A GAN-based approach is used to generate adversarial examples that mimic legitimate claims, testing the robustness of fraud detection models.

Result: The attack achieves a 99% success rate, demonstrating the ease with which adversaries can bypass current detection systems.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the urgent need to improve the robustness of fraud detection models against adversarial attacks to ensure system reliability.

Abstract: Insurance fraud detection represents a pivotal advancement in modern
insurance service, providing intelligent and digitalized monitoring to enhance
management and prevent fraud. It is crucial for ensuring the security and
efficiency of insurance systems. Although AI and machine learning algorithms
have demonstrated strong performance in detecting fraudulent claims, the
absence of standardized defense mechanisms renders current systems vulnerable
to emerging adversarial threats. In this paper, we propose a GAN-based approach
to conduct adversarial attacks on fraud detection systems. Our results indicate
that an attacker, without knowledge of the training data or internal model
details, can generate fraudulent cases that are classified as legitimate with a
99\% attack success rate (ASR). By subtly modifying real insurance records and
claims, adversaries can significantly increase the fraud risk, potentially
bypassing compromised detection systems. These findings underscore the urgent
need to enhance the robustness of insurance fraud detection models against
adversarial manipulation, thereby ensuring the stability and reliability of
different insurance systems.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper critiques existing secure weight release schemes for lacking rigorous security foundations and introduces formal security definitions. It analyzes TaylorMLP, revealing vulnerabilities, and advocates for stricter security standards in future designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of rigorous security foundations in secure weight release schemes and provide formal definitions to evaluate their security.

Method: The authors formalize security definitions for weight release schemes and conduct a case study of TaylorMLP to test these definitions.

Result: The analysis exposes vulnerabilities in TaylorMLP, showing it fails to meet its security goals.

Conclusion: The paper calls for more rigorous security research in machine learning and provides a framework for evaluating future weight release schemes.

Abstract: Recent secure weight release schemes claim to enable open-source model
distribution while protecting model ownership and preventing misuse. However,
these approaches lack rigorous security foundations and provide only informal
security guarantees. Inspired by established works in cryptography, we
formalize the security of weight release schemes by introducing several
concrete security definitions. We then demonstrate our definition's utility
through a case study of TaylorMLP, a prominent secure weight release scheme.
Our analysis reveals vulnerabilities that allow parameter extraction thus
showing that TaylorMLP fails to achieve its informal security goals. We hope
this work will advocate for rigorous research at the intersection of machine
learning and security communities and provide a blueprint for how future weight
release schemes should be designed and evaluated.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Comparison of MLP, CNN, OCSVM, and LOF for intrusion detection shows OCSVM balances precision and recall best, offering robust detection for known and novel attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifying effective machine learning paradigms for intrusion detection to build generalizable security solutions.

Method: Controlled comparison of MLP, CNN, OCSVM, and LOF on the CICIDS2017 dataset for detecting known and novel attacks.

Result: Supervised MLP and CNN excel on known attacks but falter on novel ones; LOF has moderate accuracy and high recall for unknown threats; OCSVM balances precision and recall robustly.

Conclusion: OCSVM is the most balanced choice for IDS in dynamic environments, providing practical guidance for model selection.

Abstract: Identifying suitable machine learning paradigms for intrusion detection
remains critical for building effective and generalizable security solutions.
In this study, we present a controlled comparison of four representative models
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN),
One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) and Local Outlier Factor (LOF) - on
the CICIDS2017 dataset under two scenarios: detecting known attack types and
generalizing to previously unseen threats. Our results show that supervised MLP
and CNN achieve near-perfect accuracy on familiar attacks but suffer drastic
recall drops on novel attacks. Unsupervised LOF attains moderate overall
accuracy and high recall on unknown threats at the cost of elevated false
alarms, while boundary-based OCSVM balances precision and recall best,
demonstrating robust detection across both scenarios. These findings offer
practical guidance for selecting IDS models in dynamic network environments.

### [207] [Retrieval-Confused Generation is a Good Defender for Privacy Violation Attack of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19889)
*Wanli Peng,Xin Chen,Hang Fu,XinYu He,Xue Yiming,Juan Wen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A novel defense method, retrieval-confused generation (RCG), is proposed to efficiently and covertly counter privacy violation attacks (PVAs) on large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defense methods for PVAs in LLMs are costly, ineffective, or expose the defense strategy, prompting the need for a better solution.

Method: The RCG method involves paraphrasing prompts to rewrite attack queries, constructing a disturbed database, retrieving irrelevant data, and replacing original data to mislead attackers.

Result: Extensive experiments on two datasets and eight LLMs demonstrate the method's feasibility and superiority in defending against PVAs.

Conclusion: The RCG paradigm effectively defends against PVAs by confusing attackers with wrong personal attributes, offering a robust and covert solution.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made a profound impact
on our society and also raised new security concerns. Particularly, due to the
remarkable inference ability of LLMs, the privacy violation attack (PVA),
revealed by Staab et al., introduces serious personal privacy issues. Existing
defense methods mainly leverage LLMs to anonymize the input query, which
requires costly inference time and cannot gain satisfactory defense
performance. Moreover, directly rejecting the PVA query seems like an effective
defense method, while the defense method is exposed, promoting the evolution of
PVA. In this paper, we propose a novel defense paradigm based on
retrieval-confused generation (RCG) of LLMs, which can efficiently and covertly
defend the PVA. We first design a paraphrasing prompt to induce the LLM to
rewrite the "user comments" of the attack query to construct a disturbed
database. Then, we propose the most irrelevant retrieval strategy to retrieve
the desired user data from the disturbed database. Finally, the "data comments"
are replaced with the retrieved user data to form a defended query, leading to
responding to the adversary with some wrong personal attributes, i.e., the
attack fails. Extensive experiments are conducted on two datasets and eight
popular LLMs to comprehensively evaluate the feasibility and the superiority of
the proposed defense method.

*Isaac Marroqui Penalva,Enrique Tomás Martínez Beltrán,Manuel Gil Pérez,Alberto Huertas Celdrán*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: RepuNet, a decentralized reputation system, mitigates threats in Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) by dynamically evaluating node behavior and adjusting influence based on reputation scores, achieving high detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DFL solutions suffer from computational overhead, scalability issues, or limited adaptability due to rigid configurations or reliance on additional infrastructures like blockchain.

Method: RepuNet categorizes threats and evaluates node behavior using metrics like model similarity, parameter changes, message latency, and communication volume. It adjusts nodes' influence in aggregation based on reputation scores.

Result: RepuNet achieved F1 scores above 95% for MNIST and ~76% for CIFAR-10 under various attack scenarios, demonstrating effective threat detection and mitigation.

Conclusion: RepuNet is adaptable, robust, and practical for securing DFL environments against malicious behavior.

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) enables nodes to collaboratively train
models without a central server, introducing new vulnerabilities since each
node independently selects peers for model aggregation. Malicious nodes may
exploit this autonomy by sending corrupted models (model poisoning), delaying
model submissions (delay attack), or flooding the network with excessive
messages, negatively affecting system performance. Existing solutions often
depend on rigid configurations or additional infrastructures such as
blockchain, leading to computational overhead, scalability issues, or limited
adaptability. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes RepuNet, a
decentralized reputation system that categorizes threats in DFL and dynamically
evaluates node behavior using metrics like model similarity, parameter changes,
message latency, and communication volume. Nodes' influence in model
aggregation is adjusted based on their reputation scores. RepuNet was
integrated into the Nebula DFL platform and experimentally evaluated with MNIST
and CIFAR-10 datasets under non-IID distributions, using federations of up to
25 nodes in both fully connected and random topologies. Different attack
intensities, frequencies, and activation intervals were tested. Results
demonstrated that RepuNet effectively detects and mitigates malicious behavior,
achieving F1 scores above 95% for MNIST scenarios and approximately 76% for
CIFAR-10 cases. These outcomes highlight RepuNet's adaptability, robustness,
and practical potential for mitigating threats in decentralized federated
learning environments.

### [209] [Blameless Users in a Clean Room: Defining Copyright Protection for Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19881)
*Aloni Cohen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper revisits provable copyright protection for generative models, showing that near access-freeness (NAF) fails to prevent infringement and introduces a new framework, blameless copy protection, with clean-room copy protection as an instantiation. It also links differential privacy (DP) to copyright protection under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inadequacy of NAF in preventing copyright infringement and establish stronger technical and legal foundations for provable copyright protection.

Method: The authors critique NAF, introduce the blameless copy protection framework, and instantiate it with clean-room copy protection. They also formalize the relationship between DP and copyright protection.

Result: NAF is insufficient for preventing infringement, while clean-room copy protection offers a viable alternative. DP ensures clean-room copy protection under golden dataset conditions.

Conclusion: The paper provides stronger foundations for copyright protection in generative models, highlighting the limitations of NAF and the potential of clean-room copy protection and DP.

Abstract: Are there any conditions under which a generative model's outputs are
guaranteed not to infringe the copyrights of its training data? This is the
question of "provable copyright protection" first posed by Vyas, Kakade, and
Barak (ICML 2023). They define near access-freeness (NAF) and propose it as
sufficient for protection. This paper revisits the question and establishes new
foundations for provable copyright protection -- foundations that are firmer
both technically and legally. First, we show that NAF alone does not prevent
infringement. In fact, NAF models can enable verbatim copying, a blatant
failure of copy protection that we dub being tainted. Then, we introduce our
blameless copy protection framework for defining meaningful guarantees, and
instantiate it with clean-room copy protection. Clean-room copy protection
allows a user to control their risk of copying by behaving in a way that is
unlikely to copy in a counterfactual clean-room setting. Finally, we formalize
a common intuition about differential privacy and copyright by proving that DP
implies clean-room copy protection when the dataset is golden, a copyright
deduplication requirement.

TL;DR: DiffSem, a diffusion-based semantic communication framework, improves task performance and privacy in 6G networks by optimizing semantic reconstruction and introducing a new metric for attack evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient task-oriented semantic communication in 6G networks while addressing privacy concerns and the inadequacy of traditional image quality metrics for semantic divergence.

Method: Proposes DiffSem, a framework using diffusion mechanisms and self-referential label embedding to enhance semantic reconstruction and robustness against channel noise. Introduces a new metric for evaluating semantic fidelity in attacks.

Result: DiffSem improves classification accuracy by 10.03% on MNIST and maintains stable performance in dynamic channels. Shows discrepancy between traditional image quality metrics and semantic leakage.

Conclusion: DiffSem effectively balances task performance and privacy, offering a robust solution for semantic communication in 6G networks.

Abstract: Semantic communication has emerged as a promising neural network-based system
design for 6G networks. Task-oriented semantic communication is a novel
paradigm whose core goal is to efficiently complete specific tasks by
transmitting semantic information, optimizing communication efficiency and task
performance. The key challenge lies in preserving privacy while maintaining
task accuracy, as this scenario is susceptible to model inversion attacks. In
such attacks, adversaries can restore or even reconstruct input data by
analyzing and processing model outputs, owing to the neural network-based
nature of the systems. In addition, traditional systems use image quality
indicators (such as PSNR or SSIM) to assess attack severity, which may be
inadequate for task-oriented semantic communication, since visual differences
do not necessarily ensure semantic divergence. In this paper, we propose a
diffusion-based semantic communication framework, named DiffSem, that optimizes
semantic information reconstruction through a diffusion mechanism with
self-referential label embedding to significantly improve task performance. Our
model also compensates channel noise and adopt semantic information distortion
to ensure the robustness of the system in various signal-to-noise ratio
environments. To evaluate the attacker's effectiveness, we propose a new metric
that better quantifies the semantic fidelity of estimations from the adversary.
Experimental results based on this criterion show that on the MNIST dataset,
DiffSem improves the classification accuracy by 10.03%, and maintain stable
performance under dynamic channels. Our results further demonstrate that
significant deviation exists between traditional image quality indicators and
the leakage of task-relevant semantic information.

TL;DR: Guardian-FC is a two-layer framework for privacy-preserving federated computing, unifying safety enforcement across diverse privacy mechanisms like FHE, MPC, and DP. It decouples guard-rails from privacy mechanisms using a backend-neutral DSL and interchangeable Execution Providers, with an Agentic-AI control plane for safety enforcement.

Motivation: To address the challenge of enforcing consistent safety and risk management across diverse privacy-preserving mechanisms in federated computing.

Method: Proposes Guardian-FC, a framework with a backend-neutral DSL for modular computation and interchangeable Execution Providers, managed by an Agentic-AI control plane for safety enforcement.

Result: Enables backend-agnostic safety, fail-fast job admission, and extensibility to new privacy back-ends, supported by qualitative scenarios and a formal model for verification.

Conclusion: Guardian-FC provides a flexible and extensible solution for privacy-preserving federated computing, with a research agenda for further advancements in adaptive guard-rail tuning, multi-backend composition, and DSL development.

Abstract: We propose Guardian-FC, a novel two-layer framework for privacy preserving
federated computing that unifies safety enforcement across diverse privacy
preserving mechanisms, including cryptographic back-ends like fully homomorphic
encryption (FHE) and multiparty computation (MPC), as well as statistical
techniques such as differential privacy (DP). Guardian-FC decouples guard-rails
from privacy mechanisms by executing plug-ins (modular computation units),
written in a backend-neutral, domain-specific language (DSL) designed
specifically for federated computing workflows and interchangeable Execution
Providers (EPs), which implement DSL operations for various privacy back-ends.
An Agentic-AI control plane enforces a finite-state safety loop through signed
telemetry and commands, ensuring consistent risk management and auditability.
The manifest-centric design supports fail-fast job admission and seamless
extensibility to new privacy back-ends. We present qualitative scenarios
illustrating backend-agnostic safety and a formal model foundation for
verification. Finally, we outline a research agenda inviting the community to
advance adaptive guard-rail tuning, multi-backend composition, DSL
specification development, implementation, and compiler extensibility alongside
human-override usability.

Result: The system reduces manual intervention, improves accuracy, and accelerates security analysis, as shown in case studies.

Conclusion: SV-LLM demonstrates potential to transform hardware security practices by proactively identifying and mitigating risks early in the design cycle.

Abstract: Ensuring the security of complex system-on-chips (SoCs) designs is a critical
imperative, yet traditional verification techniques struggle to keep pace due
to significant challenges in automation, scalability, comprehensiveness, and
adaptability. The advent of large language models (LLMs), with their remarkable
capabilities in natural language understanding, code generation, and advanced
reasoning, presents a new paradigm for tackling these issues. Moving beyond
monolithic models, an agentic approach allows for the creation of multi-agent
systems where specialized LLMs collaborate to solve complex problems more
effectively. Recognizing this opportunity, we introduce SV-LLM, a novel
multi-agent assistant system designed to automate and enhance SoC security
verification. By integrating specialized agents for tasks like verification
question answering, security asset identification, threat modeling, test plan
and property generation, vulnerability detection, and simulation-based bug
validation, SV-LLM streamlines the workflow. To optimize their performance in
these diverse tasks, agents leverage different learning paradigms, such as
in-context learning, fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The
system aims to reduce manual intervention, improve accuracy, and accelerate
security analysis, supporting proactive identification and mitigation of risks
early in the design cycle. We demonstrate its potential to transform hardware
security practices through illustrative case studies and experiments that
showcase its applicability and efficacy.

### [213] [Attack Smarter: Attention-Driven Fine-Grained Webpage Fingerprinting Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20082)
*Yali Yuan,Weiyi Zou,Guang Cheng*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ADWPF, an attention-driven fine-grained WebPage Fingerprinting attack, improves large-scale website recognition by addressing subpage and multi-tab browsing challenges using targeted augmentation and self-attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Website Fingerprinting (WF) attacks are limited to small-scale scenarios, failing in practical settings where users access multiple subpages or browse in multiple tabs.

Method: ADWPF uses attention-driven augmentation (cropping and masking) during training, extracts low-dimensional features, and applies self-attention to capture global patterns. Residual attention handles multi-tab scenarios.

Result: ADWPF outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across datasets of varying scales.

Conclusion: ADWPF effectively generalizes WF to large-scale environments, addressing subpage and multi-tab challenges with attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Website Fingerprinting (WF) attacks aim to infer which websites a user is
visiting by analyzing traffic patterns, thereby compromising user anonymity.
Although this technique has been demonstrated to be effective in controlled
experimental environments, it remains largely limited to small-scale scenarios,
typically restricted to recognizing website homepages. In practical settings,
however, users frequently access multiple subpages in rapid succession, often
before previous content fully loads. WebPage Fingerprinting (WPF) generalizes
the WF framework to large-scale environments by modeling subpages of the same
site as distinct classes. These pages often share similar page elements,
resulting in lower inter-class variance in traffic features. Furthermore, we
consider multi-tab browsing scenarios, in which a single trace encompasses
multiple categories of webpages. This leads to overlapping traffic segments,
and similar features may appear in different positions within the traffic,
thereby increasing the difficulty of classification. To address these
challenges, we propose an attention-driven fine-grained WPF attack, named
ADWPF. Specifically, during the training phase, we apply targeted augmentation
to salient regions of the traffic based on attention maps, including attention
cropping and attention masking. ADWPF then extracts low-dimensional features
from both the original and augmented traffic and applies self-attention modules
to capture the global contextual patterns of the trace. Finally, to handle the
multi-tab scenario, we employ the residual attention to generate class-specific
representations of webpages occurring at different temporal positions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method consistently
surpasses state-of-the-art baselines across datasets of different scales.

*Malikussaid,Sutiyo*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces the ARC framework, a co-evolutionary method for enhancing ICS security by autonomously hardening defenses against adaptive adversaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The convergence of IT and OT in ICS exposes critical infrastructure to intelligent adversaries, rendering static defenses ineffective. Existing paradigms fail to address the 'Trinity of Trust.'

Method: ARC uses a closed-loop process with a DRL-based 'Red Agent' to discover attacks and an ensemble-based 'Blue Agent' to harden defenses through adversarial training.

Result: Experimental validation on TEP and SWaT testbeds shows superior performance, with co-evolution significantly improving attack detection.

Conclusion: ARC represents a paradigm shift toward dynamic, self-improving security for critical infrastructure, integrating XAI for operator trust and scalability.

Abstract: The convergence of IT and OT has created hyper-connected ICS, exposing
critical infrastructure to a new class of adaptive, intelligent adversaries
that render static defenses obsolete. Existing security paradigms often fail to
address a foundational "Trinity of Trust," comprising the fidelity of the
system model, the integrity of synchronizing data, and the resilience of the
analytical engine against sophisticated evasion. This paper introduces the ARC
framework, a method for achieving analytical resilience through an autonomous,
closed-loop hardening process. ARC establishes a perpetual co-evolutionary arms
race within the high-fidelity sandbox of a F-SCDT. A DRL agent, the "Red
Agent," is formalized and incentivized to autonomously discover stealthy,
physically-plausible attack paths that maximize process disruption while
evading detection. Concurrently, an ensemble-based "Blue Agent" defender is
continuously hardened via adversarial training against the evolving threats
discovered by its adversary. This co-evolutionary dynamic forces both agents to
become progressively more sophisticated, enabling the system to autonomously
probe and patch its own vulnerabilities. Experimental validation on both the
TEP and the SWaT testbeds demonstrates the framework's superior performance. A
comprehensive ablation study, supported by extensive visualizations including
ROC curves and SHAP plots, reveals that the co-evolutionary process itself is
responsible for a significant performance increase in detecting novel attacks.
By integrating XAI to ensure operator trust and proposing a scalable F-ARC
architecture, this work presents ARC not merely as an improvement, but as a
necessary paradigm shift toward dynamic, self-improving security for the future
of critical infrastructure.

### [215] [Vulnerability Disclosure through Adaptive Black-Box Adversarial Attacks on NIDS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20576)
*Sabrine Ennaji,Elhadj Benkhelifa,Luigi V. Mancini*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A novel black-box adversarial attack method for structured data like network traffic, focusing on minimal interaction and adaptive feature selection to evade detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The gap between theoretical adversarial attack advancements and practical application, especially in structured data, along with reproducibility issues and ineffective defenses.

Method: An adaptive feature selection strategy using change-point detection and causality analysis, respecting black-box constraints with minimal interaction.

Result: Effective evasion of detection with minimal interaction, demonstrated through comprehensive experiments.

Conclusion: Advances understanding of adversarial attacks in network traffic, paving the way for robust defenses.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks, wherein slight inputs are carefully crafted to mislead
intelligent models, have attracted increasing attention. However, a critical
gap persists between theoretical advancements and practical application,
particularly in structured data like network traffic, where interdependent
features complicate effective adversarial manipulations. Moreover, ambiguity in
current approaches restricts reproducibility and limits progress in this field.
Hence, existing defenses often fail to handle evolving adversarial attacks.
This paper proposes a novel approach for black-box adversarial attacks, that
addresses these limitations. Unlike prior work, which often assumes system
access or relies on repeated probing, our method strictly respect black-box
constraints, reducing interaction to avoid detection and better reflect
real-world scenarios. We present an adaptive feature selection strategy using
change-point detection and causality analysis to identify and target sensitive
features to perturbations. This lightweight design ensures low computational
cost and high deployability. Our comprehensive experiments show the attack's
effectiveness in evading detection with minimal interaction, enhancing its
adaptability and applicability in real-world scenarios. By advancing the
understanding of adversarial attacks in network traffic, this work lays a
foundation for developing robust defenses.

*Xiaoyu Li,Zhao Song,Jiahao Zhang*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: The paper proposes an algorithm to minimize unnecessary desk-rejections of AI conference submissions while adhering to per-author limits, preserving up to 19.23% more papers efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The strict per-author submission limits at AI conferences may discard valuable papers unfairly. The research aims to reduce needless rejections while respecting limits.

Method: Formalizes desk-rejection as an optimization problem, solves it using linear programming relaxation and a rounding scheme.

Result: The method preserves up to 19.23% more papers without violating author limits, with efficient computation (≤53.64 seconds).

Conclusion: The algorithm offers a practical solution to improve submission policies, reducing unnecessary rejections effectively.

Abstract: The explosive growth of AI research has driven paper submissions at flagship
AI conferences to unprecedented levels, necessitating many venues in 2025
(e.g., CVPR, ICCV, KDD, AAAI, IJCAI, WSDM) to enforce strict per-author
submission limits and to desk-reject any excess papers by simple ID order.
While this policy helps reduce reviewer workload, it may unintentionally
discard valuable papers and penalize authors' efforts. In this paper, we ask an
essential research question on whether it is possible to follow submission
limits while minimizing needless rejections. We first formalize the current
desk-rejection policies as an optimization problem, and then develop a
practical algorithm based on linear programming relaxation and a rounding
scheme. Under extensive evaluation on 11 years of real-world ICLR
(International Conference on Learning Representations) data, our method
preserves up to $19.23\%$ more papers without violating any author limits.
Moreover, our algorithm is highly efficient in practice, with all results on
ICLR data computed within at most 53.64 seconds. Our work provides a simple and
practical desk-rejection strategy that significantly reduces unnecessary
rejections, demonstrating strong potential to improve current CS conference
submission policies.

*Stefanos Achlatis,Efstratios Gavves,Jan-Jakob Sonke*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: A two-stage, physics-guided deep learning pipeline for radiotherapy planning is proposed, achieving results close to clinical ground truths with reduced radiation exposure to organs at risk.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adaptive radiotherapy requires frequent plan modifications due to anatomical variations, and deep learning can automate this process efficiently.

Method: A two-stage approach: first, training with direct supervision on treatment plan parameters (MLC and MU values); second, incorporating physics-based guidance from predicted 3D dose distributions.

Result: The method achieves a mean difference of D95% = 0.42 +/- 1.83 Gy and V95% = -0.22 +/- 1.87% at the PTV, reducing radiation exposure to organs at risk.

Conclusion: Physics-guided deep learning shows promise for efficient and accurate radiotherapy planning.

Abstract: Radiotherapy (RT) is a critical cancer treatment, with volumetric modulated
arc therapy (VMAT) being a commonly used technique that enhances dose
conformity by dynamically adjusting multileaf collimator (MLC) positions and
monitor units (MU) throughout gantry rotation. Adaptive radiotherapy requires
frequent modifications to treatment plans to account for anatomical variations,
necessitating time-efficient solutions. Deep learning offers a promising
solution to automate this process. To this end, we propose a two-stage,
physics-guided deep learning pipeline for radiotherapy planning. In the first
stage, our network is trained with direct supervision on treatment plan
parameters, consisting of MLC and MU values. In the second stage, we
incorporate an additional supervision signal derived from the predicted 3D dose
distribution, integrating physics-based guidance into the training process. We
train and evaluate our approach on 133 prostate cancer patients treated with a
uniform 2-arc VMAT protocol delivering a dose of 62 Gy to the planning target
volume (PTV). Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach, implemented
using both 3D U-Net and UNETR architectures, consistently produces treatment
plans that closely match clinical ground truths. Our method achieves a mean
difference of D95% = 0.42 +/- 1.83 Gy and V95% = -0.22 +/- 1.87% at the PTV
while generating dose distributions that reduce radiation exposure to organs at
risk. These findings highlight the potential of physics-guided deep learning in
RT planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the resource-intensive and time-consuming nature of traditional methods (experimental testing and FEM) for studying adhesive peeling behavior on skin.

Method: A neural network model trained on FEM-generated data from 90-degree peel tests with varying adhesive and fracture mechanics parameters.

Result: High accuracy with MSE of 3.66*10^-7 and R^2 score of 0.94, validated via 5-fold cross-validation.

Conclusion: The method offers a reliable, efficient alternative to FEM, enabling scalable research in computational dermato-mechanics and bio-adhesive design.

Abstract: Studying the peeling behaviour of adhesives on skin is vital for advancing
biomedical applications such as medical adhesives and transdermal patches.
Traditional methods like experimental testing and finite element method (FEM),
though considered gold standards, are resource-intensive, computationally
expensive and time-consuming, particularly when analysing a wide material
parameter space. In this study, we present a neural network-based approach to
predict the minimum peel force (F_min) required for adhesive detachment from
skin tissue, limiting the need for repeated FEM simulations and significantly
reducing the computational cost. Leveraging a dataset generated from FEM
simulations of 90 degree peel test with varying adhesive and fracture mechanics
parameters, our neural network model achieved high accuracy, validated through
rigorous 5-fold cross-validation. The final architecture was able to predict a
wide variety of skin-adhesive peeling behaviour, exhibiting a mean squared
error (MSE) of 3.66*10^-7 and a R^2 score of 0.94 on test set, demonstrating
robust performance. This work introduces a reliable, computationally efficient
method for predicting adhesive behaviour, significantly reducing simulation
time while maintaining accuracy. This integration of machine learning with
high-fidelity biomechanical simulations enables efficient design and
optimization of skin-adhesive systems, providing a scalable framework for
future research in computational dermato-mechanics and bio-adhesive material
design.

operations and reduce carbon footprint by dynamically ranking resources,
including data centers, edge computing nodes, and multi-cloud environments,
based on real-time and forecasted carbon intensity, Power Usage Effectiveness
(PUE), and energy consumption. Leveraging a flexible ranking algorithm, MAIZX
achieved an 85.68% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to baseline hypervisor
operations. Tested across geographically distributed data centers, the
framework demonstrates scalability and effectiveness, directly interfacing with
hypervisors to optimize workloads in private, hybrid, and multi-cloud
environments. MAIZX integrates real-time data on carbon intensity, power
consumption, and carbon footprint, as well as forecasted values, into cloud
management, providing a robust tool for enhancing climate performance potential
while maintaining operational efficiency.

Result: Validation shows reliability and clinical interpretability. Integrating FundaQ-8 improves diabetic retinopathy grading robustness.

Conclusion: FundaQ-8 enhances quality-aware training, proving valuable for real-world screening applications.

Abstract: Automated fundus image quality assessment (FIQA) remains a challenge due to
variations in image acquisition and subjective expert evaluations. We introduce
FundaQ-8, a novel expert-validated framework for systematically assessing
fundus image quality using eight critical parameters, including field coverage,
anatomical visibility, illumination, and image artifacts. Using FundaQ-8 as a
structured scoring reference, we develop a ResNet18-based regression model to
predict continuous quality scores in the 0 to 1 range. The model is trained on
1800 fundus images from real-world clinical sources and Kaggle datasets, using
transfer learning, mean squared error optimization, and standardized
preprocessing. Validation against the EyeQ dataset and statistical analyses
confirm the framework's reliability and clinical interpretability.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: VoxelOpt is a novel DIR framework combining learning-based and iterative methods for better accuracy and speed, using displacement entropy and adaptive message passing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of learning-based and iterative DIR methods, such as limited training data, large deformations, and speed-accuracy trade-offs.

Method: Uses displacement entropy for voxel-wise adaptive message passing, multi-level image pyramids, and a pretrained segmentation model for feature extraction.

Result: Outperforms iterative methods in efficiency and accuracy, matches supervised learning-based methods in abdominal CT registration.

Conclusion: VoxelOpt achieves a superior balance between accuracy and runtime, leveraging innovative techniques for DIR.

Abstract: Recent developments in neural networks have improved deformable image
registration (DIR) by amortizing iterative optimization, enabling fast and
accurate DIR results. However, learning-based methods often face challenges
with limited training data, large deformations, and tend to underperform
compared to iterative approaches when label supervision is unavailable. While
iterative methods can achieve higher accuracy in such scenarios, they are
considerably slower than learning-based methods. To address these limitations,
we propose VoxelOpt, a discrete optimization-based DIR framework that combines
the strengths of learning-based and iterative methods to achieve a better
balance between registration accuracy and runtime. VoxelOpt uses displacement
entropy from local cost volumes to measure displacement signal strength at each
voxel, which differs from earlier approaches in three key aspects. First, it
introduces voxel-wise adaptive message passing, where voxels with lower entropy
receives less influence from their neighbors. Second, it employs a multi-level
image pyramid with 27-neighbor cost volumes at each level, avoiding exponential
complexity growth. Third, it replaces hand-crafted features or contrastive
learning with a pretrained foundational segmentation model for feature
extraction. In abdominal CT registration, these changes allow VoxelOpt to
outperform leading iterative in both efficiency and accuracy, while matching
state-of-the-art learning-based methods trained with label supervision. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IQA methods for PET/CT images fail to account for both low-level distortions and high-level anatomical structures, leading to diagnostic uncertainty.

Method: Uses a multi-scale feature fusion network (MS-IQA) with ResNet and Swin Transformer, and a dynamically weighted channel attention mechanism. Constructs PET-CT-IQA-DS dataset with 2,700 images.

Result: Superior performance on PET-CT-IQA-DS and LDCTIQAC2023 datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MS-IQA provides an accurate and efficient IQA method for PET/CT, addressing limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography (PET/CT) plays a critical
role in medical imaging, combining functional and anatomical information to aid
in accurate diagnosis. However, image quality degradation due to noise,
compression and other factors could potentially lead to diagnostic uncertainty
and increase the risk of misdiagnosis. When evaluating the quality of a PET/CT
image, both low-level features like distortions and high-level features like
organ anatomical structures affect the diagnostic value of the image. However,
existing medical image quality assessment (IQA) methods are unable to account
for both feature types simultaneously. In this work, we propose MS-IQA, a novel
multi-scale feature fusion network for PET/CT IQA, which utilizes multi-scale
features from various intermediate layers of ResNet and Swin Transformer,
enhancing its ability of perceiving both local and global information. In
addition, a multi-scale feature fusion module is also introduced to effectively
combine high-level and low-level information through a dynamically weighted
channel attention mechanism. Finally, to fill the blank of PET/CT IQA dataset,
we construct PET-CT-IQA-DS, a dataset containing 2,700 varying-quality PET/CT
images with quality scores assigned by radiologists. Experiments on our dataset
and the publicly available LDCTIQAC2023 dataset demonstrate that our proposed
model has achieved superior performance against existing state-of-the-art
methods in various IQA metrics. This work provides an accurate and efficient
IQA method for PET/CT. Our code and dataset are available at

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework addresses limitations in osteoporosis diagnosis by leveraging unlabeled CT data, enhancing cross-device adaptability, and integrating clinical knowledge for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for osteoporosis diagnosis using CT data underutilize unlabeled data, face device-specific biases, and lack clinical knowledge integration.

Method: Proposes a unified deep learning framework with self-supervised learning, Mixture of Experts (MoE) for cross-device adaptability, and multi-task learning for diagnosis, BMD regression, and vertebra location prediction.

Result: Demonstrates superior generalizability and accuracy across clinical sites and an external hospital compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The framework improves opportunistic osteoporosis screening and diagnosis by addressing key limitations of current approaches.

Abstract: Osteoporosis, characterized by reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and
compromised bone microstructure, increases fracture risk in aging populations.
While dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the clinical standard for BMD
assessment, its limited accessibility hinders diagnosis in resource-limited
regions. Opportunistic computed tomography (CT) analysis has emerged as a
promising alternative for osteoporosis diagnosis using existing imaging data.
Current approaches, however, face three limitations: (1) underutilization of
unlabeled vertebral data, (2) systematic bias from device-specific DXA
discrepancies, and (3) insufficient integration of clinical knowledge such as
spatial BMD distribution patterns. To address these, we propose a unified deep
learning framework with three innovations. First, a self-supervised learning
method using radiomic representations to leverage unlabeled CT data and
preserve bone texture. Second, a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture with
learned gating mechanisms to enhance cross-device adaptability. Third, a
multi-task learning framework integrating osteoporosis diagnosis, BMD
regression, and vertebra location prediction. Validated across three clinical
sites and an external hospital, our approach demonstrates superior
generalizability and accuracy over existing methods for opportunistic
osteoporosis screening and diagnosis.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: EAGLE, a U-shaped network with PVSS encoder and HVSS decoder, achieves efficient and accurate segmentation of hepatic echinococcosis lesions, outperforming MSVM-UNet with a DSC of 89.76%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HE is a parasitic disease in underdeveloped areas. Existing CNN and Transformer models have limitations in global context modeling and computational cost.

Method: EAGLE combines PVSS encoder and HVSS decoder with CVSSB for local-global feature fusion and HWTB for lossless downsampling.

Result: EAGLE achieves 89.76% DSC, surpassing MSVM-UNet by 1.61%.

Conclusion: EAGLE offers an efficient and accurate solution for HE lesion segmentation, addressing limitations of existing models.

Abstract: Hepatic echinococcosis (HE) is a widespread parasitic disease in
underdeveloped pastoral areas with limited medical resources. While CNN-based
and Transformer-based models have been widely applied to medical image
segmentation, CNNs lack global context modeling due to local receptive fields,
and Transformers, though capable of capturing long-range dependencies, are
computationally expensive. Recently, state space models (SSMs), such as Mamba,
have gained attention for their ability to model long sequences with linear
complexity. In this paper, we propose EAGLE, a U-shaped network composed of a
Progressive Visual State Space (PVSS) encoder and a Hybrid Visual State Space
(HVSS) decoder that work collaboratively to achieve efficient and accurate
segmentation of hepatic echinococcosis (HE) lesions. The proposed Convolutional
Vision State Space Block (CVSSB) module is designed to fuse local and global
features, while the Haar Wavelet Transformation Block (HWTB) module compresses
spatial information into the channel dimension to enable lossless downsampling.
Due to the lack of publicly available HE datasets, we collected CT slices from
260 patients at a local hospital. Experimental results show that EAGLE achieves
state-of-the-art performance with a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of
89.76%, surpassing MSVM-UNet by 1.61%.

Abstract: Accurate gestational age (GA) estimation, ideally through fetal ultrasound
measurement, is a crucial aspect of providing excellent antenatal care.
However, deriving GA from manual fetal biometric measurements depends on the
operator and is time-consuming. Hence, automatic computer-assisted methods are
demanded in clinical practice. In this paper, we present a novel feature fusion
framework to estimate GA using fetal ultrasound images without any measurement
information. We adopt a deep learning model to extract deep representations
from ultrasound images. We extract radiomic features to reveal patterns and
characteristics of fetal brain growth. To harness the interpretability of
radiomics in medical imaging analysis, we estimate GA by fusing radiomic
features and deep representations. Our framework estimates GA with a mean
absolute error of 8.0 days across three trimesters, outperforming current
machine learning-based methods at these gestational ages. Experimental results
demonstrate the robustness of our framework across different populations in
diverse geographical regions. Our code is publicly available on

*Simon Perrin,Sébastien Levilly,Huajun Sun,Harold Mouchère,Jean-Michel Serfaty*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A new feature, Weighted Mean Frequencies (WMF), improves 4D Flow MRI image segmentation by revealing pulsatile flow regions, outperforming PC-MRA in metrics like IoU and Dice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Poor resolution and noise in 4D Flow MRI images hinder accurate segmentation, especially for biomarkers like wall shear stress.

Method: Introduces WMF, a handcrafted feature for visualizing pulsatile flow regions, tested with optimal thresholding and deep learning methods.

Result: WMF enhances segmentation performance, increasing IoU by 0.12 and Dice by 0.13 compared to PC-MRA.

Conclusion: WMF shows promise for improving segmentation in vascular regions like the heart or brain.

Abstract: In recent decades, the use of 4D Flow MRI images has enabled the
quantification of velocity fields within a volume of interest and along the
cardiac cycle. However, the lack of resolution and the presence of noise in
these biomarkers are significant issues. As indicated by recent studies, it
appears that biomarkers such as wall shear stress are particularly impacted by
the poor resolution of vessel segmentation. The Phase Contrast Magnetic
Resonance Angiography (PC-MRA) is the state-of-the-art method to facilitate
segmentation. The objective of this work is to introduce a new handcraft
feature that provides a novel visualisation of 4D Flow MRI images, which is
useful in the segmentation task. This feature, termed Weighted Mean Frequencies
(WMF), is capable of revealing the region in three dimensions where a voxel has
been passed by pulsatile flow. Indeed, this feature is representative of the
hull of all pulsatile velocity voxels. The value of the feature under
discussion is illustrated by two experiments. The experiments involved
segmenting 4D Flow MRI images using optimal thresholding and deep learning
methods. The results obtained demonstrate a substantial enhancement in terms of
IoU and Dice, with a respective increase of 0.12 and 0.13 in comparison with
the PC-MRA feature, as evidenced by the deep learning task. This feature has
the potential to yield valuable insights that could inform future segmentation
processes in other vascular regions, such as the heart or the brain.

TL;DR: MNN-AECS is an energy-efficient system for LLM decoding on mobile devices, reducing energy use by 23% without slowdown by dynamically selecting low-power CPU cores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Energy efficiency in on-device LLM inference is critical for battery-limited mobile devices, with the decode phase being the dominant energy consumer.

Method: Introduces Adaptive Energy-Centric Core Selection (AECS) integrated into MNN, dynamically selecting low-power CPU cores to balance energy and speed.

Result: MNN-AECS reduces energy use by 23% without slowdown and outperforms other engines with 39%-78% energy savings and 12%-363% speedup.

Conclusion: MNN-AECS is a practical, engine-level solution for energy-efficient LLM decoding on mobile devices without requiring root access or OS changes.

Abstract: As the demand for on-device Large Language Model (LLM) inference grows,
energy efficiency has become a major concern, especially for battery-limited
mobile devices. Our analysis shows that the memory-bound LLM decode phase
dominates energy use, and yet most existing works focus on accelerating the
prefill phase, neglecting energy concerns. We introduce Adaptive Energy-Centric
Core Selection (AECS) and integrate it into MNN to create the energy-efficient
version, MNN-AECS, the first engine-level system solution without requiring
root access or OS modifications for energy-efficient LLM decoding. MNN-AECS is
designed to reduce LLM decoding energy while keeping decode speed within an
acceptable slowdown threshold by dynamically selecting low-power CPU cores.
MNN-AECS is evaluated across 5 Android and 2 iOS devices on 5 popular LLMs of
various sizes. Compared to original MNN, MNN-AECS cuts down energy use by 23%
without slowdown averaged over all 7 devices and 4 datasets. Against other
engines, including llama.cpp, executorch, mllm, and MediaPipe, MNN-AECS
delivers 39% to 78% energy saving and 12% to 363% speedup on average.

TL;DR: RSERI-EV is a framework for assessing EV charging station resilience using multi-source data and spatial analytics, applied to Wales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The resilience of EV charging infrastructure under environmental and infrastructural stress is underexplored.

Method: Combines remote sensing, open datasets, and spatial graph analytics to evaluate vulnerability, integrating flood risk, LST, NDVI, LULC, substation proximity, and road accessibility.

Result: A composite Resilience Score is generated, demonstrated on Wales' EV charger dataset using a spatial kNN graph.

Conclusion: Multi-source data fusion and spatial reasoning enhance climate-resilient EV infrastructure deployment.

Abstract: Electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure is increasingly critical to
sustainable transport systems, yet its resilience under environmental and
infrastructural stress remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce
RSERI-EV, a spatially explicit and multi-modal risk assessment framework that
combines remote sensing data, open infrastructure datasets, and spatial graph
analytics to evaluate the vulnerability of EV charging stations. RSERI-EV
integrates diverse data layers, including flood risk maps, land surface
temperature (LST) extremes, vegetation indices (NDVI), land use/land cover
(LULC), proximity to electrical substations, and road accessibility to generate
a composite Resilience Score. We apply this framework to the country of Wales
EV charger dataset to demonstrate its feasibility. A spatial $k$-nearest
neighbours ($k$NN) graph is constructed over the charging network to enable
neighbourhood-based comparisons and graph-aware diagnostics. Our prototype
highlights the value of multi-source data fusion and interpretable spatial
reasoning in supporting climate-resilient, infrastructure-aware EV deployment.

*Natalie Lang,Maya Simhi,Nir Shlezinger*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: OLALa introduces adaptive lattice quantization in federated learning to reduce communication overhead and improve performance in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed quantization rules in FL are suboptimal for heterogeneous and dynamic settings where model updates vary.

Method: Proposes OLALa, where clients adjust quantizers online using lightweight computations and exchange compact parameters.

Result: OLALa outperforms fixed-codebook and non-adaptive schemes, improving learning performance under various quantization rates.

Conclusion: Adaptive lattice quantization in FL enhances efficiency and performance in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training across distributed
clients without sharing raw data, often at the cost of substantial
communication overhead induced by transmitting high-dimensional model updates.
This overhead can be alleviated by having the clients quantize their model
updates, with dithered lattice quantizers identified as an attractive scheme
due to its structural simplicity and convergence-preserving properties.
However, existing lattice-based FL schemes typically rely on a fixed
quantization rule, which is suboptimal in heterogeneous and dynamic
environments where the model updates distribution varies across users and
training rounds. In this work, we propose Online Learned Adaptive Lattices
(OLALa), a heterogeneous FL framework where each client can adjust its
quantizer online using lightweight local computations. We first derive
convergence guarantees for FL with non-fixed lattice quantizers and show that
proper lattice adaptation can tighten the convergence bound. Then, we design an
online learning algorithm that enables clients to tune their quantizers
throughout the FL process while exchanging only a compact set of quantization
parameters. Numerical experiments demonstrate that OLALa consistently improves
learning performance under various quantization rates, outperforming
conventional fixed-codebook and non-adaptive schemes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of sampling valid ligand-binding poses, especially for unseen or diverse targets, in molecular docking.

Method: Combines pocket prediction with systematic multi-pocket exploration, evaluated on benchmarks like PDBbind2020, DockGen, Astex, and PoseBusters.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in physical validity and competitive RMSD, especially on diverse targets. Also introduces TargetDock-AI, a large benchmarking dataset.

Conclusion: PocketVina is a robust, scalable docking tool suitable for high-throughput virtual screening and drug discovery, requiring no task-specific training and running efficiently on standard GPUs.

Abstract: Sampling physically valid ligand-binding poses remains a major challenge in
molecular docking, particularly for unseen or structurally diverse targets. We
introduce PocketVina, a fast and memory-efficient, search-based docking
framework that combines pocket prediction with systematic multi-pocket
exploration. We evaluate PocketVina across four established
benchmarks--PDBbind2020 (timesplit and unseen), DockGen, Astex, and
PoseBusters--and observe consistently strong performance in sampling physically
valid docking poses. PocketVina achieves state-of-the-art performance when
jointly considering ligand RMSD and physical validity (PB-valid), while
remaining competitive with deep learning-based approaches in terms of RMSD
alone, particularly on structurally diverse and previously unseen targets.
PocketVina also maintains state-of-the-art physically valid docking accuracy
across ligands with varying degrees of flexibility. We further introduce
TargetDock-AI, a benchmarking dataset we curated, consisting of over 500000
protein-ligand pairs, and a partition of the dataset labeled with PubChem
activity annotations. On this large-scale dataset, PocketVina successfully
discriminates active from inactive targets, outperforming a deep learning
baseline while requiring significantly less GPU memory and runtime. PocketVina
offers a robust and scalable docking strategy that requires no task-specific
training and runs efficiently on standard GPUs, making it well-suited for
high-throughput virtual screening and structure-based drug discovery.

### [232] [MILAAP: Mobile Link Allocation via Attention-based Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19947)
*Yung-Fu Chen,Anish Arora*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: MiLAAP is a learning-based framework for predicting channel occupancy in dynamic wireless networks without state sharing, achieving high accuracy and zero-shot generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of state sharing in channel hopping systems, especially in large or mobile networks, by predicting channel occupancy locally.

Method: Uses self-attention and multi-head self-attention mechanisms to predict spectral, spatial, and temporal dependencies, relying only on locally observed channel activities.

Result: Achieves ~100% prediction accuracy across mobility patterns and zero-shot generalizability.

Conclusion: MiLAAP effectively eliminates communication overhead while maintaining high prediction accuracy in dynamic networks.

Abstract: Channel hopping (CS) communication systems must adapt to interference changes
in the wireless network and to node mobility for maintaining throughput
efficiency. Optimal scheduling requires up-to-date network state information
(i.e., of channel occupancy) to select non-overlapping channels for links in
interference regions. However, state sharing among nodes introduces significant
communication overhead, especially as network size or node mobility scale,
thereby decreasing throughput efficiency of already capacity-limited networks.
In this paper, we eschew state sharing while adapting the CS schedule based on
a learning-based channel occupancy prediction. We propose the MiLAAP
attention-based prediction framework for machine learning models of spectral,
spatial, and temporal dependencies among network nodes. MiLAAP uses a
self-attention mechanism that lets each node capture the temporospectral CS
pattern in its interference region and accordingly predict the channel
occupancy state within that region. Notably, the prediction relies only on
locally and passively observed channel activities, and thus introduces no
communication overhead. To deal with node mobility, MiLAAP also uses a
multi-head self-attention mechanism that lets each node locally capture the
spatiotemporal dependencies on other network nodes that can interfere with it
and accordingly predict the motion trajectory of those nodes. Detecting nodes
that enter or move outside the interference region is used to further improve
the prediction accuracy of channel occupancy. We show that for dynamic networks
that use local CS sequences to support relatively long-lived flow traffics, the
channel state prediction accuracy of MiLAAP is remarkably ~100% across
different node mobility patterns and it achieves zero-shot generalizability
across different periods of CS sequences.

TL;DR: A stability-based approach ensures coverage guarantees for selected conformal prediction sets, even when choosing the smallest set, with extensions to online settings and refinements for structured data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of invalidating coverage guarantees when selecting the most desirable conformal prediction set (e.g., the smallest).

Method: Proposes a stability-based approach to ensure coverage for selected prediction sets, extends it to online conformal settings, and refines it for structured data.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness through experiments, ensuring coverage guarantees are maintained.

Conclusion: The stability-based approach successfully preserves coverage guarantees while allowing selection of desirable prediction sets, with applicability in online and structured settings.

Abstract: Conformal prediction offers a distribution-free framework for constructing
prediction sets with coverage guarantees. In practice, multiple valid conformal
prediction sets may be available, arising from different models or
methodologies. However, selecting the most desirable set, such as the smallest,
can invalidate the coverage guarantees. To address this challenge, we propose a
stability-based approach that ensures coverage for the selected prediction set.
We extend our results to the online conformal setting, propose several
refinements in settings where additional structure is available, and
demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments.

*Graeme Baker,Agostino Capponi,J. Antonio Sidaoui*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A data-driven dynamic factor framework using Anisotropic Diffusion Maps for high-dimensional covariate-response relationships, validated with financial stress testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model high-dimensional covariate-response dynamics without parametric assumptions, leveraging nonlinear manifold learning for improved accuracy.

Method: Uses Anisotropic Diffusion Maps to uncover joint dynamics, approximates embedding with linear diffusions, and applies Kalman filtering for prediction.

Result: Outperforms standard methods in financial stress testing, reducing mean absolute error by up to 55% and 39%.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust, data-driven approach for dynamic modeling, validated by superior performance in financial applications.

Abstract: We propose a data-driven dynamic factor framework where a response variable
depends on a high-dimensional set of covariates, without imposing any
parametric model on the joint dynamics. Leveraging Anisotropic Diffusion Maps,
a nonlinear manifold learning technique introduced by Singer and Coifman, our
framework uncovers the joint dynamics of the covariates and responses in a
purely data-driven way. We approximate the embedding dynamics using linear
diffusions, and exploit Kalman filtering to predict the evolution of the
covariates and response variables directly from the diffusion map embedding
space. We generalize Singer's convergence rate analysis of the graph Laplacian
from the case of independent uniform samples on a compact manifold to the case
of time series arising from Langevin diffusions in Euclidean space.
Furthermore, we provide rigorous justification for our procedure by showing the
robustness of approximations of the diffusion map coordinates by linear
diffusions, and the convergence of ergodic averages under standard spectral
assumptions on the underlying dynamics. We apply our method to the stress
testing of equity portfolios using a combination of financial and macroeconomic
factors from the Federal Reserve's supervisory scenarios. We demonstrate that
our data-driven stress testing method outperforms standard scenario analysis
and Principal Component Analysis benchmarks through historical backtests
spanning three major financial crises, achieving reductions in mean absolute
error of up to 55% and 39% for scenario-based portfolio return prediction,
respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a unified framework for distributional OPE, the paper aims to extend fitted-Q evaluation to this setting.

Method: Develops FDE methods based on guiding principles, with convergence analysis and theoretical justification for existing methods.

Result: New FDE methods outperform in experiments, including linear quadratic regulators and Atari games.

Conclusion: The paper provides a unified framework and superior FDE methods for distributional OPE, validated theoretically and empirically.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning, distributional off-policy evaluation (OPE) focuses
on estimating the return distribution of a target policy using offline data
collected under a different policy. This work focuses on extending the widely
used fitted-Q evaluation -- developed for expectation-based reinforcement
learning -- to the distributional OPE setting. We refer to this extension as
fitted distributional evaluation (FDE). While only a few related approaches
exist, there remains no unified framework for designing FDE methods. To fill
this gap, we present a set of guiding principles for constructing theoretically
grounded FDE methods. Building on these principles, we develop several new FDE
methods with convergence analysis and provide theoretical justification for
existing methods, even in non-tabular environments. Extensive experiments,
including simulations on linear quadratic regulators and Atari games,
demonstrate the superior performance of the FDE methods.

TL;DR: Proposes an estimator to extract compact decision rules from tree ensembles, improving interpretability and accuracy with control over rule count and interaction depth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tree ensembles are accurate but hard to interpret; this work aims to uncover useful relationships in data by extracting interpretable rules.

Method: Develops an estimator with exact and approximate algorithms for optimization and regularization paths, and establishes prediction error bounds.

Result: The estimator outperforms existing rule extraction methods and matches oracle performance in large-sample settings.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively balances accuracy and interpretability, offering a practical solution for rule extraction from tree ensembles.

Abstract: Tree ensembles are non-parametric methods widely recognized for their
accuracy and ability to capture complex interactions. While these models excel
at prediction, they are difficult to interpret and may fail to uncover useful
relationships in the data. We propose an estimator to extract compact sets of
decision rules from tree ensembles. The extracted models are accurate and can
be manually examined to reveal relationships between the predictors and the
response. A key novelty of our estimator is the flexibility to jointly control
the number of rules extracted and the interaction depth of each rule, which
improves accuracy. We develop a tailored exact algorithm to efficiently solve
optimization problems underlying our estimator and an approximate algorithm for
computing regularization paths, sequences of solutions that correspond to
varying model sizes. We also establish novel non-asymptotic prediction error
bounds for our proposed approach, comparing it to an oracle that chooses the
best data-dependent linear combination of the rules in the ensemble subject to
the same complexity constraint as our estimator. The bounds illustrate that the
large-sample predictive performance of our estimator is on par with that of the
oracle. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our estimator outperforms
existing algorithms for rule extraction.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: POLAR is a novel pessimistic model-based policy learning algorithm for offline dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs), offering statistical guarantees and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DTR methods lack robustness under partial data coverage and statistical guarantees, while offline reinforcement learning focuses on average performance without guarantees.

Method: POLAR estimates transition dynamics from offline data, quantifies uncertainty, and incorporates a pessimistic penalty into the reward function to discourage high-uncertainty actions.

Result: POLAR provides finite-sample bounds on policy suboptimality and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and MIMIC-III datasets.

Conclusion: POLAR is the first model-based DTR method with statistical and computational guarantees, yielding near-optimal, history-aware treatment strategies.

Abstract: Dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) provide a principled framework for
optimizing sequential decision-making in domains where decisions must adapt
over time in response to individual trajectories, such as healthcare,
education, and digital interventions. However, existing statistical methods
often rely on strong positivity assumptions and lack robustness under partial
data coverage, while offline reinforcement learning approaches typically focus
on average training performance, lack statistical guarantees, and require
solving complex optimization problems. To address these challenges, we propose
POLAR, a novel pessimistic model-based policy learning algorithm for offline
DTR optimization. POLAR estimates the transition dynamics from offline data and
quantifies uncertainty for each history-action pair. A pessimistic penalty is
then incorporated into the reward function to discourage actions with high
uncertainty. Unlike many existing methods that focus on average training
performance, POLAR directly targets the suboptimality of the final learned
policy and offers theoretical guarantees, without relying on computationally
intensive minimax or constrained optimization procedures. To the best of our
knowledge, POLAR is the first model-based DTR method to provide both
statistical and computational guarantees, including finite-sample bounds on
policy suboptimality. Empirical results on both synthetic data and the
MIMIC-III dataset demonstrate that POLAR outperforms state-of-the-art methods
and yields near-optimal, history-aware treatment strategies.

<details>

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Linear mixed models (LMMs), which incorporate fixed and random effects, are
key tools for analyzing heterogeneous data, such as in personalized medicine or
adaptive marketing. Nowadays, this type of data is increasingly wide, sometimes
containing thousands of candidate predictors, necessitating sparsity for
prediction and interpretation. However, existing sparse learning methods for
LMMs do not scale well beyond tens or hundreds of predictors, leaving a large
gap compared with sparse methods for linear models, which ignore random
effects. This paper closes the gap with a new $\ell_0$ regularized method for
LMM subset selection that can run on datasets containing thousands of
predictors in seconds to minutes. On the computational front, we develop a
coordinate descent algorithm as our main workhorse and provide a guarantee of
its convergence. We also develop a local search algorithm to help traverse the
nonconvex optimization surface. Both algorithms readily extend to subset
selection in generalized LMMs via a penalized quasi-likelihood approximation.
On the statistical front, we provide a finite-sample bound on the
Kullback-Leibler divergence of the new method. We then demonstrate its
excellent performance in synthetic experiments and illustrate its utility on
two datasets from biology and journalism.

TL;DR: The paper provides the first global convergence guarantees for Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) in robust subspace recovery, including affine subspace estimation, and demonstrates its practical utility in neural network training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robust subspace estimation is crucial for machine learning and data analysis, but the theoretical properties of IRLS, an effective empirical method, remain unclear.

Method: The study introduces a variant of IRLS with dynamic smoothing regularization and analyzes its linear convergence under deterministic conditions.

Result: The method achieves linear convergence to the underlying subspace from any initialization and extends to affine subspace estimation, a previously untheorized setting.

Conclusion: The paper establishes theoretical guarantees for IRLS in nonconvex settings and demonstrates its practical effectiveness in neural network training.

Abstract: Robust subspace estimation is fundamental to many machine learning and data
analysis tasks. Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) is an elegant and
empirically effective approach to this problem, yet its theoretical properties
remain poorly understood. This paper establishes that, under deterministic
conditions, a variant of IRLS with dynamic smoothing regularization converges
linearly to the underlying subspace from any initialization. We extend these
guarantees to affine subspace estimation, a setting that lacks prior recovery
theory. Additionally, we illustrate the practical benefits of IRLS through an
application to low-dimensional neural network training. Our results provide the
first global convergence guarantees for IRLS in robust subspace recovery and,
more broadly, for nonconvex IRLS on a Riemannian manifold.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the need for learner-agnostic robust data prefiltering (LARP) to protect downstream learners from corrupted data, analyzing its trade-offs and utility loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public datasets often contain low-quality or contaminated data, which can negatively impact downstream learning methods, necessitating robust prefiltering solutions.

Method: The authors formalize LARP, focusing on scalar mean estimation with Huber estimators under the Huber contamination model, and analyze natural prefiltering procedures.

Result: Theoretical and experimental results show utility loss when using LARP on heterogeneous learners compared to learner-specific prefiltering, but benefits for large datasets.

Conclusion: LARP offers a practical trade-off between utility loss and cost efficiency, especially for large datasets, despite some performance reduction.

Abstract: The widespread availability of large public datasets is a key factor behind
the recent successes of statistical inference and machine learning methods.
However, these datasets often contain some low-quality or contaminated data, to
which many learning procedures are sensitive. Therefore, the question of
whether and how public datasets should be prefiltered to facilitate accurate
downstream learning arises. On a technical level this requires the construction
of principled data prefiltering methods which are learner-agnostic robust, in
the sense of provably protecting a set of pre-specified downstream learners
from corrupted data. In this work, we formalize the problem of Learner-Agnostic
Robust data Prefiltering (LARP), which aims at finding prefiltering procedures
that minimize a worst-case loss over a pre-specified set of learners. We first
instantiate our framework in the context of scalar mean estimation with Huber
estimators under the Huber data contamination model. We provide a hardness
result on a specific problem instance and analyze several natural prefiltering
procedures. Our theoretical results indicate that performing LARP on a
heterogeneous set of learners leads to some loss in model performance compared
to the alternative of prefiltering data for each learner/use-case individually.
We explore the resulting utility loss and its dependence on the problem
parameters via extensive experiments on real-world image and tabular data,
observing statistically significant reduction in utility. Finally, we model the
trade-off between the utility drop and the cost of repeated (learner-specific)
prefiltering within a game-theoretic framework and showcase benefits of LARP
for large datasets.

TL;DR: LLMs can effectively partition and document legacy government code, outperforming human partitioning in factual accuracy and usefulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in LLM applications for legacy government code, especially in languages like MUMPS and ALC, and explore code-chunking methods for better documentation.

Method: Investigate code-chunking methods for legacy code, evaluate LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3 Sonnet, Mixtral, Llama 3) on documentation quality, and compare with human partitioning.

Result: LLMs align with human partitioning and produce 20% more factual and 10% more useful comments.

Conclusion: LLMs are suitable replacements for human partitioning in modernizing large legacy codebases.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become essential tools in computer science,
especially for tasks involving code understanding and generation. However,
existing work does not address many of the unique challenges presented by code
written for government applications. In particular, government enterprise
software is often written in legacy languages like MUMPS or assembly language
code (ALC) and the overall token lengths of these systems exceed the context
window size for current commercially available LLMs. Additionally, LLMs are
primarily trained on modern software languages and have undergone limited
testing with legacy languages, making their ability to understand legacy
languages unknown and, hence, an area for empirical study. This paper examines
the application of LLMs in the modernization of legacy government code written
in ALC and MUMPS, addressing the challenges of input limitations. We
investigate various code-chunking methods to optimize the generation of summary
module comments for legacy code files, evaluating the impact of code-chunking
methods on the quality of documentation produced by different LLMs, including
GPT-4o, Claude 3 Sonnet, Mixtral, and Llama 3. Our results indicate that LLMs
can select partition points closely aligned with human expert partitioning. We
also find that chunking approaches have significant impact on downstream tasks
such as documentation generation. LLM-created partitions produce comments that
are up to 20% more factual and up to 10% more useful than when humans create
partitions. Therefore, we conclude that LLMs can be used as suitable
replacements for human partitioning of large codebases during LLM-aided
modernization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual code compliance checking in BIM is time-consuming and error-prone, necessitating automation.

Method: Integrates LLMs (GPT, Claude, Gemini, Llama) with Revit to interpret codes, generate Python scripts, and perform semi-automated checks.

Result: Case studies showed reduced time and effort, improved accuracy, and streamlined violation identification (e.g., room dimensions, materials).

Conclusion: The system offers a cost-effective, adaptable solution for BIM compliance, advancing automation in construction projects.

Abstract: This research addresses the time-consuming and error-prone nature of manual
code compliance checking in Building Information Modeling (BIM) by introducing
a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven approach to semi-automate this critical
process. The developed system integrates LLMs such as GPT, Claude, Gemini, and
Llama, with Revit software to interpret building codes, generate Python
scripts, and perform semi-automated compliance checks within the BIM
environment. Case studies on a single-family residential project and an office
building project demonstrated the system's ability to reduce the time and
effort required for compliance checks while improving accuracy. It streamlined
the identification of violations, such as non-compliant room dimensions,
material usage, and object placements, by automatically assessing relationships
and generating actionable reports. Compared to manual methods, the system
eliminated repetitive tasks, simplified complex regulations, and ensured
reliable adherence to standards. By offering a comprehensive, adaptable, and
cost-effective solution, this proposed approach offers a promising advancement
in BIM-based compliance checking, with potential applications across diverse
regulatory documents in construction projects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ideation methods lack support for ML challenges, leading to misaligned visions. Define-ML addresses this gap.

Method: Developed and validated via Technology Transfer Model, including static (toy problem) and dynamic (industrial case study) validation with mixed-method analysis.

Result: Participants found Define-ML effective for data clarity, goal alignment, and collaboration, though noted a learning curve. All intended to adopt it.

Conclusion: Define-ML is a validated, open framework enhancing ML product ideation by integrating data and feasibility awareness.

Abstract: [Context] The increasing adoption of machine learning (ML) in software
systems demands specialized ideation approaches that address ML-specific
challenges, including data dependencies, technical feasibility, and alignment
between business objectives and probabilistic system behavior. Traditional
ideation methods like Lean Inception lack structured support for these ML
considerations, which can result in misaligned product visions and unrealistic
expectations. [Goal] This paper presents Define-ML, a framework that extends
Lean Inception with tailored activities - Data Source Mapping, Feature-to-Data
Source Mapping, and ML Mapping - to systematically integrate data and technical
constraints into early-stage ML product ideation. [Method] We developed and
validated Define-ML following the Technology Transfer Model, conducting both
static validation (with a toy problem) and dynamic validation (in a real-world
industrial case study). The analysis combined quantitative surveys with
qualitative feedback, assessing utility, ease of use, and intent of adoption.
[Results] Participants found Define-ML effective for clarifying data concerns,
aligning ML capabilities with business goals, and fostering cross-functional
collaboration. The approach's structured activities reduced ideation ambiguity,
though some noted a learning curve for ML-specific components, which can be
mitigated by expert facilitation. All participants expressed the intention to
adopt Define-ML. [Conclusion] Define-ML provides an openly available, validated
approach for ML product ideation, building on Lean Inception's agility while
aligning features with available data and increasing awareness of technical
feasibility.

### [246] [DeepQuark: deep-neural-network approach to multiquark bound states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20555)
*Wei-Lin Wu,Lu Meng,Shi-Lin Zhu*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: DeepQuark, a deep-neural-network-based variational Monte Carlo method, is introduced for multiquark systems, outperforming existing methods and successfully describing complex interactions in nucleon, tetraquark, and pentaquark systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of multiquark systems due to strong SU(3) color interactions and unique challenges like stronger correlations and intractable confinement interactions motivates the development of a novel computational approach.

Method: DeepQuark, a high-efficiency architecture, is designed to handle multiquark systems, incorporating three-body flux-tube confinement interactions and an unbiased wave function ansatz.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in nucleon, tetraquark, and pentaquark systems, predicting new states like $P_{cc\bar c}(5715)$ and $P_{bb\bar b}(15569)$.

Conclusion: DeepQuark shows promise for larger multiquark systems and offers insights into nonperturbative QCD and many-body physics, recommending experimental validation of predicted states.

Abstract: For the first time, we implement the deep-neural-network-based variational
Monte Carlo approach for the multiquark bound states, whose complexity
surpasses that of electron or nucleon systems due to strong SU(3) color
interactions. We design a novel and high-efficiency architecture, DeepQuark, to
address the unique challenges in multiquark systems such as stronger
correlations, extra discrete quantum numbers, and intractable confinement
interaction. Our method demonstrates competitive performance with
state-of-the-art approaches, including diffusion Monte Carlo and Gaussian
expansion method, in the nucleon, doubly heavy tetraquark, and fully heavy
tetraquark systems. Notably, it outperforms existing calculations for
pentaquarks, exemplified by the triply heavy pentaquark. For the nucleon, we
successfully incorporate three-body flux-tube confinement interactions without
additional computational costs. In tetraquark systems, we consistently describe
hadronic molecule $T_{cc}$ and compact tetraquark $T_{bb}$ with an unbiased
form of wave function ansatz. In the pentaquark sector, we obtain weakly bound
$\bar D^*\Xi_{cc}^*$ molecule $P_{cc\bar c}(5715)$ with $S=\frac{5}{2}$ and its
bottom partner $P_{bb\bar b}(15569)$. They can be viewed as the analogs of the
molecular $T_{cc}$. We recommend experimental search of $P_{cc\bar c}(5715)$ in
the D-wave $J/\psi \Lambda_c$ channel. DeepQuark holds great promise for
extension to larger multiquark systems, overcoming the computational barriers
in conventional methods. It also serves as a powerful framework for exploring
confining mechanism beyond two-body interactions in multiquark states, which
may offer valuable insights into nonperturbative QCD and general many-body
physics.

*Ankit Shah,Rita Singh,Bhiksha Raj,Alexander Hauptmann*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper proposes a cost-effective gunshot detection and firearm classification system using acoustic analysis and machine learning, outperforming traditional methods but facing challenges with noisy data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the high costs of commercial gunshot detection systems and the need for timely, accurate information to enhance public safety.

Method: Uses acoustic analysis of gunshot recordings and evaluates machine learning frameworks (SVM and CNN) for detection and classification.

Result: CNN achieves mAP 0.58 on clean data (vs. SVM's 0.39), but performance drops to 0.35 with noisy web-sourced data.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for real-time deployment on common devices, though data quality and noise remain challenges.

Abstract: The escalating rates of gun-related violence and mass shootings represent a
significant threat to public safety. Timely and accurate information for law
enforcement agencies is crucial in mitigating these incidents. Current
commercial gunshot detection systems, while effective, often come with
prohibitive costs. This research explores a cost-effective alternative by
leveraging acoustic analysis of gunshot recordings, potentially obtainable from
ubiquitous devices like cell phones, to not only detect gunshots but also
classify the type of firearm used. This paper details a study on deciphering
gun type hierarchies using a curated dataset of 3459 recordings. We investigate
the fundamental acoustic characteristics of gunshots, including muzzle blasts
and shockwaves, which vary based on firearm type, ammunition, and shooting
direction. We propose and evaluate machine learning frameworks, including
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) as a baseline and a more advanced Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) architecture for joint gunshot detection and gun type
classification. Results indicate that our deep learning approach achieves a
mean average precision (mAP) of 0.58 on clean labeled data, outperforming the
SVM baseline (mAP 0.39). Challenges related to data quality, environmental
noise, and the generalization capabilities when using noisy web-sourced data
(mAP 0.35) are also discussed. The long-term vision is to develop a highly
accurate, real-time system deployable on common recording devices,
significantly reducing detection costs and providing critical intelligence to
first responders.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper proposes output-feedback schemes for recurrent neural networks using linear matrix inequalities and tube-based NMPC, ensuring robustness and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of designing robust output-feedback controllers for recurrent neural networks, particularly in handling disturbances and state estimation uncertainty.

Method: Uses linear matrix inequalities for observer and controller design, and introduces a tube-based NMPC scheme leveraging incremental ISS properties.

Result: The proposed methods ensure robustness, convergence, and recursive feasibility, validated via simulations on a pH-neutralisation process.

Conclusion: The schemes effectively enhance control performance and stability for recurrent neural networks, with practical validation.

Abstract: This paper investigates the design of output-feedback schemes for systems
described by a class of recurrent neural networks. We propose a procedure based
on linear matrix inequalities for designing an observer and a static
state-feedback controller. The algorithm leverages global and regional
incremental input-to-state stability (incremental ISS) and enables the tracking
of constant setpoints, ensuring robustness to disturbances and state estimation
uncertainty. To address the potential limitations of regional incremental ISS,
we introduce an alternative scheme in which the static law is replaced with a
tube-based nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) that exploits regional
incremental ISS properties. We show that these conditions enable the
formulation of a robust NMPC law with guarantees of convergence and recursive
feasibility, leading to an enlarged region of attraction. Theoretical results
are validated through numerical simulations on the pH-neutralisation process
benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.

*Andrew Mole,Max Weissenbacher,Georgios Rigas,Sylvain Laizet*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning (RL) controller integrated with high-fidelity large-eddy simulation (LES) boosts wind farm power output by 4.30%, outperforming static control methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional wind farm control optimizes individual turbines, but coordinated wake steering can enhance overall energy production. Current methods rely on static, low-fidelity simulators, missing turbulent flow dynamics.

Method: The study introduces an RL controller combined with high-fidelity LES for dynamic, real-time control of wind farms, responding to atmospheric turbulence.

Result: The RL controller increased power output by 4.30%, nearly doubling the gain from static optimal yaw control (2.19%).

Conclusion: Dynamic flow-responsive control is a transformative approach for wind farm optimization, aiding renewable energy goals.

Abstract: Traditional wind farm control operates each turbine independently to maximize
individual power output. However, coordinated wake steering across the entire
farm can substantially increase the combined wind farm energy production.
Although dynamic closed-loop control has proven effective in flow control
applications, wind farm optimization has relied primarily on static,
low-fidelity simulators that ignore critical turbulent flow dynamics. In this
work, we present the first reinforcement learning (RL) controller integrated
directly with high-fidelity large-eddy simulation (LES), enabling real-time
response to atmospheric turbulence through collaborative, dynamic control
strategies. Our RL controller achieves a 4.30% increase in wind farm power
output compared to baseline operation, nearly doubling the 2.19% gain from
static optimal yaw control obtained through Bayesian optimization. These
results establish dynamic flow-responsive control as a transformative approach
to wind farm optimization, with direct implications for accelerating renewable
energy deployment to net-zero targets.

Motivation: To develop a novel method for estimating firm linkages and improving momentum spillover trading strategies.

Method: Uses Euclidean similarity and Quantum Cognition Machine Learning (QCML) for similarity learning to construct trading strategies.

Result: Both methods work, but QCML similarity outperforms Euclidean similarity in profitability.

Conclusion: QCML-based similarity learning is superior for constructing profitable momentum spillover trading strategies.

Abstract: We introduce a novel proxy for firm linkages, Characteristic Vector Linkages
(CVLs). We use this concept to estimate firm linkages, first through Euclidean
similarity, and then by applying Quantum Cognition Machine Learning (QCML) to

*Junjie Xu,Jiahao Zhang,Mangal Prakash,Xiang Zhang,Suhang Wang*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: DualEquiNet introduces a dual-space hierarchical equivariant network to address scalability and expressiveness challenges in modeling large biomolecules, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing geometric GNNs struggle with scalability and capturing multi-scale features in large biomolecules like RNA and proteins.

Method: DualEquiNet uses Euclidean and Spherical Harmonics spaces, bidirectional cross-space message passing, and Cross-Space Interaction Pooling for hierarchical feature aggregation.

Result: Outperforms prior methods on RNA and protein benchmarks, including new 3D structural tasks.

Conclusion: DualEquiNet effectively models large biomolecules by combining local and global features, demonstrating broad applicability.

Abstract: Geometric graph neural networks (GNNs) that respect E(3) symmetries have
achieved strong performance on small molecule modeling, but they face
scalability and expressiveness challenges when applied to large biomolecules
such as RNA and proteins. These systems require models that can simultaneously
capture fine-grained atomic interactions, long-range dependencies across
spatially distant components, and biologically relevant hierarchical structure,
such as atoms forming residues, which in turn form higher-order domains.
Existing geometric GNNs, which typically operate exclusively in either
Euclidean or Spherical Harmonics space, are limited in their ability to capture
both the fine-scale atomic details and the long-range, symmetry-aware
dependencies required for modeling the multi-scale structure of large
biomolecules. We introduce DualEquiNet, a Dual-Space Hierarchical Equivariant
Network that constructs complementary representations in both Euclidean and
Spherical Harmonics spaces to capture local geometry and global symmetry-aware
features. DualEquiNet employs bidirectional cross-space message passing and a
novel Cross-Space Interaction Pooling mechanism to hierarchically aggregate
atomic features into biologically meaningful units, such as residues, enabling
efficient and expressive multi-scale modeling for large biomolecular systems.
DualEquiNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple existing
benchmarks for RNA property prediction and protein modeling, and outperforms
prior methods on two newly introduced 3D structural benchmarks demonstrating
its broad effectiveness across a range of large biomolecule modeling tasks.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Recursive Cost Guidance and Dynamic Library mechanisms to improve template-based molecular generation, addressing synthesis cost, scalability, and small fragment utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in template-based GFlowNets, including minimizing synthesis cost, scaling to large libraries, and utilizing small fragment sets effectively.

Method: Introduces Recursive Cost Guidance (a backward policy with ML models for cost approximation) and Dynamic Library (reusing high-reward states). Also includes an Exploitation Penalty for balance.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in template-based molecular generation, enhancing cost-efficiency, diversity, and quality.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively address core challenges and advance template-based molecular generation.

Abstract: Template-based molecular generation offers a promising avenue for drug design
by ensuring generated compounds are synthetically accessible through predefined
reaction templates and building blocks. In this work, we tackle three core
challenges in template-based GFlowNets: (1) minimizing synthesis cost, (2)
scaling to large building block libraries, and (3) effectively utilizing small
fragment sets. We propose \textbf{Recursive Cost Guidance}, a backward policy
framework that employs auxiliary machine learning models to approximate
synthesis cost and viability. This guidance steers generation toward low-cost
synthesis pathways, significantly enhancing cost-efficiency, molecular
diversity, and quality, especially when paired with an \textbf{Exploitation
Penalty} that balances the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. To
enhance performance in smaller building block libraries, we develop a
\textbf{Dynamic Library} mechanism that reuses intermediate high-reward states
to construct full synthesis trees. Our approach establishes state-of-the-art
results in template-based molecular generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve sequential lossy compression by framing it as a reinforcement-learning problem and addressing limitations of existing methods.

Method: Recasts sequential compression as a multi-armed bandit problem, analyzes 'natural type selection,' and derives robust cost-directed algorithms.

Result: Identifies limitations of existing schemes and proposes new algorithms that perform well at any block length.

Conclusion: The proposed robust cost-directed MAB algorithms enhance sequential lossy compression, overcoming prior limitations.

Abstract: Universal compression can learn the source and adapt to it either in a batch
mode (forward adaptation), or in a sequential mode (backward adaptation). We
recast the sequential mode as a multi-armed bandit problem, a fundamental model
in reinforcement-learning, and study the trade-off between exploration and
exploitation in the lossy compression case. We show that a previously proposed
"natural type selection" scheme can be cast as a reconstruction-directed MAB
algorithm, for sequential lossy compression, and explain its limitations in
terms of robustness and short-block performance. We then derive and analyze
robust cost-directed MAB algorithms, which work at any block length.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MARL studies lack exploration of bilateral grouping in dynamic populations, limiting understanding of algorithmic influences on policy performance and generalization.

Method: A framework for learning two-sided team formation in dynamic multi-agent systems is proposed and validated using common multi-agent scenarios.

Result: The approach shows competitive performance and improved generalization in most tested scenarios.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into algorithmic properties of bilateral team formation, enhancing MARL applications in dynamic settings.

Abstract: Team formation and the dynamics of team-based learning have drawn significant
interest in the context of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However,
existing studies primarily focus on unilateral groupings, predefined teams, or
fixed-population settings, leaving the effects of algorithmic bilateral
grouping choices in dynamic populations underexplored. To address this gap, we
introduce a framework for learning two-sided team formation in dynamic
multi-agent systems. Through this study, we gain insight into what algorithmic
properties in bilateral team formation influence policy performance and
generalization. We validate our approach using widely adopted multi-agent
scenarios, demonstrating competitive performance and improved generalization in

TL;DR: Orbformer, a transferable wavefunction model pretrained on 22,000 structures, achieves chemical accuracy (1 kcal/mol) in bond dissociations and reactions, rivaling classical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bond breaking in quantum chemistry is challenging due to multireferential electronic structures, and existing methods are computationally expensive without leveraging commonalities across molecules.

Method: Quantum Monte Carlo with deep neural networks (deep QMC) is used to pretrain Orbformer, a transferable wavefunction model, on equilibrium and dissociating structures.

Result: Orbformer consistently achieves chemical accuracy (1 kcal/mol) on benchmarks, bond dissociations, and Diels-Alder reactions, outperforming classical methods.

Conclusion: Orbformer successfully amortizes the cost of solving the Schrödinger equation across molecules, making it a practical quantum chemistry approach.

Abstract: Reliable description of bond breaking remains a major challenge for quantum
chemistry due to the multireferential character of the electronic structure in
dissociating species. Multireferential methods in particular suffer from large
computational cost, which under the normal paradigm has to be paid anew for
each system at a full price, ignoring commonalities in electronic structure
across molecules. Quantum Monte Carlo with deep neural networks (deep QMC)
uniquely offers to exploit such commonalities by pretraining transferable
wavefunction models, but all such attempts were so far limited in scope. Here,
we bring this new paradigm to fruition with Orbformer, a novel transferable
wavefunction model pretrained on 22,000 equilibrium and dissociating structures
that can be fine-tuned on unseen molecules reaching an accuracy-cost ratio
rivalling classical multireferential methods. On established benchmarks as well
as more challenging bond dissociations and Diels-Alder reactions, Orbformer is
the only method that consistently converges to chemical accuracy (1 kcal/mol).
This work turns the idea of amortizing the cost of solving the Schr\"odinger
equation over many molecules into a practical approach in quantum chemistry.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoVE, a system leveraging LLMs' sequential processing for better recommender systems by using compressed vocabulary expansion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods underutilize LLMs' sequential capabilities in recommendation tasks, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: CoVE assigns unique IDs to items in an expanded vocabulary, optimizing LLMs' sequence understanding and compressing embeddings for scalability.

Result: CoVE outperforms prior methods in experiments on multiple datasets, proving its effectiveness.

Conclusion: CoVE enhances LLM-based recommender systems by better utilizing sequential processing and is scalable for industrial use.

Abstract: Recommender systems play a pivotal role in providing relevant content to
users. With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), researchers
have begun utilizing LLMs to build more powerful recommender systems. However,
existing approaches that focus on aligning LLMs with recommendation tasks do
not fully leverage their sequential information processing capabilities,
leading to suboptimal performance.
  In this paper, we propose a novel system called compressed vocabulary
expansion (CoVE). In CoVE, each item is assigned a unique ID within the
expanded vocabulary. Our framework effectively capitalizes on sequence
understanding abilities of LLMs, significantly enhancing their performance on
recommendation tasks. Additionally, we compress the embedding layer, making
CoVE practical for large-scale industrial applications. The effectiveness and
performance of CoVE are demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on
multiple recommendation datasets and comparisons with prior works. Our code can

TL;DR: FemmIR is a framework for multimodal retrieval without similarity labels, leveraging pretrained encoders and weak supervision via edit distance. It avoids annotation overhead and performs comparably to supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate the need for labeled data in multimodal retrieval and reuse pretrained models, addressing real-world scenarios with scarce annotations.

Method: Uses weak supervision through edit distance (graph edit distance) to measure relevance without labels, maintaining high-level properties and constraints.

Result: FemmIR achieves comparable performance to supervised retrieval systems on the MuQNOL dataset, even without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: FemmIR offers a practical solution for multimodal retrieval in annotation-scarce environments, leveraging existing pretrained models effectively.

Abstract: Existing multi-media retrieval models either rely on creating a common
subspace with modality-specific representation models or require schema mapping
among modalities to measure similarities among multi-media data. Our goal is to
avoid the annotation overhead incurred from considering retrieval as a
supervised classification task and re-use the pretrained encoders in large
language models and vision tasks. We propose "FemmIR", a framework to retrieve
multimodal results relevant to information needs expressed with multimodal
queries by example without any similarity label. Such identification is
necessary for real-world applications where data annotations are scarce and
satisfactory performance is required without fine-tuning with a common
framework across applications. We curate a new dataset called MuQNOL for
benchmarking progress on this task. Our technique is based on weak supervision
introduced through edit distance between samples: graph edit distance can be
modified to consider the cost of replacing a data sample in terms of its
properties, and relevance can be measured through the implicit signal from the
amount of edit cost among the objects. Unlike metric learning or encoding
networks, FemmIR re-uses the high-level properties and maintains the property
value and relationship constraints with a multi-level interaction score between
data samples and the query example provided by the user. We empirically
evaluate FemmIR on a missing person use case with MuQNOL. FemmIR performs
comparably to similar retrieval systems in delivering on-demand retrieval
results with exact and approximate similarities while using the existing
property identifiers in the system.

### [258] [Unidentified and Confounded? Understanding Two-Tower Models for Unbiased Learning to Rank](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20501)
*Philipp Hager,Onno Zoeter,Maarten de Rijke*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper explores why two-tower models trained on biased user feedback (clicks) degrade in performance, analyzing confounding effects and identifiability issues. It proposes a sample weighting solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the performance degradation of two-tower models trained on biased user feedback, particularly clicks from production systems.

Method: Theoretical analysis of identifiability conditions for two-tower models and investigation of logging policy effects. Proposal of a sample weighting technique.

Result: Identifiability requires document swaps or overlapping feature distributions. Logging policies amplify biases when models imperfectly capture user behavior. Sample weighting mitigates these effects.

Conclusion: The study provides insights and a practical solution (sample weighting) to improve two-tower model performance in real-world settings.

Abstract: Additive two-tower models are popular learning-to-rank methods for handling
biased user feedback in industry settings. Recent studies, however, report a
concerning phenomenon: training two-tower models on clicks collected by
well-performing production systems leads to decreased ranking performance. This
paper investigates two recent explanations for this observation: confounding
effects from logging policies and model identifiability issues. We
theoretically analyze the identifiability conditions of two-tower models,
showing that either document swaps across positions or overlapping feature
distributions are required to recover model parameters from clicks. We also
investigate the effect of logging policies on two-tower models, finding that
they introduce no bias when models perfectly capture user behavior. However,
logging policies can amplify biases when models imperfectly capture user
behavior, particularly when prediction errors correlate with document placement
across positions. We propose a sample weighting technique to mitigate these
effects and provide actionable insights for researchers and practitioners using
two-tower models.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A growing trend in the database and system communities is to augment
conventional index structures, such as B+-trees, with machine learning (ML)
models. Among these, error-bounded Piecewise Linear Approximation
($\epsilon$-PLA) has emerged as a popular choice due to its simplicity and
effectiveness. Despite its central role in many learned indexes, the design and
analysis of $\epsilon$-PLA fitting algorithms remain underexplored. In this
paper, we revisit $\epsilon$-PLA from both theoretical and empirical
perspectives, with a focus on its application in learned index structures. We
first establish a fundamentally improved lower bound of $\Omega(\kappa \cdot
\epsilon^2)$ on the expected segment coverage for existing $\epsilon$-PLA
fitting algorithms, where $\kappa$ is a data-dependent constant. We then
present a comprehensive benchmark of state-of-the-art $\epsilon$-PLA algorithms
when used in different learned data structures. Our results highlight key
trade-offs among model accuracy, model size, and query performance, providing
actionable guidelines for the principled design of future learned data
structures.

TL;DR: The paper reviews machine-learning-assisted photonic device development (ML-PDD) to address computational, financial, and scalability challenges in traditional PDD methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PDD methods are computationally expensive, costly, and difficult to scale, prompting the need for data-driven ML solutions.

Method: ML-PDD employs surrogate estimators, generative modeling, reinforcement learning, and active learning to optimize design, simulation, fabrication, and measurement.

Result: ML-PDD enables efficient design optimization, fast simulation under noise, and improved fabrication processes.

Conclusion: The review highlights ML-PDD's potential to accelerate photonic device development and encourages interdisciplinary collaboration.

Abstract: Photonic device development (PDD) has achieved remarkable success in
designing and implementing new devices for controlling light across various
wavelengths, scales, and applications, including telecommunications, imaging,
sensing, and quantum information processing. PDD is an iterative, five-step
process that consists of: i) deriving device behavior from design parameters,
ii) simulating device performance, iii) finding the optimal candidate designs
from simulations, iv) fabricating the optimal device, and v) measuring device
performance. Classically, all these steps involve Bayesian optimization,
material science, control theory, and direct physics-driven numerical methods.
However, many of these techniques are computationally intractable, monetarily
costly, or difficult to implement at scale. In addition, PDD suffers from large
optimization landscapes, uncertainties in structural or optical
characterization, and difficulties in implementing robust fabrication
processes. However, the advent of machine learning over the past decade has
provided novel, data-driven strategies for tackling these challenges, including
surrogate estimators for speeding up computations, generative modeling for
noisy measurement modeling and data augmentation, reinforcement learning for
fabrication, and active learning for experimental physical discovery. In this
review, we present a comprehensive perspective on these methods to enable
machine-learning-assisted PDD (ML-PDD) for efficient design optimization with
powerful generative models, fast simulation and characterization modeling under
noisy measurements, and reinforcement learning for fabrication. This review
will provide researchers from diverse backgrounds with valuable insights into
this emerging topic, fostering interdisciplinary efforts to accelerate the
development of complex photonic devices and systems.

TL;DR: The workshop evaluated LLMs' potential in nuclear energy research, showing strengths in early-stage exploration and workflow design but limitations in novel materials and advanced code generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how LLMs can accelerate fusion and fission research by addressing nuclear science challenges.

Method: Fourteen teams used LLMs like ChatGPT and Gemini for tasks such as literature synthesis, code prototyping, and experimental design, employing structured workflows.

Result: LLMs excelled in early-stage tasks but struggled with novel materials and advanced simulations, requiring expert validation.

Conclusion: AI can complement nuclear research but needs curated datasets, workflow automation, and specialized models for broader integration.

Abstract: The AI for Nuclear Energy workshop at Oak Ridge National Laboratory evaluated
the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to accelerate fusion and fission
research. Fourteen interdisciplinary teams explored diverse nuclear science
challenges using ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and other AI models over a single
day. Applications ranged from developing foundation models for fusion reactor
control to automating Monte Carlo simulations, predicting material degradation,
and designing experimental programs for advanced reactors. Teams employed
structured workflows combining prompt engineering, deep research capabilities,
and iterative refinement to generate hypotheses, prototype code, and research
strategies. Key findings demonstrate that LLMs excel at early-stage
exploration, literature synthesis, and workflow design, successfully
identifying research gaps and generating plausible experimental frameworks.
However, significant limitations emerged, including difficulties with novel
materials designs, advanced code generation for modeling and simulation, and
domain-specific details requiring expert validation. The successful outcomes
resulted from expert-driven prompt engineering and treating AI as a
complementary tool rather than a replacement for physics-based methods. The
workshop validated AI's potential to accelerate nuclear energy research through
rapid iteration and cross-disciplinary synthesis while highlighting the need
for curated nuclear-specific datasets, workflow automation, and specialized
model development. These results provide a roadmap for integrating AI tools
into nuclear science workflows, potentially reducing development cycles for
safer, more efficient nuclear energy systems while maintaining rigorous
scientific standards.

### [262] [Do psychic cells generate consciousness?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20164)
*Mototaka Suzuki,Jaan Aru*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: Recent progress in neuroscience explores cortical pyramidal neurons' role in consciousness, focusing on metabotropic receptors as a key mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand cellular-level mechanisms of conscious processing, particularly how cortical pyramidal neurons contribute to consciousness and its disruption under anesthesia.

Method: Review of recent studies highlighting the role of metabotropic receptors in pyramidal neurons' feedback signaling.

Result: Identified metabotropic receptors as a critical cellular mechanism for consciousness, supporting Cajal's early hypothesis.

Conclusion: Cajal's 'psychic cells' may indeed play a central role in generating and controlling consciousness, with recent findings validating his century-old intuition.

Abstract: Technological advances in the past decades have begun to enable
neuroscientists to address fundamental questions about consciousness in an
unprecedented way. Here we review remarkable recent progress in our
understanding of cellular-level mechanisms of conscious processing in the
brain. Of particular interest are the cortical pyramidal neurons -- or "psychic
cells" called by Ram\'on y Cajal more than 100 years ago -- which have an
intriguing cellular mechanism that accounts for selective disruption of
feedback signaling in the brain upon anesthetic-induced loss of consciousness.
Importantly, a particular class of metabotropic receptors distributed over the
dendrites of pyramidal cells are highlighted as the key cellular mechanism.
After all, Cajal's instinct over a century ago may turn out to be correct -- we
may have just begun to understand whether and how psychic cells indeed generate
and control our consciousness.

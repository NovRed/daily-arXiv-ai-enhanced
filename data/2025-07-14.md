### [2] [Self-Consistency in Vision-Language Models for Precision Agriculture: Multi-Response Consensus for Crop Disease Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08024)
*Mihir Gupta,Abhay Mangla,Ross Greer,Pratik Desai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A domain-aware framework improves vision-language models for agricultural image analysis, enhancing disease diagnosis and treatment recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models underperform in specialized agricultural tasks, necessitating a more reliable solution for precision agriculture.

Method: Combines prompt-based expert evaluation with a cosine-consistency self-voting mechanism for accurate image analysis.

Result: Improves diagnostic accuracy (82.2% to 87.8%), symptom analysis (38.9% to 52.2%), and treatment recommendation (27.8% to 43.3%).

Conclusion: The framework shows promise for reliable AI-driven precision agriculture tools in diverse field conditions.

Abstract: Precision agriculture relies heavily on accurate image analysis for crop
disease identification and treatment recommendation, yet existing
vision-language models (VLMs) often underperform in specialized agricultural
domains. This work presents a domain-aware framework for agricultural image
processing that combines prompt-based expert evaluation with self-consistency
mechanisms to enhance VLM reliability in precision agriculture applications. We
introduce two key innovations: (1) a prompt-based evaluation protocol that
configures a language model as an expert plant pathologist for scalable
assessment of image analysis outputs, and (2) a cosine-consistency self-voting
mechanism that generates multiple candidate responses from agricultural images
and selects the most semantically coherent diagnosis using domain-adapted
embeddings. Applied to maize leaf disease identification from field images
using a fine-tuned PaliGemma model, our approach improves diagnostic accuracy
from 82.2\% to 87.8\%, symptom analysis from 38.9\% to 52.2\%, and treatment
recommendation from 27.8\% to 43.3\% compared to standard greedy decoding. The
system remains compact enough for deployment on mobile devices, supporting
real-time agricultural decision-making in resource-constrained environments.
These results demonstrate significant potential for AI-driven precision
agriculture tools that can operate reliably in diverse field conditions.

### [4] [Towards Evaluating Robustness of Prompt Adherence in Text to Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08039)
*Sujith Vemishetty,Advitiya Arora,Anupama Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to evaluate Text-to-Image models' adherence to prompts, revealing their limitations in generating simple binary images and following input distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of multimodal LLMs and Text-to-Image models lacks sufficient research on their reliability, prompting the need for a robust evaluation framework.

Method: A novel dataset assesses model robustness by generating images from text prompts, comparing descriptions of ground-truth and generated images via GPT-4o.

Result: Models struggle with simple binary images and fail to match input dataset distributions, as shown by evaluations on Stable Diffusion and Janus variants.

Conclusion: The study highlights the limitations of current Text-to-Image models in adhering to prompts and suggests the need for further improvements.

Abstract: The advancements in the domain of LLMs in recent years have surprised many,
showcasing their remarkable capabilities and diverse applications. Their
potential applications in various real-world scenarios have led to significant
research on their reliability and effectiveness. On the other hand, multimodal
LLMs and Text-to-Image models have only recently gained prominence, especially
when compared to text-only LLMs. Their reliability remains constrained due to
insufficient research on assessing their performance and robustness. This paper
aims to establish a comprehensive evaluation framework for Text-to-Image
models, concentrating particularly on their adherence to prompts. We created a
novel dataset that aimed to assess the robustness of these models in generating
images that conform to the specified factors of variation in the input text
prompts. Our evaluation studies present findings on three variants of Stable
Diffusion models: Stable Diffusion 3 Medium, Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, and
Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large Turbo, and two variants of Janus models: Janus Pro
1B and Janus Pro 7B. We introduce a pipeline that leverages text descriptions
generated by the gpt-4o model for our ground-truth images, which are then used
to generate artificial images by passing these descriptions to the
Text-to-Image models. We then pass these generated images again through gpt-4o
using the same system prompt and compare the variation between the two
descriptions. Our results reveal that these models struggle to create simple
binary images with only two factors of variation: a simple geometric shape and
its location. We also show, using pre-trained VAEs on our dataset, that they
fail to generate images that follow our input dataset distribution.

### [5] [ConsNoTrainLoRA: Data-driven Weight Initialization of Low-rank Adapters using Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08044)
*Debasmit Das,Hyoungwoo Park,Munawar Hayat,Seokeon Choi,Sungrack Yun,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CNTLoRA improves LoRA fine-tuning by using a data-driven weight initialization method, enhancing convergence and performance without training during initialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA weight matrices are randomly initialized with fixed ranks, limiting performance. CNTLoRA addresses this by leveraging pre-training and fine-tuning data relationships.

Method: CNTLoRA formulates LoRA initialization as a domain shift problem, deriving closed-form weight estimates from pre-training weights and fine-tuning activations, allowing variable ranks.

Result: CNTLoRA outperforms standard and data-driven methods in tasks like image generation, classification, and understanding, with faster convergence.

Conclusion: CNTLoRA provides an optimal, efficient initialization method for LoRA fine-tuning, validated by extensive analyses and ablations.

Abstract: Foundation models are pre-trained on large-scale datasets and subsequently
fine-tuned on small-scale datasets using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
techniques like low-rank adapters (LoRA). In most previous works, LoRA weight
matrices are randomly initialized with a fixed rank across all attachment
points. In this paper, we improve convergence and final performance of LoRA
fine-tuning, using our proposed data-driven weight initialization method,
ConsNoTrainLoRA (CNTLoRA). We express LoRA initialization as a domain shift
problem where we use multiple constraints relating the pre-training and
fine-tuning activations. By reformulating these constraints, we obtain a
closed-form estimate of LoRA weights that depends on pre-training weights and
fine-tuning activation vectors and hence requires no training during
initialization. This weight estimate is decomposed to initialize the up and
down matrices with proposed flexibility of variable ranks. With the proposed
initialization method, we fine-tune on downstream tasks such as image
generation, image classification and image understanding. Both quantitative and
qualitative results demonstrate that CNTLoRA outperforms standard and
data-driven weight initialization methods. Extensive analyses and ablations
further elucidate the design choices of our framework, providing an optimal
recipe for faster convergence and enhanced performance.

### [6] [A Hybrid Multilayer Extreme Learning Machine for Image Classification with an Application to Quadcopters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08047)
*Rolando A. Hernandez-Hernandez,Adrian Rubio-Solis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Hybrid Multilayer Extreme Learning Machine (HML-ELM) combining ELM-based autoencoder and Interval Type-2 fuzzy logic for active image classification in UAVs, showing superior efficiency over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance image classification for UAVs by integrating unsupervised feature extraction and supervised classification using a novel fuzzy ELM approach.

Method: HML-ELM uses ELM-AEs for hierarchical feature extraction and SIT2-FELM for classification, validated on benchmark and real UAV tasks.

Result: HML-ELM outperforms ML-ELM, ML-FELM, and ELM in efficiency for image classification and UAV applications.

Conclusion: The proposed HML-ELM is effective for active image classification, especially in UAV scenarios, demonstrating improved performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Multilayer Extreme Learning Machine (ML-ELM) and its variants have proven to
be an effective technique for the classification of different natural signals
such as audio, video, acoustic and images. In this paper, a Hybrid Multilayer
Extreme Learning Machine (HML-ELM) that is based on ELM-based autoencoder
(ELM-AE) and an Interval Type-2 fuzzy Logic theory is suggested for active
image classification and applied to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The
proposed methodology is a hierarchical ELM learning framework that consists of
two main phases: 1) self-taught feature extraction and 2) supervised feature
classification. First, unsupervised multilayer feature encoding is achieved by
stacking a number of ELM-AEs, in which input data is projected into a number of
high-level representations. At the second phase, the final features are
classified using a novel Simplified Interval Type-2 Fuzzy ELM (SIT2-FELM) with
a fast output reduction layer based on the SC algorithm; an improved version of
the algorithm Center of Sets Type Reducer without Sorting Requirement
(COSTRWSR). To validate the efficiency of the HML-ELM, two types of experiments
for the classification of images are suggested. First, the HML-ELM is applied
to solve a number of benchmark problems for image classification. Secondly, a
number of real experiments to the active classification and transport of four
different objects between two predefined locations using a UAV is implemented.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed HML-ELM delivers a superior
efficiency compared to other similar methodologies such as ML-ELM, Multilayer
Fuzzy Extreme Learning Machine (ML-FELM) and ELM.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates machine learning methods for cloud and shadow masking in hyperspectral imaging, finding CNNs with feature reduction most efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve preprocessing of hyperspectral satellite images by identifying the best machine learning models for cloud and shadow masking.

Method: Evaluated gradient boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM) and CNNs, focusing on accuracy, storage, and inference speed.

Result: All models exceeded 93% accuracy; CNNs with feature reduction were most efficient, balancing accuracy, storage, and speed.

Conclusion: Lightweight AI models, especially CNNs, are viable for real-time hyperspectral image processing in satellite applications.

Abstract: Cloud and cloud shadow masking is a crucial preprocessing step in
hyperspectral satellite imaging, enabling the extraction of high-quality,
analysis-ready data. This study evaluates various machine learning approaches,
including gradient boosting methods such as XGBoost and LightGBM as well as
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). All boosting and CNN models achieved
accuracies exceeding 93%. Among the investigated models, the CNN with feature
reduction emerged as the most efficient, offering a balance of high accuracy,
low storage requirements, and rapid inference times on both CPUs and GPUs.
Variations of this version, with only up to 597 trainable parameters,
demonstrated the best trade-off in terms of deployment feasibility, accuracy,
and computational efficiency. These results demonstrate the potential of
lightweight artificial intelligence (AI) models for real-time hyperspectral
image processing, supporting the development of on-board satellite AI systems
for space-based applications.

### [8] [The relative importance of being Gaussian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08059)
*F. Alberto Grünbaum,Tondgi Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the performance of denoising algorithms, originally designed for Gaussian noise, when applied to non-Gaussian noise (e.g., uniform, Beta, or mixed Gaussian distributions), without modifying the algorithm. Experiments are conducted on a small laptop with minimal image sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether denoising algorithms, optimized for Gaussian noise, can perform effectively with non-Gaussian noise without algorithmic adjustments.

Method: The study applies the same denoising algorithm to images corrupted with non-Gaussian noise (uniform, Beta, or mixed Gaussian distributions) and evaluates performance. Experiments are conducted on a small-scale setup (laptop, minimal image sizes).

Result: The paper does not specify explicit results but highlights the challenge of confirming or adapting observations in varied settings.

Conclusion: The study raises questions about the robustness of Gaussian-optimized denoising algorithms for non-Gaussian noise and suggests further exploration in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: The remarkable results for denoising in computer vision using diffusion
models given in \cite{SDWMG,HJA,HHG} yield a robust mathematical justification
for algorithms based on crucial properties of a sequence of Gaussian
independent $N(0,1)$ random variables. In particular the derivations use the
fact that a Gaussian distribution is determined by its mean and variance and
that the sum of two Gaussians is another Gaussian.
  \bigskip
  The issue raised in this short note is the following: suppose we use the
algorithm without any changes but replace the nature of the noise and use, for
instance, uniformly distributed noise or noise with a Beta distribution, or
noise which is a random superposition of two Gaussians with very different
variances. One could, of course, try to modify the algorithm keeping in mind
the nature of the noise, but this is not what we do. Instead we study the
performance of the algorithm when used with noise that is very far in nature
from the Gaussian case, where it is designed to work well.
  Usually these algorithms are implemented on very powerful computers. Our
experiments are all carried out on a small laptop and for the smallest possible
image size. Exploring how our observations are confirmed or changed when
dealing in different situations remains an interesting challenge.

### [9] [An Object-Based Deep Learning Approach for Building Height Estimation from Single SAR Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08096)
*Babak Memar,Luigi Russo,Silvia Liberata Ullo,Paolo Gamba*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A DL-based method for estimating building heights from VHR SAR images, tested on diverse cities, shows strong performance in Europe but faces challenges in Asia due to urban variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate building height estimation is vital for urban applications, and this study explores DL's potential for robust cross-continental transfer learning.

Method: Uses an object-based regression approach with bounding box detection and height estimation, trained on a multi-continental dataset with cross-validation.

Result: Achieves a MAE of ~2.20m in Munich, outperforming state-of-the-art methods, but struggles with variability in Asian cities.

Conclusion: DL shows promise for cross-city height estimation but requires adaptation for diverse urban typologies.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of building heights using very high resolution (VHR)
synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is crucial for various urban
applications. This paper introduces a Deep Learning (DL)-based methodology for
automated building height estimation from single VHR COSMO-SkyMed images: an
object-based regression approach based on bounding box detection followed by
height estimation. This model was trained and evaluated on a unique
multi-continental dataset comprising eight geographically diverse cities across
Europe, North and South America, and Asia, employing a cross-validation
strategy to explicitly assess out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. The
results demonstrate highly promising performance, particularly on European
cities where the model achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of approximately
one building story (2.20 m in Munich), significantly outperforming recent
state-of-the-art methods in similar OOD scenarios. Despite the increased
variability observed when generalizing to cities in other continents,
particularly in Asia with its distinct urban typologies and prevalence of
high-rise structures, this study underscores the significant potential of DL
for robust cross-city and cross-continental transfer learning in building
height estimation from single VHR SAR data.

### [10] [RegGS: Unposed Sparse Views Gaussian Splatting with 3DGS Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08136)
*Chong Cheng,Yu Hu,Sicheng Yu,Beizhen Zhao,Zijian Wang,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RegGS is a 3D Gaussian registration framework for reconstructing unposed sparse views, combining feed-forward networks and optimal transport for alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS methods struggle with sparse views due to limited priors or input constraints.

Method: RegGS uses an entropy-regularized Sinkhorn algorithm for optimal transport alignment (MW₂ distance) and integrates photometric consistency and depth geometry for joint registration.

Result: RegGS achieves high-fidelity registration, precise pose estimation, and high-quality novel-view synthesis on RE10K and ACID datasets.

Conclusion: RegGS effectively addresses sparse-view reconstruction challenges, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its potential in reconstructing
scenes from unposed images. However, optimization-based 3DGS methods struggle
with sparse views due to limited prior knowledge. Meanwhile, feed-forward
Gaussian approaches are constrained by input formats, making it challenging to
incorporate more input views. To address these challenges, we propose RegGS, a
3D Gaussian registration-based framework for reconstructing unposed sparse
views. RegGS aligns local 3D Gaussians generated by a feed-forward network into
a globally consistent 3D Gaussian representation. Technically, we implement an
entropy-regularized Sinkhorn algorithm to efficiently solve the optimal
transport Mixture 2-Wasserstein $(\text{MW}_2)$ distance, which serves as an
alignment metric for Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) in $\mathrm{Sim}(3)$ space.
Furthermore, we design a joint 3DGS registration module that integrates the
$\text{MW}_2$ distance, photometric consistency, and depth geometry. This
enables a coarse-to-fine registration process while accurately estimating
camera poses and aligning the scene. Experiments on the RE10K and ACID datasets
demonstrate that RegGS effectively registers local Gaussians with high
fidelity, achieving precise pose estimation and high-quality novel-view
synthesis. Project page: https://3dagentworld.github.io/reggs/.

### [11] [Temporally Consistent Amodal Completion for 3D Human-Object Interaction Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08137)
*Hyungjun Doh,Dong In Lee,Seunggeun Chi,Pin-Hao Huang,Kwonjoon Lee,Sangpil Kim,Karthik Ramani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for reconstructing dynamic human-object interactions from monocular video, addressing occlusions and temporal inconsistencies using amodal completion and temporal context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D reconstruction methods fail under occlusions and dynamic conditions, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: Leverages amodal completion and temporal context to refine reconstructions incrementally without predefined models.

Result: Superior precision in handling occlusions and temporal stability compared to existing techniques, validated using 3D Gaussian Splatting.

Conclusion: The framework effectively overcomes challenges in dynamic scene reconstruction, offering improved accuracy and adaptability.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for reconstructing dynamic human-object
interactions from monocular video that overcomes challenges associated with
occlusions and temporal inconsistencies. Traditional 3D reconstruction methods
typically assume static objects or full visibility of dynamic subjects, leading
to degraded performance when these assumptions are violated-particularly in
scenarios where mutual occlusions occur. To address this, our framework
leverages amodal completion to infer the complete structure of partially
obscured regions. Unlike conventional approaches that operate on individual
frames, our method integrates temporal context, enforcing coherence across
video sequences to incrementally refine and stabilize reconstructions. This
template-free strategy adapts to varying conditions without relying on
predefined models, significantly enhancing the recovery of intricate details in
dynamic scenes. We validate our approach using 3D Gaussian Splatting on
challenging monocular videos, demonstrating superior precision in handling
occlusions and maintaining temporal stability compared to existing techniques.

*Frederick Shpilevskiy,Saiyue Lyu,Krishnamurthy Dj Dvijotham,Mathias Lécuyer,Pierre-André Noël*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adaptive Diffusion Denoised Smoothing certifies vision model predictions against adversarial examples by reinterpreting guided denoising diffusion as adaptive GDP mechanisms, improving certified and standard accuracy on ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance robustness of vision models against adversarial attacks by leveraging adaptive mechanisms in denoising diffusion processes.

Method: Reinterpret guided denoising diffusion as adaptive GDP mechanisms, compose them via a GDP privacy filter, and analyze robustness for provable certification.

Result: Improved certified and standard accuracy on ImageNet under an ℓ₂ threat model.

Conclusion: The method effectively certifies predictions and adapts to inputs, enhancing model robustness.

Abstract: We propose Adaptive Diffusion Denoised Smoothing, a method for certifying the
predictions of a vision model against adversarial examples, while adapting to
the input. Our key insight is to reinterpret a guided denoising diffusion model
as a long sequence of adaptive Gaussian Differentially Private (GDP) mechanisms
refining a pure noise sample into an image. We show that these adaptive
mechanisms can be composed through a GDP privacy filter to analyze the
end-to-end robustness of the guided denoising process, yielding a provable
certification that extends the adaptive randomized smoothing analysis. We
demonstrate that our design, under a specific guiding strategy, can improve
both certified accuracy and standard accuracy on ImageNet for an $\ell_2$
threat model.

*Jareen Anjom,Rashik Iram Chowdhury,Tarbia Hasan,Md. Ishan Arefin Hossain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight real-time system using transfer learning for depth estimation and object detection to assist visually impaired people in navigating urban obstacles in Bangladesh.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visually impaired individuals face daily challenges and injuries due to urban obstructions; a proactive alert system is needed.

Method: Utilizes transfer learning for depth estimation and object detection, optimized with quantization for lightweight deployment.

Result: Achieved a real-time model with mAP50 of 0.801, effectively detecting nearby objects.

Conclusion: The proposed system successfully aids visually impaired commuters by providing timely alerts for nearby obstacles.

Abstract: Visually impaired people face significant challenges in their day-to-day
commutes in the urban cities of Bangladesh due to the vast number of
obstructions on every path. With many injuries taking place through road
accidents on a daily basis, it is paramount for a system to be developed that
can alert the visually impaired of objects at close distance beforehand. To
overcome this issue, a novel alert system is proposed in this research to
assist the visually impaired in commuting through these busy streets without
colliding with any objects. The proposed system can alert the individual to
objects that are present at a close distance. It utilizes transfer learning to
train models for depth estimation and object detection, and combines both
models to introduce a novel system. The models are optimized through the
utilization of quantization techniques to make them lightweight and efficient,
allowing them to be easily deployed on embedded systems. The proposed solution
achieved a lightweight real-time depth estimation and object detection model
with an mAP50 of 0.801.

### [14] [HNOSeg-XS: Extremely Small Hartley Neural Operator for Efficient and Resolution-Robust 3D Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08205)
*Ken C. L. Wong,Hongzhi Wang,Tanveer Syeda-Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes HNOSeg-XS, a resolution-robust medical image segmentation model using Hartley transform for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitations of CNNs and transformers in medical image segmentation, such as computational cost and resolution dependency.

Method: Uses learnable partial differential equations via Fourier neural operator, modified with Hartley transform for efficiency.

Result: Achieves superior resolution robustness, speed (<0.24s), memory efficiency (<1.8 GiB), and parameter efficiency (<34.7k parameters).

Conclusion: HNOSeg-XS outperforms CNNs and transformers in efficiency and robustness for medical image segmentation.

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
transformers are dominant. For CNNs, given the local receptive fields of
convolutional layers, long-range spatial correlations are captured through
consecutive convolutions and pooling. However, as the computational cost and
memory footprint can be prohibitively large, 3D models can only afford fewer
layers than 2D models with reduced receptive fields and abstract levels. For
transformers, although long-range correlations can be captured by multi-head
attention, its quadratic complexity with respect to input size is
computationally demanding. Therefore, either model may require input size
reduction to allow more filters and layers for better segmentation.
Nevertheless, given their discrete nature, models trained with patch-wise
training or image downsampling may produce suboptimal results when applied on
higher resolutions. To address this issue, here we propose the
resolution-robust HNOSeg-XS architecture. We model image segmentation by
learnable partial differential equations through the Fourier neural operator
which has the zero-shot super-resolution property. By replacing the Fourier
transform by the Hartley transform and reformulating the problem in the
frequency domain, we created the HNOSeg-XS model, which is resolution robust,
fast, memory efficient, and extremely parameter efficient. When tested on the
BraTS'23, KiTS'23, and MVSeg'23 datasets with a Tesla V100 GPU, HNOSeg-XS
showed its superior resolution robustness with fewer than 34.7k model
parameters. It also achieved the overall best inference time (< 0.24 s) and
memory efficiency (< 1.8 GiB) compared to the tested CNN and transformer
models.

*Jackson Borchardt,Saul Kato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SurfDist is a CNN architecture for 3D volumetric instance segmentation, improving upon StarDist-3D by decoupling instance parameterization from voxel resolution and enabling high-resolution predictions without artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of StarDist-3D, particularly its coupling of instance parameterization and voxel resolution, and to enable smoother, higher-resolution instance segmentation.

Method: Modifies StarDist-3D to predict instances as closed surfaces with smooth parametric patches (bicubic Bézier triangles), allowing flexible upsampling.

Result: Outperforms StarDist-3D on blob-shaped instances in biomedical imaging, with more compact parameterizations and fewer artifacts.

Conclusion: SurfDist effectively learns interpretable instance surface models while maintaining instance membership accuracy, demonstrating its superiority in specific use cases.

Abstract: We present SurfDist, a convolutional neural network architecture for
three-dimensional volumetric instance segmentation. SurfDist enables prediction
of instances represented as closed surfaces composed of smooth parametric
surface patches, specifically bicubic B\'ezier triangles. SurfDist is a
modification of the popular model architecture StarDist-3D which breaks
StarDist-3D's coupling of instance parameterization dimension and instance
voxel resolution, and it produces predictions which may be upsampled to
arbitrarily high resolutions without introduction of voxelization artifacts.
  For datasets with blob-shaped instances, common in biomedical imaging,
SurfDist can outperform StarDist-3D with more compact instance
parameterizations. We detail SurfDist's technical implementation and show one
synthetic and one real-world dataset for which it outperforms StarDist-3D.
These results demonstrate that interpretable instance surface models can be
learned effectively alongside instance membership.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate fungi species identification is challenging due to fine-grained variations, addressed through the FungiCLEF 2025 competition.

Method: Used vision transformers, data augmentation, weighted sampling, and textual information; explored generative AI for zero-shot classification.

Result: Final model outperformed baselines, ranking 35/74, with domain-specific pretraining and balanced sampling proving effective.

Conclusion: Domain-specific pretraining and balanced sampling are effective, but metadata and multi-modal learning need further refinement.

Abstract: Accurate identification of fungi species presents a unique challenge in
computer vision due to fine-grained inter-species variation and high
intra-species variation. This paper presents our approach for the FungiCLEF
2025 competition, which focuses on few-shot fine-grained visual categorization
(FGVC) using the FungiTastic Few-Shot dataset. Our team (DS@GT) experimented
with multiple vision transformer models, data augmentation, weighted sampling,
and incorporating textual information. We also explored generative AI models
for zero-shot classification using structured prompting but found them to
significantly underperform relative to vision-based models. Our final model
outperformed both competition baselines and highlighted the effectiveness of
domain specific pretraining and balanced sampling strategies. Our approach
ranked 35/74 on the private test set in post-completion evaluation, this
suggests additional work can be done on metadata selection and domain-adapted
multi-modal learning. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Portable Biomechanics Laboratory (PBL), a smartphone-based tool for objectively measuring movement in clinical settings, validated across diverse populations and shown to correlate with clinical outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Movement is a key indicator of health but is underutilized due to lack of accessible measurement tools. PBL aims to bridge this gap.

Method: PBL combines a cloud-enabled smartphone app for data collection and a novel algorithm for biomechanical modeling, validated on a large clinical dataset.

Result: PBL achieved joint angle errors within 3 degrees and demonstrated high reliability and sensitivity to clinical differences, outperforming patient-reported outcomes in some cases.

Conclusion: PBL offers a scalable, low-burden solution for biomechanical measurement, enabling accessible monitoring of mobility impairments.

Abstract: The way a person moves is a direct reflection of their neurological and
musculoskeletal health, yet it remains one of the most underutilized vital
signs in clinical practice. Although clinicians visually observe movement
impairments, they lack accessible and validated methods to objectively measure
movement in routine care. This gap prevents wider use of biomechanical
measurements in practice, which could enable more sensitive outcome measures or
earlier identification of impairment. We present our Portable Biomechanics
Laboratory (PBL), which includes a secure, cloud-enabled smartphone app for
data collection and a novel algorithm for fitting biomechanical models to this
data. We extensively validated PBL's biomechanical measures using a large,
clinically representative dataset. Next, we tested the usability and utility of
our system in neurosurgery and sports medicine clinics. We found joint angle
errors within 3 degrees across participants with neurological injury,
lower-limb prosthesis users, pediatric inpatients, and controls. In addition to
being easy to use, gait metrics computed from the PBL showed high reliability
and were sensitive to clinical differences. For example, in individuals
undergoing decompression surgery for cervical myelopathy, the mJOA score is a
common patient-reported outcome measure; we found that PBL gait metrics
correlated with mJOA scores and demonstrated greater responsiveness to surgical
intervention than the patient-reported outcomes. These findings support the use
of handheld smartphone video as a scalable, low-burden tool for capturing
clinically meaningful biomechanical data, offering a promising path toward
accessible monitoring of mobility impairments. We release the first clinically
validated method for measuring whole-body kinematics from handheld smartphone
video at

### [19] [Cross-Resolution SAR Target Detection Using Structural Hierarchy Adaptation and Reliable Adjacency Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08290)
*Jiang Qin,Bin Zou,Haolin Li,Lamei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CR-Net improves cross-resolution SAR target detection by integrating structure priors and evidential learning, achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Higher SAR resolution causes scattering discrepancies, challenging model generalization. Domain adaptation struggles with blind feature adaptation and unreliable semantics.

Method: CR-Net uses SHFA for structure-aware feature adaptation and RSAA for reliable semantic alignment, enhancing discriminability.

Result: CR-Net outperforms in cross-resolution SAR target detection, preserving intra-domain structures and improving discriminability.

Conclusion: CR-Net effectively addresses cross-resolution challenges, setting a new benchmark in SAR target detection.

Abstract: In recent years, continuous improvements in SAR resolution have significantly
benefited applications such as urban monitoring and target detection. However,
the improvement in resolution leads to increased discrepancies in scattering
characteristics, posing challenges to the generalization ability of target
detection models. While domain adaptation technology is a potential solution,
the inevitable discrepancies caused by resolution differences often lead to
blind feature adaptation and unreliable semantic propagation, ultimately
degrading the domain adaptation performance. To address these challenges, this
paper proposes a novel SAR target detection method (termed CR-Net), that
incorporates structure priors and evidential learning theory into the detection
model, enabling reliable domain adaptation for cross-resolution detection. To
be specific, CR-Net integrates Structure-induced Hierarchical Feature
Adaptation (SHFA) and Reliable Structural Adjacency Alignment (RSAA). SHFA
module is introduced to establish structural correlations between targets and
achieve structure-aware feature adaptation, thereby enhancing the
interpretability of the feature adaptation process. Afterwards, the RSAA module
is proposed to enhance reliable semantic alignment, by leveraging the secure
adjacency set to transfer valuable discriminative knowledge from the source
domain to the target domain. This further improves the discriminability of the
detection model in the target domain. Based on experimental results from
different-resolution datasets,the proposed CR-Net significantly enhances
cross-resolution adaptation by preserving intra-domain structures and improving
discriminability. It achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in
cross-resolution SAR target detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M2DAO-Talker improves audio-driven talking head generation by decoupling multi-granular motions and alternating optimization, achieving better quality and realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing rendering artifacts like motion blur and penetration in 3D talking head generation methods.

Method: Proposes a unified framework with video preprocessing, motion representation, and rendering reconstruction, featuring multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating optimization.

Result: Achieves 2.43 dB PSNR improvement and 0.64 gain in user-evaluated realness, with 150 FPS speed.

Conclusion: M2DAO-Talker outperforms existing methods in quality and realism, offering practical benefits for film production.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head generation holds significant potential for film
production. While existing 3D methods have advanced motion modeling and content
synthesis, they often produce rendering artifacts, such as motion blur,
temporal jitter, and local penetration, due to limitations in representing
stable, fine-grained motion fields. Through systematic analysis, we reformulate
talking head generation into a unified framework comprising three steps: video
preprocessing, motion representation, and rendering reconstruction. This
framework underpins our proposed M2DAO-Talker, which addresses current
limitations via multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating
optimization.Specifically, we devise a novel 2D portrait preprocessing pipeline
to extract frame-wise deformation control conditions (motion region
segmentation masks, and camera parameters) to facilitate motion representation.
To ameliorate motion modeling, we elaborate a multi-granular motion decoupling
strategy, which independently models non-rigid (oral and facial) and rigid
(head) motions for improved reconstruction accuracy.Meanwhile, a motion
consistency constraint is developed to ensure head-torso kinematic consistency,
thereby mitigating penetration artifacts caused by motion aliasing. In
addition, an alternating optimization strategy is designed to iteratively
refine facial and oral motion parameters, enabling more realistic video
generation.Experiments across multiple datasets show that M2DAO-Talker achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with the 2.43 dB PSNR improvement in generation
quality and 0.64 gain in user-evaluated video realness versus TalkingGaussian
while with 150 FPS inference speed. Our project homepage is

*Ravi Shankar Prasad,Dinesh Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework using convolutional Siamese networks for craniofacial reconstruction in forensic science, achieving satisfactory identification results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve forensic identification by mapping skull X-rays to corresponding faces using deep learning.

Method: Uses Siamese networks trained on a custom dataset of 40 volunteers' skull X-rays and face images, minimizing Euclidean distance for similar pairs and maximizing for dissimilar ones.

Result: Satisfactory identification results were achieved on the cross-domain dataset.

Conclusion: The framework effectively identifies individuals from skull X-rays, demonstrating the potential of Siamese networks in forensic science.

Abstract: Craniofacial reconstruction in forensic science is crucial for the
identification of the victims of crimes and disasters. The objective is to map
a given skull to its corresponding face in a corpus of faces with known
identities using recent advancements in computer vision, such as deep learning.
In this paper, we presented a framework for the identification of a person
given the X-ray image of a skull using convolutional Siamese networks for
cross-domain identity representation. Siamese networks are twin networks that
share the same architecture and can be trained to discover a feature space
where nearby observations that are similar are grouped and dissimilar
observations are moved apart. To do this, the network is exposed to two sets of
comparable and different data. The Euclidean distance is then minimized between
similar pairs and maximized between dissimilar ones. Since getting pairs of
skull and face images are difficult, we prepared our own dataset of 40
volunteers whose front and side skull X-ray images and optical face images were
collected. Experiments were conducted on the collected cross-domain dataset to
train and validate the Siamese networks. The experimental results provide
satisfactory results on the identification of a person from the given skull.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an interpretability-guided pruning framework to reduce deep learning model complexity while maintaining performance and transparency in medical image analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advances in medical image analysis, large model sizes and lack of transparency hinder clinical adoption. Interpretability techniques can address this by identifying relevant model components.

Method: The proposed framework uses interpretability techniques (e.g., DL-Backtrace, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation) to prune less relevant parts of neural networks, preserving clinically meaningful representations.

Result: Experiments show the method achieves high compression rates with minimal accuracy loss across medical image classification benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework enables lightweight, interpretable models suitable for real-world healthcare deployment, balancing performance and transparency.

Abstract: Deep learning has driven significant advances in medical image analysis, yet
its adoption in clinical practice remains constrained by the large size and
lack of transparency in modern models. Advances in interpretability techniques
such as DL-Backtrace, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, and Integrated
Gradients make it possible to assess the contribution of individual components
within neural networks trained on medical imaging tasks. In this work, we
introduce an interpretability-guided pruning framework that reduces model
complexity while preserving both predictive performance and transparency. By
selectively retaining only the most relevant parts of each layer, our method
enables targeted compression that maintains clinically meaningful
representations. Experiments across multiple medical image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that this approach achieves high compression rates with
minimal loss in accuracy, paving the way for lightweight, interpretable models
suited for real-world deployment in healthcare settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoCo-Bot improves generative CBMs by eliminating auxiliary cues, enhancing interpretability and controllability through explicit concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous generative CBMs rely on auxiliary visual cues, compromising interpretability and compositionality.

Method: CoCo-Bot uses diffusion-based energy functions to transmit all information through explicit concepts, supporting post-hoc interventions like composition and negation.

Result: Experiments on StyleGAN2 (CelebA-HQ) show improved concept-level controllability and interpretability without sacrificing visual quality.

Conclusion: CoCo-Bot advances generative CBMs by ensuring interpretability and robust post-hoc interventions.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide interpretable and controllable
generative modeling by routing generation through explicit,
human-understandable concepts. However, previous generative CBMs often rely on
auxiliary visual cues at the bottleneck to compensate for information not
captured by the concepts, which undermines interpretability and
compositionality. We propose CoCo-Bot, a post-hoc, composable concept
bottleneck generative model that eliminates the need for auxiliary cues by
transmitting all information solely through explicit concepts. Guided by
diffusion-based energy functions, CoCo-Bot supports robust post-hoc
interventions-such as concept composition and negation-across arbitrary
concepts. Experiments using StyleGAN2 pre-trained on CelebA-HQ show that
CoCo-Bot improves concept-level controllability and interpretability, while
maintaining competitive visual quality.

*Jia-Xuan Jiang,Jiashuai Liu,Hongtao Wu,Yifeng Wu,Zhong Wang,Qi Bi,Yefeng Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the poor generalization of multimodal prognosis models across cancer types and introduces two modules, SDIR and CADE, to improve robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal methods for survival prediction lack generalization across cancers, limiting clinical utility.

Method: Proposes Cross-Cancer Single Domain Generalization task and introduces SDIR (for feature rebalancing) and CADE (for domain synthesis).

Result: Experiments show superior generalization on a four-cancer-type benchmark.

Conclusion: The work lays a foundation for robust cross-cancer multimodal prognosis, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Deep learning has shown remarkable performance in integrating multimodal data
for survival prediction. However, existing multimodal methods mainly focus on
single cancer types and overlook the challenge of generalization across
cancers. In this work, we are the first to reveal that multimodal prognosis
models often generalize worse than unimodal ones in cross-cancer scenarios,
despite the critical need for such robustness in clinical practice. To address
this, we propose a new task: Cross-Cancer Single Domain Generalization for
Multimodal Prognosis, which evaluates whether models trained on a single cancer
type can generalize to unseen cancers. We identify two key challenges: degraded
features from weaker modalities and ineffective multimodal integration. To
tackle these, we introduce two plug-and-play modules: Sparse Dirac Information
Rebalancer (SDIR) and Cancer-aware Distribution Entanglement (CADE). SDIR
mitigates the dominance of strong features by applying Bernoulli-based
sparsification and Dirac-inspired stabilization to enhance weaker modality
signals. CADE, designed to synthesize the target domain distribution, fuses
local morphological cues and global gene expression in latent space.
Experiments on a four-cancer-type benchmark demonstrate superior
generalization, laying the foundation for practical, robust cross-cancer
multimodal prognosis. Code is available at

*Junxue Yang,Xin Liao,Weixuan Tang,Jianhua Yang,Zheng Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MRAG introduces a multi-range adversarial stego generation framework for deep hiding in JPEG images, combining convolution and transformer operators for improved steganalysis resistance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep hiding schemes are easily detected due to large payloads and limited feature extraction methods.

Method: MRAG integrates local-range convolution and global-range transformer, uses multi-grained frequency decomposition, and employs a features angle-norm disentanglement loss.

Result: MRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance in secret restorability and imperceptibility.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances stego generation robustness against steganalyzers.

Abstract: Deep hiding has been exploring the hiding capability of deep learning-based
models, aiming to conceal image-level messages into cover images and reveal
them from generated stego images. Existing schemes are easily detected by
steganalyzers due to their large payloads and their limitation to feature
extraction based solely on either pure convolution or pure transformer
operators within a single range, as well as pixel-level loss constraints. To
address the issue, in this paper, we introduce generation-based adversarial
attacks into color JPEG image deep hiding and propose a multi-range
representations-driven adversarial stego generation framework called MRAG from
a steganalysis perspective. Specifically, we integrate the local-range neighbor
reception characteristic of the convolution and the global-range dependency
modeling of the transformer to construct MRAG. Meanwhile, we use the
transformed images obtained through coarse-grained and fine-grained frequency
decomposition as inputs, introducing multi-grained information. Furthermore, a
features angle-norm disentanglement loss is designed to constrain the generated
stegos closer to covers in the angle and norm space of the steganalyzer's
classified features. Consequently, small yet effective adversarial
perturbations can be injected into the process of generating stegos, ensuring
that stegos maintain favorable secret restorability and imperceptibility.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRAG can achieve state-of-the-art
performance.

*Shishuai Hu,Zehui Liao,Liangli Zhen,Huazhu Fu,Yong Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cycle Context Verification (CCV), a framework to improve in-context learning (ICL) for medical image segmentation by self-verifying predictions and enhancing contextual alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICL's performance in medical image segmentation is sensitive to query-context alignment, and fine-tuning is impractical due to computational costs and catastrophic forgetting.

Method: CCV uses a cyclic pipeline to generate and verify segmentation masks, improving alignment via query-specific prompts.

Result: CCV outperforms existing methods on seven datasets, demonstrating robust universal segmentation.

Conclusion: CCV enhances ICL-based segmentation, offering a practical solution for universal medical image segmentation.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is emerging as a promising technique for achieving
universal medical image segmentation, where a variety of objects of interest
across imaging modalities can be segmented using a single model. Nevertheless,
its performance is highly sensitive to the alignment between the query image
and in-context image-mask pairs. In a clinical scenario, the scarcity of
annotated medical images makes it challenging to select optimal in-context
pairs, and fine-tuning foundation ICL models on contextual data is infeasible
due to computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address
this challenge, we propose Cycle Context Verification (CCV), a novel framework
that enhances ICL-based medical image segmentation by enabling
self-verification of predictions and accordingly enhancing contextual
alignment. Specifically, CCV employs a cyclic pipeline in which the model
initially generates a segmentation mask for the query image. Subsequently, the
roles of the query and an in-context pair are swapped, allowing the model to
validate its prediction by predicting the mask of the original in-context
image. The accuracy of this secondary prediction serves as an implicit measure
of the initial query segmentation. A query-specific prompt is introduced to
alter the query image and updated to improve the measure, thereby enhancing the
alignment between the query and in-context pairs. We evaluated CCV on seven
medical image segmentation datasets using two ICL foundation models,
demonstrating its superiority over existing methods. Our results highlight
CCV's ability to enhance ICL-based segmentation, making it a robust solution
for universal medical image segmentation. The code will be available at

TL;DR: The study evaluates ChatGPT-4o's ability to interpret traffic scenes for elderly driver assessments, showing improved performance with better prompts, though challenges remain in ambiguous scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if multimodal LLMs like ChatGPT-4o can perform human-like traffic scene interpretations for elderly driver evaluations.

Method: Used zero-shot, few-shot, and multi-shot prompting strategies on static dashcam images, comparing model performance to human annotations via precision, recall, and F1-score.

Result: Prompt design significantly impacted performance, with recall for intersection visibility rising from 21.7% to 57.0%. Traffic density agreement improved from 53.5% to 67.6%. Stop-sign detection had high precision (86.3%) but lower recall (76.7%).

Conclusion: Well-designed prompts make LLMs promising for driving risk assessments, but future work should explore scalability and diverse datasets.

Abstract: This study investigates the potential of a multimodal large language model
(LLM), specifically ChatGPT-4o, to perform human-like interpretations of
traffic scenes using static dashcam images. Herein, we focus on three judgment
tasks relevant to elderly driver assessments: evaluating traffic density,
assessing intersection visibility, and recognizing stop signs recognition.
These tasks require contextual reasoning rather than simple object detection.
Using zero-shot, few-shot, and multi-shot prompting strategies, we evaluated
the performance of the model with human annotations serving as the reference
standard. Evaluation metrics included precision, recall, and F1-score. Results
indicate that prompt design considerably affects performance, with recall for
intersection visibility increasing from 21.7% (zero-shot) to 57.0%
(multi-shot). For traffic density, agreement increased from 53.5% to 67.6%. In
stop-sign detection, the model demonstrated high precision (up to 86.3%) but a
lower recall (approximately 76.7%), indicating a conservative response
tendency. Output stability analysis revealed that humans and the model faced
difficulties interpreting structurally ambiguous scenes. However, the model's
explanatory texts corresponded with its predictions, enhancing
interpretability. These findings suggest that, with well-designed prompts, LLMs
hold promise as supportive tools for scene-level driving risk assessments.
Future studies should explore scalability using larger datasets, diverse
annotators, and next-generation model architectures for elderly driver
assessments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GEFU, a generalized bridge between low-light enhancement and understanding, using pretrained diffusion models and SCUF for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods treat low-light enhancement and understanding separately, limiting generalization and scalability.

Method: Leverages pretrained generative diffusion models for zero-shot generalization and introduces SCUF with illumination-aware prompts and cycle-attention adapters.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in image quality and tasks like classification, detection, and segmentation.

Conclusion: GEFU successfully bridges low-light enhancement and understanding, improving both generalization and scalability.

Abstract: Low-level enhancement and high-level visual understanding in low-light vision
have traditionally been treated separately. Low-light enhancement improves
image quality for downstream tasks, but existing methods rely on physical or
geometric priors, limiting generalization. Evaluation mainly focuses on visual
quality rather than downstream performance. Low-light visual understanding,
constrained by scarce labeled data, primarily uses task-specific domain
adaptation, which lacks scalability. To address these challenges, we build a
generalized bridge between low-light enhancement and low-light understanding,
which we term Generalized Enhancement For Understanding (GEFU). This paradigm
improves both generalization and scalability. To address the diverse causes of
low-light degradation, we leverage pretrained generative diffusion models to
optimize images, achieving zero-shot generalization performance. Building on
this, we propose Semantically Consistent Unsupervised Fine-tuning (SCUF).
Specifically, to overcome text prompt limitations, we introduce an
illumination-aware image prompt to explicitly guide image generation and
propose a cycle-attention adapter to maximize its semantic potential. To
mitigate semantic degradation in unsupervised training, we propose caption and
reflectance consistency to learn high-level semantics and image-level spatial
semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in traditional image quality and
GEFU tasks including classification, detection, and semantic segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the ODOR dataset, addressing gaps in existing datasets for artwork object detection by providing extensive annotations and challenging properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for artwork object detection are biased and limited in fine-grained categories, necessitating a more robust dataset like ODOR.

Method: The ODOR dataset includes 38,116 object-level annotations across 4712 images, covering 139 fine-grained categories, with statistical analysis and baseline model evaluations.

Result: The dataset exhibits challenging properties like dense objects and spatial distribution, and baseline analyses highlight its difficulty for object detection models.

Conclusion: ODOR inspires further research in artwork object detection and cultural heritage studies, particularly in exploring object recognition and smell perception.

Abstract: Real-world applications of computer vision in the humanities require
algorithms to be robust against artistic abstraction, peripheral objects, and
subtle differences between fine-grained target classes. Existing datasets
provide instance-level annotations on artworks but are generally biased towards
the image centre and limited with regard to detailed object classes. The
proposed ODOR dataset fills this gap, offering 38,116 object-level annotations
across 4712 images, spanning an extensive set of 139 fine-grained categories.
Conducting a statistical analysis, we showcase challenging dataset properties,
such as a detailed set of categories, dense and overlapping objects, and
spatial distribution over the whole image canvas. Furthermore, we provide an
extensive baseline analysis for object detection models and highlight the
challenging properties of the dataset through a set of secondary studies.
Inspiring further research on artwork object detection and broader visual
cultural heritage studies, the dataset challenges researchers to explore the
intersection of object recognition and smell perception.

*Zhanxin Gao,Beier Zhu,Liang Yao,Jian Yang,Ying Tai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoDi is a two-stage framework for text-to-image models that ensures subject consistency while maintaining pose and layout diversity, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for subject-consistent generation (SCG) often sacrifice layout and pose diversity, limiting expressive storytelling. CoDi addresses this by balancing consistency and diversity.

Method: CoDi uses a two-stage strategy: Identity Transport (IT) for pose-aware identity feature transfer in early denoising steps, and Identity Refinement (IR) for refining subject details in later steps.

Result: CoDi achieves superior subject consistency, pose diversity, and prompt fidelity, validated by qualitative and quantitative results.

Conclusion: CoDi effectively balances subject consistency with pose and layout diversity, enhancing visual storytelling in text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Subject-consistent generation (SCG)-aiming to maintain a consistent subject
identity across diverse scenes-remains a challenge for text-to-image (T2I)
models. Existing training-free SCG methods often achieve consistency at the
cost of layout and pose diversity, hindering expressive visual storytelling. To
address the limitation, we propose subject-Consistent and pose-Diverse T2I
framework, dubbed as CoDi, that enables consistent subject generation with
diverse pose and layout. Motivated by the progressive nature of diffusion,
where coarse structures emerge early and fine details are refined later, CoDi
adopts a two-stage strategy: Identity Transport (IT) and Identity Refinement
(IR). IT operates in the early denoising steps, using optimal transport to
transfer identity features to each target image in a pose-aware manner. This
promotes subject consistency while preserving pose diversity. IR is applied in
the later denoising steps, selecting the most salient identity features to
further refine subject details. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results
on subject consistency, pose diversity, and prompt fidelity demonstrate that
CoDi achieves both better visual perception and stronger performance across all
metrics. The code is provided in https://github.com/NJU-PCALab/CoDi.

*Yongjian Zhang,Longguang Wang,Kunhong Li,Ye Zhang,Yun Wang,Liang Lin,Yulan Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PanMatch is a versatile foundation model for correspondence matching, unifying tasks like stereo matching, optical flow, and feature matching under a 2D displacement framework without task-specific weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate the need for specialized architectures or task-specific models by generalizing displacement estimation across multiple tasks.

Method: Uses a robust feature extractor and transformation pipeline leveraging Large Vision Models, pretrained on a cross-domain dataset of 1.8M samples.

Result: Outperforms UniMatch and Flow-Anything in cross-task evaluations and matches state-of-the-art task-specific methods. Excels in zero-shot scenarios like rainy days and satellite imagery.

Conclusion: PanMatch demonstrates strong generalization and versatility, achieving high performance across diverse tasks and challenging scenarios with a single model.

Abstract: This work presents PanMatch, a versatile foundation model for robust
correspondence matching. Unlike previous methods that rely on task-specific
architectures and domain-specific fine-tuning to support tasks like stereo
matching, optical flow or feature matching, our key insight is that any
two-frame correspondence matching task can be addressed within a 2D
displacement estimation framework using the same model weights. Such a
formulation eliminates the need for designing specialized unified architectures
or task-specific ensemble models. Instead, it achieves multi-task integration
by endowing displacement estimation algorithms with unprecedented
generalization capabilities. To this end, we highlight the importance of a
robust feature extractor applicable across multiple domains and tasks, and
propose the feature transformation pipeline that leverage all-purpose features
from Large Vision Models to endow matching baselines with zero-shot cross-view
matching capabilities. Furthermore, we assemble a cross-domain dataset with
near 1.8 million samples from stereo matching, optical flow, and feature
matching domains to pretrain PanMatch. We demonstrate the versatility of
PanMatch across a wide range of domains and downstream tasks using the same
model weights. Our model outperforms UniMatch and Flow-Anything on cross-task
evaluations, and achieves comparable performance to most state-of-the-art
task-specific algorithms on task-oriented benchmarks. Additionally, PanMatch
presents unprecedented zero-shot performance in abnormal scenarios, such as
rainy day and satellite imagery, where most existing robust algorithms fail to
yield meaningful results.

### [34] [Deep Hashing with Semantic Hash Centers for Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08404)
*Li Chen,Rui Liu,Yuxiang Zhou,Xudong Ma,Yong Chen,Dell Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SHC introduces semantic hash centers to improve image retrieval by preserving semantic relationships between classes, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current point-wise hashing methods use data-independent hash centers, ignoring semantic relationships, which can degrade retrieval performance.

Method: A three-stage framework: (1) classification network for semantic similarity, (2) optimization for semantic hash centers, (3) deep hashing network for binary codes.

Result: SHC improves MAP@100, MAP@1000, and MAP@ALL by +7.26%, +7.62%, and +11.71% respectively over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SHC effectively preserves semantic structure in hash codes, enhancing large-scale image retrieval performance.

Abstract: Deep hashing is an effective approach for large-scale image retrieval.
Current methods are typically classified by their supervision types:
point-wise, pair-wise, and list-wise. Recent point-wise techniques (e.g., CSQ,
MDS) have improved retrieval performance by pre-assigning a hash center to each
class, enhancing the discriminability of hash codes across various datasets.
However, these methods rely on data-independent algorithms to generate hash
centers, which neglect the semantic relationships between classes and may
degrade retrieval performance.
  This paper introduces the concept of semantic hash centers, building on the
idea of traditional hash centers. We hypothesize that hash centers of
semantically related classes should have closer Hamming distances, while those
of unrelated classes should be more distant. To this end, we propose a
three-stage framework, SHC, to generate hash codes that preserve semantic
structure.
  First, we develop a classification network to identify semantic similarities
between classes using a data-dependent similarity calculation that adapts to
varying data distributions. Second, we introduce an optimization algorithm to
generate semantic hash centers, preserving semantic relatedness while enforcing
a minimum distance between centers to avoid excessively similar hash codes.
Finally, a deep hashing network is trained using these semantic centers to
convert images into binary hash codes.
  Experimental results on large-scale retrieval tasks across several public
datasets show that SHC significantly improves retrieval performance.
Specifically, SHC achieves average improvements of +7.26%, +7.62%, and +11.71%
in MAP@100, MAP@1000, and MAP@ALL metrics, respectively, over state-of-the-art
methods.

*Shijun Yang,Xiang Zhang,Wanqing Zhao,Hangzai Luo,Sheng Zhong,Jinye Peng,Jianping Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MuGCP introduces a novel prompt learning paradigm for VLMs, addressing generalization and cross-modal alignment challenges by leveraging MLLMs and an AMG module, outperforming SOTA methods on 14 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in prompt learning for VLMs include poor generalization on novel classes and limited cross-modal alignment, prompting the need for a more effective approach.

Method: MuGCP uses MLLMs for adaptive Semantic Conditional Prompts (SCP), an AMG module for visual-semantic interaction (VCP), and a Multi-Prompt Fusion (MPF) mechanism to integrate prompts.

Result: MuGCP achieves superior performance on 14 datasets compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: MuGCP effectively addresses prompt learning challenges in VLMs, demonstrating significant improvements in multi-modal task performance.

Abstract: Prompt learning facilitates the efficient adaptation of Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks. However, it faces two significant
challenges: (1) inadequate modeling of class embedding distributions for unseen
instances, leading to suboptimal generalization on novel classes; (2)
prevailing methodologies predominantly confine cross-modal alignment to the
final output layer of vision and text encoders, which fundamentally limits
their capacity to preserve topological consistency with pre-trained multi-modal
embedding spaces. To this end, we introduce MuGCP (Multi-modal Mutual-Guidance
Conditional Prompt Learning), a novel paradigm designed for conditional prompt
generation. MuGCP leverages Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as
conditional prompt learners to adaptively generate Semantic Conditional Prompts
(SCP) that incorporate rich, fine-grained high-level semantic knowledge for
image instances. To ensure effective alignment and interaction across the
multi-modal space of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we introduce the Attention
Mutual-Guidance (AMG) module, which facilitates interactions between visual and
semantic information. Through mutual guidance, the AMG module generates Visual
Conditional Prompts (VCP), enhancing the model's performance in multi-modal
tasks. Additionally, we present a Multi-Prompt Fusion (MPF) mechanism that
integrates SCP and VCP with contextual prompts, ensuring seamless coordination
among the different prompts and enhancing the modeling of class embeddings and
instance-specific knowledge. Our MuGCP outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods on 14 different datasets. The code will be made available after
publication.

*Zesong Yang,Bangbang Yang,Wenqi Dong,Chenxuan Cao,Liyuan Cui,Yuewen Ma,Zhaopeng Cui,Hujun Bao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstaScene introduces a new paradigm for holistic 3D scene perception, focusing on decomposing instances and ensuring complete reconstruction using spatial contrastive learning and in-situ generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans can mentally complete occluded objects, but robotics struggle with this even with advanced techniques, which often fail to recognize complete objects from partial observations.

Method: Develops spatial contrastive learning for precise decomposition and in-situ generation to overcome incompleteness, leveraging observations and geometric cues.

Result: Achieves superior decomposition accuracy and produces geometrically faithful, visually intact objects in complex scenes.

Conclusion: InstaScene effectively addresses challenges in 3D perception, enabling complete and accurate object reconstruction in cluttered environments.

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify and mentally complete occluded objects in
cluttered environments. However, imparting similar cognitive ability to
robotics remains challenging even with advanced reconstruction techniques,
which models scenes as undifferentiated wholes and fails to recognize complete
object from partial observations. In this paper, we propose InstaScene, a new
paradigm towards holistic 3D perception of complex scenes with a primary goal:
decomposing arbitrary instances while ensuring complete reconstruction. To
achieve precise decomposition, we develop a novel spatial contrastive learning
by tracing rasterization of each instance across views, significantly enhancing
semantic supervision in cluttered scenes. To overcome incompleteness from
limited observations, we introduce in-situ generation that harnesses valuable
observations and geometric cues, effectively guiding 3D generative models to
reconstruct complete instances that seamlessly align with the real world.
Experiments on scene decomposition and object completion across complex
real-world and synthetic scenes demonstrate that our method achieves superior
decomposition accuracy while producing geometrically faithful and visually
intact objects.

### [37] [Upsample What Matters: Region-Adaptive Latent Sampling for Accelerated Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08422)
*Wongi Jeong,Kyungryeol Lee,Hoigi Seo,Se Young Chun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RALU accelerates diffusion transformers by mixed-resolution sampling, reducing computation while preserving quality, achieving up to 7x speed-up.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heavy computation in diffusion transformers hinders real-world deployment; existing methods focus on temporal acceleration, leaving spatial dimension underutilized.

Method: RALU uses mixed-resolution sampling: low-resolution denoising, region-adaptive upsampling, and full-resolution refinement, with noise-timestep rescheduling for stability.

Result: Achieves up to 7x speed-up on FLUX and 3x on Stable Diffusion 3 with minimal quality degradation.

Conclusion: RALU is a training-free, complementary spatial acceleration method for diffusion transformers, enhancing efficiency without compromising quality.

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have emerged as an alternative to U-net-based
diffusion models for high-fidelity image and video generation, offering
superior scalability. However, their heavy computation remains a major obstacle
to real-world deployment. Existing acceleration methods primarily exploit the
temporal dimension such as reusing cached features across diffusion timesteps.
Here, we propose Region-Adaptive Latent Upsampling (RALU), a training-free
framework that accelerates inference along spatial dimension. RALU performs
mixed-resolution sampling across three stages: 1) low-resolution denoising
latent diffusion to efficiently capture global semantic structure, 2)
region-adaptive upsampling on specific regions prone to artifacts at
full-resolution, and 3) all latent upsampling at full-resolution for detail
refinement. To stabilize generations across resolution transitions, we leverage
noise-timestep rescheduling to adapt the noise level across varying
resolutions. Our method significantly reduces computation while preserving
image quality by achieving up to 7.0$\times$ speed-up on FLUX and 3.0$\times$
on Stable Diffusion 3 with minimal degradation. Furthermore, RALU is
complementary to existing temporal accelerations such as caching methods, thus
can be seamlessly integrated to further reduce inference latency without
compromising generation quality.

### [38] [RePaintGS: Reference-Guided Gaussian Splatting for Realistic and View-Consistent 3D Scene Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08434)
*Ji Hyun Seo,Byounhyun Yoo,Gerard Jounghyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel 3D scene inpainting method improves geometric fidelity and appearance consistency by leveraging a reference view.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for object removal in radiance fields lead to inconsistencies due to varied inpainting results across views.

Method: Uses a reference view to adjust inpainting contributions, constructs accurate geometry, and warps the reference inpainting to guide optimization.

Result: Enhances geometric fidelity and appearance consistency in inpainted scenes.

Conclusion: The proposed method reliably produces realistic and perceptually consistent 3D scene inpainting results.

Abstract: Radiance field methods, such as Neural Radiance Field or 3D Gaussian
Splatting, have emerged as seminal 3D representations for synthesizing
realistic novel views. For practical applications, there is ongoing research on
flexible scene editing techniques, among which object removal is a
representative task. However, removing objects exposes occluded regions, often
leading to unnatural appearances. Thus, studies have employed image inpainting
techniques to replace such regions with plausible content - a task referred to
as 3D scene inpainting. However, image inpainting methods produce one of many
plausible completions for each view, leading to inconsistencies between
viewpoints. A widely adopted approach leverages perceptual cues to blend
inpainted views smoothly. However, it is prone to detail loss and can fail when
there are perceptual inconsistencies across views. In this paper, we propose a
novel 3D scene inpainting method that reliably produces realistic and
perceptually consistent results even for complex scenes by leveraging a
reference view. Given the inpainted reference view, we estimate the inpainting
similarity of the other views to adjust their contribution in constructing an
accurate geometry tailored to the reference. This geometry is then used to warp
the reference inpainting to other views as pseudo-ground truth, guiding the
optimization to match the reference appearance. Comparative evaluation studies
have shown that our approach improves both the geometric fidelity and
appearance consistency of inpainted scenes.

*Anlin Zheng,Xin Wen,Xuanyang Zhang,Chuofan Ma,Tiancai Wang,Gang Yu,Xiangyu Zhang,Xiaojuan Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VFMTok, an image tokenizer built on pre-trained vision models, improves image reconstruction and generation quality with region-adaptive quantization and semantic reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the underutilized potential of pre-trained vision models for image tokenization, enhancing semantic fidelity and efficiency.

Method: Uses a frozen vision model as an encoder, adding region-adaptive quantization and a semantic reconstruction objective.

Result: Achieves gFID of 2.07 on ImageNet, 3x faster convergence, and high-fidelity class-conditional synthesis without CFG.

Conclusion: VFMTok demonstrates superior performance in image tokenization, offering efficiency and quality improvements.

Abstract: Leveraging the powerful representations of pre-trained vision foundation
models -- traditionally used for visual comprehension -- we explore a novel
direction: building an image tokenizer directly atop such models, a largely
underexplored area. Specifically, we employ a frozen vision foundation model as
the encoder of our tokenizer. To enhance its effectiveness, we introduce two
key components: (1) a region-adaptive quantization framework that reduces
redundancy in the pre-trained features on regular 2D grids, and (2) a semantic
reconstruction objective that aligns the tokenizer's outputs with the
foundation model's representations to preserve semantic fidelity. Based on
these designs, our proposed image tokenizer, VFMTok, achieves substantial
improvements in image reconstruction and generation quality, while also
enhancing token efficiency. It further boosts autoregressive (AR) generation --
achieving a gFID of 2.07 on ImageNet benchmarks, while accelerating model
convergence by three times, and enabling high-fidelity class-conditional
synthesis without the need for classifier-free guidance (CFG). The code will be
released publicly to benefit the community.

TL;DR: The paper surveys deep learning-based feed-forward models like DUSt3R for 3D reconstruction, contrasting them with traditional methods and earlier learning-based approaches, and discusses future challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D reconstruction methods (e.g., SfM, MVS) are computationally expensive and struggle in challenging scenarios. Deep learning offers a more efficient and robust alternative.

Method: The paper reviews feed-forward models that use unified deep networks to jointly infer camera poses and dense geometry from unconstrained images in a single pass, focusing on Transformer-based correspondence and joint regression mechanisms.

Result: The survey highlights the advantages of feed-forward models over traditional pipelines and earlier learning-based methods, emphasizing their efficiency and robustness.

Conclusion: The paper identifies future challenges like improving model accuracy, scalability, and handling dynamic scenes, while underscoring the broad application potential of this technology.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction, which aims to recover the dense three-dimensional
structure of a scene, is a cornerstone technology for numerous applications,
including augmented/virtual reality, autonomous driving, and robotics. While
traditional pipelines like Structure from Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo
(MVS) achieve high precision through iterative optimization, they are limited
by complex workflows, high computational cost, and poor robustness in
challenging scenarios like texture-less regions. Recently, deep learning has
catalyzed a paradigm shift in 3D reconstruction. A new family of models,
exemplified by DUSt3R, has pioneered a feed-forward approach. These models
employ a unified deep network to jointly infer camera poses and dense geometry
directly from an Unconstrained set of images in a single forward pass. This
survey provides a systematic review of this emerging domain. We begin by
dissecting the technical framework of these feed-forward models, including
their Transformer-based correspondence modeling, joint pose and geometry
regression mechanisms, and strategies for scaling from two-view to multi-view
scenarios. To highlight the disruptive nature of this new paradigm, we contrast
it with both traditional pipelines and earlier learning-based methods like
MVSNet. Furthermore, we provide an overview of relevant datasets and evaluation
metrics. Finally, we discuss the technology's broad application prospects and
identify key future challenges and opportunities, such as model accuracy and
scalability, and handling dynamic scenes.

*Benjamin Meyer,Lukas Tuggener,Sascha Hänzi,Daniel Schmid,Erdal Ayfer,Benjamin F. Grewe,Ahmed Abdulkadir,Thilo Stadelmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach to document recognition by treating it as a transcription task, leveraging intrinsic document structures to improve accuracy and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current document recognition methods overlook intrinsic structural properties, relying on heuristics and limiting applicability to complex or less common document types.

Method: The authors introduce structure-specific inductive biases for machine learning models and a transformer architecture adaptable to various document structures.

Result: Experiments with complex document types (sheet music, shape drawings, engineering drawings) show success, including the first end-to-end model for engineering drawings.

Conclusion: The approach advances document recognition for less understood types and guides future foundation model designs.

Abstract: Many document types use intrinsic, convention-driven structures that serve to
encode precise and structured information, such as the conventions governing
engineering drawings. However, state-of-the-art approaches treat document
recognition as a mere computer vision problem, neglecting these underlying
document-type-specific structural properties, making them dependent on
sub-optimal heuristic post-processing and rendering many less frequent or more
complicated document types inaccessible to modern document recognition. We
suggest a novel perspective that frames document recognition as a transcription
task from a document to a record. This implies a natural grouping of documents
based on the intrinsic structure inherent in their transcription, where related
document types can be treated (and learned) similarly. We propose a method to
design structure-specific inductive biases for the underlying machine-learned
end-to-end document recognition systems, and a respective base transformer
architecture that we successfully adapt to different structures. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the so-found inductive biases in extensive experiments
with progressively complex record structures from monophonic sheet music, shape
drawings, and simplified engineering drawings. By integrating an inductive bias
for unrestricted graph structures, we train the first-ever successful
end-to-end model to transcribe engineering drawings to their inherently
interlinked information. Our approach is relevant to inform the design of
document recognition systems for document types that are less well understood
than standard OCR, OMR, etc., and serves as a guide to unify the design of
future document foundation models.

Abstract: F3-Net is a foundation model designed to overcome persistent challenges in
clinical medical image segmentation, including reliance on complete multimodal
inputs, limited generalizability, and narrow task specificity. Through flexible
synthetic modality training, F3-Net maintains robust performance even in the
presence of missing MRI sequences, leveraging a zero-image strategy to
substitute absent modalities without relying on explicit synthesis networks,
thereby enhancing real-world applicability. Its unified architecture supports
multi-pathology segmentation across glioma, metastasis, stroke, and white

Evaluated on diverse datasets such as BraTS 2021, BraTS 2024, and ISLES 2022,
F3-Net demonstrates strong resilience to domain shifts and clinical
heterogeneity. On the whole pathology dataset, F3-Net achieves average Dice

TL;DR: The paper introduces D2Dewarp, a document dewarping model that leverages dual horizontal-vertical line dimensions for improved distortion correction, along with a new dataset for training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dewarping methods focus only on horizontal lines, limiting their effectiveness. The paper aims to address this by incorporating vertical line awareness for better distortion perception.

Method: Proposes D2Dewarp, a model with fine-grained deformation perception in dual dimensions (horizontal-vertical), and a fusion module for feature interaction. Also introduces an automatic annotation method to create a large-scale training dataset.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on public benchmarks, with both quantitative and qualitative improvements in rectification.

Conclusion: D2Dewarp advances document dewarping by leveraging dual-dimensional line awareness and a novel dataset, achieving superior results.

Abstract: Document image dewarping remains a challenging task in the deep learning era.
While existing methods have improved by leveraging text line awareness, they
typically focus only on a single horizontal dimension. In this paper, we
propose a fine-grained deformation perception model that focuses on Dual
Dimensions of document horizontal-vertical-lines to improve document Dewarping
called D2Dewarp. It can perceive distortion trends in different directions
across document details. To combine the horizontal and vertical granularity
features, an effective fusion module based on X and Y coordinate is designed to
facilitate interaction and constraint between the two dimensions for feature
complementarity. Due to the lack of annotated line features in current public
dewarping datasets, we also propose an automatic fine-grained annotation method
using public document texture images and an automatic rendering engine to build
a new large-scale distortion training dataset. The code and dataset will be
publicly released. On public Chinese and English benchmarks, both quantitative
and qualitative results show that our method achieves better rectification
results compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The dataset will be
publicly available at https://github.com/xiaomore/DocDewarpHV

*Yufei Zheng,Wenjun Wang,Wenjun Gan,Jiawei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OGFR introduces occlusion-guided feature purification via reinforced knowledge distillation to address challenges in occluded person re-identification, improving robustness against diverse occlusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with unseen occlusion scenarios and feature contamination from holistic images, limiting performance in occluded person re-identification.

Method: OGFR uses a teacher-student distillation architecture with an Occlusion-Aware Vision Transformer and a Feature Erasing and Purification Module to model diverse occlusions and purify holistic knowledge.

Result: The method effectively learns robust representations by mitigating occlusion interference and feature contamination.

Conclusion: OGFR advances occluded person re-identification by integrating occlusion-aware modeling and purified knowledge distillation.

Abstract: Occluded person re-identification aims to retrieve holistic images based on
occluded ones. Existing methods often rely on aligning visible body parts,
applying occlusion augmentation, or complementing missing semantics using
holistic images. However, they face challenges in handling diverse occlusion
scenarios not seen during training and the issue of feature contamination from
holistic images. To address these limitations, we propose Occlusion-Guided
Feature Purification Learning via Reinforced Knowledge Distillation (OGFR),
which simultaneously mitigates these challenges. OGFR adopts a teacher-student
distillation architecture that effectively incorporates diverse occlusion
patterns into feature representation while transferring the purified
discriminative holistic knowledge from the holistic to the occluded branch
through reinforced knowledge distillation. Specifically, an Occlusion-Aware
Vision Transformer is designed to leverage learnable occlusion pattern
embeddings to explicitly model such diverse occlusion types, thereby guiding
occlusion-aware robust feature representation. Moreover, we devise a Feature
Erasing and Purification Module within the holistic branch, in which an agent
is employed to identify low-quality patch tokens of holistic images that
contain noisy negative information via deep reinforcement learning, and
substitute these patch tokens with learnable embedding tokens to avoid feature
contamination and further excavate identity-related discriminative clues.
Afterward, with the assistance of knowledge distillation, the student branch
effectively absorbs the purified holistic knowledge to precisely learn robust
representation regardless of the interference of occlusions.

*Inye Na,Nejung Rue,Jiwon Chung,Hyunjin Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RadiomicsRetrieval is a 3D content-based medical image retrieval framework combining radiomics and deep learning for flexible, tumor-level queries with minimal user input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods are limited to 2D images and require fully annotated queries, restricting clinical utility.

Method: Uses a promptable segmentation model (e.g., SAM) for tumor embeddings, aligned with radiomics features via contrastive learning, enriched by anatomical positional embedding (APE).

Result: Enhances retrieval specificity with radiomics and APE, supports flexible queries (shape, location, partial features), and requires minimal prompts.

Conclusion: The framework is adaptable for diverse clinical scenarios, improving diagnosis, treatment planning, and research on medical imaging repositories.

Abstract: Medical image retrieval is a valuable field for supporting clinical
decision-making, yet current methods primarily support 2D images and require
fully annotated queries, limiting clinical flexibility. To address this, we
propose RadiomicsRetrieval, a 3D content-based retrieval framework bridging
handcrafted radiomics descriptors with deep learning-based embeddings at the
tumor level. Unlike existing 2D approaches, RadiomicsRetrieval fully exploits
volumetric data to leverage richer spatial context in medical images. We employ
a promptable segmentation model (e.g., SAM) to derive tumor-specific image
embeddings, which are aligned with radiomics features extracted from the same
tumor via contrastive learning. These representations are further enriched by
anatomical positional embedding (APE). As a result, RadiomicsRetrieval enables
flexible querying based on shape, location, or partial feature sets. Extensive
experiments on both lung CT and brain MRI public datasets demonstrate that
radiomics features significantly enhance retrieval specificity, while APE
provides global anatomical context essential for location-based searches.
Notably, our framework requires only minimal user prompts (e.g., a single
point), minimizing segmentation overhead and supporting diverse clinical
scenarios. The capability to query using either image embeddings or selected
radiomics attributes highlights its adaptability, potentially benefiting
diagnosis, treatment planning, and research on large-scale medical imaging
repositories. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM 2's memory bank is enhanced with reinforcement learning for better object tracking, outperforming hand-crafted rules by 3x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve SAM 2's handling of distractors, occlusions, and motion by optimizing memory updates.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning to frame memory control as a sequential decision-making problem.

Result: Achieves a relative improvement over SAM 2, exceeding gains of existing heuristics by 3x.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning is a powerful alternative to hand-crafted rules for memory control in tracking.

Abstract: Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has demonstrated strong performance in
object segmentation tasks and has become the state-of-the-art for visual object
tracking. The model stores information from previous frames in a memory bank,
enabling temporal consistency across video sequences. Recent methods augment
SAM 2 with hand-crafted update rules to better handle distractors, occlusions,
and object motion. We propose a fundamentally different approach using
reinforcement learning for optimizing memory updates in SAM 2 by framing memory
control as a sequential decision-making problem. In an overfitting setup with a
separate agent per video, our method achieves a relative improvement over SAM 2
that exceeds by more than three times the gains of existing heuristics. These
results reveal the untapped potential of the memory bank and highlight
reinforcement learning as a powerful alternative to hand-crafted update rules
for memory control in visual object tracking.

*Cristina Mata,Michael S. Ryoo,Henrik Turbell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DA-KPN, a novel image translation method, ensures semantic matching for synthetic-to-real data translation, outperforming GAN-based methods in semantic segmentation with limited real labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the domain gap in semantic segmentation due to noisy pixel labels from synthetic data by ensuring semantic matching in translations.

Method: DA-KPN estimates pixel-wise transformation parameters using a lightweight function and multi-scale discriminators for realism.

Result: Outperforms GAN-based methods on syn2real benchmarks and achieves comparable performance in face parsing.

Conclusion: DA-KPN provides a robust solution for semantic segmentation by guaranteeing semantic matching in synthetic-to-real translations.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation relies on many dense pixel-wise annotations to achieve
the best performance, but owing to the difficulty of obtaining accurate
annotations for real world data, practitioners train on large-scale synthetic
datasets. Unpaired image translation is one method used to address the ensuing
domain gap by generating more realistic training data in low-data regimes.
Current methods for unpaired image translation train generative adversarial
networks (GANs) to perform the translation and enforce pixel-level semantic
matching through cycle consistency. These methods do not guarantee that the
semantic matching holds, posing a problem for semantic segmentation where
performance is sensitive to noisy pixel labels. We propose a novel image
translation method, Domain Adversarial Kernel Prediction Network (DA-KPN), that
guarantees semantic matching between the synthetic label and translation.
DA-KPN estimates pixel-wise input transformation parameters of a lightweight
and simple translation function. To ensure the pixel-wise transformation is
realistic, DA-KPN uses multi-scale discriminators to distinguish between
translated and target samples. We show DA-KPN outperforms previous GAN-based
methods on syn2real benchmarks for semantic segmentation with limited access to
real image labels and achieves comparable performance on face parsing.

*Enyu Liu,En Yu,Sijia Chen,Wenbing Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DISC introduces a dual-stream paradigm for 3D Semantic Scene Completion, using class queries instead of voxels to improve instance and scene category learning, achieving SOTA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current voxel-based methods limit class-level information utilization, hindering granularity in completion results.

Method: DISC replaces voxel queries with class queries and uses specialized decoding modules for targeted class-level interactions.

Result: DISC achieves mIoU scores of 17.35 and 20.55 on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360, outperforming multi-frame methods with single-frame input.

Conclusion: DISC enhances instance and scene completion, setting new benchmarks in 3D SSC.

Abstract: 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has gained increasing attention due to its
pivotal role in 3D perception. Recent advancements have primarily focused on
refining voxel-level features to construct 3D scenes. However, treating voxels
as the basic interaction units inherently limits the utilization of class-level
information, which is proven critical for enhancing the granularity of
completion results. To address this, we propose \textbf{D}isentangling Instance
and Scene Contexts (DISC), a novel dual-stream paradigm that enhances learning
for both instance and scene categories through separated optimization.
Specifically, we replace voxel queries with discriminative class queries, which
incorporate class-specific geometric and semantic priors. Additionally, we
exploit the intrinsic properties of classes to design specialized decoding
modules, facilitating targeted interactions and efficient class-level
information flow. Experimental results demonstrate that DISC achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both SemanticKITTI and
SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks, with mIoU scores of 17.35 and 20.55,
respectively. Remarkably, DISC even outperforms multi-frame SOTA methods using
only single-frame input and significantly improves instance category
performance, surpassing both single-frame and multi-frame SOTA instance mIoU by
17.9\% and 11.9\%, respectively, on the SemanticKITTI hidden test. The code is

descriptions through hierarchical semantic decoupling, and Bidirectional
Interactive Visual-semantic Attention (BIVA) enabling iterative information
exchange between modalities. The framework was evaluated on BraTS 2020 dataset
comprising 369 multi-institutional MRI scans. Results: The proposed method
achieved average Dice coefficient of 0.8505 and 95% Hausdorff distance of
2.8256mm across enhancing tumor, tumor core, and whole tumor regions,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods including SCAU-Net, CA-Net, and 3D
U-Net. Ablation studies confirmed critical contributions of semantic and
spatial modules to boundary precision. Conclusion: Multi-modal semantic fusion
combined with bidirectional interactive attention significantly enhances brain
tumor segmentation performance, establishing new paradigms for integrating
clinical knowledge into medical image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BayesTTA addresses gradual distribution shifts in vision-language models with a Bayesian framework for temporally consistent predictions and dynamic representation alignment, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing continual test-time adaptation methods fail under temporally evolving distribution shifts, leading to catastrophic forgetting, unreliable confidence, and misaligned representations.

Method: BayesTTA uses Bayesian adaptation, estimating class-conditional Gaussian mixtures, adaptive covariance selection, and GDA for calibrated inference, with self-paced normalization layer updates.

Result: BayesTTA outperforms state-of-the-art methods on temporally evolving datasets and generalizes well on standard TTA benchmarks.

Conclusion: BayesTTA effectively handles gradual distribution shifts, offering stable and efficient adaptation for vision-language models.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot
recognition but degrade significantly under \textit{temporally evolving
distribution shifts} common in real-world scenarios (e.g., gradual illumination
or seasonal changes). Existing continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) methods
are typically built around sudden and severe distribution shifts and neglect
temporal continuity, leading to three core defects: limited memory cache
restricts long-range distribution modeling, causing catastrophic forgetting;
entropy-based confidence becomes unreliable under temporal drift, worsening
error accumulation; and static visual representations misalign with evolving
inputs. We formalize this practical problem as \textit{Continual-Temporal
Test-Time Adaptation (CT-TTA)}, where test distributions evolve gradually over
time. To address it, we propose \textit{BayesTTA}, a Bayesian adaptation
framework that enforces temporally consistent predictions and dynamically
aligns visual representations. Specifically, BayesTTA incrementally estimates
class-conditional Gaussian mixture distributions without storing raw data,
adaptively selects covariance structures through statistical hypothesis
testing, and performs calibrated inference using Gaussian discriminant analysis
(GDA). These calibrated predictions supervise self-paced adaptation of
normalization layers, ensuring efficient and stable representation alignment.
We establish a comprehensive CT-TTA benchmark across four temporally evolving
datasets and further evaluate generalization on ten standard TTA datasets.
Extensive experiments show that BayesTTA consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant gains while maintaining
efficiency. Code is available at

TL;DR: The study evaluates the Document Attention Network (DAN) for extracting key-value data from Uruguayan birth certificates, comparing two annotation strategies. Normalized annotation works better for standardized fields, while diplomatic annotation excels for non-standardized fields like names.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess DAN's effectiveness for extracting information from handwritten Spanish birth certificates with minimal training data and annotation effort.

Method: Fine-tuning DAN on two datasets with different annotation methods (normalized and diplomatic) using 201 birth certificate scans.

Result: Normalized annotation is better for standardized fields (dates, places), while diplomatic annotation is superior for non-standardized fields (names, surnames).

Conclusion: The choice of annotation strategy should depend on the field type, with normalized for standardized data and diplomatic for non-standardized data.

Abstract: This study evaluates the recently proposed Document Attention Network (DAN)
for extracting key-value information from Uruguayan birth certificates,
handwritten in Spanish. We investigate two annotation strategies for
automatically transcribing handwritten documents, fine-tuning DAN with minimal
training data and annotation effort. Experiments were conducted on two datasets
containing the same images (201 scans of birth certificates written by more
than 15 different writers) but with different annotation methods. Our findings
indicate that normalized annotation is more effective for fields that can be
standardized, such as dates and places of birth, whereas diplomatic annotation
performs much better for fields containing names and surnames, which can not be
standardized.

TL;DR: OnlineBEV introduces a recurrent structure for temporal 3D perception, using MBFNet for feature alignment and achieving state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic changes in BEV features due to object motion limit performance gains from temporal aggregation in multi-view 3D perception.

Method: OnlineBEV uses a recurrent structure and MBFNet for motion-guided temporal feature alignment, along with Temporal Consistency Learning Loss.

Result: Achieves 63.9% NDS on nuScenes, outperforming SOLOFusion.

Conclusion: OnlineBEV effectively combines temporal BEV features with minimal memory, setting a new benchmark for camera-only 3D object detection.

Abstract: Multi-view camera-based 3D perception can be conducted using bird's eye view
(BEV) features obtained through perspective view-to-BEV transformations.
Several studies have shown that the performance of these 3D perception methods
can be further enhanced by combining sequential BEV features obtained from
multiple camera frames. However, even after compensating for the ego-motion of
an autonomous agent, the performance gain from temporal aggregation is limited
when combining a large number of image frames. This limitation arises due to
dynamic changes in BEV features over time caused by object motion. In this
paper, we introduce a novel temporal 3D perception method called OnlineBEV,
which combines BEV features over time using a recurrent structure. This
structure increases the effective number of combined features with minimal
memory usage. However, it is critical to spatially align the features over time
to maintain strong performance. OnlineBEV employs the Motion-guided BEV Fusion
Network (MBFNet) to achieve temporal feature alignment. MBFNet extracts motion
features from consecutive BEV frames and dynamically aligns historical BEV
features with current ones using these motion features. To enforce temporal
feature alignment explicitly, we use Temporal Consistency Learning Loss, which
captures discrepancies between historical and target BEV features. Experiments
conducted on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that OnlineBEV achieves
significant performance gains over the current best method, SOLOFusion.
OnlineBEV achieves 63.9% NDS on the nuScenes test set, recording
state-of-the-art performance in the camera-only 3D object detection task.

TL;DR: DatasetAgent, a multiagent system using MLLMs, automates high-quality real-world image dataset construction, outperforming manual and AI-generated methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual dataset construction is time-intensive; AI-generated data lacks real-world value. DatasetAgent addresses this gap.

Method: Uses four MLLM-equipped agents and image optimization tools to auto-construct datasets based on user requirements.

Result: Successfully expands existing datasets and creates new ones, validated by training vision models for classification, detection, and segmentation.

Conclusion: DatasetAgent efficiently constructs real-world image datasets, proving superior to traditional and AI-generated methods.

Abstract: Common knowledge indicates that the process of constructing image datasets
usually depends on the time-intensive and inefficient method of manual
collection and annotation. Large models offer a solution via data generation.
Nonetheless, real-world data are obviously more valuable comparing to
artificially intelligence generated data, particularly in constructing image
datasets. For this reason, we propose a novel method for auto-constructing
datasets from real-world images by a multiagent collaborative system, named as
DatasetAgent. By coordinating four different agents equipped with Multi-modal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), as well as a tool package for image
optimization, DatasetAgent is able to construct high-quality image datasets
according to user-specified requirements. In particular, two types of
experiments are conducted, including expanding existing datasets and creating
new ones from scratch, on a variety of open-source datasets. In both cases,
multiple image datasets constructed by DatasetAgent are used to train various
vision models for image classification, object detection, and image
segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A transformer-based model (7T-Restormer) synthesizes 7T-quality T1-maps from 1.5T/3T T1W images, outperforming ResViT and ResShift with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 7T MRI provides superior resolution but is costly and scarce; this work aims to make 7T-quality imaging accessible via lower-field scans.

Method: Validated on 35 1.5T and 108 3T T1W MRI paired with 7T T1 maps from MS patients, using a mixed training corpus.

Result: Achieved PSNR ~26 dB, SSIM ~0.86, and NMSE ~0.019, reducing NMSE by 41-64% vs. ResViT/ResShift.

Conclusion: 7T-Restormer efficiently predicts 7T-quality maps from lower-field scans, enhancing clinical accessibility.

Abstract: Purpose: Ultra-high-field 7T MRI offers improved resolution and contrast over
standard clinical field strengths (1.5T, 3T). However, 7T scanners are costly,
scarce, and introduce additional challenges such as susceptibility artifacts.
We propose an efficient transformer-based model (7T-Restormer) to synthesize
7T-quality T1-maps from routine 1.5T or 3T T1-weighted (T1W) images. Methods:
Our model was validated on 35 1.5T and 108 3T T1w MRI paired with corresponding
7T T1 maps of patients with confirmed MS. A total of 141 patient cases (32,128
slices) were randomly divided into 105 (25; 80) training cases (19,204 slices),
19 (5; 14) validation cases (3,476 slices), and 17 (5; 14) test cases (3,145
slices) where (X; Y) denotes the patients with 1.5T and 3T T1W scans,
respectively. The synthetic 7T T1 maps were compared against the ResViT and
ResShift models. Results: The 7T-Restormer model achieved a PSNR of 26.0 +/-
4.6 dB, SSIM of 0.861 +/- 0.072, and NMSE of 0.019 +/- 0.011 for 1.5T inputs,
and 25.9 +/- 4.9 dB, and 0.866 +/- 0.077 for 3T inputs, respectively. Using
10.5 M parameters, our model reduced NMSE by 64 % relative to 56.7M parameter
ResShift (0.019 vs 0.052, p = <.001 and by 41 % relative to 70.4M parameter
ResViT (0.019 vs 0.032, p = <.001) at 1.5T, with similar advantages at 3T
(0.021 vs 0.060 and 0.033; p < .001). Training with a mixed 1.5 T + 3 T corpus
was superior to single-field strategies. Restricting the model to 1.5T
increased the 1.5T NMSE from 0.019 to 0.021 (p = 1.1E-3) while training solely
on 3T resulted in lower performance on input 1.5T T1W MRI. Conclusion: We
propose a novel method for predicting quantitative 7T MP2RAGE maps from 1.5T
and 3T T1W scans with higher quality than existing state-of-the-art methods.
Our approach makes the benefits of 7T MRI more accessible to standard clinical
workflows.

TL;DR: ByDeWay is a training-free framework using Layered-Depth-Based Prompting (LDP) to enhance MLLMs' spatial reasoning and grounding without parameter changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve MLLMs' spatial reasoning and reduce hallucinations without requiring model training.

Method: Segments scenes into depth layers, generates region-specific captions, and appends them to prompts for enriched spatial context.

Result: Shows consistent improvements on hallucination-sensitive (POPE) and reasoning-intensive (GQA) benchmarks.

Conclusion: Depth-aware prompting is effective for enhancing MLLMs in a zero-training setting.

Abstract: We introduce ByDeWay, a training-free framework designed to enhance the
performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). ByDeWay uses a novel
prompting strategy called Layered-Depth-Based Prompting (LDP), which improves
spatial reasoning and grounding without modifying any model parameters. It
segments the scene into closest, mid-range, and farthest layers using monocular
depth estimation, then generates region-specific captions with a grounded
vision-language model. These structured, depth-aware captions are appended to
the image-question prompt, enriching it with spatial context. This guides MLLMs
to produce more grounded and less hallucinated responses. Our method is
lightweight, modular, and compatible with black-box MLLMs. Experiments on
hallucination-sensitive (POPE) and reasoning-intensive (GQA) benchmarks show
consistent improvements across multiple MLLMs, validating the effectiveness of
depth-aware prompting in a zero-training setting.

TL;DR: MoSAiC is a unified CL framework for multi-modal satellite imagery, addressing challenges like high inter-class similarity and ambiguous boundaries. It outperforms baselines in accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ESO's unique challenges (e.g., high inter-class similarity, scene clutter) complicate representation learning, especially in low-label, multi-label settings. Existing CL frameworks lack mechanisms for multi-label alignment and semantic precision across modalities.

Method: MoSAiC jointly optimizes intra- and inter-modality contrastive learning with a multi-label supervised contrastive loss, designed for multi-modal satellite imagery.

Result: MoSAiC outperforms fully supervised and self-supervised baselines in accuracy, cluster coherence, and generalization on BigEarthNet V2.0 and Sent12MS datasets.

Conclusion: MoSAiC effectively addresses ESO challenges, enabling finer semantic disentanglement and robust representation learning in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning
transferable representations without the reliance on large labeled datasets.
Its ability to capture intrinsic similarities and differences among data
samples has led to state-of-the-art results in computer vision tasks. These
strengths make CL particularly well-suited for Earth System Observation (ESO),
where diverse satellite modalities such as optical and SAR imagery offer
naturally aligned views of the same geospatial regions. However, ESO presents
unique challenges, including high inter-class similarity, scene clutter, and
ambiguous boundaries, which complicate representation learning -- especially in
low-label, multi-label settings. Existing CL frameworks often focus on
intra-modality self-supervision or lack mechanisms for multi-label alignment
and semantic precision across modalities. In this work, we introduce MoSAiC, a
unified framework that jointly optimizes intra- and inter-modality contrastive
learning with a multi-label supervised contrastive loss. Designed specifically
for multi-modal satellite imagery, MoSAiC enables finer semantic
disentanglement and more robust representation learning across spectrally
similar and spatially complex classes. Experiments on two benchmark datasets,
BigEarthNet V2.0 and Sent12MS, show that MoSAiC consistently outperforms both
fully supervised and self-supervised baselines in terms of accuracy, cluster
coherence, and generalization in low-label and high-class-overlap scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated MRI muscle segmentation faces challenges like high computational costs, large training data needs, and limited accuracy for smaller muscles. CNN-based methods add issues like overhead and poor interpretability.

Method: Proposes a training-free approach combining keypoint tracking with Lucas-Kanade optical flow for segmentation.

Result: Achieves mean DSC of 0.6-0.7, comparable to CNNs, with reduced computational demands and improved interpretability.

Conclusion: The method offers a scalable, robust, and explainable alternative for muscle segmentation in clinical and research settings.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables non-invasive, high-resolution
analysis of muscle structures. However, automated segmentation remains limited
by high computational costs, reliance on large training datasets, and reduced
accuracy in segmenting smaller muscles. Convolutional neural network
(CNN)-based methods, while powerful, often suffer from substantial
computational overhead, limited generalizability, and poor interpretability
across diverse populations. This study proposes a training-free segmentation
approach based on keypoint tracking, which integrates keypoint selection with
Lucas-Kanade optical flow. The proposed method achieves a mean Dice similarity
coefficient (DSC) ranging from 0.6 to 0.7, depending on the keypoint selection
strategy, performing comparably to state-of-the-art CNN-based models while
substantially reducing computational demands and enhancing interpretability.
This scalable framework presents a robust and explainable alternative for
muscle segmentation in clinical and research applications.

*Li Li,Yingzhe Peng,Xu Yang,Ruoxi Cheng,Haiyang Xu,Ming Yan,Fei Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: L-CLIPScore is a lightweight, efficient embedding-based captioning metric derived from CLIP, using compression and distillation techniques. It matches CLIP's alignment ability with fewer resources and is validated for caption evaluation and training when combined with n-gram metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a more efficient and lightweight alternative to CLIP for evaluating and training captioning models, reducing computational costs while maintaining performance.

Method: Compresses CLIP using weight multiplexing and matrix decomposition, and distills it with a novel Similarity Regulator (SR) loss to enhance vision-language alignment.

Result: L-CLIP achieves comparable alignment to CLIP with fewer resources. L-CLIPScore is effective for caption evaluation but requires mixing with n-gram metrics for training.

Conclusion: L-CLIPScore is a viable, efficient metric for captioning tasks, though training requires hybrid use with n-gram metrics to avoid failure.

Abstract: We propose a novel embedding-based captioning metric termed as L-CLIPScore
that can be used for efficiently evaluating caption quality and training
captioning model. L-CLIPScore is calculated from a lightweight CLIP (L-CLIP),
which is a dual-encoder architecture compressed and distilled from CLIP. To
compress, we apply two powerful techniques which are weight multiplexing and
matrix decomposition for reducing the parameters of encoders and word embedding
matrix, respectively. To distill, we design a novel multi-modal Similarity
Regulator (SR) loss to transfer more vision-language alignment knowledge.
Specifically, SR loss amplifies the multi-modal embedding similarity if the
given image-text pair is matched and diminishes the similarity if the pair is
non-matched. By compressing and distilling by this novel SR loss, our L-CLIP
achieves comparable multi-modal alignment ability to the original CLIP while it
requires fewer computation resources and running time. We carry out exhaustive
experiments to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of L-CLIPScore when
using it as the judge to evaluate caption quality. We also discover that when
using L-CLIPScore as the supervisor to train the captioning model, it should be
mixed up by an n-gram-based metric and meanwhile analyze why using L-CLIPScore
only will cause fail training.

*Andreas Lolos,Stergios Christodoulidis,Maria Vakalopoulou,Jose Dolz,Aris Moustakas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SGPMIL introduces a probabilistic attention-based MIL framework using Sparse Gaussian Processes for uncertainty quantification in instance relevance, improving interpretability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MIL methods lack uncertainty quantification in instance-level attention scores, which is crucial for reliable predictions in digital pathology.

Method: SGPMIL uses Sparse Gaussian Processes to model posterior distributions over attention scores, incorporating feature scaling for efficiency.

Result: SGPMIL achieves competitive bag-level performance and enhances instance-level prediction quality and interpretability.

Conclusion: SGPMIL provides a robust, interpretable solution for MIL in digital pathology, with improved uncertainty estimation and performance.

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) offers a natural solution for settings where
only coarse, bag-level labels are available, without having access to
instance-level annotations. This is usually the case in digital pathology,
which consists of gigapixel sized images. While deterministic attention-based
MIL approaches achieve strong bag-level performance, they often overlook the
uncertainty inherent in instance relevance. In this paper, we address the lack
of uncertainty quantification in instance-level attention scores by introducing
\textbf{SGPMIL}, a new probabilistic attention-based MIL framework grounded in
Sparse Gaussian Processes (SGP). By learning a posterior distribution over
attention scores, SGPMIL enables principled uncertainty estimation, resulting
in more reliable and calibrated instance relevance maps. Our approach not only
preserves competitive bag-level performance but also significantly improves the
quality and interpretability of instance-level predictions under uncertainty.
SGPMIL extends prior work by introducing feature scaling in the SGP predictive
mean function, leading to faster training, improved efficiency, and enhanced
instance-level performance. Extensive experiments on multiple well-established
digital pathology datasets highlight the effectiveness of our approach across
both bag- and instance-level evaluations. Our code will be made publicly
available.

TL;DR: RoundaboutHD is a high-resolution multi-camera vehicle tracking dataset addressing limitations of current datasets by providing realistic roundabout scenarios, diverse conditions, and rich annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for multi-camera vehicle tracking (MCVT) are limited in realism, diversity, and resolution, hindering progress in smart city applications.

Method: Introduces RoundaboutHD, a dataset with 40 minutes of 4K footage from four non-overlapping cameras, annotated with 512 unique vehicle identities and supporting various tasks like detection and re-identification.

Result: The dataset offers temporal consistency, enhanced challenges (e.g., occlusions), and includes subsets for specific tasks, along with baseline results for benchmarking.

Conclusion: RoundaboutHD bridges the gap between academic research and real-world MCVT applications, providing a valuable resource for future studies.

Abstract: The multi-camera vehicle tracking (MCVT) framework holds significant
potential for smart city applications, including anomaly detection, traffic
density estimation, and suspect vehicle tracking. However, current publicly
available datasets exhibit limitations, such as overly simplistic scenarios,
low-resolution footage, and insufficiently diverse conditions, creating a
considerable gap between academic research and real-world scenario. To fill
this gap, we introduce RoundaboutHD, a comprehensive, high-resolution
multi-camera vehicle tracking benchmark dataset specifically designed to
represent real-world roundabout scenarios. RoundaboutHD provides a total of 40
minutes of labelled video footage captured by four non-overlapping,
high-resolution (4K resolution, 15 fps) cameras. In total, 512 unique vehicle
identities are annotated across different camera views, offering rich
cross-camera association data. RoundaboutHD offers temporal consistency video
footage and enhanced challenges, including increased occlusions and nonlinear
movement inside the roundabout. In addition to the full MCVT dataset, several
subsets are also available for object detection, single camera tracking, and
image-based vehicle re-identification (ReID) tasks. Vehicle model information
and camera modelling/ geometry information are also included to support further
analysis. We provide baseline results for vehicle detection, single-camera
tracking, image-based vehicle re-identification, and multi-camera tracking. The

*Anna Rosenberg,John Kennedy,Zohar Keidar,Yehoshua Y. Zeevi,Guy Gilboa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using ensembles of weak learners based on spectral total-variation (STV) features to address insufficient training data in computer vision, demonstrating superior performance in a medical imaging task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of sufficient training data in computer vision problems motivates the use of STV features, which are lowly correlated and effective for texture characterization.

Method: Ensembles of weak learners are designed using STV features, leveraging their low correlation. The approach is tested on CT and PET data for predicting high uptake in PET scans.

Result: STV learners outperform deep-learning and Radiomics methods, achieving an AUC of 0.87 compared to 0.75 (neural nets) and 0.79 (Radiomics). Fine STV scales in CT are particularly predictive.

Conclusion: STV-based ensembles are effective for medical imaging tasks, offering better performance than competing methods, especially in scenarios with limited training data.

Abstract: Solving computer vision problems through machine learning, one often
encounters lack of sufficient training data. To mitigate this we propose the
use of ensembles of weak learners based on spectral total-variation (STV)
features (Gilboa 2014). The features are related to nonlinear eigenfunctions of
the total-variation subgradient and can characterize well textures at various
scales. It was shown (Burger et-al 2016) that, in the one-dimensional case,
orthogonal features are generated, whereas in two-dimensions the features are
empirically lowly correlated. Ensemble learning theory advocates the use of
lowly correlated weak learners. We thus propose here to design ensembles using
learners based on STV features. To show the effectiveness of this paradigm we
examine a hard real-world medical imaging problem: the predictive value of
computed tomography (CT) data for high uptake in positron emission tomography
(PET) for patients suspected of skeletal metastases. The database consists of
457 scans with 1524 unique pairs of registered CT and PET slices. Our approach
is compared to deep-learning methods and to Radiomics features, showing STV
learners perform best (AUC=0.87), compared to neural nets (AUC=0.75) and
Radiomics (AUC=0.79). We observe that fine STV scales in CT images are
especially indicative for the presence of high uptake in PET.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HieraRS, a hierarchical interpretation paradigm for LCLU classification, addressing flat classification limitations and cross-domain transfer challenges with heterogeneous hierarchies. It includes BHCCM for hierarchical predictions and TransLU for cross-domain adaptation, supported by the MM-5B dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for LCLU classification lack hierarchical prediction capabilities and struggle with cross-domain tasks involving heterogeneous hierarchies, limiting practical flexibility and generalization.

Method: Proposes HieraRS with BHCCM for hierarchical predictions and TransLU (CDKS and CDSA) for cross-domain transfer. Also introduces the MM-5B dataset for validation.

Result: HieraRS enables multi-granularity predictions and efficient cross-domain transfer, improving semantic consistency and classification accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed framework addresses key challenges in LCLU classification, enhancing flexibility and generalization for practical applications.

Abstract: Hierarchical land cover and land use (LCLU) classification aims to assign
pixel-wise labels with multiple levels of semantic granularity to remote
sensing (RS) imagery. However, existing deep learning-based methods face two
major challenges: 1) They predominantly adopt a flat classification paradigm,
which limits their ability to generate end-to-end multi-granularity
hierarchical predictions aligned with tree-structured hierarchies used in
practice. 2) Most cross-domain studies focus on performance degradation caused
by sensor or scene variations, with limited attention to transferring LCLU
models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous hierarchies (e.g., LCLU to crop
classification). These limitations hinder the flexibility and generalization of
LCLU models in practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose
HieraRS, a novel hierarchical interpretation paradigm that enables
multi-granularity predictions and supports the efficient transfer of LCLU
models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous tree-structured hierarchies. We
introduce the Bidirectional Hierarchical Consistency Constraint Mechanism
(BHCCM), which can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream flat classification
models to generate hierarchical predictions, while improving both semantic
consistency and classification accuracy. Furthermore, we present TransLU, a
dual-branch cross-domain transfer framework comprising two key components:
Cross-Domain Knowledge Sharing (CDKS) and Cross-Domain Semantic Alignment
(CDSA). TransLU supports dynamic category expansion and facilitates the
effective adaptation of LCLU models to heterogeneous hierarchies. In addition,
we construct MM-5B, a large-scale multi-modal hierarchical land use dataset
featuring pixel-wise annotations. The code and MM-5B dataset will be released
at: https://github.com/AI-Tianlong/HieraRS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geo-ORBIT introduces a unified framework for dynamic roadway geometry sensing in Digital Twins, combining real-time lane detection, DT synchronization, and federated meta-learning to address scalability, privacy, and efficiency challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for dynamic roadway geometry sensing in Digital Twins rely on static maps or costly sensors, limiting scalability and adaptability, and face challenges in privacy, communication, and computational efficiency.

Method: The framework includes GeoLane (lightweight lane detection), Meta-GeoLane (personalized detection), and FedMeta-GeoLane (federated learning). It integrates with CARLA and SUMO for high-fidelity DT rendering.

Result: FedMeta-GeoLane outperforms baselines, achieving lower geometric error, better generalization, and reduced communication overhead.

Conclusion: Geo-ORBIT provides a scalable, privacy-preserving foundation for flexible, context-aware infrastructure modeling in Digital Twins.

Abstract: Digital Twins (DT) have the potential to transform traffic management and
operations by creating dynamic, virtual representations of transportation
systems that sense conditions, analyze operations, and support decision-making.
A key component for DT of the transportation system is dynamic roadway geometry
sensing. However, existing approaches often rely on static maps or costly
sensors, limiting scalability and adaptability. Additionally, large-scale DTs
that collect and analyze data from multiple sources face challenges in privacy,
communication, and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we
introduce Geo-ORBIT (Geometrical Operational Roadway Blueprint with Integrated
Twin), a unified framework that combines real-time lane detection, DT
synchronization, and federated meta-learning. At the core of Geo-ORBIT is
GeoLane, a lightweight lane detection model that learns lane geometries from
vehicle trajectory data using roadside cameras. We extend this model through
Meta-GeoLane, which learns to personalize detection parameters for local
entities, and FedMeta-GeoLane, a federated learning strategy that ensures
scalable and privacy-preserving adaptation across roadside deployments. Our
system is integrated with CARLA and SUMO to create a high-fidelity DT that
renders highway scenarios and captures traffic flows in real-time. Extensive
experiments across diverse urban scenes show that FedMeta-GeoLane consistently
outperforms baseline and meta-learning approaches, achieving lower geometric
error and stronger generalization to unseen locations while drastically
reducing communication overhead. This work lays the foundation for flexible,
context-aware infrastructure modeling in DTs. The framework is publicly
available at https://github.com/raynbowy23/FedMeta-GeoLane.git.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Birkhoff is a data-free compression algorithm for SAMs, offering versatility, agility, faithfulness, and compactness. It uses Hyper-Compression and HyperLinear for efficient inference, achieving high compression ratios with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widespread use of SAMs in diverse fields creates a need for efficient compression methods without sacrificing performance.

Method: Birkhoff employs Hyper-Compression to reduce parameter dimensions and HyperLinear to fuse decompression with matrix multiplication for faster inference.

Result: Achieves a 5.17x compression ratio on SAM2-B with <1% performance drop, completing compression in under 60 seconds.

Conclusion: Birkhoff is a competitive, efficient solution for compressing SAMs, balancing speed, ratio, and performance.

Abstract: Due to the excellent performance in yielding high-quality, zero-shot
segmentation, Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its variants have been widely
applied in diverse scenarios such as healthcare and intelligent manufacturing.
Therefore, effectively compressing SAMs has become an increasingly pressing
practical need. In this study, we propose Birkhoff, a novel data-free
compression algorithm for SAM and its variants. Unlike quantization, pruning,
distillation, and other compression methods, Birkhoff embodies versatility
across model types, agility in deployment, faithfulness to the original model,
and compactness in model size. Specifically, Birkhoff introduces a novel
compression algorithm: Hyper-Compression, whose core principle is to find a
dense trajectory to turn a high-dimensional parameter vector into a
low-dimensional scalar. Furthermore, Birkhoff designs a dedicated linear layer
operator, HyperLinear, to fuse decompression and matrix multiplication to
significantly accelerate inference of the compressed SAMs. Extensive
experiments on 18 SAMs in the COCO, LVIS, and SA-1B datasets show that Birkhoff
performs consistently and competitively in compression time, compression ratio,
post-compression performance, and inference speed. For example, Birkhoff can
achieve a compression ratio of 5.17x on SAM2-B, with less than 1% performance
drop without using any fine-tuning data. Moreover, the compression is finished
within 60 seconds for all models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address intraclass variability in handwritten digits and provide an interpretable classification framework.

Method: Uses a CNN for feature extraction, k-means clustering for prototypes, and a Hopfield network for energy-based classification.

Result: Achieves 99.2% test accuracy on MNIST, demonstrating robustness to diverse handwriting styles.

Conclusion: Deep feature extraction and prototype coverage are key to high performance, with potential for broader pattern recognition applications.

Abstract: This study presents a hybrid model for classifying handwritten digits in the
MNIST dataset, combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a multi-well
Hopfield network. The approach employs a CNN to extract high-dimensional
features from input images, which are then clustered into class-specific
prototypes using k-means clustering. These prototypes serve as attractors in a
multi-well energy landscape, where a Hopfield network performs classification
by minimizing an energy function that balances feature similarity and class
assignment.The model's design enables robust handling of intraclass
variability, such as diverse handwriting styles, while providing an
interpretable framework through its energy-based decision process. Through
systematic optimization of the CNN architecture and the number of wells, the
model achieves a high test accuracy of 99.2% on 10,000 MNIST images,
demonstrating its effectiveness for image classification tasks. The findings
highlight the critical role of deep feature extraction and sufficient prototype
coverage in achieving high performance, with potential for broader applications
in pattern recognition.

Motivation: To create adaptive, generative neural interfaces for future human-computer interaction by simulating realistic GUI behaviors.

Method: Uses an RNN for state tracking and a diffusion-based neural renderer, trained on Ubuntu XFCE recordings with random and AI-generated interactions.

Result: Successfully renders realistic GUI sequences, captures mouse interactions, and predicts state transitions like app launches, though keyboard interactions are less precise.

Conclusion: NeuralOS advances toward fully adaptive neural interfaces, despite challenges in fine-grained keyboard modeling.

Abstract: We introduce NeuralOS, a neural framework that simulates graphical user
interfaces (GUIs) of operating systems by directly predicting screen frames in
response to user inputs such as mouse movements, clicks, and keyboard events.
NeuralOS combines a recurrent neural network (RNN), which tracks computer
state, with a diffusion-based neural renderer that generates screen images. The
model is trained on a large-scale dataset of Ubuntu XFCE recordings, which
include both randomly generated interactions and realistic interactions
produced by AI agents. Experiments show that NeuralOS successfully renders
realistic GUI sequences, accurately captures mouse interactions, and reliably

TL;DR: CoPart introduces a part-aware diffusion framework for 3D generation, addressing limitations of single-latent representations by decomposing objects into contextual part latents. It enables part-level editing and controllability, validated by experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D generation methods struggle with multi-part geometries, part independence, and fine-grained controllability. CoPart aims to overcome these by mimicking human design workflows.

Method: CoPart decomposes 3D objects into part latents, uses mutual guidance for joint denoising, and leverages the Partverse dataset for training.

Result: CoPart excels in part-level editing, articulated object generation, and scene composition with high controllability.

Conclusion: CoPart advances 3D generation by enabling part-aware modeling and fine-grained control, validated by superior experimental results.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D generation have transitioned from multi-view 2D
rendering approaches to 3D-native latent diffusion frameworks that exploit
geometric priors in ground truth data. Despite progress, three key limitations
persist: (1) Single-latent representations fail to capture complex multi-part
geometries, causing detail degradation; (2) Holistic latent coding neglects
part independence and interrelationships critical for compositional design; (3)
Global conditioning mechanisms lack fine-grained controllability. Inspired by
human 3D design workflows, we propose CoPart - a part-aware diffusion framework
that decomposes 3D objects into contextual part latents for coherent multi-part
generation. This paradigm offers three advantages: i) Reduces encoding
complexity through part decomposition; ii) Enables explicit part relationship
modeling; iii) Supports part-level conditioning. We further develop a mutual
guidance strategy to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models for joint part
latent denoising, ensuring both geometric coherence and foundation model
priors. To enable large-scale training, we construct Partverse - a novel 3D
part dataset derived from Objaverse through automated mesh segmentation and
human-verified annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoPart's superior
capabilities in part-level editing, articulated object generation, and scene
composition with unprecedented controllability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLiFTs, a neural rendering method using compressed light-field tokens for efficient scene representation and rendering, balancing data size, quality, and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve efficient rendering with rich scene information while allowing flexibility in token count and novel view synthesis.

Method: Uses multi-view encoder, latent-space K-means, and a condenser to create CLiFTs. A compute-adaptive renderer synthesizes views based on specified token counts.

Result: Achieves significant data reduction with comparable quality, highest rendering score, and flexible trade-offs.

Conclusion: CLiFTs offer an effective solution for neural rendering with adaptable compute and quality trade-offs.

Abstract: This paper proposes a neural rendering approach that represents a scene as
"compressed light-field tokens (CLiFTs)", retaining rich appearance and
geometric information of a scene. CLiFT enables compute-efficient rendering by
compressed tokens, while being capable of changing the number of tokens to
represent a scene or render a novel view with one trained network. Concretely,
given a set of images, multi-view encoder tokenizes the images with the camera
poses. Latent-space K-means selects a reduced set of rays as cluster centroids
using the tokens. The multi-view ``condenser'' compresses the information of
all the tokens into the centroid tokens to construct CLiFTs. At test time,
given a target view and a compute budget (i.e., the number of CLiFTs), the
system collects the specified number of nearby tokens and synthesizes a novel
view using a compute-adaptive renderer. Extensive experiments on RealEstate10K
and DL3DV datasets quantitatively and qualitatively validate our approach,
achieving significant data reduction with comparable rendering quality and the
highest overall rendering score, while providing trade-offs of data size,
rendering quality, and rendering speed.

TL;DR: Lumos-1 is an autoregressive video generator that retains LLM architecture with minimal modifications, using 3D RoPE and MM-RoPE for spatiotemporal correlations, and AR-DF for balanced frame-wise loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing autoregressive video generators, such as divergence from LLM architectures, reliance on bulky encoders, or high latency.

Method: Introduces Lumos-1 with 3D RoPE and MM-RoPE for spatiotemporal modeling, and AR-DF for balanced training. Uses memory-efficient techniques for pre-training.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to EMU3, COSMOS-Video2World, and OpenSoraPlan on benchmarks like GenEval and VBench.

Conclusion: Lumos-1 successfully integrates LLM architecture for video generation, offering efficient training and competitive performance.

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have unified a vast range of
language tasks, inspiring preliminary efforts in autoregressive video
generation. Existing autoregressive video generators either diverge from
standard LLM architectures, depend on bulky external text encoders, or incur
prohibitive latency due to next-token decoding. In this paper, we introduce
Lumos-1, an autoregressive video generator that retains the LLM architecture
with minimal architectural modifications. To inject spatiotemporal correlations
in LLMs, we identify the efficacy of incorporating 3D RoPE and diagnose its
imbalanced frequency spectrum ranges. Therefore, we propose MM-RoPE, a RoPE
scheme that preserves the original textual RoPE while providing comprehensive
frequency spectra and scaled 3D positions for modeling multimodal
spatiotemporal data. Moreover, Lumos-1 resorts to a token dependency strategy
that obeys intra-frame bidirectionality and inter-frame temporal causality.
Based on this dependency strategy, we identify the issue of frame-wise loss
imbalance caused by spatial information redundancy and solve it by proposing
Autoregressive Discrete Diffusion Forcing (AR-DF). AR-DF introduces temporal
tube masking during training with a compatible inference-time masking policy to
avoid quality degradation. By using memory-efficient training techniques, we
pre-train Lumos-1 on only 48 GPUs, achieving performance comparable to EMU3 on
GenEval, COSMOS-Video2World on VBench-I2V, and OpenSoraPlan on VBench-T2V. Code

Conclusion: TableReasoner effectively addresses TQA challenges through structured reasoning and iterative refinement, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: The paper presents our system developed for table question answering (TQA).
TQA tasks face challenges due to the characteristics of real-world tabular
data, such as large size, incomplete column semantics, and entity ambiguity. To
address these issues, we propose a large language model (LLM)-powered and
programming-based table reasoning framework, named TableReasoner. It models a
table using the schema that combines structural and semantic representations,
enabling holistic understanding and efficient processing of large tables. We
design a multi-step schema linking plan to derive a focused table schema that
retains only query-relevant information, eliminating ambiguity and alleviating
hallucinations. This focused table schema provides precise and sufficient table
details for query refinement and programming. Furthermore, we integrate the
reasoning workflow into an iterative thinking architecture, allowing

Motivation: Addressing the growing concern of jailbreaking in LLMs by modeling attacker-defender dynamics.

Method: Uses a sequential extensive-form game framework and the 'Purple Agent' with RRT for adversarial exploration and defense.

Result: Provides a principled method to analyze and mitigate jailbreaking risks.

Conclusion: The framework and agent offer a foundation for proactive defense against LLM jailbreaking.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical
applications, the challenge of jailbreaking, where adversaries manipulate the
models to bypass safety mechanisms, has become a significant concern. This
paper presents a dynamic Stackelberg game framework to model the interactions
between attackers and defenders in the context of LLM jailbreaking. The
framework treats the prompt-response dynamics as a sequential extensive-form
game, where the defender, as the leader, commits to a strategy while
anticipating the attacker's optimal responses. We propose a novel agentic AI
solution, the "Purple Agent," which integrates adversarial exploration and
defensive strategies using Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT). The Purple
Agent actively simulates potential attack trajectories and intervenes
proactively to prevent harmful outputs. This approach offers a principled
method for analyzing adversarial dynamics and provides a foundation for

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The LLM-Nash framework models strategic interaction using LLMs, where agents choose reasoning prompts, capturing bounded rationality and diverging from classical Nash equilibria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study strategic interactions in LLM-enabled systems by explicitly modeling reasoning processes and bounded rationality.

Method: Agents select reasoning prompts for LLM-guided decision-making, with equilibrium defined over the prompt space.

Result: Reasoning equilibria differ from classical Nash outcomes, highlighting cognitive constraints and mindset expressiveness.

Conclusion: The framework provides a new foundation for analyzing strategic interactions in systems powered by LLMs.

Abstract: We introduce the LLM-Nash framework, a game-theoretic model where agents
select reasoning prompts to guide decision-making via Large Language Models
(LLMs). Unlike classical games that assume utility-maximizing agents with full
rationality, this framework captures bounded rationality by modeling the
reasoning process explicitly. Equilibrium is defined over the prompt space,
with actions emerging as the behavioral output of LLM inference. This approach
enables the study of cognitive constraints, mindset expressiveness, and
epistemic learning. Through illustrative examples, we show how reasoning
equilibria can diverge from classical Nash outcomes, offering a new foundation
for strategic interaction in LLM-enabled systems.

*Fryderyk Mantiuk,Hanqi Zhou,Charley M. Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how agents balance curiosity (seeking knowledge) and competence (controlling the environment) in exploration, comparing model-based agents with handcrafted (Tabular) and learned (Dreamer) representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the interplay between curiosity and competence in intelligent agents, bridging cognitive theories and reinforcement learning.

Method: Comparison of two model-based agents: Tabular (handcrafted state abstractions) and Dreamer (learned internal world model).

Result: Tabular shows distinct exploration patterns for curiosity and competence, while Dreamer reveals a two-way interaction between exploration and representation learning.

Conclusion: Adaptive exploration balances the unknown and controllable, offering insights for cognitive theories and efficient reinforcement learning.

Abstract: What drives an agent to explore the world while also maintaining control over
the environment? From a child at play to scientists in the lab, intelligent
agents must balance curiosity (the drive to seek knowledge) with competence
(the drive to master and control the environment). Bridging cognitive theories
of intrinsic motivation with reinforcement learning, we ask how evolving
internal representations mediate the trade-off between curiosity (novelty or
information gain) and competence (empowerment). We compare two model-based
agents using handcrafted state abstractions (Tabular) or learning an internal
world model (Dreamer). The Tabular agent shows curiosity and competence guide
exploration in distinct patterns, while prioritizing both improves exploration.
The Dreamer agent reveals a two-way interaction between exploration and
representation learning, mirroring the developmental co-evolution of curiosity
and competence. Our findings formalize adaptive exploration as a balance
between pursuing the unknown and the controllable, offering insights for
cognitive theories and efficient reinforcement learning.

### [77] [Grounding Methods for Neural-Symbolic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08216)
*Rodrigo Castellano Ontiveros,Francesco Giannini,Marco Gori,Giuseppe Marra,Michelangelo Diligenti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a parametrized family of grounding methods for Neural-Symbolic (NeSy) systems, balancing expressiveness and scalability by generalizing Backward Chaining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between exhaustive (combinatorially explosive) and heuristic-based (unjustified) grounding methods in NeSy systems.

Method: Introduces a parametrized family of grounding methods inspired by multi-hop symbolic reasoning, generalizing Backward Chaining.

Result: Demonstrates that grounding criterion selection is as critical as the NeSy method itself, offering control over expressiveness and scalability.

Conclusion: The proposed grounding methods provide a flexible and justified approach to improve NeSy systems' efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: A large class of Neural-Symbolic (NeSy) methods employs a machine learner to
process the input entities, while relying on a reasoner based on First-Order
Logic to represent and process more complex relationships among the entities. A
fundamental role for these methods is played by the process of logic grounding,
which determines the relevant substitutions for the logic rules using a
(sub)set of entities. Some NeSy methods use an exhaustive derivation of all
possible substitutions, preserving the full expressive power of the logic
knowledge. This leads to a combinatorial explosion in the number of ground
formulas to consider and, therefore, strongly limits their scalability. Other
methods rely on heuristic-based selective derivations, which are generally more
computationally efficient, but lack a justification and provide no guarantees
of preserving the information provided to and returned by the reasoner. Taking
inspiration from multi-hop symbolic reasoning, this paper proposes a
parametrized family of grounding methods generalizing classic Backward
Chaining. Different selections within this family allow us to obtain commonly
employed grounding methods as special cases, and to control the trade-off
between expressiveness and scalability of the reasoner. The experimental
results show that the selection of the grounding criterion is often as
important as the NeSy method itself.

### [78] [Quantum Federated Learning for Multimodal Data: A Modality-Agnostic Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08217)
*Atit Pokharel,Ratun Rahman,Thomas Morris,Dinh C. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel multimodal quantum federated learning (QFL) method with a Missing Modality Agnostic (MMA) mechanism is introduced, improving accuracy by 6.84% (IID) and 7.25% (non-IID) over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QFL frameworks are limited to unimodal systems, restricting their real-world applicability for tasks involving multiple modalities.

Method: Proposes a multimodal QFL approach with intermediate fusion using quantum entanglement and introduces MMA to handle missing modalities by isolating untrained circuits.

Result: Simulations show accuracy improvements of 6.84% (IID) and 7.25% (non-IID) compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The multimodal QFL with MMA effectively addresses limitations of unimodal systems and enhances performance in distributed quantum machine learning.

Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) has been recently introduced to enable a
distributed privacy-preserving quantum machine learning (QML) model training
across quantum processors (clients). Despite recent research efforts, existing
QFL frameworks predominantly focus on unimodal systems, limiting their
applicability to real-world tasks that often naturally involve multiple
modalities. To fill this significant gap, we present for the first time a novel
multimodal approach specifically tailored for the QFL setting with the
intermediate fusion using quantum entanglement. Furthermore, to address a major
bottleneck in multimodal QFL, where the absence of certain modalities during
training can degrade model performance, we introduce a Missing Modality
Agnostic (MMA) mechanism that isolates untrained quantum circuits, ensuring
stable training without corrupted states. Simulation results demonstrate that
the proposed multimodal QFL method with MMA yields an improvement in accuracy
of 6.84% in independent and identically distributed (IID) and 7.25% in non-IID
data distributions compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: AI agents accessing cryptocurrencies and smart contracts could introduce new harm vectors, requiring technical research for safer implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing interest in AI agents using cryptocurrencies and smart contracts raises concerns about potential new harm vectors.

Method: Examines unique properties of cryptocurrencies and smart contracts that enable harm, details these vectors, and calls for research.

Result: Identifies new harm vectors from AI agents using cryptocurrencies and smart contracts.

Conclusion: Urges technical research to mitigate harms and safely integrate AI with cryptocurrencies and smart contracts.

Abstract: There is growing interest in giving AI agents access to cryptocurrencies as
well as to the smart contracts that transact them. But doing so, this position
paper argues, could lead to formidable new vectors of AI harm. To support this
argument, we first examine the unique properties of cryptocurrencies and smart
contracts that could lead to these new vectors of harm. Next, we describe each
of these new vectors of harm in detail. Finally, we conclude with a call for
more technical research aimed at preventing and mitigating these harms and,
thereby making it safer to endow AI agents with cryptocurrencies and smart
contracts.

TL;DR: The paper reviews abductive reasoning in epistemology, science, and design, analyzes computational implementations, and identifies gaps in generating creative hypotheses, suggesting future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the limitations in how abductive reasoning is theoretically and computationally applied, particularly in generating creative hypotheses.

Method: Review of abductive reasoning in epistemology, science, and design, followed by analysis of computational systems implementing abductive reasoning.

Result: Theoretical frameworks lack models for creative abductive hypotheses, and computational systems mainly use syllogistic forms, missing creativity.

Conclusion: Future research should focus on advancing creative abductive reasoning in computational systems by addressing identified gaps.

Abstract: Abductive reasoning, reasoning for inferring explanations for observations,
is often mentioned in scientific, design-related and artistic contexts, but its
understanding varies across these domains. This paper reviews how abductive
reasoning is discussed in epistemology, science and design, and then analyses
how various computational systems use abductive reasoning. Our analysis shows
that neither theoretical accounts nor computational implementations of
abductive reasoning adequately address generating creative hypotheses.
Theoretical frameworks do not provide a straightforward model for generating
creative abductive hypotheses, computational systems largely implement
syllogistic forms of abductive reasoning. We break down abductive computational
systems into components and conclude by identifying specific directions for
future research that could advance the state of creative abductive reasoning in
computational systems.

*Zeyang Sha,Hanling Tian,Zhuoer Xu,Shiwen Cui,Changhua Meng,Weiqiang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A unified safety-alignment framework for tool-using LLM agents addresses threats from adversarial prompts and malicious tool outputs via structured reasoning and sandboxed reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous LLM agents using tools face new safety risks beyond conversational misuse, requiring a solution for dual-threat scenarios.

Method: Proposes a tri-modal taxonomy (benign, malicious, sensitive) and a policy-driven decision model, tested in a custom sandbox environment with fine-grained reward shaping.

Result: Safety-aligned agents improve threat resistance while maintaining utility on benign tasks, as shown in benchmarks like Agent SafetyBench.

Conclusion: Safety and effectiveness can be jointly optimized, enabling trustworthy deployment of autonomous LLM agents.

Abstract: The emergence of autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents capable of tool
usage has introduced new safety risks that go beyond traditional conversational
misuse. These agents, empowered to execute external functions, are vulnerable
to both user-initiated threats (e.g., adversarial prompts) and tool-initiated
threats (e.g., malicious outputs from compromised tools). In this paper, we
propose the first unified safety-alignment framework for tool-using agents,
enabling models to handle both channels of threat via structured reasoning and
sandboxed reinforcement learning. We introduce a tri-modal taxonomy, including
benign, malicious, and sensitive for both user prompts and tool responses, and
define a policy-driven decision model. Our framework employs a custom-designed
sandbox environment that simulates real-world tool execution and allows
fine-grained reward shaping. Through extensive evaluations on public and
self-built benchmarks, including Agent SafetyBench, InjecAgent, and BFCL, we
demonstrate that our safety-aligned agents significantly improve resistance to
security threats while preserving strong utility on benign tasks. Our results
show that safety and effectiveness can be jointly optimized, laying the
groundwork for trustworthy deployment of autonomous LLM agents.

TL;DR: M2-Reasoning-7B, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM), addresses dynamic spatial interaction gaps with a novel data pipeline and dynamic training strategy, achieving SOTA in 8 benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs lack dynamic spatial interaction capabilities, limiting real-world applications.

Method: Introduces a data pipeline generating 294.2K high-quality samples and a dynamic multi-task training strategy with step-wise optimization and task-specific rewards.

Result: M2-Reasoning-7B achieves SOTA in 8 benchmarks, excelling in general and spatial reasoning.

Conclusion: The model bridges the gap in spatial reasoning, enhancing MLLM capabilities for practical use.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly
through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), have
significantly enhanced their reasoning abilities. However, a critical gap
persists: these models struggle with dynamic spatial interactions, a capability
essential for real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce
M2-Reasoning-7B, a model designed to excel in both general and spatial
reasoning. Our approach integrates two key innovations: (1) a novel data
pipeline that generates 294.2K high-quality data samples (168K for cold-start
fine-tuning and 126.2K for RLVR), which feature logically coherent reasoning
trajectories and have undergone comprehensive assessment; and (2) a dynamic
multi-task training strategy with step-wise optimization to mitigate conflicts
between data, and task-specific rewards for delivering tailored incentive
signals. This combination of curated data and advanced training allows
M2-Reasoning-7B to set a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) across 8 benchmarks,
showcasing superior performance in both general and spatial reasoning domains.

*Asma Yamani,Malak Baslyman,Moataz Ahmed*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework using an ethics advocate agent in a multi-agent LLM setting to generate ethics requirements drafts, evaluated through case studies, showing promise but needing human feedback for reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ethics requirements are often overlooked in requirements elicitation due to time and resource constraints, despite their importance for ethically aligned systems.

Method: Proposes a framework with an ethics advocate agent in a multi-agent LLM setting to critique and generate ethics requirements drafts.

Result: Captures most ethics requirements from interviews and adds new ones, but reliability issues highlight the need for human feedback.

Conclusion: The framework can aid broader ethics adoption in requirements engineering, though human oversight remains crucial.

Abstract: Incorporating ethics into the requirement elicitation process is essential
for creating ethically aligned systems. Although eliciting manual ethics
requirements is effective, it requires diverse input from multiple
stakeholders, which can be challenging due to time and resource constraints.
Moreover, it is often given a low priority in the requirements elicitation
process. This study proposes a framework for generating ethics requirements
drafts by introducing an ethics advocate agent in a multi-agent LLM setting.
This agent critiques and provides input on ethical issues based on the system
description. The proposed framework is evaluated through two case studies from
different contexts, demonstrating that it captures the majority of ethics
requirements identified by researchers during 30-minute interviews and
introduces several additional relevant requirements. However, it also
highlights reliability issues in generating ethics requirements, emphasizing
the need for human feedback in this sensitive domain. We believe this work can
facilitate the broader adoption of ethics in the requirements engineering
process, ultimately leading to more ethically aligned products.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize and analyze contrastive explanations by comparing causes for P and Q, addressing gaps in existing literature.

Method: Defines contrastive explanation problems in propositional logic, analyzes their properties, evaluates computational complexities, and implements them using answer set programming for CNF-formulas.

Result: The framework captures a cardinality-minimal version of existing contrastive explanations and provides computational complexity insights.

Conclusion: The study offers a formal and practical approach to contrastive explanations, demonstrating feasibility through implementation and examples.

Abstract: We define several canonical problems related to contrastive explanations,
each answering a question of the form ''Why P but not Q?''. The problems
compute causes for both P and Q, explicitly comparing their differences. We
investigate the basic properties of our definitions in the setting of
propositional logic. We show, inter alia, that our framework captures a

*Keying Yang,Hao Wang,Kai Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A bi-level framework maps natural language to logic via task abstraction and logic generation, outperforming baselines by up to 40% in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between unstructured language and formal logic for systematic reasoning.

Method: Two-stage process: high-level task abstraction (problem type, objectives, constraints) and low-level logic generation (symbolic workflows). Optimized with bi-level joint refinement.

Result: 40% accuracy improvement over baselines; supports modular reasoning and generalizes across domains.

Conclusion: The bi-level framework enhances accuracy, transparency, and error traceability, advancing trustworthy reasoning with LLMs.

Abstract: Structured reasoning over natural language inputs remains a core challenge in
artificial intelligence, as it requires bridging the gap between unstructured
linguistic expressions and formal logical representations. In this paper, we
propose a novel \textbf{bi-level framework} that maps language to logic through
a two-stage process: high-level task abstraction and low-level logic
generation. At the upper level, a large language model (LLM) parses natural
language queries into intermediate structured representations specifying the
problem type, objectives, decision variables, and symbolic constraints. At the
lower level, the LLM uses these representations to generate symbolic workflows
or executable reasoning programs for accurate and interpretable decision
making. The framework supports modular reasoning, enforces explicit
constraints, and generalizes across domains such as mathematical problem
solving, question answering, and logical inference. We further optimize the
framework with an end-to-end {bi-level} optimization approach that jointly
refines both the high-level abstraction and low-level logic generation stages.
Experiments on multiple realistic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing baselines in accuracy, with
accuracy gains reaching as high as 40\%. Moreover, the bi-level design enhances
transparency and error traceability, offering a promising step toward
trustworthy and systematic reasoning with LLMs.

*Mingda Zhang,Na Zhao,Jianglong Qin,Guoyu Ye,Ruixiang Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework combining multi-granularity sparse activation of medical concepts with a hierarchical knowledge graph improves rare-disease diagnosis, achieving significant performance gains and expert-validated improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rare-disease diagnosis is hindered by insufficient knowledge representation, limited concept understanding, and constrained clinical reasoning in existing medical language models.

Method: The framework uses multi-granularity sparse activation, a hierarchical knowledge graph (taxonomy, clinical features, instances), four matching algorithms, diversity control, and a five-level fallback strategy.

Result: Experiments show BLEU gains of 0.09, ROUGE gains of 0.05, and accuracy gains of 0.12, with peak accuracy of 0.89. Expert evaluation confirms improved information quality and reasoning.

Conclusion: The approach enhances rare-disease diagnosis, potentially shortening the diagnostic odyssey for patients.

Abstract: Despite advances from medical large language models in healthcare,
rare-disease diagnosis remains hampered by insufficient
knowledge-representation depth, limited concept understanding, and constrained
clinical reasoning. We propose a framework that couples multi-granularity
sparse activation of medical concepts with a hierarchical knowledge graph. Four
complementary matching algorithms, diversity control, and a five-level fallback
strategy enable precise concept activation, while a three-layer knowledge graph
(taxonomy, clinical features, instances) provides structured, up-to-date
context. Experiments on the BioASQ rare-disease QA set show BLEU gains of 0.09,
ROUGE gains of 0.05, and accuracy gains of 0.12, with peak accuracy of 0.89
approaching the 0.90 clinical threshold. Expert evaluation confirms
improvements in information quality, reasoning, and professional expression,
suggesting our approach shortens the "diagnostic odyssey" for rare-disease
patients.

*Kalana Wijegunarathna,Kristin Stock,Christopher B. Jones*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel method using Large Multi-Modal Models (LMM) for georeferencing biological samples achieves ~1 km error, outperforming existing tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Millions of un-georeferenced biological samples require labor-intensive georeferencing, and existing methods don't utilize maps effectively.

Method: Uses LMMs to visually contextualize spatial relations in locality descriptions via a grid-based, zero-shot approach.

Result: Achieves ~1 km average distance error, better than uni-modal LLMs and existing tools.

Conclusion: LMMs show promise for fine-grained map comprehension; a practical framework is proposed for integration into workflows.

Abstract: Millions of biological sample records collected in the last few centuries
archived in natural history collections are un-georeferenced. Georeferencing
complex locality descriptions associated with these collection samples is a
highly labour-intensive task collection agencies struggle with. None of the
existing automated methods exploit maps that are an essential tool for
georeferencing complex relations. We present preliminary experiments and
results of a novel method that exploits multi-modal capabilities of recent
Large Multi-Modal Models (LMM). This method enables the model to visually
contextualize spatial relations it reads in the locality description. We use a
grid-based approach to adapt these auto-regressive models for this task in a
zero-shot setting. Our experiments conducted on a small manually annotated
dataset show impressive results for our approach ($\sim$1 km Average distance
error) compared to uni-modal georeferencing with Large Language Models and
existing georeferencing tools. The paper also discusses the findings of the
experiments in light of an LMM's ability to comprehend fine-grained maps.
Motivated by these results, a practical framework is proposed to integrate this
method into a georeferencing workflow.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a query rewriting framework with multi-LLM knowledge fusion to improve speech instruction dataset quality without human annotation, increasing data usability from 72% to 93%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for speech instruction datasets rely on biased training tasks or LLM-generated continuations, which amplify shortcomings due to gaps between LLM outputs and human responses. Human annotation is costly, making speech synthesis a viable alternative, but TTS models struggle with out-of-distribution text instructions.

Method: A query rewriting framework with multi-LLM knowledge fusion is introduced, using multiple agents to annotate and validate synthesized speech. This zero-shot rewriting approach adapts text instructions for TTS models.

Result: The method improves data usability from 72% to 93% and excels in tasks requiring complex knowledge and context-related abilities.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively constructs high-quality speech instruction datasets without human annotation, addressing limitations of TTS models and LLM-generated data.

Abstract: End-to-end Large Speech Language Models~(\textbf{LSLMs}) demonstrate strong
potential in response latency and speech comprehension capabilities, showcasing
general intelligence across speech understanding tasks. However, the ability to
follow speech instructions has not been fully realized due to the lack of
datasets and heavily biased training tasks. Leveraging the rich ASR datasets,
previous approaches have used Large Language Models~(\textbf{LLMs}) to continue
the linguistic information of speech to construct speech instruction datasets.
Yet, due to the gap between LLM-generated results and real human responses, the
continuation methods further amplify these shortcomings. Given the high costs
of collecting and annotating speech instruction datasets by humans, using
speech synthesis to construct large-scale speech instruction datasets has
become a balanced and robust alternative. Although modern
Text-To-Speech~(\textbf{TTS}) models have achieved near-human-level synthesis
quality, it is challenging to appropriately convert out-of-distribution text
instruction to speech due to the limitations of the training data distribution
in TTS models. To address this issue, we propose a query rewriting framework
with multi-LLM knowledge fusion, employing multiple agents to annotate and
validate the synthesized speech, making it possible to construct high-quality
speech instruction datasets without relying on human annotation. Experiments
show that this method can transform text instructions into distributions more
suitable for TTS models for speech synthesis through zero-shot rewriting,
increasing data usability from 72\% to 93\%. It also demonstrates unique
advantages in rewriting tasks that require complex knowledge and
context-related abilities.

TL;DR: A study compares multi-agent (MAS) and two-agent (2AS) systems for engineering design tasks, finding MAS enhances detail but struggles with requirement coverage and code compatibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve early-stage engineering design by evaluating structured multi-agent systems for task continuity and executable model generation.

Method: Comparison of a nine-role MAS and a simpler 2AS using Design-State Graph (DSG) representation, tested with two LLMs across 60 experiments.

Result: MAS produced more granular DSGs but had low requirement coverage (under 20%) and code compatibility (below 50%). 2AS achieved 100% code compatibility in specific settings.

Conclusion: Structured multi-agent systems enhance design detail, but gaps in requirement coverage and code fidelity remain challenges.

Abstract: Early-stage engineering design involves complex, iterative reasoning, yet
existing large language model (LLM) workflows struggle to maintain task
continuity and generate executable models. We evaluate whether a structured
multi-agent system (MAS) can more effectively manage requirements extraction,
functional decomposition, and simulator code generation than a simpler
two-agent system (2AS). The target application is a solar-powered water
filtration system as described in a cahier des charges. We introduce the
Design-State Graph (DSG), a JSON-serializable representation that bundles
requirements, physical embodiments, and Python-based physics models into graph
nodes. A nine-role MAS iteratively builds and refines the DSG, while the 2AS
collapses the process to a Generator-Reflector loop. Both systems run a total
of 60 experiments (2 LLMs - Llama 3.3 70B vs reasoning-distilled DeepSeek R1
70B x 2 agent configurations x 3 temperatures x 5 seeds). We report a JSON
validity, requirement coverage, embodiment presence, code compatibility,
workflow completion, runtime, and graph size. Across all runs, both MAS and 2AS
maintained perfect JSON integrity and embodiment tagging. Requirement coverage
remained minimal (less than 20\%). Code compatibility peaked at 100\% under
specific 2AS settings but averaged below 50\% for MAS. Only the
reasoning-distilled model reliably flagged workflow completion. Powered by
DeepSeek R1 70B, the MAS generated more granular DSGs (average 5-6 nodes)
whereas 2AS mode-collapsed. Structured multi-agent orchestration enhanced
design detail. Reasoning-distilled LLM improved completion rates, yet low
requirements and fidelity gaps in coding persisted.

TL;DR: Leanabell-Prover-V2 is a 7B LLM for formal theorem proofs in Lean 4, using verifier-integrated CoT and RL with feedback. It improves performance by 3.2% and 2.0% on MiniF2F.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance theorem-proving performance by integrating verifier feedback for self-aware error correction and stable RL training.

Method: Upgrades RL with Lean 4 verifier feedback, uses feedback token masking, and optimizes reasoning trajectories via multi-turn verifier interactions.

Result: Performance improvements of 3.2% and 2.0% on MiniF2F test set with two base models.

Conclusion: Leanabell-Prover-V2 effectively leverages verifier feedback for improved theorem proving, with open-sourced resources.

Abstract: We introduce our Leanabell-Prover-V2, a 7B large language models (LLMs) that
can produce formal theorem proofs in Lean 4, with verifier-integrated Long
Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT). Following our previous work Leanabell-Prover-V1, we
continual to choose to posttrain existing strong prover models for further
performance improvement. In our V2 version, we mainly upgrade the Reinforcement
Learning (RL) with feedback provided by the Lean 4 verifier. Crucially,
verifier feedback, such as indicating success or detailing specific errors,
allows the LLM to become ``self-aware'' of the correctness of its own reasoning
process and learn to reflexively correct errors. Leanabell-Prover-V2 directly
optimizes LLM reasoning trajectories with multi-turn verifier interactions,
together with feedback token masking for stable RL training and a simple reward
strategy. Experiments show that Leanabell-Prover-V2 improves performance by
3.2% (pass@128) with Kimina-Prover-Preview-Distill-7B and 2.0% (pass@128) with
DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B on the MiniF2F test set. The source codes, curated data

Result: Experiments show INoT improves performance by 7.95% on average and reduces token costs by 58.3% compared to baselines.

Conclusion: INoT is effective and versatile, offering significant improvements in performance and cost efficiency for AI Agents.

Abstract: AI Agents rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal-LLMs (MLLMs) to
perform interpretation and inference in text and image tasks without
post-training, where LLMs and MLLMs play the most critical role and determine
the initial ability and limitations of AI Agents. Usually, AI Agents utilize
sophisticated prompt engineering and external reasoning framework to obtain a
promising interaction with LLMs, e.g., Chain-of-Thought, Iteration of Thought
and Image-of-Thought. However, they are still constrained by the inherent
limitations of LLM in understanding natural language, and the iterative
reasoning process will generate a large amount of inference cost. To this end,
we propose a novel AI Agent Reasoning Framework with Introspection of Thought
(INoT) by designing a new LLM-Read code in prompt. It enables LLM to execute
programmatic dialogue reasoning processes following the code in prompt.
Therefore, self-denial and reflection occur within LLM instead of outside LLM,
which can reduce token cost effectively. Through our experiments on six
benchmarks for three different tasks, the effectiveness of INoT is verified,
with an average improvement of 7.95\% in performance, exceeding the baselines.
Furthermore, the token cost of INoT is lower on average than the best
performing method at baseline by 58.3\%. In addition, we demonstrate the
versatility of INoT in image interpretation and inference through verification
experiments.

TL;DR: Surrogate-based optimization, like Bayesian optimization, addresses challenges in exploring novel system architectures by reducing computational costs and handling failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dedicated approaches for system-of-systems optimization face challenges like high evaluation costs and potential failures, necessitating more efficient methods.

Method: Surrogate-based optimization algorithms, particularly Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process models, are employed.

Result: These methods reduce computational complexity and improve the exploration of innovative architectures.

Conclusion: Surrogate-based optimization is effective for tackling the challenges of system-of-systems architecting.

Abstract: For developing innovative systems architectures, modeling and optimization
techniques have been central to frame the architecting process and define the
optimization and modeling problems. In this context, for system-of-systems the
use of efficient dedicated approaches (often physics-based simulations) is
highly recommended to reduce the computational complexity of the targeted
applications. However, exploring novel architectures using such dedicated
approaches might pose challenges for optimization algorithms, including
increased evaluation costs and potential failures. To address these challenges,
surrogate-based optimization algorithms, such as Bayesian optimization
utilizing Gaussian process models have emerged.

*Atli Sigurgeirsson,Simon King*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel fine-tuning method improves controllability in prompt-based TTS models by leveraging latent features from uncontrollable variance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in prompt-based TTS models where control is constrained to predefined features and outputs vary uncontrollably.

Method: Uses PCA on synthesized samples to identify latent features, then fine-tunes models with these features as labels. Evaluated on Icelandic speech models with and without emotional disclosure.

Result: Improved controllability, yielding both continuous and discrete features, especially in models without emotional disclosure.

Conclusion: The method effectively enhances controllability by exploiting latent variance, offering a solution to flexibility and constraint issues.

Abstract: A Prompt-based Text-To-Speech model allows a user to control different
aspects of speech, such as speaking rate and perceived gender, through natural
language instruction. Although user-friendly, such approaches are on one hand
constrained: control is limited to acoustic features exposed to the model
during training, and too flexible on the other: the same inputs yields
uncontrollable variation that are reflected in the corpus statistics.
  We investigate a novel fine-tuning regime to address both of these issues at
the same time by exploiting the uncontrollable variance of the model. Through
principal component analysis of thousands of synthesised samples, we determine
latent features that account for the highest proportion of the output variance
and incorporate them as new labels for secondary fine-tuning. We evaluate the
proposed methods on two models trained on an expressive Icelandic speech
corpus, one with emotional disclosure and one without. In the case of the model
without emotional disclosure, the method yields both continuous and discrete
features that improve overall controllability of the model.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose NLP models like BERT and GPT struggle with biomedical terminology, necessitating a domain-specific solution for tasks like named entity recognition and relation extraction.

Method: Proposed MedicalBERT, a BERT-based model pretrained on a large biomedical dataset with domain-specific vocabulary, optimized and fine-tuned for diverse biomedical NLP tasks.

Result: MedicalBERT outperforms BioBERT, SciBERT, ClinicalBERT, and general-purpose BERT, achieving higher F1-scores, accuracy, and Pearson correlation.

Conclusion: MedicalBERT demonstrates the effectiveness of transfer learning for biomedical NLP, highlighting the potential of domain-specific pretrained models.

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have been driven
bypretrained language models like BERT, RoBERTa, T5, and GPT. Thesemodels excel

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes jailbreak complexity in LLMs across 2M+ conversations, finding no significant difference in complexity between jailbreak attempts and normal conversations. It suggests practical limits on attack sophistication and highlights improving safety mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the complexity and evolution of jailbreaking strategies is critical for AI safety as LLMs become more widely deployed.

Method: A mass-scale empirical analysis using complexity metrics (probabilistic measures, lexical diversity, compression ratios, cognitive load) across diverse platforms, including jailbreaking communities and general chatbots.

Result: Jailbreak attempts do not show higher complexity than normal conversations. Attack toxicity and complexity remain stable, while assistant response toxicity decreases. No power-law scaling in complexity distributions indicates natural limits.

Conclusion: The study challenges the idea of an escalating arms race, suggesting bounded human ingenuity limits attack sophistication while defenses improve. It warns of information hazards in disclosing sophisticated jailbreaks.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly deployed, understanding
the complexity and evolution of jailbreaking strategies is critical for AI
safety.
  We present a mass-scale empirical analysis of jailbreak complexity across
over 2 million real-world conversations from diverse platforms, including
dedicated jailbreaking communities and general-purpose chatbots. Using a range
of complexity metrics spanning probabilistic measures, lexical diversity,
compression ratios, and cognitive load indicators, we find that jailbreak
attempts do not exhibit significantly higher complexity than normal
conversations. This pattern holds consistently across specialized jailbreaking
communities and general user populations, suggesting practical bounds on attack
sophistication. Temporal analysis reveals that while user attack toxicity and
complexity remains stable over time, assistant response toxicity has decreased,
indicating improving safety mechanisms. The absence of power-law scaling in
complexity distributions further points to natural limits on jailbreak
development.
  Our findings challenge the prevailing narrative of an escalating arms race
between attackers and defenders, instead suggesting that LLM safety evolution
is bounded by human ingenuity constraints while defensive measures continue
advancing. Our results highlight critical information hazards in academic
jailbreak disclosure, as sophisticated attacks exceeding current complexity
baselines could disrupt the observed equilibrium and enable widespread harm
before defensive adaptation.

TL;DR: FinGPT is evaluated on six financial NLP tasks, excelling in classification but lagging in reasoning and generation tasks compared to GPT-4 and human benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess FinGPT's capabilities and limitations in real-world financial applications.

Method: Evaluation across six NLP tasks using finance-specific datasets, comparing with GPT-4 and human benchmarks.

Result: Strong performance in classification tasks (e.g., sentiment analysis) but weaker in reasoning/generation tasks (e.g., question answering).

Conclusion: FinGPT is effective for structured financial tasks but needs improvements for comprehensive use, highlighting future research directions.

Abstract: This work evaluates FinGPT, a financial domain-specific language model,
across six key natural language processing (NLP) tasks: Sentiment Analysis,
Text Classification, Named Entity Recognition, Financial Question Answering,
Text Summarization, and Stock Movement Prediction. The evaluation uses
finance-specific datasets to assess FinGPT's capabilities and limitations in
real-world financial applications. The results show that FinGPT performs
strongly in classification tasks such as sentiment analysis and headline
categorization, often achieving results comparable to GPT-4. However, its
performance is significantly lower in tasks that involve reasoning and
generation, such as financial question answering and summarization. Comparisons
with GPT-4 and human benchmarks highlight notable performance gaps,
particularly in numerical accuracy and complex reasoning. Overall, the findings
indicate that while FinGPT is effective for certain structured financial tasks,
it is not yet a comprehensive solution. This research provides a useful
benchmark for future research and underscores the need for architectural
improvements and domain-specific optimization in financial language models.

TL;DR: The paper synthesizes findings in mechanistic interpretability (MI) to argue that LLMs develop internal structures functionally analogous to understanding, proposing a three-tiered framework for machine understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the view that LLMs rely solely on superficial statistics and introduce a theoretical framework for machine understanding.

Method: Proposes a three-tiered conception of machine understanding: conceptual, state-of-the-world, and principled understanding, supported by MI findings.

Result: LLMs exhibit forms of understanding through internal structures, though their cognitive architecture differs from humans.

Conclusion: The debate should shift from whether LLMs understand to exploring how their unique cognitive mechanisms work.

Abstract: Recent findings in mechanistic interpretability (MI), the field probing the
inner workings of Large Language Models (LLMs), challenge the view that these
models rely solely on superficial statistics. Here, we offer an accessible
synthesis of these findings that doubles as an introduction to MI, all while
integrating these findings within a novel theoretical framework for thinking
about machine understanding. We argue that LLMs develop internal structures
that are functionally analogous to the kind of understanding that consists in
seeing connections. To sharpen this idea, we propose a three-tiered conception
of machine understanding. First, conceptual understanding emerges when a model
forms "features" as directions in latent space, thereby learning the
connections between diverse manifestations of something. Second,
state-of-the-world understanding emerges when a model learns contingent factual
connections between features and dynamically tracks changes in the world.
Third, principled understanding emerges when a model ceases to rely on a
collection of memorized facts and discovers a "circuit" that connects these
facts. However, we conclude by exploring the "parallel mechanisms" phenomenon,
arguing that while LLMs exhibit forms of understanding, their cognitive
architecture remains different from ours, and the debate should shift from
whether LLMs understand to how their strange minds work.

TL;DR: R3 is a framework for iterative text generation that reviews, remasks, and refines errors without additional training, using a Process Reward Model (PRM) to improve output.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable models to efficiently identify and correct their own errors in iterative text generation without extra training.

Method: Uses a PRM to review intermediate blocks, remasks low-scoring blocks, and refines targeted segments to improve output.

Result: Improved final output by focusing on sub-optimal parts of past generations.

Conclusion: R3 is a simple yet effective framework for enhancing text generation in pre-trained models.

Abstract: A key challenge for iterative text generation is enabling models to
efficiently identify and correct their own errors. We propose Review, Remask,
Refine (R3), a relatively simple yet elegant framework that requires no
additional model training and can be applied to any pre-trained masked text
diffusion model (e.g., LLaDA or BD3-LM). In R3, a Process Reward Model (PRM) is
utilized for the Review of intermediate generated blocks. The framework then
translates these PRM scores into a Remask strategy: the lower a block's PRM
score, indicating potential mistakes, the greater the proportion of tokens
within that block are remasked. Finally, the model is compelled to Refine these
targeted segments, focusing its efforts more intensively on specific
sub-optimal parts of past generations, leading to improved final output.

TL;DR: The study examines if LLMs (Claude, GPT, Gemini) show consistent or random behavior in resume screening compared to humans, revealing significant differences in performance and adaptation to context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether LLMs provide reliable signal or noise in resume screening and how their evaluations compare to human experts.

Method: Tested three LLMs with controlled datasets across contexts, benchmarked against human experts, using ANOVA and paired t-tests.

Result: LLMs showed significant differences in performance and context adaptation (GPT strongest, Claude weakest), and consistently differed from human evaluations.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit interpretable patterns but diverge from human judgment, impacting their use in automated hiring systems.

Abstract: This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit
consistent behavior (signal) or random variation (noise) when screening resumes
against job descriptions, and how their performance compares to human experts.
Using controlled datasets, we tested three LLMs (Claude, GPT, and Gemini)
across contexts (No Company, Firm1 [MNC], Firm2 [Startup], Reduced Context)
with identical and randomized resumes, benchmarked against three human
recruitment experts. Analysis of variance revealed significant mean differences
in four of eight LLM-only conditions and consistently significant differences
between LLM and human evaluations (p < 0.01). Paired t-tests showed GPT adapts
strongly to company context (p < 0.001), Gemini partially (p = 0.038 for
Firm1), and Claude minimally (p > 0.1), while all LLMs differed significantly
from human experts across contexts. Meta-cognition analysis highlighted
adaptive weighting patterns that differ markedly from human evaluation
approaches. Findings suggest LLMs offer interpretable patterns with detailed
prompts but diverge substantially from human judgment, informing their
deployment in automated hiring systems.

*Zhibo Zhang,Yuxi Li,Kailong Wang,Shuai Yuan,Ling Shi,Haoyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ETTA is a framework that manipulates LLM embeddings to bypass safety mechanisms, achieving high attack success rates without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face security risks like embedding space poisoning, but current research lacks understanding of safety alignment dynamics at the embedding level.

Method: ETTA identifies and attenuates toxicity-sensitive dimensions in embeddings via linear transformations, preserving coherence without fine-tuning.

Result: ETTA achieves 88.61% attack success rate, outperforming baselines by 11.34%, and works on safety-enhanced models (77.39% ASR).

Conclusion: ETTA exposes vulnerabilities in LLM safety alignment, emphasizing the need for embedding-aware defenses.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across domains
such as healthcare, education, and cybersecurity. However, this openness also
introduces significant security risks, particularly through embedding space
poisoning, which is a subtle attack vector where adversaries manipulate the
internal semantic representations of input data to bypass safety alignment
mechanisms. While previous research has investigated universal perturbation
methods, the dynamics of LLM safety alignment at the embedding level remain
insufficiently understood. Consequently, more targeted and accurate adversarial
perturbation techniques, which pose significant threats, have not been
adequately studied.
  In this work, we propose ETTA (Embedding Transformation Toxicity
Attenuation), a novel framework that identifies and attenuates
toxicity-sensitive dimensions in embedding space via linear transformations.
ETTA bypasses model refusal behaviors while preserving linguistic coherence,
without requiring model fine-tuning or access to training data. Evaluated on
five representative open-source LLMs using the AdvBench benchmark, ETTA
achieves a high average attack success rate of 88.61%, outperforming the best
baseline by 11.34%, and generalizes to safety-enhanced models (e.g., 77.39% ASR
on instruction-tuned defenses). These results highlight a critical
vulnerability in current alignment strategies and underscore the need for
embedding-aware defenses.

TL;DR: The paper explores multimodal in-context learning (ICL) in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), focusing on demonstration configuration and controllability. It combines external experiments (shot number, image retrieval, caption assignment) and internal analysis (attention characteristics) to understand ICL's impact on image captioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the preliminary exploration of demonstration configuration in multimodal ICL and leverage controllability of In-Context Examples (ICEs) to analyze LMM inference characteristics.

Method: Comprehensive external (demonstration configuration strategies) and internal (attention analysis) investigations on image captioning, using multiple metrics and auxiliary experiments.

Result: Reveals how ICEs configuration impacts performance and identifies typical attention patterns, offering insights for model acceleration and compression.

Conclusion: The study provides dual perspectives (external and internal) for understanding multimodal ICL in LMMs, with broader applicability to large model research.

Abstract: The evolution of large models has witnessed the emergence of In-Context
Learning (ICL) capabilities. In Natural Language Processing (NLP), numerous
studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of ICL. Inspired by the success of
Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have developed Large Multimodal
Models (LMMs) with ICL capabilities. However, explorations of demonstration
configuration for multimodal ICL remain preliminary. Additionally, the
controllability of In-Context Examples (ICEs) provides an efficient and
cost-effective means to observe and analyze the inference characteristics of
LMMs under varying inputs. This paper conducts a comprehensive external and
internal investigation of multimodal in-context learning on the image
captioning task. Externally, we explore demonstration configuration strategies
through three dimensions: shot number, image retrieval, and caption assignment.
We employ multiple metrics to systematically and thoroughly evaluate and
summarize key findings. Internally, we analyze typical LMM attention
characteristics and develop attention-based metrics to quantify model
behaviors. We also conduct auxiliary experiments to explore the feasibility of
attention-driven model acceleration and compression. We further compare
performance variations between LMMs with identical model design and pretraining
strategies and explain the differences from the angles of pre-training data
features. Our study reveals both how ICEs configuration strategies impact model
performance through external experiments and characteristic typical patterns
through internal inspection, providing dual perspectives for understanding
multimodal ICL in LMMs. Our method of combining external and internal analysis
to investigate large models, along with our newly proposed metrics, can be
applied to broader research areas.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the liberal orientation in commercial LLMs, attributing it to training data, RLHF, academic discourse, and safety practices, and distinguishes bias from epistemic differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the causes and implications of the consistent liberal-leaning responses in LLMs.

Method: Analyzed seven LLMs using Moral Foundations Theory, political ideology scales, and a new index of political controversies.

Result: Found strong liberal-leaning values, especially care and fairness, due to training corpora, RLHF, academic discourse, and fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The liberal tilt is an emergent property of democratic rights-focused training, not bias, and may reflect Rawls' veil-of-ignorance ideal.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed a consistent liberal orientation in the ethical
and political responses generated by most commercial large language models
(LLMs), yet the underlying causes and resulting implications remain unclear.
This paper systematically investigates the political temperament of seven
prominent LLMs - OpenAI's GPT-4o, Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4, Perplexity
(Sonar Large), Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash, Meta AI's Llama 4, Mistral 7b Le Chat
and High-Flyer's DeepSeek R1 -- using a multi-pronged approach that includes
Moral Foundations Theory, a dozen established political ideology scales and a
new index of current political controversies. We find strong and consistent
prioritization of liberal-leaning values, particularly care and fairness,
across most models. Further analysis attributes this trend to four overlapping
factors: Liberal-leaning training corpora, reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), the dominance of liberal frameworks in academic ethical
discourse and safety-driven fine-tuning practices. We also distinguish between
political "bias" and legitimate epistemic differences, cautioning against
conflating the two. A comparison of base and fine-tuned model pairs reveals
that fine-tuning generally increases liberal lean, an effect confirmed through
both self-report and empirical testing. We argue that this "liberal tilt" is
not a programming error or the personal preference of programmers but an
emergent property of training on democratic rights-focused discourse. Finally,
we propose that LLMs may indirectly echo John Rawls' famous veil-of ignorance
philosophical aspiration, reflecting a moral stance unanchored to personal
identity or interest. Rather than undermining democratic discourse, this
pattern may offer a new lens through which to examine collective reasoning.

TL;DR: AI-assisted recruitment improved hiring efficiency and candidate selection, with a 20 pp. higher pass rate and 5.9 pp. higher job placement rate compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify the impact of AI on recruitment efficiency and candidate selection, given limited empirical evidence.

Method: Randomized assignment of 37,000 applicants to either traditional or AI-assisted recruitment, followed by final human interviews and LinkedIn job placement tracking.

Result: AI-assisted pipeline had a 54% pass rate vs. 34% in traditional, and 23% job placement vs. 18%. AI favored younger, less experienced candidates.

Conclusion: AI enhances recruitment efficiency but may introduce biases, highlighting the need for careful implementation and analysis.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in recruitment, yet
empirical evidence quantifying its impact on hiring efficiency and candidate
selection remains limited. We randomly assign 37,000 applicants for a
junior-developer position to either a traditional recruitment process (resume
screening followed by human selection) or an AI-assisted recruitment pipeline
incorporating an initial AI-driven structured video interview before human
evaluation. Candidates advancing from either track faced the same final-stage
human interview, with interviewers blind to the earlier selection method. In
the AI-assisted pipeline, 54% of candidates passed the final interview compared
with 34% from the traditional pipeline, yielding an average treatment effect of
20 percentage points (SE 12 pp.). Five months later, we collected LinkedIn
profiles of top applicants from both groups and found that 18% (SE 1.1%) of
applicants from the traditional track found new jobs compared with 23% (SE
2.3%) from the AI group, resulting in a 5.9 pp. (SE 2.6 pp.) difference in the
probability of finding new employment between groups. The AI system tended to
select younger applicants with less experience and fewer advanced credentials.
We analyze AI-generated interview transcripts to examine the selection criteria
and conversational dynamics. Our findings contribute to understanding how AI
technologies affect decision making in recruitment and talent acquisition while
highlighting some of their potential implications.

TL;DR: The study found a significant decline in medical disclaimers in LLM and VLM outputs from 2022 to 2025, highlighting the need for safeguards as models become more authoritative.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the presence of medical disclaimers in AI-generated outputs for medical applications, given their critical role in ensuring user safety.

Method: Analyzed 500 mammograms, 500 chest X-rays, 500 dermatology images, and 500 medical questions for disclaimer phrases across model generations from 2022 to 2025.

Result: Disclaimer presence dropped sharply: from 26.3% in 2022 to 0.97% in 2025 for LLMs, and from 19.6% in 2023 to 1.05% in 2025 for VLMs.

Conclusion: As AI models grow more capable, adaptive disclaimer implementation is essential to maintain safety in clinical contexts.

Abstract: Generative AI models, including large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used to interpret medical
images and answer clinical questions. Their responses often include
inaccuracies; therefore, safety measures like medical disclaimers are critical
to remind users that AI outputs are not professionally vetted or a substitute
for medical advice. This study evaluated the presence of disclaimers in LLM and
VLM outputs across model generations from 2022 to 2025. Using 500 mammograms,
500 chest X-rays, 500 dermatology images, and 500 medical questions, outputs
were screened for disclaimer phrases. Medical disclaimer presence in LLM and
VLM outputs dropped from 26.3% in 2022 to 0.97% in 2025, and from 19.6% in 2023
to 1.05% in 2025, respectively. By 2025, the majority of models displayed no
disclaimers. As public models become more capable and authoritative,
disclaimers must be implemented as a safeguard adapting to the clinical context
of each output.

Motivation: To evaluate if SLMs can match LLMs in mental health understanding, given their privacy advantages for sensitive applications.

Method: Systematic evaluation of five SLMs and three LLMs across six mental health tasks using zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms.

Result: SLMs achieve mean performance within 2% of LLMs in binary classification, with few-shot learning improving SLMs by up to 14.6%. Both SLMs and LLMs struggle with nuanced multi-class tasks.

Conclusion: SLMs are viable privacy-preserving alternatives for mental health tasks, especially with few-shot learning, making them suitable for scalable screening tools.

their inherent understanding capabilities compared to Large Language Models
(LLMs). This paper investigates the mental health understanding capabilities of
current SLMs through systematic evaluation across diverse classification tasks.
Employing zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms, we benchmark their
performance against established LLM baselines to elucidate their relative
strengths and limitations in this critical domain. We assess five
state-of-the-art SLMs (Phi-3, Phi-3.5, Qwen2.5, Llama-3.2, Gemma2) against
three LLMs (GPT-4, FLAN-T5-XXL, Alpaca-7B) on six mental health understanding
tasks. Our findings reveal that SLMs achieve mean performance within 2\% of
LLMs on binary classification tasks (F1 scores of 0.64 vs 0.66 in zero-shot
settings), demonstrating notable competence despite orders of magnitude fewer
parameters. Both model categories experience similar degradation on multi-class
severity tasks (a drop of over 30\%), suggesting that nuanced clinical
understanding challenges transcend model scale. Few-shot prompting provides
substantial improvements for SLMs (up to 14.6\%), while LLM gains are more
variable. Our work highlights the potential of SLMs in mental health
understanding, showing they can be effective privacy-preserving tools for
analyzing sensitive online text data. In particular, their ability to quickly
adapt and specialize with minimal data through few-shot learning positions them
as promising candidates for scalable mental health screening tools.

### [107] [Integrating External Tools with Large Language Models to Improve Accuracy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08034)
*Nripesh Niketan,Hadj Batatia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework (Athena) to enhance LLMs by integrating external tools for better query responses, achieving high accuracy in educational tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often provide poor or hallucinated responses without contextual data. Integrating external tools can improve accuracy, especially in educational settings.

Method: Developed a framework to access external APIs for additional data and computational tools (e.g., calculators, calendars). Evaluated using MMLU datasets for mathematical and scientific reasoning.

Result: Athena achieved 83% accuracy in math and 88% in science, outperforming models like GPT-4o and LLaMA-Large (67% and 79% respectively).

Conclusion: The framework shows promise for creating ecosystems around LLMs to enhance their utility in diverse tasks.

Abstract: This paper deals with improving querying large language models (LLMs). It is
well-known that without relevant contextual information, LLMs can provide poor
quality responses or tend to hallucinate. Several initiatives have proposed
integrating LLMs with external tools to provide them with up-to-date data to
improve accuracy. In this paper, we propose a framework to integrate external
tools to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in answering queries in educational
settings. Precisely, we develop a framework that allows accessing external APIs
to request additional relevant information. Integrated tools can also provide
computational capabilities such as calculators or calendars. The proposed
framework has been evaluated using datasets from the Multi-Modal Language
Understanding (MMLU) collection. The data consists of questions on mathematical
and scientific reasoning. Results compared to state-of-the-art language models
show that the proposed approach significantly improves performance. Our Athena
framework achieves 83% accuracy in mathematical reasoning and 88% in scientific
reasoning, substantially outperforming all tested models including GPT-4o,
LLaMA-Large, Mistral-Large, Phi-Large, and GPT-3.5, with the best baseline
model (LLaMA-Large) achieving only 67% and 79% respectively. These promising
results open the way to creating complex computing ecosystems around LLMs to
make their use more natural to support various tasks and activities.

*Deepali Mishra,Chaklam Silpasuwanchai,Ashutosh Modi,Madhumita Sushil,Sorayouth Chumnanvej*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper reviews MedVQA's clinical utility, identifying gaps like non-diagnostic QA pairs, lack of EHR integration, and misaligned evaluation metrics. Clinicians highlight the need for patient history, multi-view imaging, and interactive systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess MedVQA's practical integration into radiology workflows by reviewing literature and surveying clinicians, identifying key challenges and gaps.

Method: A scoping review of 68 publications (2018-2024) and a survey of 50 clinicians from India and Thailand, following the Arksey and O'Malley framework.

Result: 60% of QA pairs lack clinical relevance; datasets and models miss key features like EHR integration. Clinicians (29.8%) find MedVQA useful but cite concerns like missing patient history (87.2%) and need for multi-view support (78.7%).

Conclusion: MedVQA has potential but requires addressing multimodal analysis, patient context, and evaluation alignment for clinical adoption.

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) is a promising tool to assist
radiologists by automating medical image interpretation through question
answering. Despite advances in models and datasets, MedVQA's integration into
clinical workflows remains limited. This study systematically reviews 68
publications (2018-2024) and surveys 50 clinicians from India and Thailand to
examine MedVQA's practical utility, challenges, and gaps. Following the Arksey
and O'Malley scoping review framework, we used a two-pronged approach: (1)
reviewing studies to identify key concepts, advancements, and research gaps in
radiology workflows, and (2) surveying clinicians to capture their perspectives
on MedVQA's clinical relevance. Our review reveals that nearly 60% of QA pairs
are non-diagnostic and lack clinical relevance. Most datasets and models do not
support multi-view, multi-resolution imaging, EHR integration, or domain
knowledge, features essential for clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, there is a
clear mismatch between current evaluation metrics and clinical needs. The
clinician survey confirms this disconnect: only 29.8% consider MedVQA systems
highly useful. Key concerns include the absence of patient history or domain
knowledge (87.2%), preference for manually curated datasets (51.1%), and the
need for multi-view image support (78.7%). Additionally, 66% favor models
focused on specific anatomical regions, and 89.4% prefer dialogue-based
interactive systems. While MedVQA shows strong potential, challenges such as
limited multimodal analysis, lack of patient context, and misaligned evaluation
approaches must be addressed for effective clinical integration.

*Matan Vetzler,Koren Lazar,Guy Uziel,Eran Hirsch,Ateret Anaby-Tavor,Leshem Choshen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CRISP introduces a dataset for high-level plans in reasoning tasks, showing fine-tuned small models outperform larger few-shot models and CoT reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like Chain-of-Thought reasoning and few-shot prompting for LLMs are insufficient for complex reasoning tasks.

Method: CRISP uses a multi-domain dataset of validated high-level plans, fine-tuning small models for plan generation.

Result: Fine-tuned small models generate better plans than larger few-shot models and outperform CoT reasoning, with cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: CRISP demonstrates the effectiveness of fine-tuning for high-level planning, improving reasoning capabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) underscore the need for
stronger reasoning capabilities to solve complex problems effectively. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been a step forward, it remains
insufficient for many domains. A promising alternative is explicit high-level
plan generation, but existing approaches largely assume that LLMs can produce
effective plans through few-shot prompting alone, without additional training.
In this work, we challenge this assumption and introduce CRISP (Complex
Reasoning with Interpretable Step-based Plans), a multi-domain dataset of
high-level plans for mathematical reasoning and code generation. The plans in
CRISP are automatically generated and rigorously validated--both intrinsically,
using an LLM as a judge, and extrinsically, by evaluating their impact on
downstream task performance. We demonstrate that fine-tuning a small model on
CRISP enables it to generate higher-quality plans than much larger models using
few-shot prompting, while significantly outperforming Chain-of-Thought
reasoning. Furthermore, our out-of-domain evaluation reveals that fine-tuning
on one domain improves plan generation in the other, highlighting the
generalizability of learned planning capabilities.

### [110] [AblationBench: Evaluating Automated Planning of Ablations in Empirical AI Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08038)
*Talor Abramovich,Gal Chechik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A benchmark suite, AblationBench, is introduced to evaluate AI agents on ablation planning tasks in empirical AI research, showing current LMs perform poorly (29% success rate) and highlighting the superiority of chain-of-thought prompting over agent-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To support or automate parts of the research process, particularly ablation experiments, using autonomous agents built on language models.

Method: Developed AblationBench with two tasks (AuthorAblation and ReviewerAblation) and LM-based judges for evaluation. Tested frontier LMs on these tasks.

Result: Best-performing LM system identified only 29% of original ablations on average. Chain-of-thought prompting outperformed agent-based approaches.

Conclusion: Current LMs struggle with ablation planning tasks, and chain-of-thought prompting shows promise for improvement.

Abstract: Autonomous agents built on language models (LMs) are showing increasing
popularity in many fields, including scientific research. AI co-scientists aim
to support or automate parts of the research process using these agents. A key
component of empirical AI research is the design of ablation experiments. To
this end, we introduce AblationBench, a benchmark suite for evaluating agents
on ablation planning tasks in empirical AI research. It includes two tasks:
AuthorAblation, which helps authors propose ablation experiments based on a
method section and contains 83 instances, and ReviewerAblation, which helps
reviewers find missing ablations in a full paper and contains 350 instances.
For both tasks, we develop LM-based judges that serve as an automatic
evaluation framework. Our experiments with frontier LMs show that these tasks
remain challenging, with the best-performing LM system identifying only 29% of
the original ablations on average. Lastly, we analyze the limitations of
current LMs on these tasks, and find that chain-of-thought prompting
outperforms the currently existing agent-based approach.

### [111] [Krul: Efficient State Restoration for Multi-turn Conversations with Dynamic Cross-layer KV Sharing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08045)
*Junyi Wen,Junyuan Liang,Zicong Hong,Wuhui Chen,Zibin Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Krul is a system for efficient KV cache restoration in multi-turn LLM conversations, dynamically selecting compression strategies to reduce overhead without losing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use fixed compression schemes for KV caches, ignoring conversation-specific attention dynamics, leading to accuracy loss.

Method: Krul dynamically selects compression strategies, uses a recomputation-loading pipeline, and introduces innovations like a preemptive selector, token-wise similarity estimator, and bubble-free scheduler.

Result: Krul reduces time-to-first-token by 1.5x-2.68x and KV cache storage by 1.33x-2.35x compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Krul effectively balances efficiency and accuracy in multi-turn LLM conversations.

Abstract: Efficient state restoration in multi-turn conversations with large language
models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to the overhead of
recomputing or loading full key-value (KV) caches for all historical tokens. To
address this, existing approaches compress KV caches across adjacent layers
with highly similar attention patterns. However, these methods often apply a
fixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer
pairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention
dynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern
similarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable
accuracy degradation.
  We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and
efficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies
based on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a
recomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key
innovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical
context for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the
conversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to
mitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model
generation; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles
brought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV
caches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul
achieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x
reduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without
compromising generation quality.

*Sebastian Walter,Hannah Bast*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A zero-shot approach for generating SPARQL queries from natural language using large language models, achieving state-of-the-art results on Wikidata and competitive performance on Freebase and other knowledge graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient SPARQL query generation from natural language without fine-tuning, leveraging large language models to explore knowledge graphs.

Method: Uses a language model to strategically execute SPARQL queries and search for relevant IRIs and literals, evaluated on various benchmarks and knowledge graphs.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on Wikidata, close to few-shot methods on Freebase, and strong performance on other knowledge graphs.

Conclusion: The approach is effective in zero-shot settings, adaptable to diverse knowledge graphs, and benefits from additional studies like feedback mechanisms.

Abstract: We propose a new approach for generating SPARQL queries on RDF knowledge
graphs from natural language questions or keyword queries, using a large
language model. Our approach does not require fine-tuning. Instead, it uses the
language model to explore the knowledge graph by strategically executing SPARQL
queries and searching for relevant IRIs and literals. We evaluate our approach
on a variety of benchmarks (for knowledge graphs of different kinds and sizes)
and language models (of different scales and types, commercial as well as
open-source) and compare it with existing approaches. On Wikidata we reach
state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, despite the zero-shot setting.
On Freebase we come close to the best few-shot methods. On other, less commonly
evaluated knowledge graphs and benchmarks our approach also performs well
overall. We conduct several additional studies, like comparing different ways
of searching the graphs, incorporating a feedback mechanism, or making use of
few-shot examples.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for statically typed, LM-powered subroutines is proposed to ensure transparency and auditability in real-world applications, evaluated in public comment processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To responsibly leverage language models (LMs) with concerns about safety, explainability, and bias, enabling human experts to focus on decision-making rather than data-processing.

Method: A framework for declaring LM-powered subroutines, recording all LM artifacts for audit, and using sparse human feedback to improve performance online. Implemented as a library and evaluated in public comment processing.

Result: The framework was applied to develop "CommentNEPA," which processes public comments for environmental review. Quantitative evaluation compared outputs to human-labeled ground-truth data.

Conclusion: The framework offers a transparent, auditable way to integrate LMs into workflows, demonstrated effectively in public comment processing.

Abstract: The advent of language models (LMs) has the potential to dramatically
accelerate tasks that may be cast to text-processing; however, real-world
adoption is hindered by concerns regarding safety, explainability, and bias.
How can we responsibly leverage LMs in a transparent, auditable manner --
minimizing risk and allowing human experts to focus on informed decision-making
rather than data-processing or prompt engineering? In this work, we propose a
framework for declaring statically typed, LM-powered subroutines (i.e.,
callable, function-like procedures) for use within conventional asynchronous
code -- such that sparse feedback from human experts is used to improve the
performance of each subroutine online (i.e., during use). In our
implementation, all LM-produced artifacts (i.e., prompts, inputs, outputs, and
data-dependencies) are recorded and exposed to audit on demand. We package this
framework as a library to support its adoption and continued development. While
this framework may be applicable across several real-world decision workflows
(e.g., in healthcare and legal fields), we evaluate it in the context of public
comment processing as mandated by the 1969 National Environmental Protection
Act (NEPA): Specifically, we use this framework to develop "CommentNEPA," an
application that compiles, organizes, and summarizes a corpus of public
commentary submitted in response to a project requiring environmental review.
We quantitatively evaluate the application by comparing its outputs (when
operating without human feedback) to historical ``ground-truth'' data as
labelled by human annotators during the preparation of official environmental
impact statements.

### [114] [Compactor: Calibrated Query-Agnostic KV Cache Compression with Approximate Leverage Scores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08143)
*Vivek Chari,Benjamin Van Durme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Compactor is a query-agnostic KV cache compression method using leverage scores, reducing memory by 63% while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high memory requirement of KV cache in LLMs, which limits throughput and increases costs.

Method: Uses approximate leverage scores for token importance and introduces context-calibrated compression.

Result: Achieves same performance as competitors with half the tokens, reducing KV memory by 63%.

Conclusion: Compactor is effective and generalizable across multiple tasks and model families.

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to support very
large context windows. Unfortunately the ability to use long contexts in
generation is complicated by the large memory requirement of the KV cache,
which scales linearly with the context length. This memory footprint is often
the dominant resource bottleneck in real-world deployments, limiting throughput
and increasing serving cost. One way to address this is by compressing the KV
cache, which can be done either with knowledge of the question being asked
(query-aware) or without knowledge of the query (query-agnostic). We present
Compactor, a parameter-free, query-agnostic KV compression strategy that uses
approximate leverage scores to determine token importance. We show that
Compactor can achieve the same performance as competing methods while retaining
1/2 the tokens in both synthetic and real-world context tasks, with minimal
computational overhead. We further introduce a procedure for context-calibrated
compression, which allows one to infer the maximum compression ratio a given
context can support. Using context-calibrated compression, we show that
Compactor achieves full KV performance on Longbench while reducing the KV
memory burden by 63%, on average. To demonstrate the efficacy and
generalizability of our approach, we apply Compactor to 27 synthetic and
real-world tasks from RULER and Longbench, with models from both the Qwen 2.5
and Llama 3.1 families.

*Henry J. Xie,Jinghan Zhang,Xinhao Zhang,Kunpeng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for distilling empathy from LLMs into SLMs using a two-step fine-tuning process and targeted prompts, achieving a 90% win rate in empathetic response generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure SLMs retain empathy from LLMs for human-interactive applications in resource-constrained environments.

Method: A two-step fine-tuning process with empathetic dialogue datasets and four unique prompt sets for targeted empathy improvement.

Result: SLMs achieved a 90% win rate in empathetic responses, with targeted prompts improving performance by 10% over basic prompting.

Conclusion: The approach effectively distills empathy into SLMs, enhancing their performance in human interactions.

Abstract: The distillation of knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) into Smaller
Language Models (SLMs), preserving the capabilities and performance of LLMs
while reducing model size, has played a key role in the proliferation of LLMs.
Because SLMs are considerably smaller than LLMs, they are often utilized in
domains where human interaction is frequent but resources are highly
constrained, e.g., smart phones. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that
empathy, a fundamental aspect of positive human interactions, already instilled
into LLMs, is retained by SLMs after distillation. In this paper, we develop a
comprehensive approach for effective empathy distillation from LLMs into SLMs.
Our approach features a two-step fine-tuning process that fully leverages
datasets of empathetic dialogue responses distilled from LLMs. We explore
several distillation methods beyond basic direct prompting and propose four
unique sets of prompts for targeted empathy improvement to significantly
enhance the empathy distillation process. Our evaluations demonstrate that SLMs
fine-tuned through the two-step fine-tuning process with distillation datasets
enhanced by the targeted empathy improvement prompts significantly outperform
the base SLM at generating empathetic responses with a win rate of 90%. Our
targeted empathy improvement prompts substantially outperform the basic direct
prompting with a 10% improvement in win rate.

Result: Evaluated on TriviaQA, GSM8K, and FactScore-Bio datasets, demonstrating effectiveness.

Conclusion: TruthTorchLM advances truthfulness prediction research with its comprehensive, extensible toolkit.

Abstract: Generative Large Language Models (LLMs)inevitably produce untruthful
responses. Accurately predicting the truthfulness of these outputs is critical,
especially in high-stakes settings. To accelerate research in this domain and
make truthfulness prediction methods more accessible, we introduce TruthTorchLM
an open-source, comprehensive Python library featuring over 30 truthfulness
prediction methods, which we refer to as Truth Methods. Unlike existing
toolkits such as Guardrails, which focus solely on document-grounded
verification, or LM-Polygraph, which is limited to uncertainty-based methods,
TruthTorchLM offers a broad and extensible collection of techniques. These
methods span diverse tradeoffs in computational cost, access level (e.g.,
black-box vs white-box), grounding document requirements, and supervision type
(self-supervised or supervised). TruthTorchLM is seamlessly compatible with
both HuggingFace and LiteLLM, enabling support for locally hosted and API-based
models. It also provides a unified interface for generation, evaluation,
calibration, and long-form truthfulness prediction, along with a flexible
framework for extending the library with new methods. We conduct an evaluation
of representative truth methods on three datasets, TriviaQA, GSM8K, and
FactScore-Bio. The code is available at https://github.com/Ybakman/TruthTorchLM

*Atticus Wang,Joshua Engels,Oliver Clive-Griffin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explains out-of-context reasoning (OOCR) in fine-tuned LLMs as a result of LoRA fine-tuning adding a constant steering vector, which improves generalization across related tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why fine-tuned LLMs exhibit OOCR, an advanced capability crucial for their safe deployment.

Method: Mechanistic investigation of OOCR, including training steering vectors from scratch and testing on tasks like model backdoors.

Result: OOCR is largely due to steering vectors, which unconditionally improve performance across related domains.

Conclusion: The study provides an explanation for OOCR in LLMs, highlighting the role of steering vectors in generalization.

Abstract: Out-of-context reasoning (OOCR) is a phenomenon in which fine-tuned LLMs
exhibit surprisingly deep out-of-distribution generalization. Rather than
learning shallow heuristics, they implicitly internalize and act on the
consequences of observations scattered throughout the fine-tuning data. In this
work, we investigate this phenomenon mechanistically and find that many
instances of OOCR in the literature have a simple explanation: the LoRA
fine-tuning essentially adds a constant steering vector, steering the model
towards a general concept. This improves performance on the fine-tuning task
and in many other concept-related domains, causing the surprising
generalization. Moreover, we can directly train steering vectors for these
tasks from scratch, which also induces OOCR. We find that our results hold even
for a task that seems like it must involve conditional behavior (model
backdoors); it turns out that unconditionally adding a steering vector is
sufficient. Overall, our work presents one explanation of what gets learned
during fine-tuning for OOCR tasks, contributing to the key question of why LLMs
can reason out of context, an advanced capability that is highly relevant to
their safe and reliable deployment.

TL;DR: LLMs as proxy students in ITSs and test question piloting are evaluated for alignment with real students using NAEP data and IRT models, revealing performance gaps and prompting effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if LLMs accurately emulate real students in educational contexts, given their growing use in ITSs and test development.

Method: Collected 489 NAEP items, applied IRT to compare 11 LLMs' abilities with real students, and tested grade-enforcement prompts.

Result: Strong LLMs outperform average students; weaker models align incidentally. Prompting affects performance, but no model-prompt pair consistently matches grade-level expectations.

Conclusion: Guidelines for selecting viable proxies are needed, highlighting gaps in current LLM alignment with real student behavior.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxy students in the
development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) and in piloting test
questions. However, to what extent these proxy students accurately emulate the
behavior and characteristics of real students remains an open question. To
investigate this, we collected a dataset of 489 items from the National
Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), covering mathematics and reading
comprehension in grades 4, 8, and 12. We then apply an Item Response Theory
(IRT) model to position 11 diverse and state-of-the-art LLMs on the same
ability scale as real student populations. Our findings reveal that, without
guidance, strong general-purpose models consistently outperform the average
student at every grade, while weaker or domain-mismatched models may align
incidentally. Using grade-enforcement prompts changes models' performance, but
whether they align with the average grade-level student remains highly model-
and prompt-specific: no evaluated model-prompt pair fits the bill across
subjects and grades, underscoring the need for new training and evaluation
strategies. We conclude by providing guidelines for the selection of viable
proxies based on our findings.

TL;DR: The study uses NLP and HAM-CNN to analyze gender differences in pain experiences, revealing linguistic and prevalence disparities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Earlier research often ignored gender's role in pain, prompting this study to explore gender-specific pain experiences.

Method: Used NLP and HAM-CNN to classify posts by gender, analyzing linguistic patterns and pain condition prevalence.

Result: Achieved an F1 score of 0.86; found females' posts more emotionally focused and certain conditions more prevalent among them.

Conclusion: Gender significantly influences pain experiences, with linguistic and medical differences, impacting treatment approaches.

Abstract: Pain is an inherent part of human existence, manifesting as both physical and
emotional experiences, and can be categorized as either acute or chronic. Over
the years, extensive research has been conducted to understand the causes of
pain and explore potential treatments, with contributions from various
scientific disciplines. However, earlier studies often overlooked the role of
gender in pain experiences. In this study, we utilized Natural Language
Processing (NLP) to analyze and gain deeper insights into individuals' pain
experiences, with a particular focus on gender differences. We successfully
classified posts into male and female corpora using the Hidden Attribute
Model-Convolutional Neural Network (HAM-CNN), achieving an F1 score of 0.86 by
aggregating posts based on usernames. Our analysis revealed linguistic
differences between genders, with female posts tending to be more emotionally
focused. Additionally, the study highlighted that conditions such as migraine
and sinusitis are more prevalent among females and explored how pain medication
affects individuals differently based on gender.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Kwaipilot-AutoThink (KAT) is a 40B LLM addressing overthinking in reasoning tasks via dynamic mode-switching, efficient training, and reinforcement learning, outperforming SOTA models while reducing token usage by ~30%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the overthinking problem in reasoning-intensive tasks by dynamically adjusting reasoning modes based on task complexity.

Method: Uses a dual-regime dataset, MTP-enhanced knowledge distillation, cold-start initialization, and Step-SRPO reinforcement learning for mode selection and accuracy.

Result: KAT matches or outperforms SOTA models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-0528, Qwen3-235B-A22B) with ~30% fewer tokens and improves real-world workflows.

Conclusion: KAT's AutoThink paradigm is scalable, with promising early results for a 200B MoE model, demonstrating efficiency and performance improvements.

Abstract: We present Kwaipilot-AutoThink (KAT), an open-source 40B large language model
developed to address the overthinking problem in reasoning-intensive tasks,
where an automatic thinking training paradigm is proposed to dynamically switch
between reasoning and non-reasoning modes based on task complexity.
Specifically, first, we construct the dual-regime dataset based on a novel
tagging pipeline and a multi-agent synthesis strategy, and then we apply
Multi-Token Prediction (MTP)-enhanced knowledge distillation, enabling
efficient and fine-grained reasoning transfer with minimal pretraining cost.
Besides, we implement a cold-start initialization strategy that introduces
mode-selection priors using majority-vote signals and intent-aware prompting.
Finally, we propose Step-SRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that
incorporates intermediate supervision into the GRPO framework, offering
structured guidance over both reasoning-mode selection and response accuracy.
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that KAT
consistently matches or even outperforms current state-of-the-art models,
including DeepSeek-R1-0528 and Qwen3-235B-A22B, across a wide range of
reasoning-intensive tasks while reducing token usage by up to approximately
30\%. Beyond academic evaluation, KAT has been successfully deployed in
Kwaipilot (i.e., Kuaishou's internal coding assistant), and improves real-world
development workflows with high accuracy, efficiency, and controllable
reasoning behaviors. Moreover, we are actively training a 200B
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with 40B activation parameters, where the early-stage
results already demonstrate promising improvements in performance and
efficiency, further showing the scalability of the AutoThink paradigm.

*Yupu Liang,Yaping Zhang,Zhiyang Zhang,Zhiyuan Chen,Yang Zhao,Lu Xiang,Chengqing Zong,Yu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel fine-tuning paradigm, Synchronously Self-Reviewing (SSR), improves Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT) in MLLMs by preserving OCR abilities while learning translation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with DIMT due to cross-modal and cross-lingual challenges, and SFT often causes forgetting of monolingual OCR abilities.

Method: Introduces SSR, prompting the model to generate OCR text before translation, leveraging existing OCR skills.

Result: SSR mitigates catastrophic forgetting, enhancing performance on both OCR and DIMT tasks.

Conclusion: SSR effectively balances learning translation while retaining OCR capabilities, improving MLLM generalization.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance in
document image tasks, especially Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However,
they struggle with Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT), which requires
handling both cross-modal and cross-lingual challenges. Previous efforts to
enhance DIMT capability through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on the DIMT
dataset often result in the forgetting of the model's existing monolingual
abilities, such as OCR. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
fine-tuning paradigm, named Synchronously Self-Reviewing (SSR) its OCR
proficiency, inspired by the concept "Bilingual Cognitive Advantage".
Specifically, SSR prompts the model to generate OCR text before producing
translation text, which allows the model to leverage its strong monolingual OCR
ability while learning to translate text across languages. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the proposed SSR learning helps mitigate catastrophic
forgetting, improving the generalization ability of MLLMs on both OCR and DIMT
tasks.

*Yinzhu Quan,Xinrui Li,Ying Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CRMAgent, a multi-agent LLM system, helps merchants craft persuasive e-commerce messages by leveraging group-based learning, retrieval-and-adaptation, and rule-based fallback, outperforming original templates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Merchants lack expertise and tools to write persuasive CRM messages, leading to poor retention and conversion.

Method: CRMAgent uses three modes: group-based learning, retrieval-and-adaptation, and rule-based fallback to generate high-quality templates.

Result: CRMAgent outperforms merchants' original templates in audience-match and marketing-effectiveness metrics.

Conclusion: CRMAgent provides scalable, effective solutions for crafting persuasive CRM messages.

Abstract: In e-commerce private-domain channels such as instant messaging and e-mail,
merchants engage customers directly as part of their Customer Relationship
Management (CRM) programmes to drive retention and conversion. While a few top
performers excel at crafting outbound messages, most merchants struggle to
write persuasive copy because they lack both expertise and scalable tools. We
introduce CRMAgent, a multi-agent system built on large language models (LLMs)
that generates high-quality message templates and actionable writing guidance
through three complementary modes. First, group-based learning enables the
agent to learn from a merchant's own top-performing messages within the same
audience segment and rewrite low-performing ones. Second,
retrieval-and-adaptation fetches templates that share the same audience segment
and exhibit high similarity in voucher type and product category, learns their
successful patterns, and adapts them to the current campaign. Third, a
rule-based fallback provides a lightweight zero-shot rewrite when no suitable
references are available. Extensive experiments show that CRMAgent consistently
outperforms merchants' original templates, delivering significant gains in both
audience-match and marketing-effectiveness metrics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MK2, a prompt-centric pipeline, generates viable product ideas from patents without extra training data, outperforming in most tests but lagging in materials-chemistry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate the transformation of patents into commercially viable product ideas within three years.

Method: Uses Gemini 2.5 for prompt drafting and iterative editing, GPT-4.1 for idea generation, and an Elo loop with Qwen3-8B for prompt selection.

Result: MK2 topped the automatic leaderboard, winning 25 of 36 tests, but struggled in materials-chemistry.

Conclusion: Lightweight prompt engineering can produce competitive, commercially relevant ideas from patents, though deeper domain grounding may be needed for certain fields.

Abstract: The Patent-Based Idea Generation task asks systems to turn real patents into
product ideas viable within three years. We propose MK2, a prompt-centric
pipeline: Gemini 2.5 drafts and iteratively edits a prompt, grafting useful
fragments from weaker outputs; GPT-4.1 then uses this prompt to create one idea
per patent, and an Elo loop judged by Qwen3-8B selects the best prompt-all
without extra training data. Across three domains, two evaluator types, and six
criteria, MK2 topped the automatic leaderboard and won 25 of 36 tests. Only the
materials-chemistry track lagged, indicating the need for deeper domain
grounding; yet, the results show that lightweight prompt engineering has
already delivered competitive, commercially relevant ideation from patents.

### [124] [Distillation versus Contrastive Learning: How to Train Your Rerankers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08336)
*Zhichao Xu,Zhiqi Huang,Shengyao Zhuang,Ashim Gupta,Vivek Srikumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper compares contrastive learning and knowledge distillation for training text rerankers, finding knowledge distillation superior when using a larger teacher model, while contrastive learning is more reliable otherwise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To empirically compare the effectiveness of contrastive learning and knowledge distillation for training cross-encoder rerankers under practical conditions.

Method: Training rerankers of varying sizes and architectures using both strategies on the same data, with a strong contrastive learning model as the distillation teacher.

Result: Knowledge distillation outperforms contrastive learning in in-domain and out-of-domain ranking when using a larger teacher, but not with a same-capacity teacher.

Conclusion: Knowledge distillation is recommended for smaller rerankers if a larger teacher is available; otherwise, contrastive learning is a reliable alternative.

Abstract: Training text rerankers is crucial for information retrieval. Two primary
strategies are widely used: contrastive learning (optimizing directly on
ground-truth labels) and knowledge distillation (transferring knowledge from a
larger reranker). While both have been studied in the literature, a clear
comparison of their effectiveness for training cross-encoder rerankers under
practical conditions is needed.
  This paper empirically compares these strategies by training rerankers of
different sizes and architectures using both methods on the same data, with a
strong contrastive learning model acting as the distillation teacher. Our
results show that knowledge distillation generally yields better in-domain and
out-of-domain ranking performance than contrastive learning when distilling
from a larger teacher model. This finding is consistent across student model
sizes and architectures. However, distilling from a teacher of the same
capacity does not provide the same advantage, particularly for out-of-domain
tasks. These findings offer practical guidance for choosing a training strategy
based on available teacher models. Therefore, we recommend using knowledge
distillation to train smaller rerankers if a larger, more powerful teacher is
accessible; in its absence, contrastive learning provides a strong and more
reliable alternative otherwise.

### [125] [What Factors Affect LLMs and RLLMs in Financial Question Answering?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08339)
*Peng Wang,Xuesi Hu,Jiageng Wu,Yuntao Zou,Qiancheng Zhang,Dagang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores methods to optimize LLMs and RLLMs for financial question-answering, finding that prompting and agent frameworks boost LLMs, while RLLMs' inherent Long CoT limits further gains. Multilingual methods help LLMs but not RLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically investigate how to maximize LLMs and RLLMs' performance in financial tasks, given limited prior research.

Method: Evaluated five LLMs and three RLLMs using prompting methods, agentic frameworks, and multilingual alignment on financial QA tasks.

Result: Prompting and agent frameworks improve LLMs via Long CoT simulation, but RLLMs' inherent Long CoT limits gains. Multilingual methods aid LLMs but not RLLMs.

Conclusion: The study provides key insights for optimizing LLMs and RLLMs in financial QA, highlighting limitations and opportunities for future work.

Abstract: Recently, the development of large language models (LLMs) and reasoning large
language models (RLLMs) have gained considerable attention from many
researchers. RLLMs enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) processes, significantly improving the performance
of LLMs in addressing complex problems. However, there are few works that
systematically explore what methods can fully unlock the performance of LLMs
and RLLMs within the financial domain. To investigate the impact of various
methods on LLMs and RLLMs, we utilize five LLMs and three RLLMs to assess the
effects of prompting methods, agentic frameworks, and multilingual alignment
methods on financial question-answering tasks. Our research findings indicate:
(1) Current prompting methods and agent frameworks enhance the performance of
LLMs in financial question answering by simulating Long CoT; (2) RLLMs possess
inherent Long CoT capabilities, which limits the effectiveness of conventional
methods in further enhancing their performance; (3) Current advanced
multilingual alignment methods primarily improve the multilingual performance
of LLMs by extending the reasoning length, which yields minimal benefits for
RLLMs. We hope that this study can serve as an important reference for LLMs and
RLLMs in the field of financial question answering.

*Itai Mondshine,Tzuf Paz-Argaman,Reut Tsarfaty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates n-gram and neural-based metrics for generative tasks across eight languages, finding n-gram metrics less effective for fusional languages and advocating for neural-based alternatives like COMET.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the suitability of automatic evaluation metrics (n-gram and neural-based) for generative tasks in diverse languages, as their effectiveness beyond English is unclear.

Method: A large-scale evaluation suite across eight languages from four typological families, analyzing correlation with human judgments.

Result: N-gram metrics show lower correlation with human assessments in fusional languages, while neural-based metrics like COMET outperform others, especially in low-resource settings.

Conclusion: N-gram metrics are limited for fusional languages; neural-based metrics trained for evaluation, such as COMET, are more reliable and should be prioritized.

Abstract: Automatic n-gram based metrics such as ROUGE are widely used for evaluating
generative tasks such as summarization. While these metrics are considered
indicative (even if imperfect) of human evaluation for English, their
suitability for other languages remains unclear. To address this, we
systematically assess evaluation metrics for generation both n-gram-based and
neural based to evaluate their effectiveness across languages and tasks.
Specifically, we design a large-scale evaluation suite across eight languages
from four typological families: agglutinative, isolating, low-fusional, and
high-fusional, spanning both low- and high-resource settings, to analyze their
correlation with human judgments. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of
evaluation metrics to the language type. For example, in fusional languages,
n-gram-based metrics show lower correlation with human assessments compared to
isolating and agglutinative languages. We also demonstrate that proper
tokenization can significantly mitigate this issue for morphologically rich
fusional languages, sometimes even reversing negative trends. Additionally, we
show that neural-based metrics specifically trained for evaluation, such as
COMET, consistently outperform other neural metrics and better correlate with
human judgments in low-resource languages. Overall, our analysis highlights the
limitations of n-gram metrics for fusional languages and advocates for greater
investment in neural-based metrics trained for evaluation tasks.

TL;DR: The study explores how multi-agent LLM dialogues enhance scientific ideation, finding that larger agent groups, deeper interactions, and diverse personas improve idea novelty and feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the optimal design of multi-agent LLM interactions for improving the novelty and feasibility of generated scientific ideas.

Method: Comparative analysis of agent roles, numbers, and dialogue depth in multi-agent LLM setups, including iterative ideation-critique-revision loops.

Result: Larger agent cohorts, deeper interactions, and diverse personas enhance idea diversity, while critic-side diversity boosts feasibility.

Conclusion: The findings provide practical guidelines for designing effective multi-agent LLM systems for scientific ideation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to support creative tasks
such as research idea generation. While recent work has shown that structured
dialogues between LLMs can improve the novelty and feasibility of generated
ideas, the optimal design of such interactions remains unclear. In this study,
we conduct a comprehensive analysis of multi-agent LLM dialogues for scientific
ideation. We compare different configurations of agent roles, number of agents,
and dialogue depth to understand how these factors influence the novelty and
feasibility of generated ideas. Our experimental setup includes settings where
one agent generates ideas and another critiques them, enabling iterative
improvement. Our results show that enlarging the agent cohort, deepening the
interaction depth, and broadening agent persona heterogeneity each enrich the
diversity of generated ideas. Moreover, specifically increasing critic-side
diversity within the ideation-critique-revision loop further boosts the
feasibility of the final proposals. Our findings offer practical guidelines for
building effective multi-agent LLM systems for scientific ideation. Our code is

### [128] [The Curious Case of Factuality Finetuning: Models' Internal Beliefs Can Improve Factuality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08371)
*Benjamin Newman,Abhilasha Ravichander,Jaehun Jung,Rui Xin,Hamish Ivison,Yegor Kuznetsov,Pang Wei Koh,Yejin Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Finetuning on model-generated data filtered by models' own judgments improves factuality more than using factual gold data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing hallucination in language models by studying the impact of finetuning data factuality.

Method: Analyzed finetuning on factual gold data vs. model-generated data, evaluating filtering strategies.

Result: Model-generated data filtered by models' judgments outperforms other configurations in reducing hallucinations.

Conclusion: Models' internal beliefs are a strong signal for improving factuality across domains.

Abstract: Language models are prone to hallucination - generating text that is
factually incorrect. Finetuning models on high-quality factual information can
potentially reduce hallucination, but concerns remain; obtaining factual gold
data can be expensive and training on correct but unfamiliar data may
potentially lead to even more downstream hallucination. What data should
practitioners finetune on to mitigate hallucinations in language models? In
this work, we study the relationship between the factuality of finetuning data
and the prevalence of hallucinations in long-form generation tasks.
Counterintuitively, we find that finetuning on factual gold data is not as
helpful as finetuning on model-generated data that models believe to be
factual. Next, we evaluate filtering strategies applied on both factual gold
data and model-generated data, and find that finetuning on model-generated data
that is filtered by models' own internal judgments often leads to better
overall factuality compared to other configurations: training on gold data
filtered by models' judgments, training on gold data alone, or training on
model-generated data that is supported by gold data. These factuality
improvements transfer across three domains we study, suggesting that a models'
own beliefs can provide a powerful signal for factuality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChainEdit improves logical consistency in LLM knowledge editing by combining knowledge graphs and LLM reasoning, achieving 30% better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods fail to maintain logical consistency when updating associated facts in LLMs.

Method: ChainEdit integrates knowledge graph rules with LLM reasoning to dynamically edit logically connected knowledge clusters.

Result: 30% improvement in logical generalization, with reliable and specific edits.

Conclusion: ChainEdit sets a new benchmark for logical consistency in knowledge editing.

Abstract: Current knowledge editing methods for large language models (LLMs) struggle
to maintain logical consistency when propagating ripple effects to associated
facts. We propose ChainEdit, a framework that synergizes knowledge
graph-derived logical rules with LLM logical reasoning capabilities to enable
systematic chain updates. By automatically extracting logical patterns from
structured knowledge bases and aligning them with LLMs' internal logics,
ChainEdit dynamically generates and edits logically connected knowledge
clusters. Experiments demonstrate an improvement of more than 30% in logical
generalization over baselines while preserving editing reliability and
specificity. We further address evaluation biases in existing benchmarks
through knowledge-aware protocols that disentangle external dependencies. This
work establishes new state-of-the-art performance on ripple effect while
ensuring internal logical consistency after knowledge editing.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-based multi-agent system simulates decision conferences, detecting agreement among agents with reliable stance and polarity detection, improving debate efficiency and coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of LLMs in simulating real-world decision conferences and enhancing group decision-making processes.

Method: Developed an LLM-based multi-agent system for simulating decision conferences, evaluating six LLMs on stance and stance polarity detection tasks within dynamic debates.

Result: LLMs reliably detect agreement in nuanced debates; an agreement-detection agent improves debate efficiency and coherence, matching real-world conference outcomes.

Conclusion: LLM-based multi-agent systems show promise for simulating group decision-making and supporting expert elicitation workshops across domains.

Abstract: Decision conferences are structured, collaborative meetings that bring
together experts from various fields to address complex issues and reach a
consensus on recommendations for future actions or policies. These conferences
often rely on facilitated discussions to ensure productive dialogue and
collective agreement. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
significant promise in simulating real-world scenarios, particularly through
collaborative multi-agent systems that mimic group interactions. In this work,
we present a novel LLM-based multi-agent system designed to simulate decision
conferences, specifically focusing on detecting agreement among the participant
agents. To achieve this, we evaluate six distinct LLMs on two tasks: stance
detection, which identifies the position an agent takes on a given issue, and
stance polarity detection, which identifies the sentiment as positive,
negative, or neutral. These models are further assessed within the multi-agent
system to determine their effectiveness in complex simulations. Our results
indicate that LLMs can reliably detect agreement even in dynamic and nuanced
debates. Incorporating an agreement-detection agent within the system can also
improve the efficiency of group debates and enhance the overall quality and
coherence of deliberations, making them comparable to real-world decision
conferences regarding outcome and decision-making. These findings demonstrate
the potential for LLM-based multi-agent systems to simulate group
decision-making processes. They also highlight that such systems could be
instrumental in supporting decision-making with expert elicitation workshops
across various domains.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Misattribution Framework and AttriData dataset for categorizing and attributing errors in LLM responses, along with a fine-tuned model, MisAttributionLLM, for automated evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM evaluation models lack error attribution capabilities, necessitating a systematic framework for diagnosing failures in model responses.

Method: Developed a Misattribution Framework with 6 primary and 15 secondary categories, created the AttriData dataset, and fine-tuned MisAttributionLLM for automated error attribution.

Result: The framework and model effectively categorize errors and provide scores, misattribution, and feedback, validated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a robust and automated solution for error analysis in LLM responses, enhancing model evaluation and diagnosis.

Abstract: With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various
tasks, the mainstream LLM platforms generate massive user-model interactions
daily. In order to efficiently analyze the performance of models and diagnose
failures in their answers, it is essential to develop an automated framework to
systematically categorize and attribute errors. However, existing evaluation
models lack error attribution capability. In this work, we establish a
comprehensive Misattribution Framework with 6 primary and 15 secondary
categories to facilitate in-depth analysis. Based on this framework, we present
AttriData, a dataset specifically designed for error attribution, encompassing
misattribution, along with the corresponding scores and feedback. We also
propose MisAttributionLLM, a fine-tuned model on AttriData, which is the first
general-purpose judge model capable of simultaneously generating score,
misattribution, and feedback. Extensive experiments and analyses are conducted
to confirm the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs' ability to assist in VAT law decision-making, testing fine-tuning and RAG methods. Results show promise but highlight limitations for full automation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce tax professionals' workload by automating routine tasks and providing initial legal analyses using LLMs.

Method: Experiments with fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) on textbook and real-world VAT cases.

Result: LLMs can support tax consultants with routine tasks and initial analyses but aren't ready for full automation due to legal sensitivity.

Conclusion: Properly configured LLMs show potential in VAT tasks, but future work is needed to integrate structured background information.

Abstract: This paper provides an experimental evaluation of the capability of large
language models (LLMs) to assist in legal decision-making within the framework
of Austrian and European Union value-added tax (VAT) law. In tax consulting
practice, clients often describe cases in natural language, making LLMs a prime
candidate for supporting automated decision-making and reducing the workload of
tax professionals. Given the requirement for legally grounded and
well-justified analyses, the propensity of LLMs to hallucinate presents a
considerable challenge. The experiments focus on two common methods for
enhancing LLM performance: fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG). In this study, these methods are applied on both textbook cases and
real-world cases from a tax consulting firm to systematically determine the
best configurations of LLM-based systems and assess the legal-reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. The findings highlight the potential of using LLMs to
support tax consultants by automating routine tasks and providing initial
analyses, although current prototypes are not ready for full automation due to
the sensitivity of the legal domain. The findings indicate that LLMs, when
properly configured, can effectively support tax professionals in VAT tasks and
provide legally grounded justifications for decisions. However, limitations
remain regarding the handling of implicit client knowledge and context-specific
documentation, underscoring the need for future integration of structured
background information.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness in experiments; achieved 4th in Track 1 and 1st in Track 2 of the MLC-SLM challenge.

Conclusion: The method is practical and has strong application potential, as evidenced by competition results.

Abstract: The deep integration of large language models and automatic speech
recognition systems has become a promising research direction with high
practical value. To address the overfitting issue commonly observed in Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) during the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, this work
proposes an innovative training paradigm Iterative LoRA Training (ILT) in
combination with an Iterative Pseudo Labeling strategy, effectively enhancing
the theoretical upper bound of model performance. Based on Whisper-large-v3 and
Qwen2-Audio, we conduct systematic experiments using a three-stage training

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A study proposes using item response theory to enhance machine learning models for scoring essay cohesion, outperforming conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatically scoring cohesion in essays is challenging, and existing machine learning models often ignore individual text characteristics.

Method: The approach combines item response theory with machine learning, using linguistic features and treating the task as regression.

Result: The proposed method outperforms conventional models and ensembles in evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: This research offers a promising method for improving automatic cohesion evaluation in educational essays.

Abstract: Essays are considered a valuable mechanism for evaluating learning outcomes
in writing. Textual cohesion is an essential characteristic of a text, as it
facilitates the establishment of meaning between its parts. Automatically
scoring cohesion in essays presents a challenge in the field of educational
artificial intelligence. The machine learning algorithms used to evaluate texts
generally do not consider the individual characteristics of the instances that
comprise the analysed corpus. In this meaning, item response theory can be
adapted to the context of machine learning, characterising the ability,
difficulty and discrimination of the models used. This work proposes and
analyses the performance of a cohesion score prediction approach based on item
response theory to adjust the scores generated by machine learning models. In
this study, the corpus selected for the experiments consisted of the extended
Essay-BR, which includes 6,563 essays in the style of the National High School
Exam (ENEM), and the Brazilian Portuguese Narrative Essays, comprising 1,235
essays written by 5th to 9th grade students from public schools. We extracted
325 linguistic features and treated the problem as a machine learning
regression task. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach
outperforms conventional machine learning models and ensemble methods in
several evaluation metrics. This research explores a potential approach for
improving the automatic evaluation of cohesion in educational essays.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing LLM evaluation paradigms (reference-based and preference-based) by offering a controlled, repeatable, and goal-directed method.

Method: Developed clembench, a tool optimized for ease of use, enabling benchmarking of models with provided game instances and extension with custom tests.

Result: clembench provides a mature, reusable implementation for dialogue game-based evaluation, bridging gaps in current methods.

Conclusion: clembench enhances LLM evaluation by combining strengths of existing paradigms and facilitating adoption through usability.

Abstract: There are currently two main paradigms for evaluating large language models
(LLMs), reference-based evaluation and preference-based evaluation. The first,
carried over from the evaluation of machine learning models in general, relies
on pre-defined task instances, for which reference task executions are
available. The second, best exemplified by the LM-arena, relies on (often
self-selected) users bringing their own intents to a site that routes these to
several models in parallel, among whose responses the user then selects their
most preferred one. The former paradigm hence excels at control over what is
tested, while the latter comes with higher ecological validity, testing actual
use cases interactively. Recently, a third complementary paradigm has emerged
that combines some of the strengths of these approaches, offering control over
multi-turn, reference-free, repeatable interactions, while stressing
goal-directedness: dialogue game based evaluation. While the utility of this
approach has been shown by several projects, its adoption has been held back by
the lack of a mature, easily re-usable implementation. In this paper, we
present clembench, which has been in continuous development since 2023 and has
in its latest release been optimized for ease of general use. We describe how
it can be used to benchmark one's own models (using a provided set of benchmark
game instances in English), as well as how easily the benchmark itself can be
extended with new, tailor-made targeted tests.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLaPa is a vision-language model framework for multimodal procedural planning, integrating textual and visual inputs with counterfactual reasoning to improve action sequence generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the underexplored integration of multimodal inputs and counterfactual reasoning in procedural planning for embodied AI systems.

Method: LLaPa uses vision-language models (VLMs) to generate action sequences from text and images, enhanced by two modules: Task-Environment Reranker (TER) for task-sensitive alignment and Counterfactual Activities Retriever (CAR) for counterfactual reasoning.

Result: LLaPa outperforms advanced models on ActPlan-1K and ALFRED benchmarks, generating higher-quality plans with superior LCS and correctness.

Conclusion: LLaPa effectively integrates multimodal inputs and counterfactual reasoning, advancing procedural planning for embodied AI.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have advanced procedural planning for
embodied AI systems through strong reasoning abilities, the integration of
multimodal inputs and counterfactual reasoning remains underexplored. To tackle
these challenges, we introduce LLaPa, a vision-language model framework
designed for multimodal procedural planning. LLaPa generates executable action
sequences from textual task descriptions and visual environmental images using
vision-language models (VLMs). Furthermore, we enhance LLaPa with two auxiliary
modules to improve procedural planning. The first module, the Task-Environment
Reranker (TER), leverages task-oriented segmentation to create a task-sensitive
feature space, aligning textual descriptions with visual environments and
emphasizing critical regions for procedural execution. The second module, the
Counterfactual Activities Retriever (CAR), identifies and emphasizes potential
counterfactual conditions, enhancing the model's reasoning capability in
counterfactual scenarios. Extensive experiments on ActPlan-1K and ALFRED
benchmarks demonstrate that LLaPa generates higher-quality plans with superior
LCS and correctness, outperforming advanced models. The code and models are
available https://github.com/sunshibo1234/LLaPa.

### [138] [Semantic-Augmented Latent Topic Modeling with LLM-in-the-Loop](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08498)
*Mengze Hong,Chen Jason Zhang,Di Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates integrating LLMs with LDA for topic modeling, focusing on initialization and post-correction. While LLM-guided initialization improves early LDA iterations, it doesn't affect convergence and underperforms baselines. LLM post-correction, however, boosts coherence by 5.86%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance LDA's performance by leveraging LLMs for initialization and post-correction, addressing LDA's dependency on initialization quality.

Method: Augments LDA with LLMs in two phases: (1) LLM-guided topic clustering for Gibbs sampling initialization, and (2) LLM-enabled post-correction.

Result: LLM initialization improves early LDA iterations but not convergence, performing worse than baselines. LLM post-correction improves coherence by 5.86%.

Conclusion: LLM integration shows practical benefits in post-correction but challenges the assumption that LLMs always outperform in text mining.

Abstract: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a prominent generative probabilistic
model used for uncovering abstract topics within document collections. In this
paper, we explore the effectiveness of augmenting topic models with Large
Language Models (LLMs) through integration into two key phases: Initialization
and Post-Correction. Since the LDA is highly dependent on the quality of its
initialization, we conduct extensive experiments on the LLM-guided topic
clustering for initializing the Gibbs sampling algorithm. Interestingly, the
experimental results reveal that while the proposed initialization strategy
improves the early iterations of LDA, it has no effect on the convergence and
yields the worst performance compared to the baselines. The LLM-enabled
post-correction, on the other hand, achieved a promising improvement of 5.86%
in the coherence evaluation. These results highlight the practical benefits of
the LLM-in-the-loop approach and challenge the belief that LLMs are always the
superior text mining alternative.

Motivation: To address linguistic diversity and resource constraints in multilingual emotion detection.

Method: Proposes a dynamic framework adapting document representations and learning algorithms, evaluating TF-IDF, FastText, Sentence-BERT, PCA, and MLP.

Result: TF-IDF excels in low-resource languages; FastText and Sentence-BERT show language-specific strengths. PCA improves efficiency without performance loss.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable solution for multilingual emotion detection, balancing complexity and cost.

Abstract: This paper presents our system for SemEval 2025 Task 11: Bridging the Gap in
Text-Based Emotion Detection (Track A), which focuses on multi-label emotion
detection in short texts. We propose a feature-centric framework that
dynamically adapts document representations and learning algorithms to optimize
language-specific performance. Our study evaluates three key components:
document representation, dimensionality reduction, and model training in 28
languages, highlighting five for detailed analysis. The results show that
TF-IDF remains highly effective for low-resource languages, while contextual
embeddings like FastText and transformer-based document representations, such
as those produced by Sentence-BERT, exhibit language-specific strengths.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces training time without compromising
performance, particularly benefiting FastText and neural models such as
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). Computational efficiency analysis underscores
the trade-off between model complexity and processing cost. Our framework
provides a scalable solution for multilingual emotion detection, addressing the
challenges of linguistic diversity and resource constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional models rely on absolute 2D positional embeddings, which may not be efficient. The goal is to improve document understanding with a more effective attention mechanism.

Method: Extends self-attention to use relative polar coordinates for text block positions, reducing dependency on large pre-training datasets.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance despite using a dataset six times smaller than the IIT-CDIP corpus.

Conclusion: A well-designed attention mechanism can compensate for reduced pre-training data, offering an efficient alternative for document understanding.

Abstract: We introduce DocPolarBERT, a layout-aware BERT model for document
understanding that eliminates the need for absolute 2D positional embeddings.
We extend self-attention to take into account text block positions in relative
polar coordinate system rather than the Cartesian one. Despite being
pre-trained on a dataset more than six times smaller than the widely used
IIT-CDIP corpus, DocPolarBERT achieves state-of-the-art results. These results
demonstrate that a carefully designed attention mechanism can compensate for
reduced pre-training data, offering an efficient and effective alternative for
document understanding.

*Marcin Pietroń,Rafał Olszowski,Jakub Gomułka,Filip Gampel,Andrzej Tomski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes LLMs like GPT-4o and Deepseek-R1 for argument classification, highlighting their performance and common errors, while identifying dataset shortcomings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of research on LLMs in publicly available argument classification databases and evaluate their performance.

Method: Tested LLMs (GPT, Llama, DeepSeek) and reasoning-enhanced variants on datasets like Args.me and UKP, using benchmarks.

Result: ChatGPT-4o and Deepseek-R1 outperformed others, but errors persist; weaknesses in prompt algorithms were identified.

Conclusion: The study provides the first broad LLM analysis of argument datasets, revealing limitations and suggesting improvements.

Abstract: Argument mining (AM) is an interdisciplinary research field that integrates
insights from logic, philosophy, linguistics, rhetoric, law, psychology, and
computer science. It involves the automatic identification and extraction of
argumentative components, such as premises and claims, and the detection of
relationships between them, such as support, attack, or neutrality. Recently,
the field has advanced significantly, especially with the advent of large
language models (LLMs), which have enhanced the efficiency of analyzing and
extracting argument semantics compared to traditional methods and other deep
learning models. There are many benchmarks for testing and verifying the
quality of LLM, but there is still a lack of research and results on the
operation of these models in publicly available argument classification
databases. This paper presents a study of a selection of LLM's, using diverse
datasets such as Args.me and UKP. The models tested include versions of GPT,
Llama, and DeepSeek, along with reasoning-enhanced variants incorporating the
Chain-of-Thoughts algorithm. The results indicate that ChatGPT-4o outperforms
the others in the argument classification benchmarks. In case of models
incorporated with reasoning capabilities, the Deepseek-R1 shows its
superiority. However, despite their superiority, GPT-4o and Deepseek-R1 still
make errors. The most common errors are discussed for all models. To our
knowledge, the presented work is the first broader analysis of the mentioned
datasets using LLM and prompt algorithms. The work also shows some weaknesses
of known prompt algorithms in argument analysis, while indicating directions
for their improvement. The added value of the work is the in-depth analysis of
the available argument datasets and the demonstration of their shortcomings.

### [143] [The Impact of Automatic Speech Transcription on Speaker Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08660)
*Cristina Aggazzotti,Matthew Wiesner,Elizabeth Allyn Smith,Nicholas Andrews*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Speaker attribution from speech transcripts is resilient to ASR errors, sometimes outperforming human transcripts due to speaker-specific error patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the impact of ASR transcription errors on speaker attribution, as prior work focused only on human-transcribed data.

Method: Comprehensive analysis of speaker attribution performance using ASR-generated transcripts, comparing it to human-transcribed data.

Result: Attribution remains robust despite word-level errors; ASR transcripts can perform as well or better than human transcripts.

Conclusion: ASR-generated transcripts are viable for speaker attribution, with errors potentially revealing speaker identity.

Abstract: Speaker attribution from speech transcripts is the task of identifying a
speaker from the transcript of their speech based on patterns in their language
use. This task is especially useful when the audio is unavailable (e.g.
deleted) or unreliable (e.g. anonymized speech). Prior work in this area has
primarily focused on the feasibility of attributing speakers using transcripts
produced by human annotators. However, in real-world settings, one often only
has more errorful transcripts produced by automatic speech recognition (ASR)
systems. In this paper, we conduct what is, to our knowledge, the first
comprehensive study of the impact of automatic transcription on speaker
attribution performance. In particular, we study the extent to which speaker
attribution performance degrades in the face of transcription errors, as well
as how properties of the ASR system impact attribution. We find that
attribution is surprisingly resilient to word-level transcription errors and
that the objective of recovering the true transcript is minimally correlated
with attribution performance. Overall, our findings suggest that speaker
attribution on more errorful transcripts produced by ASR is as good, if not
better, than attribution based on human-transcribed data, possibly because ASR
transcription errors can capture speaker-specific features revealing of speaker
identity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KELPS, a neuro-symbolic framework, improves formalizing informal math by translating natural language into Knowledge Equations and then into formal languages, achieving 88.9% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address bottlenecks in LLMs for formalizing math due to limited multilingual parallel corpora.

Method: Propose KELPS, translating natural language to Knowledge Equations, then to formal languages (Lean, Coq, Isabelle) with defined rules.

Result: Generated 60,000 problems, achieving 88.9% syntactic accuracy, outperforming SOTA models.

Conclusion: KELPS effectively bridges informal math to formal languages, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) show promising progress in formalizing
informal mathematics into machine-verifiable theorems. However, these methods
still face bottlenecks due to the limited quantity and quality of multilingual
parallel corpora. In this paper, we propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework
KELPS (Knowledge-Equation based Logical Processing System) to address these
problems. KELPS is an iterative framework for translating, synthesizing, and
filtering informal data into multiple formal languages (Lean, Coq, and
Isabelle). First, we translate natural language into Knowledge Equations (KEs),
a novel language that we designed, theoretically grounded in assertional logic.
Next, we convert them to target languages through rigorously defined rules that
preserve both syntactic structure and semantic meaning. This process yielded a
parallel corpus of over 60,000 problems. Our framework achieves 88.9% syntactic
accuracy (pass@1) on MiniF2F, outperforming SOTA models such as Deepseek-V3
(81%) and Herald (81.3%) across multiple datasets. All datasets and codes are
available in the supplementary materials.

*Songlin Zhai,Guilin Qi,Yuan Meng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A test-time KG-augmented framework for LLMs uses dynamic knowledge fusion without parameter updates, addressing catastrophic forgetting and real-time adaptability issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KG-enhanced LLMs rely on parameter-intensive fine-tuning, risking catastrophic forgetting and lacking real-time adaptability.

Method: Introduces a knowledge graph-guided attention (KGA) module with outward (knowledge fusion) and inward (knowledge filtering) pathways for dynamic, parameter-free integration.

Result: Achieves comparable knowledge fusion performance on five benchmarks without modifying model parameters.

Conclusion: The KGA framework enables real-time, dynamic knowledge fusion in LLMs, improving adaptability and avoiding catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) play a critical role in enhancing large language
models (LLMs) by introducing structured and grounded knowledge into the
learning process. However, most existing KG-enhanced approaches rely on
parameter-intensive fine-tuning, which risks catastrophic forgetting and
degrades the pretrained model's generalization. Moreover, they exhibit limited
adaptability to real-time knowledge updates due to their static integration
frameworks. To address these issues, we introduce the first test-time
KG-augmented framework for LLMs, built around a dedicated knowledge
graph-guided attention (KGA) module that enables dynamic knowledge fusion
without any parameter updates. The proposed KGA module augments the standard
self-attention mechanism with two synergistic pathways: outward and inward
aggregation. Specifically, the outward pathway dynamically integrates external
knowledge into input representations via input-driven KG fusion. This inward
aggregation complements the outward pathway by refining input representations
through KG-guided filtering, suppressing task-irrelevant signals and amplifying
knowledge-relevant patterns. Importantly, while the outward pathway handles
knowledge fusion, the inward path selects the most relevant triples and feeds
them back into the fusion process, forming a closed-loop enhancement mechanism.
By synergistically combining these two pathways, the proposed method supports
real-time knowledge fusion exclusively at test-time, without any parameter
modification. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks verify the comparable
knowledge fusion performance of KGA.

TL;DR: MM-Coder integrates visual aids like UML diagrams with text to improve code generation, addressing limitations of text-only LLMs. It uses MMc-Instruct for training and MMEval for benchmarking, revealing challenges in visual information capture and programming knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs lack support for visual aids in code generation, which are crucial in real-world software development. MM-Coder aims to bridge this gap by combining text and visual inputs.

Method: MM-Coder uses MMc-Instruct, a multimodal dataset, to train models on visual-workflow-based code generation. It also introduces MMEval for benchmarking multimodal code generation.

Result: Evaluations show challenges in visual information capture, instruction following, and advanced programming knowledge, despite improvements in code generation accuracy.

Conclusion: MM-Coder represents a step toward revolutionizing industrial programming by enabling LLMs to handle complex specifications involving both text and visual designs.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly
improved code generation, yet most models remain text-only, neglecting crucial
visual aids like diagrams and flowcharts used in real-world software
development. To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-Coder, a Multilingual
Multimodal software developer. MM-Coder integrates visual design inputs-Unified
Modeling Language (UML) diagrams and flowcharts (termed Visual Workflow)-with
textual instructions to enhance code generation accuracy and architectural
alignment. To enable this, we developed MMc-Instruct, a diverse multimodal
instruction-tuning dataset including visual-workflow-based code generation,
allowing MM-Coder to synthesize textual and graphical information like human
developers, distinct from prior work on narrow tasks. Furthermore, we introduce
MMEval, a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal code generation, addressing
existing text-only limitations. Our evaluations using MMEval highlight
significant remaining challenges for models in precise visual information
capture, instruction following, and advanced programming knowledge. Our work
aims to revolutionize industrial programming by enabling LLMs to interpret and
implement complex specifications conveyed through both text and visual designs.

Motivation: To enable controlled generation in language models without the need for continuous interventions or fine-tuning, making it more efficient and practical.

Method: Uses GPT-4-generated reasoning traces to create steering vectors applied to the key-value cache, inducing chain-of-thought reasoning in small models.

Result: Improves reasoning structure and task performance on benchmarks, with advantages in hyperparameter stability and inference efficiency.

Conclusion: Cache steering is a robust, practical solution for controlled generation, outperforming prior activation steering techniques.

Abstract: We propose cache steering, a lightweight method for implicit steering of
language models via a one-shot intervention applied directly to the key-value
cache. To validate its effectiveness, we apply cache steering to induce
chain-of-thought reasoning in small language models. Our approach leverages
GPT-4o-generated reasoning traces to construct steering vectors that shift
model behavior toward more explicit, multi-step reasoning without fine-tuning
or prompt modifications. Experimental evaluations on diverse reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that cache steering improves both the qualitative
structure of model reasoning and quantitative task performance. Compared to
prior activation steering techniques that require continuous interventions, our
one-shot cache steering offers substantial advantages in terms of
hyperparameter stability, inference-time efficiency, and ease of integration,
making it a more robust and practical solution for controlled generation.

*Ming Wang,Zhaoyang Duan,Dong Xue,Fangzhou Liu,Zhongheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A federated few-shot learning framework with privacy-preserving mechanisms is proposed to address limited labeled data and privacy concerns in respiratory disease diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges include labor-intensive data annotation, scarcity of high-quality labeled datasets, and patient privacy concerns in medical data sharing.

Method: Uses meta-stochastic gradient descent to prevent overfitting and integrates differential privacy noise to protect data. Aggregates local models via weighted averaging.

Result: The method achieves strong performance with differential privacy, effectively diagnosing respiratory diseases across diverse data.

Conclusion: The framework successfully balances privacy protection and diagnostic accuracy in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: The labor-intensive nature of medical data annotation presents a significant
challenge for respiratory disease diagnosis, resulting in a scarcity of
high-quality labeled datasets in resource-constrained settings. Moreover,
patient privacy concerns complicate the direct sharing of local medical data
across institutions, and existing centralized data-driven approaches, which
rely on amounts of available data, often compromise data privacy. This study
proposes a federated few-shot learning framework with privacy-preserving
mechanisms to address the issues of limited labeled data and privacy protection
in diagnosing respiratory diseases. In particular, a meta-stochastic gradient
descent algorithm is proposed to mitigate the overfitting problem that arises
from insufficient data when employing traditional gradient descent methods for
neural network training. Furthermore, to ensure data privacy against gradient
leakage, differential privacy noise from a standard Gaussian distribution is
integrated into the gradients during the training of private models with local
data, thereby preventing the reconstruction of medical images. Given the
impracticality of centralizing respiratory disease data dispersed across
various medical institutions, a weighted average algorithm is employed to
aggregate local diagnostic models from different clients, enhancing the
adaptability of a model across diverse scenarios. Experimental results show
that the proposed method yields compelling results with the implementation of
differential privacy, while effectively diagnosing respiratory diseases using
data from different structures, categories, and distributions.

*Kenshin Abe,Yunzhuo Wang,Shuhei Watanabe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an efficient combinatorial optimization algorithm for Tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE), extending its applicability beyond deep learning to domains like chemistry and biology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Combinatorial optimization is crucial in fields like chemistry and biology but remains underexplored in TPE. The paper addresses this gap.

Method: The authors generalize the categorical kernel in TPE to include a distance structure and modify it for large combinatorial spaces, reducing time complexity.

Result: Experiments show the proposed method outperforms the original TPE, finding better solutions with fewer evaluations.

Conclusion: The algorithm is integrated into Optuna, enhancing TPE's versatility for combinatorial optimization.

Abstract: Tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE) is a versatile hyperparameter
optimization (HPO) method supported by popular HPO tools. Since these HPO tools
have been developed in line with the trend of deep learning (DL), the problem
setups often used in the DL domain have been discussed for TPE such as
multi-objective optimization and multi-fidelity optimization. However, the
practical applications of HPO are not limited to DL, and black-box
combinatorial optimization is actively utilized in some domains, e.g.,
chemistry and biology. As combinatorial optimization has been an untouched, yet
very important, topic in TPE, we propose an efficient combinatorial
optimization algorithm for TPE. In this paper, we first generalize the
categorical kernel with the numerical kernel in TPE, enabling us to introduce a
distance structure to the categorical kernel. Then we discuss modifications for
the newly developed kernel to handle a large combinatorial search space. These
modifications reduce the time complexity of the kernel calculation with respect
to the size of a combinatorial search space. In the experiments using synthetic
problems, we verified that our proposed method identifies better solutions with
fewer evaluations than the original TPE. Our algorithm is available in Optuna,
an open-source framework for HPO.

*Simon Matrenok,Skander Moalla,Caglar Gulcehre*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QRPO bridges the gap between pointwise absolute rewards and offline learning by using quantile rewards, outperforming DPO, REBEL, and SimPO in evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods like DPO and REBEL are limited to preference pairs, while PPO and GRPO require online learning. QRPO aims to simplify learning from absolute rewards offline.

Method: QRPO leverages quantile rewards to enable regression to the KL-regularized RL objective's closed-form solution, avoiding the need for relative signals.

Result: QRPO achieves top performance in chat and coding evaluations (reward model scores, AlpacaEval 2, LeetCode) compared to other methods.

Conclusion: QRPO is effective for offline learning with absolute rewards, reduces length bias, and scales with compute for quantile reward estimation.

Abstract: Aligning large language models with pointwise absolute rewards has so far
required online, on-policy algorithms such as PPO and GRPO. In contrast,
simpler methods that can leverage offline or off-policy data, such as DPO and
REBEL, are limited to learning from preference pairs or relative signals. To
bridge this gap, we introduce \emph{Quantile Reward Policy Optimization}
(QRPO), which learns from pointwise absolute rewards while preserving the
simplicity and offline applicability of DPO-like methods. QRPO uses quantile
rewards to enable regression to the closed-form solution of the KL-regularized
RL objective. This reward yields an analytically tractable partition function,
removing the need for relative signals to cancel this term. Moreover, QRPO
scales with increased compute to estimate quantile rewards, opening a new
dimension for pre-computation scaling. Empirically, QRPO consistently achieves
top performance on chat and coding evaluations -- reward model scores,
AlpacaEval 2, and LeetCode -- compared to DPO, REBEL, and SimPO across diverse
datasets and 8B-scale models. Finally, we find that training with robust
rewards instead of converting them to preferences induces less length bias.

*Pouria Mahdavinia,Mehrdad Mahdavi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoFaSGD is a memory-efficient fine-tuning method for large models, using dynamic low-rank SVD updates to approximate full-rank momentum, balancing memory reduction and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing memory challenges in fine-tuning large models with stateful optimizers like AdamW, which require high GPU memory.

Method: Proposes MoFaSGD, which dynamically updates a low-rank SVD representation of first-order momentum, enabling efficient subspace updates.

Result: Achieves competitive memory reduction (similar to LoRA) and performance, with theoretical convergence guarantees.

Conclusion: MoFaSGD offers an effective, memory-efficient alternative for fine-tuning large models, with practical and theoretical benefits.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large foundation models presents significant memory challenges
due to stateful optimizers like AdamW, often requiring several times more GPU
memory than inference. While memory-efficient methods like parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA) and optimizer state compression exist, recent
approaches like GaLore bridge these by using low-rank gradient projections and
subspace moment accumulation. However, such methods may struggle with fixed
subspaces or computationally costly offline resampling (e.g., requiring
full-matrix SVDs). We propose Momentum Factorized SGD (MoFaSGD), which
maintains a dynamically updated low-rank SVD representation of the first-order
momentum, closely approximating its full-rank counterpart throughout training.
This factorization enables a memory-efficient fine-tuning method that
adaptively updates the optimization subspace at each iteration. Crucially,
MoFaSGD leverages the computed low-rank momentum factors to perform efficient
spectrally normalized updates, offering an alternative to subspace moment
accumulation. We establish theoretical convergence guarantees for MoFaSGD,
proving it achieves an optimal rate for non-convex stochastic optimization
under standard assumptions. Empirically, we demonstrate MoFaSGD's effectiveness
on large language model alignment benchmarks, achieving a competitive trade-off

*Hardik Shukla,Manurag Khullar,Vismay Churiwala*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A PDE-aware optimizer is proposed to improve PINNs training by adapting updates based on PDE residual gradients, outperforming Adam and SOAP in stability and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard optimizers like Adam struggle with balancing loss terms in stiff or ill-conditioned PDE systems, leading to poor performance in PINNs.

Method: The PDE-aware optimizer adapts parameter updates using the variance of per-sample PDE residual gradients, avoiding the high cost of second-order methods.

Result: The optimizer achieves smoother convergence and lower errors on 1D Burgers', Allen-Cahn, and KdV equations, especially in sharp gradient regions.

Conclusion: The PDE-aware optimizer enhances PINNs training stability, though scaling to larger architectures and hardware accelerators needs further research.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful framework
for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding physical
constraints into the loss function. However, standard optimizers such as Adam
often struggle to balance competing loss terms, particularly in stiff or
ill-conditioned systems. In this work, we propose a PDE-aware optimizer that
adapts parameter updates based on the variance of per-sample PDE residual
gradients. This method addresses gradient misalignment without incurring the
heavy computational costs of second-order optimizers such as SOAP. We benchmark
the PDE-aware optimizer against Adam and SOAP on 1D Burgers', Allen-Cahn and
Korteweg-de Vries(KdV) equations. Across both PDEs, the PDE-aware optimizer
achieves smoother convergence and lower absolute errors, particularly in
regions with sharp gradients. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of PDE
residual-aware adaptivity in enhancing stability in PINNs training. While
promising, further scaling on larger architectures and hardware accelerators
remains an important direction for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve PINNs' performance by addressing sensitivity to point sampling, leveraging quasi Monte-Carlo methods.

Method: Proposes QRPINNs, using low-discrepancy sequences for sampling instead of random points.

Result: QRPINNs show better convergence and outperform PINNs and adaptive methods in high-dimensional PDEs.

Conclusion: QRPINNs enhance PINNs' performance, with further gains possible by combining with adaptive sampling.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks have shown promise in solving partial
differential equations (PDEs) by integrating physical constraints into neural
network training, but their performance is sensitive to the sampling of points.
Based on the impressive performance of quasi Monte-Carlo methods in high
dimensional problems, this paper proposes Quasi-Random Physics-Informed Neural
Networks (QRPINNs), which use low-discrepancy sequences for sampling instead of
random points directly from the domain. Theoretically, QRPINNs have been proven
to have a better convergence rate than PINNs. Empirically, experiments
demonstrate that QRPINNs significantly outperform PINNs and some representative
adaptive sampling methods, especially in high-dimensional PDEs. Furthermore,
combining QRPINNs with adaptive sampling can further improve the performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PINNs fail to guarantee strict constraint satisfaction, which is critical for reliable predictions in engineering systems.

Method: KKT-Hardnet projects onto feasible regions via KKT conditions and reformulates nonlinear constraints using log-exponential transformations for differentiability.

Result: KKT-Hardnet achieves higher accuracy and strict constraint satisfaction compared to multilayer perceptrons and PINNs.

Conclusion: KKT-Hardnet enables reliable hybrid modeling by integrating domain knowledge into machine learning for complex systems.

Abstract: Traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) do not guarantee strict
constraint satisfaction. This is problematic in engineering systems where minor
violations of governing laws can significantly degrade the reliability and
consistency of model predictions. In this work, we develop KKT-Hardnet, a PINN
architecture that enforces both linear and nonlinear equality and inequality
constraints up to machine precision. It leverages a projection onto the
feasible region through solving Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of a
distance minimization problem. Furthermore, we reformulate the nonlinear KKT
conditions using log-exponential transformation to construct a general sparse
system with only linear and exponential terms, thereby making the projection
differentiable. We apply KKT-Hardnet on both test problems and a real-world
chemical process simulation. Compared to multilayer perceptrons and PINNs,
KKT-Hardnet achieves higher accuracy and strict constraint satisfaction. This
approach allows the integration of domain knowledge into machine learning
towards reliable hybrid modeling of complex systems.

Motivation: Traffic accidents are rare but impactful, requiring long-context multimodal reasoning for accurate risk prediction.

Method: ALCo-FM dynamically selects context windows, uses shallow cross attention for multimodal fusion, and employs a GAT layer and BigBird-style transformer with Monte Carlo dropout.

Result: Achieves 0.94 accuracy, 0.92 F1, and 0.04 ECE, outperforming 20+ baselines.

Conclusion: ALCo-FM is effective for urban risk prediction, with well-calibrated results and minimal fine-tuning.

Abstract: Traffic accidents are rare, yet high-impact events that require long-context
multimodal reasoning for accurate risk forecasting. In this paper, we introduce
ALCo-FM, a unified adaptive long-context foundation model that computes a
volatility pre-score to dynamically select context windows for input data and
encodes and fuses these multimodal data via shallow cross attention. Following
a local GAT layer and a BigBird-style sparse global transformer over H3
hexagonal grids, coupled with Monte Carlo dropout for confidence, the model
yields superior, well-calibrated predictions. Trained on data from 15 US cities
with a class-weighted loss to counter label imbalance, and fine-tuned with
minimal data on held-out cities, ALCo-FM achieves 0.94 accuracy, 0.92 F1, and
an ECE of 0.04, outperforming more than 20 state-of-the-art baselines in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of incorporating new items in machine learning for educational assessment, as traditional methods rely heavily on historical data.

Method: Extends the LENS partial variational auto-encoder to use item text embeddings, tested on Eedi and LLM-Sim datasets.

Result: Text-LENS matches LENS on seen items and outperforms it on unseen items, effectively learning student proficiency and predicting performance on new items.

Conclusion: Text-LENS is a promising approach for improving generalization in educational assessment, especially for unseen items.

Abstract: Machine learning has been proposed as a way to improve educational assessment
by making fine-grained predictions about student performance and learning
relationships between items. One challenge with many machine learning
approaches is incorporating new items, as these approaches rely heavily on
historical data. We develop Text-LENS by extending the LENS partial variational
auto-encoder for educational assessment to leverage item text embeddings, and
explore the impact on predictive performance and generalization to previously
unseen items. We examine performance on two datasets: Eedi, a publicly
available dataset that includes item content, and LLM-Sim, a novel dataset with
test items produced by an LLM. We find that Text-LENS matches LENS' performance
on seen items and improves upon it in a variety of conditions involving unseen

TL;DR: The paper explores using physiological signals for emotion recognition, comparing classical and quantum machine learning. Quantum-enhanced SVM outperforms classical methods, showing promise for privacy-preserving emotion monitoring in clinical settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a privacy-preserving alternative to facial recognition for emotion detection, especially beneficial for individuals with communication impairments like ADRD or PTSD.

Method: Performance comparison of classical ML algorithms and hybrid quantum ML (QML) methods, specifically a quantum kernel-based SVM model, using physiological signals.

Result: Quantum-enhanced SVM achieves over 80% F1 scores and up to 36% improvement in recall, outperforming classical methods even with limited datasets.

Conclusion: The integration of wearable sensors and QML offers accurate, unobtrusive emotion recognition, with potential applications in clinical and assisted living environments.

Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of inferring emotional states exclusively from
physiological signals, thereby presenting a privacy-preserving alternative to
conventional facial recognition techniques. We conduct a performance comparison
of classical machine learning algorithms and hybrid quantum machine learning
(QML) methods with a quantum kernel-based model. Our results indicate that the
quantum-enhanced SVM surpasses classical counterparts in classification
performance across all emotion categories, even when trained on limited
datasets. The F1 scores over all classes are over 80% with around a maximum of
36% improvement in the recall values. The integration of wearable sensor data
with quantum machine learning not only enhances accuracy and robustness but
also facilitates unobtrusive emotion recognition. This methodology holds
promise for populations with impaired communication abilities, such as
individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) and veterans
with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The findings establish an early
foundation for passive emotional monitoring in clinical and assisted living

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a causal learning approach for spatio-temporal anomaly detection in cyber-physical systems, addressing interpretability and adaptability issues in current deep learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring resilience against cyberattacks in interconnected systems is critical, but current data-driven methods lack interpretability and robustness.

Method: The paper introduces causal graph profiling, multi-view fusion, and continual causal graph learning to model dynamic cause-effect relationships.

Result: Causal models provide early warnings and root cause attribution, outperforming black-box detectors in real-world systems like water treatment infrastructures.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for causality-driven approaches in cybersecurity, outlining future research on scalable, adaptive, and explainable anomaly detection frameworks.

Abstract: As cyber-physical systems grow increasingly interconnected and spatially
distributed, ensuring their resilience against evolving cyberattacks has become
a critical priority. Spatio-Temporal Anomaly detection plays an important role
in ensuring system security and operational integrity. However, current
data-driven approaches, largely driven by black-box deep learning, face
challenges in interpretability, adaptability to distribution shifts, and
robustness under evolving system dynamics. In this paper, we advocate for a
causal learning perspective to advance anomaly detection in spatially
distributed infrastructures that grounds detection in structural cause-effect
relationships. We identify and formalize three key directions: causal graph
profiling, multi-view fusion, and continual causal graph learning, each
offering distinct advantages in uncovering dynamic cause-effect structures
across time and space. Drawing on real-world insights from systems such as
water treatment infrastructures, we illustrate how causal models provide early
warning signals and root cause attribution, addressing the limitations of
black-box detectors. Looking ahead, we outline the future research agenda
centered on multi-modality, generative AI-driven, and scalable adaptive causal
frameworks. Our objective is to lay a new research trajectory toward scalable,
adaptive, explainable, and spatially grounded anomaly detection systems. We
hope to inspire a paradigm shift in cybersecurity research, promoting
causality-driven approaches to address evolving threats in interconnected
infrastructures.

*Junda Wu,Yuxin Xiong,Xintong Li,Zhengmian Hu,Tong Yu,Rui Wang,Xiang Chen,Jingbo Shang,Julian McAuley*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CTRLS introduces a framework for Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning using Markov decision processes and reinforcement learning, improving reasoning accuracy and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional CoT methods lack structured modeling of reasoning transitions, limiting exploration of diverse reasoning paths.

Method: CTRLS models CoT reasoning as a Markov decision process with latent state transitions, using distributional reinforcement learning for principled exploration.

Result: The framework enhances reasoning accuracy, diversity, and exploration efficiency in benchmark tasks.

Conclusion: CTRLS provides a theoretically grounded and effective approach to structured reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enables large language models (LLMs) to
break down complex problems into interpretable intermediate steps,
significantly enhancing model transparency and performance in reasoning tasks.
However, conventional CoT methods rely on heuristic sampling without structured
modeling of reasoning transitions, constraining their ability to systematically
explore and discover diverse and effective reasoning trajectories. In this
work, we introduce CTRLS, a framework that formulates CoT reasoning as a Markov
decision process (MDP) with latent state transitions, enabling principled and
state-aware exploration via distributional reinforcement learning. By modelling
reasoning actions as explicit probability distributions in latent space, our
approach explicitly models epistemic uncertainty, facilitating robust
exploration of the reasoning space. As part of our framework, we introduce an
on-policy reinforcement learning strategy incorporating epsilon-greedy
exploration and entropy-based regularization to iteratively refine latent state
transitions without requiring additional fine-tuning of the underlying LLM.
Theoretical analyses provide evidence lower bounds (ELBO), theoretically
grounding our transition-aware modeling of latent reasoning dynamics. Further
experiments demonstrate improvements in reasoning accuracy, diversity, and
exploration efficiency across benchmark reasoning tasks.

### [160] [EvA: Evolutionary Attacks on Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08212)
*Mohammad Sadegh Akhondzadeh,Soroush H. Zargarbashi,Jimin Cao,Aleksandar Bojchevski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an evolutionary-based attack (EvA) for graph neural networks (GNNs) that directly solves discrete optimization, outperforming gradient-based attacks by ~11% in accuracy drop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attacks on GNNs rely on gradient information, which limits adaptability and optimality. The paper aims to address these limitations by proposing a more flexible and effective approach.

Method: The authors enhance an evolutionary algorithm to directly solve the discrete optimization problem, enabling attacks on non-differentiable objectives and black-box models.

Result: EvA achieves an ~11% greater accuracy drop compared to previous attacks and works with any model or objective, including novel attacks on robustness certificates and conformal sets.

Conclusion: The proposed EvA method reveals untapped potential in attack design, offering superior performance and flexibility over gradient-based approaches.

Abstract: Even a slight perturbation in the graph structure can cause a significant
drop in the accuracy of graph neural networks (GNNs). Most existing attacks
leverage gradient information to perturb edges. This relaxes the attack's
optimization problem from a discrete to a continuous space, resulting in
solutions far from optimal. It also restricts the adaptability of the attack to
non-differentiable objectives. Instead, we introduce a few simple yet effective
enhancements of an evolutionary-based algorithm to solve the discrete
optimization problem directly. Our Evolutionary Attack (EvA) works with any
black-box model and objective, eliminating the need for a differentiable proxy
loss. This allows us to design two novel attacks that reduce the effectiveness
of robustness certificates and break conformal sets. The memory complexity of
our attack is linear in the attack budget. Among our experiments, EvA shows
$\sim$11\% additional drop in accuracy on average compared to the best previous
attack, revealing significant untapped potential in designing attacks.

TL;DR: InsightBuild combines causal analysis and LLMs to explain energy anomalies in smart buildings, improving facility management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Facility managers lack clear explanations for anomalous energy usage in smart buildings.

Method: A two-stage framework: causal inference (Granger tests, structural discovery) and LLM-based natural language generation.

Result: Effective in providing actionable explanations for energy anomalies, validated on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating causal discovery with LLMs enhances clarity and precision in diagnosing energy inefficiencies.

Abstract: Smart buildings generate vast streams of sensor and control data, but
facility managers often lack clear explanations for anomalous energy usage. We
propose InsightBuild, a two-stage framework that integrates causality analysis
with a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) to provide human-readable, causal
explanations of energy consumption patterns. First, a lightweight causal
inference module applies Granger causality tests and structural causal
discovery on building telemetry (e.g., temperature, HVAC settings, occupancy)
drawn from Google Smart Buildings and Berkeley Office datasets. Next, an LLM,
fine-tuned on aligned pairs of sensor-level causes and textual explanations,
receives as input the detected causal relations and generates concise,
actionable explanations. We evaluate InsightBuild on two real-world datasets
(Google: 2017-2022; Berkeley: 2018-2020), using expert-annotated ground-truth
causes for a held-out set of anomalies. Our results demonstrate that combining
explicit causal discovery with LLM-based natural language generation yields
clear, precise explanations that assist facility managers in diagnosing and
mitigating energy inefficiencies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting prosocial behavior intentions in mobility scenarios is underexplored due to lack of large labeled datasets, limiting deep-learning model training.

Method: Uses self-supervised learning with multi-modal data from existing datasets, pre-trains on diverse tasks, and fine-tunes with a smaller labeled prosocial behavior dataset.

Result: Significantly enhances model performance, addressing data scarcity and improving prosocial behavior prediction.

Conclusion: Provides a benchmark for prosocial behavior prediction and insights for intelligent vehicle systems and human-machine interaction.

Abstract: Human state detection and behavior prediction have seen significant
advancements with the rise of machine learning and multimodal sensing
technologies. However, predicting prosocial behavior intentions in mobility
scenarios, such as helping others on the road, is an underexplored area.
Current research faces a major limitation. There are no large, labeled datasets
available for prosocial behavior, and small-scale datasets make it difficult to
train deep-learning models effectively. To overcome this, we propose a
self-supervised learning approach that harnesses multi-modal data from existing
physiological and behavioral datasets. By pre-training our model on diverse
tasks and fine-tuning it with a smaller, manually labeled prosocial behavior
dataset, we significantly enhance its performance. This method addresses the
data scarcity issue, providing a more effective benchmark for prosocial
behavior prediction, and offering valuable insights for improving intelligent
vehicle systems and human-machine interaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Function estimation for generative models is computationally and statistically challenging, prompting the exploration of alternative methods.

Method: The method uses deterministic (inverse) gradient descent on point sets to transport uniform distributions to data distributions, leveraging physics of interacting particles.

Result: The approach successfully generates data without function estimation, neural networks, or noise injection, supported by theoretical and experimental evidence.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a promising alternative to traditional generative models by eliminating the need for function estimation and complex training.

Abstract: Estimating the score function (or other population-density-dependent
functions) is a fundamental component of most generative models. However, such
function estimation is computationally and statistically challenging. Can we
avoid function estimation for data generation? We propose an estimation-free
generative method: A set of points whose locations are deterministically
updated with (inverse) gradient descent can transport a uniform distribution to
arbitrary data distribution, in the mean field regime, without function
estimation, training neural networks, and even noise injection. The proposed
method is built upon recent advances in the physics of interacting particles.
We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that these advances can be
leveraged to develop novel generative methods.

TL;DR: CoreSPECT enhances clustering by leveraging interactions between density and geometry, improving K-Means and GMM performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the overlooked interaction between density and geometry in clustering algorithms to enhance simple methods like K-Means and GMM.

Method: Uses a novel framework (CoreSPECT) with strategic region selection and multi-layer propagation via neighborhood graphs.

Result: Improves K-Means ARI by 40% and GMM by 14%, outperforming density and manifold-based methods.

Conclusion: CoreSPECT effectively boosts clustering accuracy with theoretical support and robustness to noise.

Abstract: Density and geometry have long served as two of the fundamental guiding
principles in clustering algorithm design, with algorithm usually focusing
either on the density structure of the data (e.g., HDBSCAN and Density Peak
Clustering) or the complexity of underlying geometry (e.g., manifold clustering
algorithms).
  In this paper, we identify and formalize a recurring but often overlooked
interaction between distribution and geometry and leverage this insight to
design our clustering enhancement framework CoreSPECT (Core Space
Projection-based Enhancement of Clustering Techniques). Our framework boosts
the performance of simple algorithms like K-Means and GMM by applying them to
strategically selected regions, then extending the partial partition to a
complete partition for the dataset using a novel neighborhood graph based
multi-layer propagation procedure.
  We apply our framework on 15 datasets from three different domains and obtain
consistent and substantial gain in clustering accuracy for both K-Means and
GMM. On average, our framework improves the ARI of K-Means by 40% and of GMM by
14%, often surpassing the performance of both manifold-based and recent
density-based clustering algorithms. We further support our framework with
initial theoretical guarantees, ablation to demonstrate the usefulness of the
individual steps and with evidence of robustness to noise.

TL;DR: Quantum-UnIMP integrates quantum circuits into LLM-based imputation, outperforming classical methods by leveraging quantum phenomena for richer data representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of classical embedding methods in LLMs for handling complex, non-linear correlations in mixed-type data with missing values.

Method: Replaces classical embeddings with quantum feature maps generated by an IQP circuit, utilizing superposition and entanglement for enhanced data representation.

Result: Reduces imputation error by 15.2% (RMSE) for numerical features and improves classification accuracy by 8.7% (F1-Score) for categorical features.

Conclusion: Quantum-enhanced representations show significant potential for improving data imputation, even with current quantum hardware.

Abstract: Missing data presents a critical challenge in real-world datasets,
significantly degrading the performance of machine learning models. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
tabular data imputation, exemplified by frameworks like UnIMP, their reliance
on classical embedding methods often limits their ability to capture complex,
non-linear correlations, particularly in mixed-type data scenarios encompassing
numerical, categorical, and textual features. This paper introduces
Quantum-UnIMP, a novel framework that integrates shallow quantum circuits into
an LLM-based imputation architecture. Our core innovation lies in replacing
conventional classical input embeddings with quantum feature maps generated by
an Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial (IQP) circuit. This approach enables the
model to leverage quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement,
thereby learning richer, more expressive representations of data and enhancing
the recovery of intricate missingness patterns. Our experiments on benchmark
mixed-type datasets demonstrate that Quantum-UnIMP reduces imputation error by
up to 15.2% for numerical features (RMSE) and improves classification accuracy
by 8.7% for categorical features (F1-Score) compared to state-of-the-art
classical and LLM-based methods. These compelling results underscore the
profound potential of quantum-enhanced representations for complex data
imputation tasks, even with near-term quantum hardware.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve LLMs' mathematical reasoning by systematically integrating SFT and RL, addressing gaps in accuracy and efficiency.

Method: Extend SFT for up to 10 epochs to maximize accuracy, then apply GRPO to optimize token efficiency while maintaining performance.

Result: Achieves top-tier performance in benchmarks, including a high rank in the AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO).

Conclusion: The method provides a reproducible blueprint for developing highly accurate and efficient mathematical reasoners, with open-sourced resources.

Abstract: Enhancing the mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a
pivotal challenge in advancing AI capabilities. While Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are the dominant training paradigms, a
systematic methodology for combining them to maximize both accuracy and
efficiency remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a practical and
effective training recipe that strategically integrates extended SFT with RL
from online inference (GRPO). We posit that these methods play complementary,
not competing, roles: a prolonged SFT phase first pushes the model's accuracy
to its limits, after which a GRPO phase dramatically improves token efficiency
while preserving this peak performance. Our experiments reveal that extending
SFT for as many as 10 epochs is crucial for performance breakthroughs, and that
the primary role of GRPO in this framework is to optimize solution length. The
efficacy of our recipe is rigorously validated through top-tier performance on
challenging benchmarks, including a high rank among over 2,200 teams in the
strictly leak-free AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO). This work provides the
community with a battle-tested blueprint for developing state-of-the-art
mathematical reasoners that are both exceptionally accurate and practically
efficient. To ensure full reproducibility and empower future research, we will

on type-specific data and guided by a type-specifying layer, enabling both
single-type and multi-type synthesis. A novel simulation metric evaluates
prediction quality by comparing desired and generated motions. Experiments show
our approach produces accurate, defect-free linkages across various

Result: Small language models achieve or surpass larger models in content moderation, with improved resilience and reduced computational costs.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable, efficient solution for AI content moderation, enhancing performance and robustness of small models.

Abstract: We introduce a lightweight yet highly effective safety guardrail framework
for language models, demonstrating that small-scale language models can
achieve, and even surpass, the performance of larger counterparts in content

generation and adversarial training. The synthetic data generation process
begins with human-curated seed data, which undergoes query augmentation and
paraphrasing to create diverse and contextually rich examples. This augmented
data is then subjected to multiple rounds of curation, ensuring high fidelity

Network (GAN) architecture, our adversarial training employs reinforcement
learning to guide a generator that produces challenging synthetic examples.
These examples are used to fine-tune the safety classifier, enhancing its
ability to detect and mitigate harmful content. Additionally, we incorporate
strategies from recent research on efficient LLM training, leveraging the
capabilities of smaller models to improve the performance of larger generative
models. With iterative adversarial training and the generation of diverse,
high-quality synthetic data, our framework enables small language models (SLMs)
to serve as robust safety guardrails. This approach not only reduces
computational overhead but also enhances resilience against adversarial
attacks, offering a scalable and efficient solution for content moderation in
AI systems.

*Jitendra Kumar,Deepika Saxena,Kishu Gupta,Satyam Kumar,Ashutosh Kumar Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes CA-QNN, a quantum neural network model for cloud workload prediction, outperforming existing methods with up to 93.40% error reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional neural networks struggle with diverse, high-dimensional cloud workloads due to limited optimization, prompting the need for a more adaptive solution.

Method: CA-QNN combines quantum computing with structural and parametric learning, using qubit neurons and a novel optimization algorithm for adaptive training.

Result: CA-QNN reduces prediction errors by up to 93.40% and 91.27% compared to deep learning and QNN-based methods.

Conclusion: The CA-QNN model offers superior accuracy for cloud workload prediction, addressing inefficiencies in traditional approaches.

Abstract: Accurate workload prediction and advanced resource reservation are
indispensably crucial for managing dynamic cloud services. Traditional neural
networks and deep learning models frequently encounter challenges with diverse,
high-dimensional workloads, especially during sudden resource demand changes,
leading to inefficiencies. This issue arises from their limited optimization
during training, relying only on parametric (inter-connection weights)
adjustments using conventional algorithms. To address this issue, this work
proposes a novel Comprehensively Adaptive Architectural Optimization-based
Variable Quantum Neural Network (CA-QNN), which combines the efficiency of
quantum computing with complete structural and qubit vector parametric
learning. The model converts workload data into qubits, processed through qubit
neurons with Controlled NOT-gated activation functions for intuitive pattern
recognition. In addition, a comprehensive architecture optimization algorithm
for networks is introduced to facilitate the learning and propagation of the
structure and parametric values in variable-sized QNNs. This algorithm
incorporates quantum adaptive modulation and size-adaptive recombination during
training process. The performance of CA-QNN model is thoroughly investigated
against seven state-of-the-art methods across four benchmark datasets of
heterogeneous cloud workloads. The proposed model demonstrates superior
prediction accuracy, reducing prediction errors by up to 93.40% and 91.27%
compared to existing deep learning and QNN-based approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: scE2TM is a knowledge-guided single-cell embedded topic model that improves clustering and interpretability in scRNA-seq data analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of quantitative interpretability evaluation and the neglect of external biological knowledge in existing single-cell embedded topic models.

Method: Develops scE2TM, integrating external biological knowledge for embedding and clustering, and introduces 10 metrics for interpretability evaluation.

Result: Outperforms 7 state-of-the-art methods in clustering and shows superior interpretability in diversity and biological consistency.

Conclusion: scE2TM enhances scRNA-seq analysis by combining high-quality embeddings with robust interpretability, revealing underlying biological mechanisms.

Abstract: Recent advances in sequencing technologies have enabled researchers to
explore cellular heterogeneity at single-cell resolution. Meanwhile,
interpretability has gained prominence parallel to the rapid increase in the
complexity and performance of deep learning models. In recent years, topic
models have been widely used for interpretable single-cell embedding learning
and clustering analysis, which we refer to as single-cell embedded topic
models. However, previous studies evaluated the interpretability of the models
mainly through qualitative analysis, and these single-cell embedded topic
models suffer from the potential problem of interpretation collapse.
Furthermore, their neglect of external biological knowledge constrains
analytical performance. Here, we present scE2TM, an external knowledge-guided
single-cell embedded topic model that provides a high-quality cell embedding
and strong interpretation, contributing to comprehensive scRNA-seq data
analysis. Our comprehensive evaluation across 20 scRNA-seq datasets
demonstrates that scE2TM achieves significant clustering performance gains
compared to 7 state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we propose a new
interpretability evaluation benchmark that introduces 10 metrics to
quantitatively assess the interpretability of single-cell embedded topic
models. The results show that the interpretation provided by scE2TM performs
encouragingly in terms of diversity and consistency with the underlying
biological signals, contributing to a better revealing of the underlying
biological mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual conversion of text to BPMN models is time-intensive and costly; existing methods struggle with writing styles and parallel structures.

Method: Leverages machine learning and large language models, augmented by a newly annotated dataset (PET dataset with 15 additional documents and 32 parallel gateways).

Result: Improved reconstruction accuracy, especially in capturing parallel structures in process descriptions.

Conclusion: The approach offers a promising solution for organizations to accelerate BPMN model creation.

Abstract: Efficient planning, resource management, and consistent operations often rely
on converting textual process documents into formal Business Process Model and
Notation (BPMN) models. However, this conversion process remains time-intensive
and costly. Existing approaches, whether rule-based or machine-learning-based,
still struggle with writing styles and often fail to identify parallel
structures in process descriptions.
  This paper introduces an automated pipeline for extracting BPMN models from
text, leveraging the use of machine learning and large language models. A key
contribution of this work is the introduction of a newly annotated dataset,
which significantly enhances the training process. Specifically, we augment the
PET dataset with 15 newly annotated documents containing 32 parallel gateways
for model training, a critical feature often overlooked in existing datasets.
This addition enables models to better capture parallel structures, a common
but complex aspect of process descriptions. The proposed approach demonstrates
adequate performance in terms of reconstruction accuracy, offering a promising
foundation for organizations to accelerate BPMN model creation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares LSTM, CNN, and Transformer networks for predicting lane changes by human drivers, finding Transformers perform best with accuracy up to 96.73%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting lane changes improves safety and efficiency for automated vehicles, but existing methods lack focus on maneuver prediction within time intervals and architectural comparisons.

Method: Implemented and compared LSTM, CNN, and Transformer networks using the highD dataset, detailing data preparation, feature selection, and network design.

Result: Transformers outperformed LSTMs and CNNs, showing less overfitting and achieving accuracy between 82.79% and 96.73%.

Conclusion: Transformer networks are superior for lane change prediction, offering robust performance across various input configurations.

Abstract: Lane changes of preceding vehicles have a great impact on the motion planning
of automated vehicles especially in complex traffic situations. Predicting them
would benefit the public in terms of safety and efficiency. While many research
efforts have been made in this direction, few concentrated on predicting
maneuvers within a set time interval compared to predicting at a set prediction
time. In addition, there exist a lack of comparisons between different
architectures to try to determine the best performing one and to assess how to
correctly choose the input for such models. In this paper the structure of an
LSTM, a CNN and a Transformer network are described and implemented to predict
the intention of human drivers to perform a lane change. We show how the data
was prepared starting from a publicly available dataset (highD), which features
were used, how the networks were designed and finally we compare the results of
the three networks with different configurations of input data. We found that
transformer networks performed better than the other networks and was less
affected by overfitting. The accuracy of the method spanned from $82.79\%$ to
$96.73\%$ for different input configurations and showed overall good
performances considering also precision and recall.

Motivation: To explore how QML can leverage quantum computing advantages to enhance data-driven tasks and address classical ML computational bottlenecks.

Method: Introduces QML's theoretical foundations, categorizes approaches by data type and architecture, and evaluates key developments like Quantum PCA and quantum-enhanced sensing.

Result: QML shows promise for specific applications (e.g., quantum chemistry) but faces challenges like hardware noise and scalability, limiting broader utility.

Conclusion: While QML has potential, its real-world impact depends on overcoming technological hurdles, developing quantum-native algorithms, and improving error correction.

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) represents a promising frontier at the
intersection of quantum computing and artificial intelligence, aiming to
leverage quantum computational advantages to enhance data-driven tasks. This
review explores the potential of QML to address the computational bottlenecks
of classical machine learning, particularly in processing complex datasets. We
introduce the theoretical foundations of QML, including quantum data encoding,
quantum learning theory and optimization techniques, while categorizing QML
approaches based on data type and computational architecture. It is
well-established that quantum computational advantages are problem-dependent,
and so potentially useful directions for QML need to be systematically
identified. Key developments, such as Quantum Principal Component Analysis,
quantum-enhanced sensing and applications in material science, are critically
evaluated for their theoretical speed-ups and practical limitations. The
challenges posed by Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, including
hardware noise, scalability constraints and data encoding overheads, are
discussed in detail. We also outline future directions, emphasizing the need
for quantum-native algorithms, improved error correction, and realistic
benchmarks to bridge the gap between theoretical promise and practical
deployment. This comprehensive analysis underscores that while QML has
significant potential for specific applications such as quantum chemistry and
sensing, its broader utility in real-world scenarios remains contingent on
overcoming technological and methodological hurdles.

*Xinying Liu,Lianyu Hu,Mudi Jiang,Simen Zhang,Jun Lou,Zengyou He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the bias in using classic two-sample tests for cluster analysis and proposes a new two-cluster test method based on boundary points to reduce Type-I error rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classic two-sample tests yield inflated Type-I error rates when applied to subsets generated by clustering procedures, necessitating a new significance testing approach.

Method: A new two-cluster test method is introduced, leveraging boundary points between subsets to derive analytical p-values.

Result: Experiments show the proposed test significantly reduces Type-I error rates compared to classic methods and is validated in practical clustering applications.

Conclusion: The two-cluster test is a distinct and effective solution for significance testing in clustering, with demonstrated utility in interpretable and hierarchical clustering.

Abstract: Cluster analysis is a fundamental research issue in statistics and machine
learning. In many modern clustering methods, we need to determine whether two
subsets of samples come from the same cluster. Since these subsets are usually
generated by certain clustering procedures, the deployment of classic
two-sample tests in this context would yield extremely smaller p-values,
leading to inflated Type-I error rate. To overcome this bias, we formally
introduce the two-cluster test issue and argue that it is a totally different
significance testing issue from conventional two-sample test. Meanwhile, we
present a new method based on the boundary points between two subsets to derive
an analytical p-value for the purpose of significance quantification.
Experiments on both synthetic and real data sets show that the proposed test is
able to significantly reduce the Type-I error rate, in comparison with several
classic two-sample testing methods. More importantly, the practical usage of
such two-cluster test is further verified through its applications in
tree-based interpretable clustering and significance-based hierarchical
clustering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline pre-trained agents often underperform during online fine-tuning due to distribution shift, leading to inaccurate value estimation.

Method: Proposes OPT, which adds an Online Pre-Training phase to tailor a new value function for effective online fine-tuning.

Result: Implementation on TD3 and SPOT shows a 30% average performance improvement across D4RL environments.

Conclusion: OPT effectively mitigates value estimation issues in offline-to-online RL, enhancing fine-tuning performance.

Abstract: Offline-to-online reinforcement learning (RL) aims to integrate the
complementary strengths of offline and online RL by pre-training an agent
offline and subsequently fine-tuning it through online interactions. However,
recent studies reveal that offline pre-trained agents often underperform during
online fine-tuning due to inaccurate value estimation caused by distribution
shift, with random initialization proving more effective in certain cases. In
this work, we propose a novel method, Online Pre-Training for Offline-to-Online
RL (OPT), explicitly designed to address the issue of inaccurate value
estimation in offline pre-trained agents. OPT introduces a new learning phase,
Online Pre-Training, which allows the training of a new value function tailored
specifically for effective online fine-tuning. Implementation of OPT on TD3 and
SPOT demonstrates an average 30% improvement in performance across a wide range
of D4RL environments, including MuJoCo, Antmaze, and Adroit.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel inference-time scaling method using particle Gibbs sampling for discrete diffusion models improves reward-guided text generation by refining multiple trajectories iteratively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inference-time scaling in discrete diffusion models is under-explored, limiting their performance in reward-guided settings.

Method: Introduces particle Gibbs sampling with conditional Sequential Monte Carlo to refine diffusion trajectories iteratively, optimizing for reward-weighted distributions.

Result: Outperforms prior methods in reward-guided text generation, achieving higher accuracy under fixed compute budgets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses inference-time scaling challenges, enhancing discrete diffusion models' performance in reward-guided tasks.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for language
modeling, rivaling auto-regressive models by training-time scaling. However,
inference-time scaling in discrete diffusion models remains relatively
under-explored. In this work, we study sampling-based approaches for achieving
high-quality text generation from discrete diffusion models in reward-guided
settings. We introduce a novel inference-time scaling approach based on
particle Gibbs sampling for discrete diffusion models. The particle Gibbs
sampling algorithm iteratively refines full diffusion trajectories using
conditional Sequential Monte Carlo as its transition mechanism. This process
ensures that the updated samples progressively improve and move closer to the
reward-weighted target distribution. Unlike existing inference-time scaling
methods, which are often limited to single diffusion trajectories, our approach
leverages iterative refinement across multiple trajectories. Within this
framework, we further analyze the trade-offs between four key axes for
inference-time scaling under fixed compute budgets: particle Gibbs iterations,
particle count, denoising steps, and reward estimation cost. Empirically, our
method consistently outperforms prior inference-time strategies on
reward-guided text generation tasks, achieving significant improvement in
accuracy under varying compute budgets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RTNinja is an automated machine learning framework for analyzing random telegraph noise (RTN) signals without prior knowledge, outperforming conventional methods in accuracy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RTN variability in nanoelectronics affects reliability and performance, but existing analysis methods are limited by assumptions and manual steps.

Method: RTNinja uses Bayesian inference (LevelsExtractor) and probabilistic clustering (SourcesMapper) to deconvolve RTN signals and identify hidden sources.

Result: Tested on 7000 datasets, RTNinja achieved high-fidelity signal reconstruction and accurate source characterization.

Conclusion: RTNinja is a robust, scalable tool for RTN analysis, useful for benchmarking, reliability qualification, and device physics research.

Abstract: Random telegraph noise is a prevalent variability phenomenon in
nanoelectronic devices, arising from stochastic carrier exchange at defect
sites and critically impacting device reliability and performance. Conventional
analysis techniques often rely on restrictive assumptions or manual
interventions, limiting their applicability to complex, noisy datasets. Here,
we introduce RTNinja, a generalized, fully automated machine learning framework
for the unsupervised analysis of random telegraph noise signals. RTNinja
deconvolves complex signals to identify the number and characteristics of
hidden individual sources, without requiring prior knowledge of the system. The
framework comprises two modular components: LevelsExtractor, which uses
Bayesian inference and model selection to denoise and discretize the signal;
and SourcesMapper, which infers source configurations through probabilistic
clustering and optimization. To evaluate performance, we developed a Monte
Carlo simulator that generates labeled datasets spanning broad signal-to-noise
ratios and source complexities; across 7000 such datasets, RTNinja consistently
demonstrated high-fidelity signal reconstruction and accurate extraction of
source amplitudes and activity patterns. Our results demonstrate that RTNinja
offers a robust, scalable, and device-agnostic tool for random telegraph noise
characterization, enabling large-scale statistical benchmarking,
reliability-centric technology qualification, predictive failure modeling, and
device physics exploration in next-generation nanoelectronics.

TL;DR: KGRAG-Ex enhances RAG by using a domain-specific KG for structured, explainable retrieval and reasoning, improving factual grounding and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the explainability challenge in RAG systems by leveraging structured knowledge graphs for transparent retrieval and reasoning.

Method: Construct a domain-specific KG via prompt-based extraction, identify relevant entities/paths, transform them into pseudo-paragraphs, and use perturbation-based explanations.

Result: Experiments analyze system sensitivity to perturbations, graph component importance, semantic node types, and graph metrics' influence.

Conclusion: KGRAG-Ex improves factual grounding and explainability in RAG systems through structured KG integration and perturbation-based explanations.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances language models by grounding
responses in external information, yet explainability remains a critical
challenge, particularly when retrieval relies on unstructured text. Knowledge
graphs (KGs) offer a solution by introducing structured, semantically rich
representations of entities and their relationships, enabling transparent
retrieval paths and interpretable reasoning. In this work, we present KGRAG-Ex,
a RAG system that improves both factual grounding and explainability by
leveraging a domain-specific KG constructed via prompt-based information
extraction. Given a user query, KGRAG-Ex identifies relevant entities and
semantic paths in the graph, which are then transformed into pseudo-paragraphs:
natural language representations of graph substructures that guide corpus
retrieval. To improve interpretability and support reasoning transparency, we
incorporate perturbation-based explanation methods that assess the influence of
specific KG-derived components on the generated answers. We conduct a series of
experiments to analyze the sensitivity of the system to different perturbation
methods, the relationship between graph component importance and their
structural positions, the influence of semantic node types, and how graph
metrics correspond to the influence of components within the explanations
process.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new generalization error bound for MLPs, advocating variance reduction of empirical loss. It proposes RSS-MLP, using Rank Set Sampling (RSS) instead of Simple Random Sampling (SRS) in bagging, to further reduce variance. Theoretical and experimental results validate its effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance MLP's generalization ability by reducing the variance of empirical loss, addressing the high randomness in traditional bagging methods.

Method: Proposes RSS-MLP, replacing SRS with RSS in bagging to introduce ordered structure in training data, reducing variance of empirical loss.

Result: Theoretical and experimental results show RSS-MLP reduces variance more effectively than SRS, improving performance on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: RSS-MLP is effective and rational for enhancing MLP's generalization ability by reducing empirical loss variance.

Abstract: Multilayer perceptron (MLP), one of the most fundamental neural networks, is
extensively utilized for classification and regression tasks. In this paper, we
establish a new generalization error bound, which reveals how the variance of
empirical loss influences the generalization ability of the learning model.
Inspired by this learning bound, we advocate to reduce the variance of
empirical loss to enhance the ability of MLP. As is well-known, bagging is a
popular ensemble method to realize variance reduction. However, bagging
produces the base training data sets by the Simple Random Sampling (SRS)
method, which exhibits a high degree of randomness. To handle this issue, we
introduce an ordered structure in the training data set by Rank Set Sampling
(RSS) to further reduce the variance of loss and develop a RSS-MLP method.
Theoretical results show that the variance of empirical exponential loss and
the logistic loss estimated by RSS are smaller than those estimated by SRS,
respectively. To validate the performance of RSS-MLP, we conduct comparison
experiments on twelve benchmark data sets in terms of the two convex loss
functions under two fusion methods. Extensive experimental results and analysis
illustrate the effectiveness and rationality of the propose method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the most effective optimizer for reducing pre-training times and improving model performance in LLMs.

Method: Compared AdamW, Lion, and Sophia using two base architectures and single/multiple-epoch approaches, with hyperparameter tuning via Maximal Update Parametrization and proxy models.

Result: Sophia had lowest training/validation loss, Lion was fastest, and AdamW performed best in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Optimizer choice depends on priorities: Sophia for loss, Lion for speed, AdamW for downstream performance.

Abstract: Optimizers play a decisive role in reducing pre-training times for LLMs and
achieving better-performing models. In this study, we compare three major
variants: the de-facto standard AdamW, the simpler Lion, developed through an
evolutionary search, and the second-order optimizer Sophia. For better
generalization, we train with two different base architectures and use a
single- and a multiple-epoch approach while keeping the number of tokens
constant. Using the Maximal Update Parametrization and smaller proxy models, we
tune relevant hyperparameters separately for each combination of base
architecture and optimizer. We found that while the results from all three
optimizers were in approximately the same range, Sophia exhibited the lowest
training and validation loss, Lion was fastest in terms of training GPU hours
but AdamW led to the best downstream evaluation results.

*Gonçalo Paulo,Nora Belrose*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to evaluate the interpretability of sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and transcoders without relying on natural language explanations, aiming for a more direct and standardized assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for evaluating interpretability in SAEs and transcoders rely on natural language explanations, which complicates the process and may not directly measure latent interpretability.

Method: The authors adapt existing methods to assess interpretability without generating explanations, comparing their metrics with human evaluations across tasks.

Result: The proposed metrics provide a more direct and potentially standardized way to evaluate interpretability, aligning with human judgments in various setups.

Conclusion: The work suggests improvements for evaluating interpretability in sparse coders, advocating for methods that bypass natural language explanations.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and transcoders have become important tools for
machine learning interpretability. However, measuring how interpretable they
are remains challenging, with weak consensus about which benchmarks to use.
Most evaluation procedures start by producing a single-sentence explanation for
each latent. These explanations are then evaluated based on how well they
enable an LLM to predict the activation of a latent in new contexts. This
method makes it difficult to disentangle the explanation generation and
evaluation process from the actual interpretability of the latents discovered.
In this work, we adapt existing methods to assess the interpretability of
sparse coders, with the advantage that they do not require generating natural
language explanations as an intermediate step. This enables a more direct and
potentially standardized assessment of interpretability. Furthermore, we
compare the scores produced by our interpretability metrics with human
evaluations across similar tasks and varying setups, offering suggestions for
the community on improving the evaluation of these techniques.

TL;DR: SynBridge is a bidirectional flow-based generative model for multi-task reaction prediction, achieving state-of-the-art performance in forward and retrosynthesis tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chemical reactions involve discrete electron redistribution, which is challenging to model. SynBridge aims to capture these abrupt changes in bond and atom states.

Method: Uses a graph-to-graph transformer and discrete flow bridges to model bidirectional transformations between reactants and products.

Result: Achieves top performance on USPTO-50K, USPTO-MIT, and Pistachio datasets. Structured diffusion over discrete spaces proves beneficial.

Conclusion: SynBridge effectively models chemical reactions, demonstrating the advantages of discrete-space diffusion for reaction prediction.

Abstract: The essence of a chemical reaction lies in the redistribution and
reorganization of electrons, which is often manifested through electron
transfer or the migration of electron pairs. These changes are inherently
discrete and abrupt in the physical world, such as alterations in the charge
states of atoms or the formation and breaking of chemical bonds. To model the
transition of states, we propose SynBridge, a bidirectional flow-based
generative model to achieve multi-task reaction prediction. By leveraging a
graph-to-graph transformer network architecture and discrete flow bridges
between any two discrete distributions, SynBridge captures bidirectional
chemical transformations between graphs of reactants and products through the
bonds' and atoms' discrete states. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(USPTO-50K, USPTO-MIT, Pistachio), achieving state-of-the-art performance in
both forward and retrosynthesis tasks. Our ablation studies and noise
scheduling analysis reveal the benefits of structured diffusion over discrete
spaces for reaction prediction.

TL;DR: A survey of deployment frameworks for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on mobile devices reveals performance bottlenecks, including CPU overuse and inefficient GPU/NPU utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational and energy inefficiency challenges in deploying VLMs on mobile devices for real-time applications.

Method: Evaluated frameworks (llama.cpp, MLC-Imp, mllm) using LLaVA-1.5 7B, MobileVLM-3B, and Imp-v1.5 3B on a OnePlus 13R, measuring hardware utilization, power, and user experience.

Result: CPU overuse during token generation, GPU/NPU underutilization, and degraded responsiveness when GPU was used for image feature extraction.

Conclusion: Current frameworks struggle with hardware efficiency, highlighting the need for better CPU, GPU, and NPU utilization in VLM deployment.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer promising capabilities for mobile
devices, but their deployment faces significant challenges due to computational
limitations and energy inefficiency, especially for real-time applications.
This study provides a comprehensive survey of deployment frameworks for VLMs on
mobile devices, evaluating llama.cpp, MLC-Imp, and mllm in the context of
running LLaVA-1.5 7B, MobileVLM-3B, and Imp-v1.5 3B as representative workloads
on a OnePlus 13R. Each deployment framework was evaluated on the OnePlus 13R
while running VLMs, with measurements covering CPU, GPU, and NPU utilization,
temperature, inference time, power consumption, and user experience.
Benchmarking revealed critical performance bottlenecks across frameworks: CPU
resources were consistently over-utilized during token generation, while GPU
and NPU accelerators were largely unused. When the GPU was used, primarily for
image feature extraction, it was saturated, leading to degraded device
responsiveness. The study contributes framework-level benchmarks, practical
profiling tools, and an in-depth analysis of hardware utilization bottlenecks,
highlighting the consistent overuse of CPUs and the ineffective or unstable use
of GPUs and NPUs in current deployment frameworks.

*Haotian Xu,Jinrui Zhou,Xichong Zhang,Mingjun Xiao,He Sun,Yin Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SFedKD is a Sequential Federated Learning framework using multi-teacher knowledge distillation to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in heterogeneous environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SFL suffers from severe catastrophic forgetting in heterogeneous settings, leading to loss of previously learned knowledge.

Method: SFedKD extends single-teacher knowledge distillation to a multi-teacher setting, using discrepancy-aware weighting and a complementary-based teacher selection mechanism.

Result: SFedKD effectively overcomes catastrophic forgetting and outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods.

Conclusion: SFedKD enhances training efficacy and mitigates forgetting in SFL, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm which
coordinates multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model via a
central server. Sequential Federated Learning (SFL) is a newly-emerging FL
training framework where the global model is trained in a sequential manner
across clients. Since SFL can provide strong convergence guarantees under data
heterogeneity, it has attracted significant research attention in recent years.
However, experiments show that SFL suffers from severe catastrophic forgetting
in heterogeneous environments, meaning that the model tends to forget knowledge
learned from previous clients. To address this issue, we propose an SFL
framework with discrepancy-aware multi-teacher knowledge distillation, called
SFedKD, which selects multiple models from the previous round to guide the
current round of training. In SFedKD, we extend the single-teacher Decoupled
Knowledge Distillation approach to our multi-teacher setting and assign
distinct weights to teachers' target-class and non-target-class knowledge based
on the class distributional discrepancy between teacher and student data.
Through this fine-grained weighting strategy, SFedKD can enhance model training
efficacy while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, to prevent
knowledge dilution, we eliminate redundant teachers for the knowledge
distillation and formalize it as a variant of the maximum coverage problem.
Based on the greedy strategy, we design a complementary-based teacher selection
mechanism to ensure that the selected teachers achieve comprehensive knowledge
space coverage while reducing communication and computational costs. Extensive
experiments show that SFedKD effectively overcomes catastrophic forgetting in
SFL and outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods.

*Yuting Tang,Yivan Zhang,Johannes Ackermann,Yu-Jie Zhang,Soichiro Nishimori,Masashi Sugiyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an alternative RL method for behavior alignment without modifying reward functions, using reward aggregation functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning agent behavior with complex objectives in RL is challenging due to reward function design.

Method: Introduces an algebraic perspective on MDPs, generalizing reward aggregation (e.g., discounted max, Sharpe ratio).

Result: Effectively optimizes diverse objectives in deterministic and stochastic settings.

Conclusion: Versatile approach with potential for real-world RL applications.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), aligning agent behavior with specific
objectives typically requires careful design of the reward function, which can
be challenging when the desired objectives are complex. In this work, we
propose an alternative approach for flexible behavior alignment that eliminates
the need to modify the reward function by selecting appropriate reward
aggregation functions. By introducing an algebraic perspective on Markov
decision processes (MDPs), we show that the Bellman equations naturally emerge
from the recursive generation and aggregation of rewards, allowing for the
generalization of the standard discounted sum to other recursive aggregations,
such as discounted max and Sharpe ratio. Our approach applies to both
deterministic and stochastic settings and integrates seamlessly with
value-based and actor-critic algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach effectively optimizes diverse objectives, highlighting its
versatility and potential for real-world applications.

*Tianyou Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep learning framework, CircFormerMoE, is proposed to predict plant circRNAs directly from genomic DNA, addressing limitations of current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current circRNA identification methods are inefficient, computationally costly, and rely on RNA-seq data, lacking generalization for plants where splice sites differ.

Method: CircFormerMoE uses transformers and mixture-of-experts for splicing site detection and pairing, validated on 10 plant species.

Result: The model accurately predicts circRNAs, including unannotated ones, and provides interpretable sequence patterns.

Conclusion: CircFormerMoE offers a fast, accurate tool for large-scale plant circRNA discovery, advancing plant genomics research.

Abstract: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are important components of the non-coding RNA
regulatory network. Previous circRNA identification primarily relies on
high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data combined with alignment-based
algorithms that detect back-splicing signals. However, these methods face
several limitations: they can't predict circRNAs directly from genomic DNA
sequences and relies heavily on RNA experimental data; they involve high
computational costs due to complex alignment and filtering steps; and they are
inefficient for large-scale or genome-wide circRNA prediction. The challenge is
even greater in plants, where plant circRNA splice sites often lack the
canonical GT-AG motif seen in human mRNA splicing, and no efficient deep
learning model with strong generalization capability currently exists.
Furthermore, the number of currently identified plant circRNAs is likely far
lower than their true abundance. In this paper, we propose a deep learning
framework named CircFormerMoE based on transformers and mixture-of experts for
predicting circRNAs directly from plant genomic DNA. Our framework consists of
two subtasks known as splicing site detection (SSD) and splicing site pairing
(SSP). The model's effectiveness has been validated on gene data of 10 plant
species. Trained on known circRNA instances, it is also capable of discovering
previously unannotated circRNAs. In addition, we performed interpretability
analyses on the trained model to investigate the sequence patterns contributing
to its predictions. Our framework provides a fast and accurate computational
method and tool for large-scale circRNA discovery in plants, laying a
foundation for future research in plant functional genomics and non-coding RNA
annotation.

*Xinyi Ning,Zilin Bian,Kaan Ozbay,Semiha Ergan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel spatial-temporal risk-attentive framework improves vehicle trajectory prediction by incorporating risk potential fields, reducing errors by 4.8% (NGSIM) and 31.2% (HighD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook uncertain or aggressive behaviors of surrounding vehicles, risking safety in autonomous driving.

Method: Uses a spatial-temporal encoder and risk-attentive decoder to integrate risk potential fields into trajectory predictions, with a risk-scaled loss function.

Result: Reduces prediction errors by 4.8% (NGSIM) and 31.2% (HighD), especially in high-risk scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework offers interpretable, risk-aware predictions, enhancing decision-making for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Accurate vehicle trajectory prediction is essential for ensuring safety and
efficiency in fully autonomous driving systems. While existing methods
primarily focus on modeling observed motion patterns and interactions with
other vehicles, they often neglect the potential risks posed by the uncertain
or aggressive behaviors of surrounding vehicles. In this paper, we propose a
novel spatial-temporal risk-attentive trajectory prediction framework that
incorporates a risk potential field to assess perceived risks arising from
behaviors of nearby vehicles. The framework leverages a spatial-temporal
encoder and a risk-attentive feature fusion decoder to embed the risk potential
field into the extracted spatial-temporal feature representations for
trajectory prediction. A risk-scaled loss function is further designed to
improve the prediction accuracy of high-risk scenarios, such as short relative
spacing. Experiments on the widely used NGSIM and HighD datasets demonstrate
that our method reduces average prediction errors by 4.8% and 31.2%
respectively compared to state-of-the-art approaches, especially in high-risk
scenarios. The proposed framework provides interpretable, risk-aware
predictions, contributing to more robust decision-making for autonomous driving
systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AbbIE is a recursive Transformer variant improving perplexity and dynamic compute scaling, outperforming standard and iterative methods in zero-shot tasks and perplexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance Transformer performance without relying on parameter or token count scaling, and enable dynamic compute adjustment.

Method: Recursive generalization of encoder-only Transformers, operating in latent space without specialized datasets or training.

Result: 12% better zero-shot learning and 5% perplexity improvement, with upward generalization using only 2 training iterations.

Conclusion: AbbIE offers a new approach to scaling Transformer performance, validated up to 350M parameters.

Abstract: We introduce the Autoregressive Block-Based Iterative Encoder (AbbIE), a
novel recursive generalization of the encoder-only Transformer architecture,
which achieves better perplexity than a standard Transformer and allows for the
dynamic scaling of compute resources at test time. This simple, recursive
approach is a complement to scaling large language model (LLM) performance
through parameter and token counts. AbbIE performs its iterations in latent
space, but unlike latent reasoning models, does not require a specialized
dataset or training protocol. We show that AbbIE upward generalizes (ability to
generalize to arbitrary iteration lengths) at test time by only using 2
iterations during train time, far outperforming alternative iterative methods.
AbbIE's ability to scale its computational expenditure based on the complexity
of the task gives it an up to \textbf{12\%} improvement in zero-shot in-context
learning tasks versus other iterative and standard methods and up to 5\%
improvement in language perplexity. The results from this study open a new
avenue to Transformer performance scaling. We perform all of our evaluations on
model sizes up to 350M parameters.

TL;DR: ADAPT, a pseudo-labeling semi-supervised algorithm, addresses concept drift in malware detection by leveraging unlabeled data, outperforming baselines across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models for malware classification degrade over time due to concept drift, requiring costly updates. Semi-supervised learning is underexplored for this challenge.

Method: ADAPT is a model-agnostic pseudo-labeling semi-supervised algorithm applicable to various ML models, tested on five malware datasets.

Result: ADAPT consistently outperforms baseline models and benchmarks across Android, Windows, and PDF malware datasets.

Conclusion: ADAPT enables more effective adaptation to concept drift in malware detection, reducing reliance on costly annotations.

Abstract: Machine learning models are commonly used for malware classification;
however, they suffer from performance degradation over time due to concept
drift. Adapting these models to changing data distributions requires frequent
updates, which rely on costly ground truth annotations. While active learning
can reduce the annotation burden, leveraging unlabeled data through
semi-supervised learning remains a relatively underexplored approach in the
context of malware detection. In this research, we introduce \texttt{ADAPT}, a
novel pseudo-labeling semi-supervised algorithm for addressing concept drift.
Our model-agnostic method can be applied to various machine learning models,
including neural networks and tree-based algorithms. We conduct extensive
experiments on five diverse malware detection datasets spanning Android,
Windows, and PDF domains. The results demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms baseline models and competitive benchmarks. This work paves the way
for more effective adaptation of machine learning models to concept drift in
malware detection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A remote sensing framework monitors sustainable rice irrigation practices (DSR and AWD) in Punjab, India, achieving 78% accuracy in distinguishing DSR from traditional methods. It aids policymakers in tracking adoption and targeting interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rice cultivation consumes significant freshwater, and sustainable practices like DSR and AWD can reduce water use. However, limited adoption data hinders policymaking.

Method: Developed a remote sensing framework using Sentinel-1 satellite imagery and ground truth data from farmer training programs to classify water management practices.

Result: Achieved 78% F1-score in distinguishing DSR, mapped adoption across 3 million plots, and showed strong correlation with government records.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable tool for policymakers to monitor sustainable practices and allocate resources effectively.

Abstract: Rice cultivation consumes 24-30% of global freshwater, creating critical
water management challenges in major rice-producing regions. Sustainable
irrigation practices like direct seeded rice (DSR) and alternate wetting and
drying (AWD) can reduce water use by 20-40% while maintaining yields, helping
secure long-term agricultural productivity as water scarcity intensifies - a
key component of the Zero Hunger Sustainable Development Goal. However, limited
data on adoption rates of these practices prevents evidence-based policymaking
and targeted resource allocation. We developed a novel remote sensing framework
to monitor sustainable water management practices at scale in Punjab, India - a
region facing severe groundwater depletion of 41.6 cm/year. To collect
essential ground truth data, we partnered with the Nature Conservancy's
Promoting Regenerative and No-burn Agriculture (PRANA) program, which trained
approximately 1,400 farmers on water-saving techniques while documenting their
field-level practices. Using this data, we created a classification system with
Sentinel-1 satellite imagery that separates water management along sowing and
irrigation dimensions. Our approach achieved a 78% F1-score in distinguishing
DSR from traditional puddled transplanted rice without requiring prior
knowledge of planting dates. We demonstrated scalability by mapping DSR
adoption across approximately 3 million agricultural plots in Punjab, with
district-level predictions showing strong correlation (Pearson=0.77, RBO= 0.77)
with government records. This study provides policymakers with a powerful tool
to track sustainable water management adoption, target interventions, and
measure program impacts at scale.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoGIC, a multi-agent reinforcement learning game, improves unsupervised image captioning by leveraging pre-trained VLMs and LLMs, achieving a 46 BLEU score, and lightweight components for a 31 BLEU score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing labelled datasets are exhausted for training VLMs, making unsupervised image captioning essential for performance improvement.

Method: Proposes LoGIC, a game with 'speaker' and 'listener' agents trained using GRPO, leveraging pre-trained VLMs and LLMs, and lightweight components (ViT and GPT2).

Result: Achieved 46 BLEU with pre-trained models (2 points over vanilla VLM) and 31 BLEU with lightweight components (10 points over existing methods).

Conclusion: LoGIC effectively improves unsupervised image captioning, demonstrating the potential of multi-agent reinforcement learning in this domain.

Abstract: Image captioning is an important problem in developing various AI systems,
and these tasks require large volumes of annotated images to train the models.
Since all existing labelled datasets are already used for training the large
Vision Language Models (VLMs), it becomes challenging to improve the
performance of the same. Considering this, it is essential to consider the
unsupervised image captioning performance, which remains relatively
under-explored. To that end, we propose LoGIC (Lewis Communication Game for
Image Captioning), a Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning game. The proposed
method consists of two agents, a 'speaker' and a 'listener', with the objective
of learning a strategy for communicating in natural language. We train agents
in the cooperative common-reward setting using the GRPO algorithm and show that
improvement in image captioning performance emerges as a consequence of the
agents learning to play the game. We show that using pre-trained VLMs as the
'speaker' and Large Language Model (LLM) for language understanding in the
'listener', we achieved a $46$ BLEU score after fine-tuning using LoGIC without
additional labels, a $2$ units advantage in absolute metrics compared to the
$44$ BLEU score of the vanilla VLM. Additionally, we replace the VLM from the
'speaker' with lightweight components: (i) a ViT for image perception and (ii)
a GPT2 language generation, and train them from scratch using LoGIC, obtaining
a $31$ BLEU score in the unsupervised setting, a $10$ points advantage over
existing unsupervised image-captioning methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedAKD addresses collaborative fairness in federated learning under imbalanced covariate shift by using asynchronous knowledge distillation, improving accuracy and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook imbalanced covariate shift, a key challenge in federated learning, leading to unfair collaboration.

Method: FedAKD uses client updates with asynchronous knowledge distillation and server updates via aggregation, leveraging correctly predicted samples.

Result: FedAKD improves fairness, accuracy, and client participation on datasets like FashionMNIST, CIFAR10, and EHR.

Conclusion: FedAKD effectively balances fairness and accuracy in federated learning, even with heterogeneous data.

Abstract: Collaborative fairness is a crucial challenge in federated learning. However,
existing approaches often overlook a practical yet complex form of
heterogeneity: imbalanced covariate shift. We provide a theoretical analysis of
this setting, which motivates the design of FedAKD (Federated Asynchronous
Knowledge Distillation)- simple yet effective approach that balances accurate
prediction with collaborative fairness. FedAKD consists of client and server
updates. In the client update, we introduce a novel asynchronous knowledge
distillation strategy based on our preliminary analysis, which reveals that
while correctly predicted samples exhibit similar feature distributions across
clients, incorrectly predicted samples show significant variability. This
suggests that imbalanced covariate shift primarily arises from misclassified
samples. Leveraging this insight, our approach first applies traditional
knowledge distillation to update client models while keeping the global model
fixed. Next, we select correctly predicted high-confidence samples and update
the global model using these samples while keeping client models fixed. The
server update simply aggregates all client models. We further provide a
theoretical proof of FedAKD's convergence. Experimental results on public
datasets (FashionMNIST and CIFAR10) and a real-world Electronic Health Records
(EHR) dataset demonstrate that FedAKD significantly improves collaborative
fairness, enhances predictive accuracy, and fosters client participation even
under highly heterogeneous data distributions.

*Vincenzo Dentamaro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WERSA introduces a linear-time attention mechanism for efficient long-sequence processing, outperforming other methods in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational inefficiency of quadratic-time attention in Transformer models for long sequences.

Method: Combines content-adaptive random spectral features, multi-resolution Haar wavelets, and learnable parameters for selective attention.

Result: Achieves best accuracy across benchmarks, reduces training time by 81%, and cuts FLOPS by 73.4%. Excels on extremely long sequences where others fail.

Conclusion: WERSA enables practical, affordable long-context models, especially for low-resource hardware, promoting sustainable AI development.

Abstract: Transformer models are computationally costly on long sequences since regular
attention has quadratic $O(n^2)$ time complexity. We introduce Wavelet-Enhanced
Random Spectral Attention (WERSA), a novel mechanism of linear $O(n)$ time
complexity that is pivotal to enable successful long-sequence processing
without the performance trade-off. WERSA merges content-adaptive random
spectral features together with multi-resolution Haar wavelets and learnable
parameters to selectively attend to informative scales of data while preserving
linear efficiency.
  Large-scale comparisons \textbf{on single GPU} and across various benchmarks
(vision, NLP, hierarchical reasoning) and various attention mechanisms (like
Multiheaded Attention, Flash-Attention-2, FNet, Linformer, Performer,
Waveformer), reveal uniform advantages of WERSA. It achieves best accuracy in
all tests. On ArXiv classification, WERSA improves accuracy over vanilla
attention by 1.2\% (86.2\% vs 85.0\%) while cutting training time by 81\% (296s
vs 1554s) and FLOPS by 73.4\% (26.2G vs 98.4G). Significantly, WERSA excels
where vanilla and FlashAttention-2 fail: on ArXiv-128k's extremely lengthy
sequences, it achieves best accuracy (79.1\%) and AUC (0.979) among viable
methods, operating on data that gives Out-Of-Memory errors to quadratic methods
while being \textbf{twice as fast} as Waveformer, its next-best competitor.
  By significantly reducing computational loads without compromising accuracy,
WERSA makes possible more practical, more affordable, long-context models, in
particular on low-resource hardware, for more sustainable and more scalable AI
development.

*Uri Stern,Eli Corn,Daphna Weinshall*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel score to measure local overfitting in deep neural networks, linking it to the double descent phenomenon, and proposes a two-stage method to recover forgotten knowledge, improving performance without added inference cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite theory predicting overfitting with increased model capacity, it rarely occurs globally. The paper explores local overfitting in specific data sub-regions and aims to address it.

Method: A two-stage approach: (1) aggregating checkpoints into an ensemble, and (2) distilling it into a single model of original size. This leverages training history to recover forgotten knowledge.

Result: The method outperforms original models and independently trained ensembles, especially under label noise, reducing training and inference complexity.

Conclusion: Local overfitting is a significant issue, and the proposed approach effectively mitigates it, offering a win-win solution for performance and complexity.

Abstract: Overfitting in deep neural networks occurs less frequently than expected.
This is a puzzling observation, as theory predicts that greater model capacity
should eventually lead to overfitting -- yet this is rarely seen in practice.
But what if overfitting does occur, not globally, but in specific sub-regions
of the data space? In this work, we introduce a novel score that measures the
forgetting rate of deep models on validation data, capturing what we term local
overfitting: a performance degradation confined to certain regions of the input
space. We demonstrate that local overfitting can arise even without
conventional overfitting, and is closely linked to the double descent
phenomenon.
  Building on these insights, we introduce a two-stage approach that leverages
the training history of a single model to recover and retain forgotten
knowledge: first, by aggregating checkpoints into an ensemble, and then by
distilling it into a single model of the original size, thus enhancing
performance without added inference cost.
  Extensive experiments across multiple datasets, modern architectures, and
training regimes validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, in the
presence of label noise, our method -- Knowledge Fusion followed by Knowledge
Distillation -- outperforms both the original model and independently trained
ensembles, achieving a rare win-win scenario: reduced training and inference
complexity.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MAD-OPT, a framework combining Mahalanobis distance and domain knowledge to optimize thermal efficiency and turbine heat rate in gas turbines, showing robust and implementable solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low adoption of AI in thermal power plants due to lack of domain knowledge in data-centric methods.

Method: Developed MAD-OPT framework with Mahalanobis distance-based constraints for domain-informed optimization.

Result: MAD-OPT successfully estimates optimal process conditions, validated by Monte Carlo simulations and real plant data.

Conclusion: Incorporating domain knowledge in AI analytics improves operational excellence and safe AI adoption in power systems.

Abstract: The domain-consistent adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) remains low in
thermal power plants due to the black-box nature of AI algorithms and low
representation of domain knowledge in conventional data-centric analytics. In
this paper, we develop a MAhalanobis Distance-based OPTimization (MAD-OPT)
framework that incorporates the Mahalanobis distance-based constraint to
introduce domain knowledge into data-centric analytics. The developed MAD-OPT
framework is applied to maximize thermal efficiency and minimize turbine heat
rate for a 395 MW capacity gas turbine system. We demonstrate that the MAD-OPT
framework can estimate domain-informed optimal process conditions under
different ambient conditions, and the optimal solutions are found to be robust
as evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations. We also apply the MAD-OPT framework to
estimate optimal process conditions beyond the design power generation limit of
the gas turbine system, and have found comparable results with the actual data
of the power plant. We demonstrate that implementing data-centric optimization
analytics without incorporating domain-informed constraints may provide
ineffective solutions that may not be implementable in the real operation of
the gas turbine system. This research advances the integration of the
data-driven domain knowledge into machine learning-powered analytics that
enhances the domain-informed operation excellence and paves the way for safe AI
adoption in thermal power systems.

TL;DR: SPLASH improves IRL for long-horizon adversarial tasks using suboptimal hierarchical demonstrations, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IRL methods assume expert demonstrations or fail in long-horizon/adversarial tasks, limiting real-world robotic applications.

Method: SPLASH uses sample-efficient preference-based IRL and hierarchical demonstrations for long-horizon adversarial tasks, validated in simulation and real-world experiments.

Result: SPLASH outperforms state-of-the-art in reward learning from suboptimal demonstrations, demonstrated in maritime tasks and sim-to-real translation.

Conclusion: SPLASH addresses critical IRL limitations, enabling robust learning from suboptimal demonstrations for complex robotic tasks.

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) presents a powerful paradigm for
learning complex robotic tasks from human demonstrations. However, most
approaches make the assumption that expert demonstrations are available, which
is often not the case. Those that allow for suboptimality in the demonstrations
are not designed for long-horizon goals or adversarial tasks. Many desirable
robot capabilities fall into one or both of these categories, thus highlighting
a critical shortcoming in the ability of IRL to produce field-ready robotic
agents. We introduce Sample-efficient Preference-based inverse reinforcement
learning for Long-horizon Adversarial tasks from Suboptimal Hierarchical
demonstrations (SPLASH), which advances the state-of-the-art in learning from
suboptimal demonstrations to long-horizon and adversarial settings. We
empirically validate SPLASH on a maritime capture-the-flag task in simulation,
and demonstrate real-world applicability with sim-to-real translation
experiments on autonomous unmanned surface vehicles. We show that our proposed
methods allow SPLASH to significantly outperform the state-of-the-art in reward
learning from suboptimal demonstrations.

*Jan Felix Kleuker,Aske Plaat,Thomas Moerland*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PMD links policy gradient methods with mirror descent, using two regularizers for stable updates and robustness. Empirical analysis shows their combination is critical for performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To empirically investigate the interplay between the two regularization components in PMD, which has been theoretically studied but lacks empirical validation.

Method: Large-scale empirical analysis with over 500k training seeds on small RL environments, testing combinations of the two regularizers.

Result: The two regularizers can partially substitute each other, but their precise combination is crucial for robust performance.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the importance of combining regularizers in PMD for robustness and suggest directions for future research on hyperparameter sensitivity.

Abstract: Policy Mirror Descent (PMD) has emerged as a unifying framework in
reinforcement learning (RL) by linking policy gradient methods with a
first-order optimization method known as mirror descent. At its core, PMD
incorporates two key regularization components: (i) a distance term that
enforces a trust region for stable policy updates and (ii) an MDP regularizer
that augments the reward function to promote structure and robustness. While
PMD has been extensively studied in theory, empirical investigations remain
scarce. This work provides a large-scale empirical analysis of the interplay
between these two regularization techniques, running over 500k training seeds
on small RL environments. Our results demonstrate that, although the two
regularizers can partially substitute each other, their precise combination is
critical for achieving robust performance. These findings highlight the
potential for advancing research on more robust algorithms in RL, particularly

*Mona Schirmer,Metod Jazbec,Christian A. Naesseth,Eric Nalisnick*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes pairing test-time adaptation (TTA) with risk monitoring to detect model degradation, extending sequential testing tools for unlabeled test data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test-time adaptation (TTA) is a temporary solution for shifted data, but models eventually degrade. Monitoring is needed to detect failure points.

Method: Extends sequential testing with confidence sequences to monitor performance without labeled test data, adapting to model updates.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness across datasets, shift types, and TTA methods.

Conclusion: Combining TTA with risk monitoring provides a rigorous solution for detecting model failure in real-world deployments.

Abstract: Encountering shifted data at test time is a ubiquitous challenge when
deploying predictive models. Test-time adaptation (TTA) methods address this
issue by continuously adapting a deployed model using only unlabeled test data.
While TTA can extend the model's lifespan, it is only a temporary solution.
Eventually the model might degrade to the point that it must be taken offline
and retrained. To detect such points of ultimate failure, we propose pairing
TTA with risk monitoring frameworks that track predictive performance and raise
alerts when predefined performance criteria are violated. Specifically, we
extend existing monitoring tools based on sequential testing with confidence
sequences to accommodate scenarios in which the model is updated at test time
and no test labels are available to estimate the performance metrics of
interest. Our extensions unlock the application of rigorous statistical risk
monitoring to TTA, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed TTA
monitoring framework across a representative set of datasets, distribution
shift types, and TTA methods.

*Idan Mashiach,Oren Glickman,Tom Tirer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes tracking parameters during the final training plateau to mitigate catastrophic forgetting by identifying flat loss landscape directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses catastrophic forgetting in deep neural networks by focusing on parameter activity during the final training phase.

Method: Tracks parameters during the final training plateau to identify flat loss landscape directions for adaptation.

Result: Superior performance in balancing forgetting mitigation and new task performance.

Conclusion: Monitoring final plateau parameters is effective for mitigating catastrophic forgetting while maintaining new task performance.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting in deep neural networks occurs when learning new
tasks degrades performance on previously learned tasks due to knowledge
overwriting. Among the approaches to mitigate this issue, regularization
techniques aim to identify and constrain "important" parameters to preserve
previous knowledge. In the highly nonconvex optimization landscape of deep
learning, we propose a novel perspective: tracking parameters during the final
training plateau is more effective than monitoring them throughout the entire
training process. We argue that parameters that exhibit higher activity
(movement and variability) during this plateau reveal directions in the loss
landscape that are relatively flat, making them suitable for adaptation to new
tasks while preserving knowledge from previous ones. Our comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves superior performance in
balancing catastrophic forgetting mitigation with strong performance on newly
learned tasks.

*Azimov Sherkhon,Susana Lopez-Moreno,Eric Dolores-Cuenca,Sieun Lee,Sangil Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An adaptive NVAR model combining delay-embedded linear inputs with a learnable MLP outperforms standard NVAR in chaotic system forecasting, especially under noise and low observation frequency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard NVAR and RC methods are limited by fixed nonlinearities and poor scalability in high-dimensional or noisy settings.

Method: Proposes an adaptive NVAR model with a shallow MLP for feature generation and joint training of MLP and linear readout via gradient-based optimization.

Result: Outperforms standard NVAR in predictive accuracy and robustness under noisy conditions with lower observation frequency.

Conclusion: The adaptive NVAR model offers improved adaptability and scalability, reducing reliance on exhaustive parameter tuning.

Abstract: Nonlinear vector autoregression (NVAR) and reservoir computing (RC) have
shown promise in forecasting chaotic dynamical systems, such as the Lorenz-63
model and El Nino-Southern Oscillation. However, their reliance on fixed
nonlinearities - polynomial expansions in NVAR or random feature maps in RC -
limits their adaptability to high noise or real-world data. These methods also
scale poorly in high-dimensional settings due to costly matrix inversion during
readout computation. We propose an adaptive NVAR model that combines
delay-embedded linear inputs with features generated by a shallow, learnable
multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The MLP and linear readout are jointly trained
using gradient-based optimization, enabling the model to learn data-driven
nonlinearities while preserving a simple readout structure. Unlike standard
NVAR, our approach avoids the need for an exhaustive and sensitive grid search
over ridge and delay parameters. Instead, tuning is restricted to neural
network hyperparameters, improving scalability. Initial experiments on chaotic
systems tested under noise-free and synthetically noisy conditions showed that
the adaptive model outperformed the standard NVAR in predictive accuracy and
showed robust forecasting under noisy conditions with a lower observation
frequency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PHQFNO is a hybrid quantum-classical extension of QFNO for scientific machine learning, showing competitive or superior performance to classical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize QFNO by enabling tunable quantum-classical hybridization and distributed execution, addressing limitations in classical scientific machine learning.

Method: Partitions Fourier operator computation between classical and quantum resources, uses unary encoding for quantum states, and optimizes parameters variationally. Evaluated on PDEs like Burgers' and Navier-Stokes equations.

Result: Matches classical FNO accuracy on Burgers' equation, outperforms classical methods on incompressible Navier-Stokes, and shows improved noise stability.

Conclusion: PHQFNO successfully integrates quantum and classical resources, demonstrating potential for enhanced performance in scientific machine learning.

Abstract: We introduce the Partitioned Hybrid Quantum Fourier Neural Operator (PHQFNO),
a generalization of the Quantum Fourier Neural Operator (QFNO) for scientific
machine learning. PHQFNO partitions the Fourier operator computation across
classical and quantum resources, enabling tunable quantum-classical
hybridization and distributed execution across quantum and classical devices.
The method extends QFNOs to higher dimensions and incorporates a
message-passing framework to distribute data across different partitions. Input
data are encoded into quantum states using unary encoding, and quantum circuit
parameters are optimized using a variational scheme. We implement PHQFNO using
PennyLane with PyTorch integration and evaluate it on Burgers' equation,
incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes equations. We show that PHQFNO
recovers classical FNO accuracy. On incompressible Navier-Stokes, PHQFNO
achieves higher accuracy than its classical counterparts. Finally, we perform a
sensitivity analysis under input noise, confirming improved stability of PHQFNO
over classical baselines.

TL;DR: A discrete-time conditional Gaussian Koopman network (CGKN) is developed for efficient state forecast and data assimilation in high-dimensional nonlinear systems, unifying scientific machine learning and DA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of modeling high-dimensional nonlinear systems, especially partially observed ones, by leveraging Koopman embedding for latent state representation.

Method: Uses Koopman embedding to create latent states with conditional linear dynamics, forming a conditional Gaussian system for efficient DA via analytical formulae.

Result: Demonstrates comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods in forecasting and provides accurate DA results for nonlinear PDEs.

Conclusion: CGKN unifies SciML and DA, offering a framework for broader applications like optimization and control.

Abstract: A discrete-time conditional Gaussian Koopman network (CGKN) is developed in
this work to learn surrogate models that can perform efficient state forecast
and data assimilation (DA) for high-dimensional complex dynamical systems,
e.g., systems governed by nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs).
Focusing on nonlinear partially observed systems that are common in many
engineering and earth science applications, this work exploits Koopman
embedding to discover a proper latent representation of the unobserved system
states, such that the dynamics of the latent states are conditional linear,
i.e., linear with the given observed system states. The modeled system of the
observed and latent states then becomes a conditional Gaussian system, for
which the posterior distribution of the latent states is Gaussian and can be
efficiently evaluated via analytical formulae. The analytical formulae of DA
facilitate the incorporation of DA performance into the learning process of the
modeled system, which leads to a framework that unifies scientific machine
learning (SciML) and data assimilation. The performance of discrete-time CGKN
is demonstrated on several canonical problems governed by nonlinear PDEs with
intermittency and turbulent features, including the viscous Burgers' equation,
the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and the 2-D Navier-Stokes equations, with
which we show that the discrete-time CGKN framework achieves comparable
performance as the state-of-the-art SciML methods in state forecast and
provides efficient and accurate DA results. The discrete-time CGKN framework
also serves as an example to illustrate unifying the development of SciML
models and their other outer-loop applications such as design optimization,
inverse problems, and optimal control.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoSlim is a machine learning-based framework that simplifies symbolic accelerators (NFAs) on FPGAs, reducing complexity and resource usage while maintaining correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symbolic accelerators face scalability issues due to memory use and routing complexity, especially for large datasets.

Method: AutoSlim uses Random Forest classification to prune low-impact transitions based on edge scores and structural features.

Result: Achieves 40% reduction in FPGA LUTs and 30% pruning in transitions, scaling to larger graphs than benchmarks.

Conclusion: AutoSlim effectively mitigates resource blowup and improves scalability for symbolic accelerators.

Abstract: Symbolic accelerators are increasingly used for symbolic data processing in
domains such as genomics, NLP, and cybersecurity. However, these accelerators
face scalability issues due to excessive memory use and routing complexity,
especially when targeting a large set. We present AutoSlim, a machine
learning-based graph simplification framework designed to reduce the complexity
of symbolic accelerators built on Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA)
deployed on FPGA-based overlays such as NAPOLY+. AutoSlim uses Random Forest
classification to prune low-impact transitions based on edge scores and
structural features, significantly reducing automata graph density while
preserving semantic correctness. Unlike prior tools, AutoSlim targets automated
score-aware simplification with weighted transitions, enabling efficient
ranking-based sequence analysis. We evaluated data sets (1K to 64K nodes) in
NAPOLY+ and conducted performance measurements including latency, throughput,
and resource usage. AutoSlim achieves up to 40 percent reduction in FPGA LUTs
and over 30 percent pruning in transitions, while scaling to graphs an order of
magnitude larger than existing benchmarks. Our results also demonstrate how
hardware interconnection (fanout) heavily influences hardware cost and that
AutoSlim's pruning mitigates resource blowup.

TL;DR: PARS algorithm mitigates Q-value extrapolation errors in offline reinforcement learning using RS-LN and PA, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing Q-value extrapolation errors in offline reinforcement learning due to linear extrapolation issues.

Method: Proposes RS-LN for reward scaling with layer normalization and PA for penalizing infeasible actions, combined into PARS.

Result: PARS excels in offline training and online fine-tuning on D4RL, especially in AntMaze Ultra.

Conclusion: PARS effectively reduces extrapolation errors and enhances performance in offline RL tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with offline data suffers from Q-value extrapolation
errors. To address this issue, we first demonstrate that linear extrapolation
of the Q-function beyond the data range is particularly problematic. To
mitigate this, we propose guiding the gradual decrease of Q-values outside the
data range, which is achieved through reward scaling with layer normalization
(RS-LN) and a penalization mechanism for infeasible actions (PA). By combining
RS-LN and PA, we develop a new algorithm called PARS. We evaluate PARS across a
range of tasks, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
algorithms in both offline training and online fine-tuning on the D4RL
benchmark, with notable success in the challenging AntMaze Ultra task.

TL;DR: BlockFFN introduces a novel MoE architecture with differentiable routing and CLS-aware training to improve sparsity and acceleration, outperforming baselines with 80% TLS and 70% CLS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inflexible routing and low chunk-level sparsity of vanilla MoE, hindering acceleration under low-resource conditions.

Method: Proposes BlockFFN with ReLU-RMSNorm routing, CLS-aware training, and efficient kernels combining sparsity and speculative decoding.

Result: Achieves 80% TLS, 70% 8-token CLS, and 3.67x speedup on end-side devices.

Conclusion: BlockFFN is a superior MoE architecture, enhancing performance and acceleration compatibility.

Abstract: To alleviate the computational burden of large language models (LLMs),
architectures with activation sparsity, represented by mixture-of-experts
(MoE), have attracted increasing attention. However, the non-differentiable and
inflexible routing of vanilla MoE hurts model performance. Moreover, while each
token activates only a few parameters, these sparsely-activated architectures
exhibit low chunk-level sparsity, indicating that the union of multiple
consecutive tokens activates a large ratio of parameters. Such a sparsity
pattern is unfriendly for acceleration under low-resource conditions (e.g.,
end-side devices) and incompatible with mainstream acceleration techniques
(e.g., speculative decoding). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
MoE architecture, BlockFFN, as well as its efficient training and deployment
techniques. Specifically, we use a router integrating ReLU activation and
RMSNorm for differentiable and flexible routing. Next, to promote both
token-level sparsity (TLS) and chunk-level sparsity (CLS), CLS-aware training
objectives are designed, making BlockFFN more acceleration-friendly. Finally,
we implement efficient acceleration kernels, combining activation sparsity and
speculative decoding for the first time. The experimental results demonstrate
the superior performance of BlockFFN over other MoE baselines, achieving over
80% TLS and 70% 8-token CLS. Our kernels achieve up to 3.67$\times$ speedup on
real end-side devices than dense models. All codes and checkpoints are
available publicly (https://github.com/thunlp/BlockFFN).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Distributed optimization is pivotal for large-scale signal processing and
machine learning, yet communication overhead remains a major bottleneck.
Low-rank gradient compression, in which the transmitted gradients are
approximated by low-rank matrices to reduce communication, offers a promising
remedy. Existing methods typically adopt either randomized or greedy
compression strategies: randomized approaches project gradients onto randomly
chosen subspaces, introducing high variance and degrading empirical
performance; greedy methods select the most informative subspaces, achieving
strong empirical results but lacking convergence guarantees. To address this
gap, we propose GreedyLore--the first Greedy Low-Rank gradient compression
algorithm for distributed learning with rigorous convergence guarantees.
GreedyLore incorporates error feedback to correct the bias introduced by greedy
compression and introduces a semi-lazy subspace update that ensures the
compression operator remains contractive throughout all iterations. With these
techniques, we prove that GreedyLore achieves a convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\sigma/\sqrt{NT} + 1/T)$ under standard optimizers such as MSGD
and Adam--marking the first linear speedup convergence rate for low-rank
gradient compression. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate our
theoretical findings.

*James McCarthy,Radu Marinescu,Elizabeth Daly,Ivana Dusparic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ORAC is an exploration-based method for RaCRL that balances reward maximization and risk-aversion by adjusting cost weights dynamically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Risk-aversion in RL often leads to overly conservative policies, hindering reward maximization and goal achievement.

Method: ORAC uses local confidence bounds for reward and cost functions, dynamically adjusting cost weights to encourage safe exploration.

Result: ORAC avoids sub-optimal policies and improves reward-cost trade-offs in tasks like Safety-Gymnasium and CityLearn.

Conclusion: ORAC effectively balances exploration and risk-aversion, enhancing performance in constrained RL tasks.

Abstract: Risk-averse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (RaCRL) aims to learn policies
that minimise the likelihood of rare and catastrophic constraint violations
caused by an environment's inherent randomness. In general, risk-aversion leads
to conservative exploration of the environment which typically results in
converging to sub-optimal policies that fail to adequately maximise reward or,
in some cases, fail to achieve the goal. In this paper, we propose an
exploration-based approach for RaCRL called Optimistic Risk-averse Actor Critic
(ORAC), which constructs an exploratory policy by maximising a local upper
confidence bound of the state-action reward value function whilst minimising a
local lower confidence bound of the risk-averse state-action cost value
function. Specifically, at each step, the weighting assigned to the cost value
is increased or decreased if it exceeds or falls below the safety constraint
value. This way the policy is encouraged to explore uncertain regions of the
environment to discover high reward states whilst still satisfying the safety
constraints. Our experimental results demonstrate that the ORAC approach
prevents convergence to sub-optimal policies and improves significantly the
reward-cost trade-off in various continuous control tasks such as
Safety-Gymnasium and a complex building energy management environment
CityLearn.

TL;DR: Generative reward models using LLMs for answer evaluation are vulnerable to superficial manipulations, leading to false positives. A data augmentation strategy improves robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address vulnerabilities in LLM-based reward models, which are widely used in RLVR and other paradigms, due to their susceptibility to non-word symbols and reasoning openers.

Method: Introduce a data augmentation strategy to train a more robust generative reward model.

Result: The new model shows improved robustness across LLMs, datasets, and prompt formats.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for reliable LLM-based evaluation methods and releases a robust reward model and training data.

Abstract: Generative reward models (also known as LLMs-as-judges), which use large
language models (LLMs) to evaluate answer quality, are increasingly adopted in
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). They are often preferred
over rigid rule-based metrics, especially for complex reasoning tasks involving
free-form outputs. In this paradigm, an LLM is typically prompted to compare a
candidate answer against a ground-truth reference and assign a binary reward
indicating correctness. Despite the seeming simplicity of this comparison task,
we find that generative reward models exhibit surprising vulnerabilities to
superficial manipulations: non-word symbols (e.g., ":" or ".") or reasoning
openers like "Thought process:" and "Let's solve this problem step by step."
can often lead to false positive rewards. We demonstrate that this weakness is
widespread across LLMs, datasets, and prompt formats, posing a serious threat
for core algorithmic paradigms that rely on generative reward models, such as
rejection sampling, preference optimization, and RLVR. To mitigate this issue,
we introduce a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy and train a new
generative reward model with substantially improved robustness. Our findings
highlight the urgent need for more reliable LLM-based evaluation methods. We

*Denis Sutter,Julian Minder,Thomas Hofmann,Tiago Pimentel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques causal abstraction in interpretability by showing that unrestricted alignment maps can trivialize it, proving any neural network can map to any algorithm. Empirical evidence supports this, highlighting the need for assumptions about information encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the linearity constraint in causal abstraction and explore the implications of using arbitrarily powerful alignment maps, revealing the limitations of causal abstraction for interpretability.

Method: Theoretical proof and empirical experiments, including mapping randomly initialized language models to algorithms, to demonstrate the triviality of unrestricted causal abstraction.

Result: Unrestricted causal abstraction is trivial, as any neural network can map to any algorithm, even if the model cannot solve the task. Empirical results show 100% interchange-intervention accuracy in such cases.

Conclusion: Causal abstraction alone is insufficient for mechanistic interpretability without assumptions about information encoding. Future work should explore the link between these assumptions and causal abstraction.

Abstract: The concept of causal abstraction got recently popularised to demystify the
opaque decision-making processes of machine learning models; in short, a neural
network can be abstracted as a higher-level algorithm if there exists a
function which allows us to map between them. Notably, most interpretability
papers implement these maps as linear functions, motivated by the linear
representation hypothesis: the idea that features are encoded linearly in a
model's representations. However, this linearity constraint is not required by
the definition of causal abstraction. In this work, we critically examine the
concept of causal abstraction by considering arbitrarily powerful alignment
maps. In particular, we prove that under reasonable assumptions, any neural
network can be mapped to any algorithm, rendering this unrestricted notion of
causal abstraction trivial and uninformative. We complement these theoretical
findings with empirical evidence, demonstrating that it is possible to
perfectly map models to algorithms even when these models are incapable of
solving the actual task; e.g., on an experiment using randomly initialised
language models, our alignment maps reach 100% interchange-intervention
accuracy on the indirect object identification task. This raises the non-linear
representation dilemma: if we lift the linearity constraint imposed to
alignment maps in causal abstraction analyses, we are left with no principled
way to balance the inherent trade-off between these maps' complexity and
accuracy. Together, these results suggest an answer to our title's question:
causal abstraction is not enough for mechanistic interpretability, as it
becomes vacuous without assumptions about how models encode information.
Studying the connection between this information-encoding assumption and causal
abstraction should lead to exciting future work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack 3D spatial awareness and struggle with diverse camera viewpoints, limiting fine-grained robotic manipulation.

Method: Integrates point cloud Masked Autoencoder for 3D representations and contrastive learning with 2D models, unifying coordinate systems and fusing multi-view point clouds.

Result: Superior performance in simulation and real-world experiments, enabling robust perception from novel viewpoints.

Conclusion: CL3R effectively enhances visuomotor policy learning for robotic manipulation by addressing 3D spatial and semantic challenges.

Abstract: Building a robust perception module is crucial for visuomotor policy
learning. While recent methods incorporate pre-trained 2D foundation models
into robotic perception modules to leverage their strong semantic
understanding, they struggle to capture 3D spatial information and generalize
across diverse camera viewpoints. These limitations hinder the policy's
effectiveness, especially in fine-grained robotic manipulation scenarios. To
address these challenges, we propose CL3R, a novel 3D pre-training framework
designed to enhance robotic manipulation policies. Our method integrates both
spatial awareness and semantic understanding by employing a point cloud Masked
Autoencoder to learn rich 3D representations while leveraging pre-trained 2D
foundation models through contrastive learning for efficient semantic knowledge
transfer. Additionally, we propose a 3D visual representation pre-training
framework for robotic tasks. By unifying coordinate systems across datasets and
introducing random fusion of multi-view point clouds, we mitigate camera view
ambiguity and improve generalization, enabling robust perception from novel
viewpoints at test time. Extensive experiments in both simulation and the real
world demonstrate the superiority of our method, highlighting its effectiveness
in visuomotor policy learning for robotic manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Satellite attitude control is critical for mission success, especially in autonomous operations. Existing methods lack real-time adaptability and fault tolerance.

Method: Integrates TD3 with HER and DWC (TD3-HD) to enhance learning in sparse reward environments and maintain stability during RW failures.

Result: TD3-HD achieves lower attitude error, better angular velocity regulation, and enhanced stability under faults.

Conclusion: TD3-HD is a promising fault-tolerant AI solution for autonomous satellite attitude control.

Abstract: Reliable satellite attitude control is essential for the success of space
missions, particularly as satellites increasingly operate autonomously in
dynamic and uncertain environments. Reaction wheels (RWs) play a pivotal role
in attitude control, and maintaining control resilience during RW faults is
critical to preserving mission objectives and system stability. However,
traditional Proportional Derivative (PD) controllers and existing deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms such as TD3, PPO, and A2C often fall
short in providing the real time adaptability and fault tolerance required for
autonomous satellite operations. This study introduces a DRL-based control
strategy designed to improve satellite resilience and adaptability under fault
conditions. Specifically, the proposed method integrates Twin Delayed Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) with Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) and
Dimension Wise Clipping (DWC) referred to as TD3-HD to enhance learning in
sparse reward environments and maintain satellite stability during RW failures.
The proposed approach is benchmarked against PD control and leading DRL
algorithms. Experimental results show that TD3-HD achieves significantly lower
attitude error, improved angular velocity regulation, and enhanced stability
under fault conditions. These findings underscore the proposed method potential
as a powerful, fault tolerant, onboard AI solution for autonomous satellite
attitude control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the visual domain gap between simulation and real-world robot manipulation without costly real-robot trials.

Method: Uses sparse-view Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct handover scenes, generating image-action pairs for policy training.

Result: Successfully trains and deploys a robot policy in real-world handover tasks using only simulated data.

Conclusion: H2RH-SGS is an effective representation for human-to-robot handovers, reducing reliance on real-robot data.

Abstract: Learning robot manipulation policies from raw, real-world image data requires
a large number of robot-action trials in the physical environment. Although
training using simulations offers a cost-effective alternative, the visual
domain gap between simulation and robot workspace remains a major limitation.
Gaussian Splatting visual reconstruction methods have recently provided new
directions for robot manipulation by generating realistic environments. In this
paper, we propose the first method for learning supervised-based robot
handovers solely from RGB images without the need of real-robot training or
real-robot data collection. The proposed policy learner, Human-to-Robot
Handover using Sparse-View Gaussian Splatting (H2RH-SGS), leverages sparse-view
Gaussian Splatting reconstruction of human-to-robot handover scenes to generate
robot demonstrations containing image-action pairs captured with a camera
mounted on the robot gripper. As a result, the simulated camera pose changes in
the reconstructed scene can be directly translated into gripper pose changes.
We train a robot policy on demonstrations collected with 16 household objects
and {\em directly} deploy this policy in the real environment. Experiments in
both Gaussian Splatting reconstructed scene and real-world human-to-robot
handover experiments demonstrate that H2RH-SGS serves as a new and effective
representation for the human-to-robot handover task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the growing threat of IP theft in LLMs deployed on edge devices by developing a watermarking solution.

Method: Generates unique user keys and stable watermarks via linear constraints from model invariants, with noise mechanisms for multi-user scenarios.

Result: Evaluated on Llama3, Phi3, and Gemma, showing strong robustness against various attacks (fine-tuning, pruning, etc.).

Conclusion: The scheme effectively protects transformer models from IP theft without requiring retraining, demonstrating high robustness.

Abstract: Watermarking technology has gained significant attention due to the
increasing importance of intellectual property (IP) rights, particularly with
the growing deployment of large language models (LLMs) on billions
resource-constrained edge devices. To counter the potential threats of IP theft
by malicious users, this paper introduces a robust watermarking scheme without
retraining or fine-tuning for transformer models. The scheme generates a unique
key for each user and derives a stable watermark value by solving linear
constraints constructed from model invariants. Moreover, this technology
utilizes noise mechanism to hide watermark locations in multi-user scenarios
against collusion attack. This paper evaluates the approach on three popular
models (Llama3, Phi3, Gemma), and the experimental results confirm the strong
robustness across a range of attack methods (fine-tuning, pruning,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of software vulnerabilities and improving detection methodologies in cybersecurity.

Abstract: The proliferation of software vulnerabilities presents a significant
challenge to cybersecurity, necessitating more effective detection
methodologies. We introduce White-Basilisk, a novel approach to vulnerability
detection that demonstrates superior performance while challenging prevailing
assumptions in AI model scaling. Utilizing an innovative architecture that
integrates Mamba layers, linear self-attention, and a Mixture of Experts
framework, White-Basilisk achieves state-of-the-art results in vulnerability
detection tasks with a parameter count of only 200M. The model's capacity to
process sequences of unprecedented length enables comprehensive analysis of
extensive codebases in a single pass, surpassing the context limitations of
current Large Language Models (LLMs). White-Basilisk exhibits robust
performance on imbalanced, real-world datasets, while maintaining computational
efficiency that facilitates deployment across diverse organizational scales.
This research not only establishes new benchmarks in code security but also
provides empirical evidence that compact, efficiently designed models can
outperform larger counterparts in specialized tasks, potentially redefining
optimization strategies in AI development for domain-specific applications.

### [217] [AgentsNet: Coordination and Collaborative Reasoning in Multi-Agent LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08616)
*Florian Grötschla,Luis Müller,Jan Tönshoff,Mikhail Galkin,Bryan Perozzi*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: AgentsNet is a new benchmark for multi-agent systems, testing their ability to collaborate, self-organize, and communicate effectively within a network topology. It scales beyond existing benchmarks, evaluating LLMs in networks of up to 100 agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks measuring multi-agent systems' ability to leverage network topology for problem-solving, self-organization, and communication.

Method: AgentsNet draws from distributed systems and graph theory, evaluating baseline methods, including homogeneous agent networks, on collaborative strategy formation.

Result: Frontier LLMs perform well in small networks but decline as network size increases. AgentsNet scales beyond traditional benchmarks (2-5 agents) to 100 agents.

Conclusion: AgentsNet provides a scalable benchmark for multi-agent reasoning, revealing limitations in current LLMs as network size grows.

Abstract: Large-language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful problem-solving
capabilities, in particular when organized in multi-agent systems. However, the
advent of such systems also raises several questions on the ability of a
complex network of agents to effectively self-organize and collaborate. While
measuring performance on standard reasoning benchmarks indicates how well
multi-agent systems can solve reasoning tasks, it is unclear whether these
systems are able to leverage their topology effectively. Here, we propose
AgentsNet, a new benchmark for multi-agent reasoning. By drawing inspiration
from classical problems in distributed systems and graph theory, AgentsNet
measures the ability of multi-agent systems to collaboratively form strategies
for problem-solving, self-organization, and effective communication given a
network topology. We evaluate a variety of baseline methods on AgentsNet
including homogeneous networks of agents which first have to agree on basic
protocols for organization and communication. We find that some frontier LLMs
are already demonstrating strong performance for small networks but begin to
fall off once the size of the network scales. While existing multi-agent
benchmarks cover at most 2-5 agents, AgentsNet is practically unlimited in size
and can scale with new generations of LLMs. As such, we also probe frontier
models in a setup with up to 100 agents.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an agentic system using LLMs to discover stochastic differential equations for financial time series, improving trading decisions and outperforming standard LLM-based agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based agentic frameworks lack principled model-building, relying on sentiment or trend analysis, which this work aims to address.

Method: Develops an agentic system where LLMs iteratively discover stochastic differential equations for financial time series, generating risk metrics for trading decisions.

Result: Model-informed trading strategies outperform standard LLM-based agents, improving Sharpe ratios across multiple equities.

Conclusion: Combining LLMs with agentic model discovery enhances market risk estimation and leads to more profitable trading decisions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in agentic frameworks,
in which prompts trigger complex tool-based analysis in pursuit of a goal.
While these frameworks have shown promise across multiple domains including in
finance, they typically lack a principled model-building step, relying instead
on sentiment- or trend-based analysis. We address this gap by developing an
agentic system that uses LLMs to iteratively discover stochastic differential
equations for financial time series. These models generate risk metrics which
inform daily trading decisions. We evaluate our system in both traditional
backtests and using a market simulator, which introduces synthetic but causally
plausible price paths and news events. We find that model-informed trading
strategies outperform standard LLM-based agents, improving Sharpe ratios across
multiple equities. Our results show that combining LLMs with agentic model
discovery enhances market risk estimation and enables more profitable trading
decisions.

*Gwanhyeong Koo,Sunjae Yoon,Younghwan Lee,Ji Woo Hong,Chang D. Yoo*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: FlowDrag improves drag-based editing by leveraging geometric information for accurate transformations, outperforming existing methods on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current drag-based editing methods suffer from geometric inconsistency, focusing only on user-defined points and neglecting broader geometry, leading to artifacts.

Method: FlowDrag constructs a 3D mesh from the image, uses an energy function for deformation, and projects displacements into 2D for UNet denoising.

Result: FlowDrag achieves precise handle-to-target alignment while preserving structural integrity and outperforms existing methods on VFD and DragBench.

Conclusion: FlowDrag addresses geometric inconsistency in drag-based editing and introduces the VFD benchmark for accurate evaluation.

Abstract: Drag-based editing allows precise object manipulation through point-based
control, offering user convenience. However, current methods often suffer from
a geometric inconsistency problem by focusing exclusively on matching
user-defined points, neglecting the broader geometry and leading to artifacts
or unstable edits. We propose FlowDrag, which leverages geometric information
for more accurate and coherent transformations. Our approach constructs a 3D
mesh from the image, using an energy function to guide mesh deformation based
on user-defined drag points. The resulting mesh displacements are projected
into 2D and incorporated into a UNet denoising process, enabling precise
handle-to-target point alignment while preserving structural integrity.
Additionally, existing drag-editing benchmarks provide no ground truth, making
it difficult to assess how accurately the edits match the intended
transformations. To address this, we present VFD (VidFrameDrag) benchmark
dataset, which provides ground-truth frames using consecutive shots in a video
dataset. FlowDrag outperforms existing drag-based editing methods on both VFD
Bench and DragBench.

TL;DR: A synthetic pipeline generates 3D visual instruction datasets to improve Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in capturing camera-object relations, achieving a 33.4% accuracy boost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with camera-object relations due to limited training data diversity.

Method: A synthetic generation pipeline uses 3D assets, rendering, diffusion models, and LLMs to create photorealistic images and text prompts.

Result: Ultimate3D dataset (240K VQAs) improves MLLMs, outperforming commercial models by 33.4%.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and dataset enhance MLLM capabilities for camera-object relation tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with accurately capturing
camera-object relations, especially for object orientation, camera viewpoint,
and camera shots. This stems from the fact that existing MLLMs are trained on
images with limited diverse camera-object relations and corresponding textual
descriptions. To address this, we propose a synthetic generation pipeline to
create large-scale 3D visual instruction datasets. Our framework takes 3D
assets as input and uses rendering and diffusion-based image generation models
to create photorealistic images preserving precise camera-object relations.
Additionally, large language models (LLMs) are used to generate text prompts
for guiding visual instruction tuning and controlling image generation. We
create Ultimate3D, a dataset of 240K VQAs with precise camera-object
annotations, and corresponding benchmark. MLLMs fine-tuned on our proposed
dataset outperform commercial models by a large margin, achieving an average
accuracy improvement of 33.4% on camera-object relation recognition tasks. Our
code, dataset, and benchmark will contribute to broad MLLM applications.

*Sounak Bhowmik,Travis S. Humble,Himanshu Thapliyal*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces Quantum Properties Trojans (QuPTs), a novel attack exploiting quantum computing properties to compromise QNNs, showing significant stealth and performance impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: QNN security and robustness are understudied, posing risks for quantum machine learning applications.

Method: Proposed QuPTs leverage unitary quantum gate properties and Hadamard gates to insert Trojans into QNN-based binary classifiers.

Result: QuPTs degraded QNN accuracy by 23%, demonstrating high stealth and impact.

Conclusion: This is the first Trojan attack study on fully quantum neural networks, highlighting critical security vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNN) hold immense potential for the future of
quantum machine learning (QML). However, QNN security and robustness remain
largely unexplored. In this work, we proposed novel Trojan attacks based on the
quantum computing properties in a QNN-based binary classifier. Our proposed
Quantum Properties Trojans (QuPTs) are based on the unitary property of quantum
gates to insert noise and Hadamard gates to enable superposition to develop
Trojans and attack QNNs. We showed that the proposed QuPTs are significantly
stealthier and heavily impact the quantum circuits' performance, specifically
QNNs. The most impactful QuPT caused a deterioration of 23% accuracy of the
compromised QNN under the experimental setup. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work on the Trojan attack on a fully quantum neural network
independent of any hybrid classical-quantum architecture.

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs) in quantum machine learning for quantum chemistry datasets, evaluating their performance and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the potential of PQCs in quantum chemistry, addressing the gap in exploring chemically meaningful datasets.

Method: Constructed 168 PQCs using 14 encoding strategies and 12 variational ansätze, tested on 5- and 16-qubit circuits, and evaluated with simulations and real hardware.

Result: PQCs face challenges in solving chemically relevant problems that are easy for classical methods but non-trivial for quantum approaches.

Conclusion: While PQCs show promise, their application to quantum chemistry remains challenging compared to classical methods.

Abstract: In the field of quantum machine learning (QML), parametrized quantum circuits
(PQCs) -- constructed using a combination of fixed and tunable quantum gates --
provide a promising hybrid framework for tackling complex machine learning
problems. Despite numerous proposed applications, there remains limited
exploration of datasets relevant to quantum chemistry. In this study, we
investigate the potential benefits and limitations of PQCs on two chemically
meaningful datasets: (1) the BSE49 dataset, containing bond separation energies
for 49 different classes of chemical bonds, and (2) a dataset of water
conformations, where coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) wavefunctions
are predicted from lower-level electronic structure methods using the
data-driven coupled-cluster (DDCC) approach. We construct a comprehensive set
of 168 PQCs by combining 14 data encoding strategies with 12 variational
ans{\"a}tze, and evaluate their performance on circuits with 5 and 16 qubits.
Our initial analysis examines the impact of circuit structure on model
performance using state-vector simulations. We then explore how circuit depth
and training set size influence model performance. Finally, we assess the
performance of the best-performing PQCs on current quantum hardware, using both
noisy simulations ("fake" backends) and real quantum devices. Our findings
underscore the challenges of applying PQCs to chemically relevant problems that
are straightforward for classical machine learning methods but remain
non-trivial for quantum approaches.

*Jianhao He,John C. S. Lui*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Quantum algorithms for projection-free sparse convex optimization in vector and matrix domains outperform classical methods, reducing query and time complexity significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the need for efficient optimization in machine learning and data science, the paper explores quantum advantages in sparse convex optimization.

Method: Proposes quantum algorithms for vector and matrix domains, leveraging function value oracles and nuclear norm constraints to reduce complexity.

Result: Achieves query complexity of O(√d/ε) and O(1/ε) for vectors, and time complexity of Õ(rd/ε²) and Õ(√rd/ε³) for matrices, outperforming classical methods.

Conclusion: Quantum algorithms demonstrate superior performance in projection-free sparse convex optimization, offering significant improvements over classical approaches.

Abstract: This paper considers the projection-free sparse convex optimization problem
for the vector domain and the matrix domain, which covers a large number of
important applications in machine learning and data science. For the vector
domain $\mathcal{D} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, we propose two quantum algorithms
for sparse constraints that finds a $\varepsilon$-optimal solution with the
query complexity of $O(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon)$ and $O(1/\varepsilon)$ by using
the function value oracle, reducing a factor of $O(\sqrt{d})$ and $O(d)$ over
the best classical algorithm, respectively, where $d$ is the dimension. For the
matrix domain $\mathcal{D} \subset \mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$, we propose two
quantum algorithms for nuclear norm constraints that improve the time
complexity to $\tilde{O}(rd/\varepsilon^2)$ and
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{r}d/\varepsilon^3)$ for computing the update step, reducing at
least a factor of $O(\sqrt{d})$ over the best classical algorithm, where $r$ is
the rank of the gradient matrix. Our algorithms show quantum advantages in
projection-free sparse convex optimization problems as they outperform the
optimal classical methods in dependence on the dimension $d$.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a structured approach to model vulnerabilities in Quantum Machine Learning (QML) by adapting kill chain models from classical cybersecurity, providing a taxonomy of attack vectors and their interdependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research on QML security is fragmented, analyzing threats in isolation with unrealistic assumptions, hindering holistic defense strategies.

Method: The authors adapt kill chain models to QML, mapping attack vectors to stages like reconnaissance, manipulation, and exfiltration, inspired by MITRE ATLAS.

Result: A detailed taxonomy of QML attack vectors is presented, highlighting interdependencies between physical, algorithmic, and privacy threats.

Conclusion: The work lays a foundation for realistic threat modeling and proactive security design in QML.

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) systems inherit vulnerabilities from classical
machine learning while introducing new attack surfaces rooted in the physical
and algorithmic layers of quantum computing. Despite a growing body of research
on individual attack vectors - ranging from adversarial poisoning and evasion
to circuit-level backdoors, side-channel leakage, and model extraction - these
threats are often analyzed in isolation, with unrealistic assumptions about
attacker capabilities and system environments. This fragmentation hampers the
development of effective, holistic defense strategies. In this work, we argue
that QML security requires more structured modeling of the attack surface,
capturing not only individual techniques but also their relationships,
prerequisites, and potential impact across the QML pipeline. We propose
adapting kill chain models, widely used in classical IT and cybersecurity, to
the quantum machine learning context. Such models allow for structured
reasoning about attacker objectives, capabilities, and possible multi-stage
attack paths - spanning reconnaissance, initial access, manipulation,
persistence, and exfiltration. Based on extensive literature analysis, we
present a detailed taxonomy of QML attack vectors mapped to corresponding
stages in a quantum-aware kill chain framework that is inspired by the MITRE
ATLAS for classical machine learning. We highlight interdependencies between
physical-level threats (like side-channel leakage and crosstalk faults), data
and algorithm manipulation (such as poisoning or circuit backdoors), and
privacy attacks (including model extraction and training data inference). This
work provides a foundation for more realistic threat modeling and proactive
security-in-depth design in the emerging field of quantum machine learning.

Conclusion: AF3 demonstrates the effectiveness of open-source training and novel methodologies in advancing audio-language understanding.

Abstract: We present Audio Flamingo 3 (AF3), a fully open state-of-the-art (SOTA) large
audio-language model that advances reasoning and understanding across speech,
sound, and music. AF3 introduces: (i) AF-Whisper, a unified audio encoder
trained using a novel strategy for joint representation learning across all 3

<details>

Motivation: To evaluate the robustness of modern LID and SR methods using historical radio recordings, focusing on multilingual speakers and cross-age recordings.

Method: Leveraged UNESCO's mid-20th century radio recordings to test off-the-shelf LID and SR systems.

Result: LID systems perform well with accented speech, but SR embeddings are biased by channel, age, and language.

Conclusion: SR methods need improvement to overcome biases for effective use in archival speaker indexing.

Abstract: In this study, we leverage a unique UNESCO collection of mid-20th century
radio recordings to probe the robustness of modern off-the-shelf language
identification (LID) and speaker recognition (SR) methods, especially with
respect to the impact of multilingual speakers and cross-age recordings. Our
findings suggest that LID systems, such as Whisper, are increasingly adept at
handling second-language and accented speech. However, speaker embeddings
remain a fragile component of speech processing pipelines that is prone to
biases related to the channel, age, and language. Issues which will need to be
overcome should archives aim to employ SR methods for speaker indexing.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: A novel discrete diffusion-based audio inpainting method outperforms existing approaches, especially for gaps longer than 100ms, using tokenized audio representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing audio inpainting methods degrade for gaps exceeding 100ms, prompting the need for a more robust solution.

Method: Uses discrete diffusion modeling on tokenized audio representations from a pre-trained tokenizer for stable reconstruction.

Result: Outperforms baselines on MusicNet and MTG datasets, especially for gaps up to 500ms, with superior perceptual quality.

Conclusion: The method provides a robust solution for restoring degraded audio, particularly for longer gaps.

Abstract: Audio inpainting refers to the task of reconstructing missing segments in
corrupted audio recordings. While prior approaches-including waveform and
spectrogram-based diffusion models-have shown promising results for short gaps,
they often degrade in quality when gaps exceed 100 milliseconds (ms). In this
work, we introduce a novel inpainting method based on discrete diffusion
modeling, which operates over tokenized audio representations produced by a
pre-trained audio tokenizer. Our approach models the generative process
directly in the discrete latent space, enabling stable and semantically
coherent reconstruction of missing audio. We evaluate the method on the
MusicNet dataset using both objective and perceptual metrics across gap
durations up to 300 ms. We further evaluated our approach on the MTG dataset,
extending the gap duration to 500 ms. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing
baselines, particularly for longer gaps, offering a robust solution for
restoring degraded musical recordings. Audio examples of our proposed method

TL;DR: MIDI-VALLE, a neural codec model adapted from VALLE, improves expressive MIDI-to-audio synthesis by conditioning on reference audio and MIDI, outperforming baselines in quality and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MIDI-to-audio synthesis struggles with generalization across diverse inputs. MIDI-VALLE aims to address this by leveraging a neural codec approach.

Method: Adapts VALLE framework for MIDI-to-audio synthesis, encoding MIDI and audio as discrete tokens and training on diverse piano performance data.

Result: Achieves 75% lower Frechet Audio Distance and wins 202 vs. 58 votes in listening tests, showing superior quality and generalization.

Conclusion: MIDI-VALLE effectively improves MIDI-to-audio synthesis, offering robust performance across diverse inputs.

Abstract: Generating expressive audio performances from music scores requires models to
capture both instrument acoustics and human interpretation. Traditional music
performance synthesis pipelines follow a two-stage approach, first generating
expressive performance MIDI from a score, then synthesising the MIDI into
audio. However, the synthesis models often struggle to generalise across
diverse MIDI sources, musical styles, and recording environments. To address
these challenges, we propose MIDI-VALLE, a neural codec language model adapted
from the VALLE framework, which was originally designed for zero-shot
personalised text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. For performance MIDI-to-audio
synthesis, we improve the architecture to condition on a reference audio
performance and its corresponding MIDI. Unlike previous TTS-based systems that
rely on piano rolls, MIDI-VALLE encodes both MIDI and audio as discrete tokens,
facilitating a more consistent and robust modelling of piano performances.
Furthermore, the model's generalisation ability is enhanced by training on an
extensive and diverse piano performance dataset. Evaluation results show that
MIDI-VALLE significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline, achieving
over 75% lower Frechet Audio Distance on the ATEPP and Maestro datasets. In the
listening test, MIDI-VALLE received 202 votes compared to 58 for the baseline,
demonstrating improved synthesis quality and generalisation across diverse
performance MIDI inputs.

TL;DR: FreeAudio is a training-free framework for timing-controlled text-to-audio (T2A) generation, enabling precise and long-form synthesis without requiring aligned audio-text pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2A methods struggle with complex text prompts involving precise timing due to limited aligned data. FreeAudio addresses this gap by enabling timing-controlled long-form generation.

Method: Uses an LLM for time window planning and recaptioning, along with Decoupling and Aggregating Attention Control for timing precision, and Contextual Latent Composition and Reference Guidance for smoothness and consistency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art timing-conditioned T2A synthesis quality among training-free methods and comparable performance to training-based methods, including long-form generation.

Conclusion: FreeAudio advances timing-controlled long-form T2A synthesis, demonstrating high-quality results and paving the way for future improvements.

Abstract: Text-to-audio (T2A) generation has achieved promising results with the recent
advances in generative models. However, because of the limited quality and
quantity of temporally-aligned audio-text pairs, existing T2A methods struggle
to handle the complex text prompts that contain precise timing control, e.g.,
"owl hooted at 2.4s-5.2s". Recent works have explored data augmentation
techniques or introduced timing conditions as model inputs to enable
timing-conditioned 10-second T2A generation, while their synthesis quality is
still limited. In this work, we propose a novel training-free timing-controlled
T2A framework, FreeAudio, making the first attempt to enable timing-controlled
long-form T2A generation, e.g., "owl hooted at 2.4s-5.2s and crickets chirping
at 0s-24s". Specifically, we first employ an LLM to plan non-overlapping time
windows and recaption each with a refined natural language description, based
on the input text and timing prompts. Then we introduce: 1) Decoupling and
Aggregating Attention Control for precise timing control; 2) Contextual Latent
Composition for local smoothness and Reference Guidance for global consistency.
Extensive experiments show that: 1) FreeAudio achieves state-of-the-art
timing-conditioned T2A synthesis quality among training-free methods and is
comparable to leading training-based methods; 2) FreeAudio demonstrates
comparable long-form generation quality with training-based Stable Audio and
paves the way for timing-controlled long-form T2A synthesis. Demo samples are

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: VideoConviction is a multimodal dataset for analyzing finfluencers' impact on stock recommendations. It shows multimodal inputs improve ticker extraction but struggle with distinguishing conviction. Betting against finfluencer recommendations outperforms the S&P 500 but with higher risk.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the influence of finfluencers beyond text, analyzing multimodal signals like tone and facial expressions is needed.

Method: Created VideoConviction, a dataset with 6,000+ expert annotations, to benchmark MLLMs and LLMs in financial discourse.

Result: Multimodal inputs improve ticker extraction but fail to distinguish conviction. Betting against finfluencer recommendations yields 6.8% higher annual returns than the S&P 500 but with more risk.

Conclusion: The benchmark enables diverse evaluation of multimodal tasks, advancing financial research. Dataset and tools are available under CC BY-NC 4.0.

Abstract: Social media has amplified the reach of financial influencers known as
"finfluencers," who share stock recommendations on platforms like YouTube.
Understanding their influence requires analyzing multimodal signals like tone,
delivery style, and facial expressions, which extend beyond text-based
financial analysis. We introduce VideoConviction, a multimodal dataset with
6,000+ expert annotations, produced through 457 hours of human effort, to
benchmark multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and text-based large
language models (LLMs) in financial discourse. Our results show that while
multimodal inputs improve stock ticker extraction (e.g., extracting Apple's
ticker AAPL), both MLLMs and LLMs struggle to distinguish investment actions
and conviction--the strength of belief conveyed through confident delivery and
detailed reasoning--often misclassifying general commentary as definitive
recommendations. While high-conviction recommendations perform better than
low-conviction ones, they still underperform the popular S\&P 500 index fund.
An inverse strategy--betting against finfluencer recommendations--outperforms
the S\&P 500 by 6.8\% in annual returns but carries greater risk (Sharpe ratio
of 0.41 vs. 0.65). Our benchmark enables a diverse evaluation of multimodal

*Yibo Lyu,Rui Shao,Gongwei Chen,Yijie Zhu,Weili Guan,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: PUMA proposes a layer-pruned MLLM with modality-adaptive learning for efficient unified multimodal retrieval, reducing resource usage without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency and high training costs of large multimodal language models (MLLMs) in unified multimodal retrieval (UMR).

Method: Layer-Pruned Self-Distillation to prune MLLMs and Modality-Adaptive Contrastive Learning Loss (MAC-Loss) for efficient learning.

Result: Significantly reduces resource usage while maintaining strong performance.

Conclusion: PUMA offers an efficient solution for UMR by balancing structural pruning and adaptive learning.

Abstract: As multimedia content expands, the demand for unified multimodal retrieval
(UMR) in real-world applications increases. Recent work leverages multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) to tackle this task. However, their large
parameter size results in high training costs and low inference efficiency. To
address this, we propose PUMA: a Layer-Pruned Language Model for Efficient
Unified Multimodal Retrieval with Modality-Adaptive Learning. Our approach
improves UMR from both structural and learning perspectives. (1) Structurally,
we propose Layer-Pruned Self-Distillation, which prunes MLLMs by keeping only
shallow layers while distilling features from dropped deep layers as teacher
signals. This reduces parameters and preserves representation capability. (2)
On the learning side, we introduce Modality-Adaptive Contrastive Learning Loss
(MAC-Loss), which separates in-batch negatives into harder intra-modality and
easier inter-modality groups based on the target modality, assigning different
temperature strategies to enhance learning efficiency. Experiments show our
method significantly reduces resource usage while maintaining strong
performance.

*Junyu Chen,Yihua Gao,Mingyong Li*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: A novel framework for image-text matching (ITM) uses multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate Visual Semantic Descriptions (VSD) for bridging modality gaps, improving alignment and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning visual and textual modalities is challenging due to their inherent differences in representation.

Method: Leverages MLLMs to generate VSD for instance-level (fusing visual features) and prototype-level (clustering) alignment.

Result: Significant performance improvements on Flickr30K and MSCOCO, with strong zero-shot generalization to cross-domain tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively bridges modality gaps and enhances ITM performance, with potential for broader applications.

Abstract: Image-text matching (ITM) aims to address the fundamental challenge of
aligning visual and textual modalities, which inherently differ in their
representations, continuous, high-dimensional image features vs. discrete,
structured text. We propose a novel framework that bridges the modality gap by
leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as visual semantic parsers.
By generating rich Visual Semantic Descriptions (VSD), MLLMs provide semantic
anchor that facilitate cross-modal alignment. Our approach combines: (1)
Instance-level alignment by fusing visual features with VSD to enhance the
linguistic expressiveness of image representations, and (2) Prototype-level
alignment through VSD clustering to ensure category-level consistency. These
modules can be seamlessly integrated into existing ITM models. Extensive
experiments on Flickr30K and MSCOCO demonstrate substantial performance
improvements. The approach also exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to
cross-domain tasks, including news and remote sensing ITM. The code and model
checkpoints are available at https://github.com/Image-Text-Matching/VSD.

*Yun Tang,Mengbang Zou,Zeinab Nezami,Syed Ali Raza Zaidi,Weisi Guo*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: KP-A is a unified Network Knowledge Plane for Agentic network intelligence, streamlining development and enhancing interoperability by decoupling knowledge acquisition from intelligence logic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current implementations of intelligence tasks in autonomous 6G networks involve redundant data flows and inconsistent interpretations due to isolated knowledge retrieval pipelines.

Method: Proposes KP-A, a unified knowledge plane, inspired by Open-RAN's service model unification, to decouple knowledge acquisition and management from intelligence logic.

Result: Demonstrated in live network knowledge Q&A and edge AI service orchestration, showing improved efficiency and interoperability.

Conclusion: KP-A reduces maintenance complexity and supports reproducibility, with open-sourced implementation artifacts for future standardization.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) and agentic systems is enabling
autonomous 6G networks with advanced intelligence, including
self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-healing. However, the current
implementation of individual intelligence tasks necessitates isolated knowledge
retrieval pipelines, resulting in redundant data flows and inconsistent
interpretations. Inspired by the service model unification effort in Open-RAN
(to support interoperability and vendor diversity), we propose KP-A: a unified
Network Knowledge Plane specifically designed for Agentic network intelligence.
By decoupling network knowledge acquisition and management from intelligence
logic, KP-A streamlines development and reduces maintenance complexity for
intelligence engineers. By offering an intuitive and consistent knowledge
interface, KP-A also enhances interoperability for the network intelligence
agents. We demonstrate KP-A in two representative intelligence tasks: live
network knowledge Q&A and edge AI service orchestration. All implementation
artifacts have been open-sourced to support reproducibility and future
standardization efforts.

TL;DR: The paper discusses integrating AI/ML natively into 6G RAN from the start, proposing a framework with three key capabilities and validating it through large-scale trials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complexity of 6G and support ubiquitous AI applications by designing an AI-Native RAN, unlike 5G where AI was an add-on.

Method: Explores AI-Native RAN design principles, focusing on Day 1 architecture, functionalities, and capabilities, validated via large-scale field trials.

Result: Proposed AI-Native 6G RAN architecture improved latency, root cause identification, and energy efficiency in trials.

Conclusion: Provides a Day 1 framework for 6G AI-Native RAN standardization, balancing innovation with practical deployment.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) has become the most certain
and prominent feature of 6G mobile networks. Unlike 5G, where AI/ML was not
natively integrated but rather an add-on feature over existing architecture, 6G
shall incorporate AI from the onset to address its complexity and support
ubiquitous AI applications. Based on our extensive mobile network operation and
standardization experience from 2G to 5G, this paper explores the design and
standardization principles of AI-Native radio access networks (RAN) for 6G,
with a particular focus on its critical Day 1 architecture, functionalities and
capabilities. We investigate the framework of AI-Native RAN and present its
three essential capabilities to shed some light on the standardization
direction; namely, AI-driven RAN processing/optimization/automation, reliable
AI lifecycle management (LCM), and AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) provisioning. The
standardization of AI-Native RAN, in particular the Day 1 features, including
an AI-Native 6G RAN architecture, were proposed. For validation, a large-scale
field trial with over 5000 5G-A base stations have been built and delivered
significant improvements in average air interface latency, root cause
identification, and network energy consumption with the proposed architecture
and the supporting AI functions. This paper aims to provide a Day 1 framework
for 6G AI-Native RAN standardization design, balancing technical innovation
with practical deployment.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hashing-based method for efficient pattern set mining, focusing on minimizing reconstruction error, and shows it outperforms standard greedy algorithms in speed while maintaining similar quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient methods to find good sets of patterns in data mining, as traditional approaches may not scale well.

Method: A bottom-k hashing-based approach for selecting pattern sets, extended to handle approximate pattern appearances.

Result: The method is significantly faster than greedy algorithms and achieves nearly equal results on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The hashing-based approach is efficient and effective for pattern set mining, with broad applications in data mining tasks.

Abstract: Pattern set mining, which is the task of finding a good set of patterns
instead of all patterns, is a fundamental problem in data mining. Many
different definitions of what constitutes a good set have been proposed in
recent years. In this paper, we consider the reconstruction error as a proxy
measure for the goodness of the set, and concentrate on the adjacent problem of
how to find a good set efficiently. We propose a method based on bottom-k
hashing for efficiently selecting the set and extend the method for the common
case where the patterns might only appear in approximate form in the data. Our
approach has applications in tiling databases, Boolean matrix factorization,
and redescription mining, among others. We show that our hashing-based approach
is significantly faster than the standard greedy algorithm while obtaining
almost equally good results in both synthetic and real-world data sets.

TL;DR: EP-GAT, an energy-based parallel graph attention neural network, improves stock movement prediction by dynamically modeling stock interdependencies and preserving hierarchical intra-stock features, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph neural networks for stock prediction rely on static or manual factors, missing dynamic interdependencies and hierarchical features.

Method: EP-GAT uses energy differences and Boltzmann distribution for dynamic stock graphs and a parallel graph attention mechanism for hierarchical dynamics.

Result: EP-GAT outperforms five baselines on US and UK stock market datasets, validated by ablation studies.

Conclusion: EP-GAT effectively addresses gaps in dynamic interdependency modeling and hierarchical feature preservation, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Graph neural networks have shown remarkable performance in forecasting stock
movements, which arises from learning complex inter-dependencies between stocks
and intra-dynamics of stocks. Existing approaches based on graph neural
networks typically rely on static or manually defined factors to model changing
inter-dependencies between stocks. Furthermore, these works often struggle to
preserve hierarchical features within stocks. To bridge these gaps, this work
presents the Energy-based Parallel Graph Attention Neural Network, a novel
approach for predicting future movements for multiple stocks. First, it
generates a dynamic stock graph with the energy difference between stocks and
Boltzmann distribution, capturing evolving inter-dependencies between stocks.
Then, a parallel graph attention mechanism is proposed to preserve the
hierarchical intra-stock dynamics. Extensive experiments on five real-world
datasets are conducted to validate the proposed approach, spanning from the US
stock markets (NASDAQ, NYSE, SP) and UK stock markets (FTSE, LSE). The
experimental results demonstrate that EP-GAT consistently outperforms
competitive five baselines on test periods across various metrics. The ablation
studies and hyperparameter sensitivity analysis further validate the
effectiveness of each module in the proposed method.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: SPINT, a Spatial Permutation-Invariant Neural Transformer, addresses nonstationarity in iBCI by dynamically inferring unit identities, enabling robust cross-session decoding without test-time alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The nonstationarity of neural recordings in iBCI limits long-term usability due to unstable neural populations across sessions. Existing methods require fixed identities or test-time updates, hindering generalization.

Method: SPINT uses context-dependent positional embeddings for dynamic unit identity inference, supports variable population sizes, and employs dynamic channel dropout for robustness. Few-shot adaptation is gradient-free.

Result: SPINT outperforms zero-shot and few-shot baselines on the FALCON Benchmark, demonstrating robust cross-session generalization without test-time alignment or fine-tuning.

Conclusion: SPINT advances long-term iBCI by providing a scalable, robust decoding framework that eliminates the need for session-specific alignment, enhancing usability for motor-impaired individuals.

Abstract: Intracortical Brain-Computer Interfaces (iBCI) aim to decode behavior from
neural population activity, enabling individuals with motor impairments to
regain motor functions and communication abilities. A key challenge in
long-term iBCI is the nonstationarity of neural recordings, where the
composition and tuning profiles of the recorded populations are unstable across
recording sessions. Existing methods attempt to address this issue by explicit
alignment techniques; however, they rely on fixed neural identities and require
test-time labels or parameter updates, limiting their generalization across
sessions and imposing additional computational burden during deployment. In
this work, we introduce SPINT - a Spatial Permutation-Invariant Neural
Transformer framework for behavioral decoding that operates directly on
unordered sets of neural units. Central to our approach is a novel
context-dependent positional embedding scheme that dynamically infers
unit-specific identities, enabling flexible generalization across recording
sessions. SPINT supports inference on variable-size populations and allows
few-shot, gradient-free adaptation using a small amount of unlabeled data from
the test session. To further promote model robustness to population
variability, we introduce dynamic channel dropout, a regularization method for
iBCI that simulates shifts in population composition during training. We
evaluate SPINT on three multi-session datasets from the FALCON Benchmark,
covering continuous motor decoding tasks in human and non-human primates. SPINT
demonstrates robust cross-session generalization, outperforming existing
zero-shot and few-shot unsupervised baselines while eliminating the need for
test-time alignment and fine-tuning. Our work contributes an initial step
toward a robust and scalable neural decoding framework for long-term iBCI
applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces filter-equivariant functions as a criterion for good extrapolation in list functions, proving theorems and relating them to map-equivariant functions, with a highlight being the amalgamation algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To define a 'good' extrapolant for functions beyond known examples by ensuring predictable behavior even when elements are removed, using filter operations in functional programming.

Method: Introduces filter-equivariant functions, proves theorems about them, relates them to map-equivariant functions, and provides a geometric interpretation using simplicial structures.

Result: Demonstrates that filter-equivariant functions form a meaningful class, with the amalgamation algorithm as a key result for perfect extrapolation.

Conclusion: Filter-equivariant functions provide a robust framework for rule-following in extrapolation, with practical implications for functional programming.

Abstract: What should a function that extrapolates beyond known input/output examples
look like? This is a tricky question to answer in general, as any function
matching the outputs on those examples can in principle be a correct
extrapolant. We argue that a "good" extrapolant should follow certain kinds of
rules, and here we study a particularly appealing criterion for rule-following
in list functions: that the function should behave predictably even when
certain elements are removed. In functional programming, a standard way to
express such removal operations is by using a filter function. Accordingly, our
paper introduces a new semantic class of functions -- the filter equivariant
functions. We show that this class contains interesting examples, prove some
basic theorems about it, and relate it to the well-known class of map
equivariant functions. We also present a geometric account of filter
equivariants, showing how they correspond naturally to certain simplicial
structures. Our highlight result is the amalgamation algorithm, which
constructs any filter-equivariant function's output by first studying how it
behaves on sublists of the input, in a way that extrapolates perfectly.

*Yeganeh Alimohammadi,Kiana Asgari*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper generalizes the Mallows model by learning the distance metric from data, proposing an FPTAS for sampling and an efficient MLE algorithm, validated on sports rankings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Mallows models use fixed distances, but rankings vary by context (e.g., sports). The paper aims to learn the distance metric directly from data.

Method: The authors generalize the Mallows model using $L_\alpha$ distances and develop an FPTAS for sampling and an MLE algorithm to jointly estimate parameters.

Result: They achieve strong consistency for estimators and validate the approach empirically on sports ranking datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively learns distance metrics from data, generalizing prior work and performing well in practical applications.

Abstract: \textit{Mallows model} is a widely-used probabilistic framework for learning
from ranking data, with applications ranging from recommendation systems and
voting to aligning language models with human
preferences~\cite{chen2024mallows, kleinberg2021algorithmic,
rafailov2024direct}. Under this model, observed rankings are noisy
perturbations of a central ranking $\sigma$, with likelihood decaying
exponentially in distance from $\sigma$, i.e, $P (\pi) \propto \exp\big(-\beta
\cdot d(\pi, \sigma)\big),$ where $\beta > 0$ controls dispersion and $d$ is a
distance function.
  Existing methods mainly focus on fixed distances (such as Kendall's $\tau$
distance), with no principled approach to learning the distance metric directly
from data. In practice, however, rankings naturally vary by context; for
instance, in some sports we regularly see long-range swaps (a low-rank team
beating a high-rank one), while in others such events are rare. Motivated by
this, we propose a generalization of Mallows model that learns the distance
metric directly from data. Specifically, we focus on $L_\alpha$ distances:
$d_\alpha(\pi,\sigma):=\sum_{i=1} |\pi(i)-\sigma(i)|^\alpha$.
  For any $\alpha\geq 1$ and $\beta>0$, we develop a Fully Polynomial-Time
Approximation Scheme (FPTAS) to efficiently generate samples that are
$\epsilon$- close (in total variation distance) to the true distribution. Even
in the special cases of $L_1$ and $L_2$, this generalizes prior results that
required vanishing dispersion ($\beta\to0$). Using this sampling algorithm, we
propose an efficient Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) algorithm that jointly
estimates the central ranking, the dispersion parameter, and the optimal
distance metric. We prove strong consistency results for our estimators (for
any values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$), and we validate our approach empirically
using datasets from sports rankings.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: CLEAR is a calibration method combining aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty for improved conditional coverage in regression tasks, outperforming baselines by 28.2% and 17.4% in interval width.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods often address only one type of uncertainty (aleatoric or epistemic), limiting reliability in predictive modeling. CLEAR aims to balance both for better coverage.

Method: CLEAR uses two parameters (γ₁ and γ₂) to combine aleatoric (quantile regression) and epistemic (PCS framework ensembles) uncertainty estimators.

Result: On 17 datasets, CLEAR improves interval width by 28.2% and 17.4% over individually calibrated baselines while maintaining nominal coverage.

Conclusion: CLEAR effectively balances and combines aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, enhancing predictive reliability, especially in high-uncertainty scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate uncertainty quantification is critical for reliable predictive
modeling, especially in regression tasks. Existing methods typically address
either aleatoric uncertainty from measurement noise or epistemic uncertainty
from limited data, but not necessarily both in a balanced way. We propose
CLEAR, a calibration method with two distinct parameters, $\gamma_1$ and
$\gamma_2$, to combine the two uncertainty components for improved conditional
coverage. CLEAR is compatible with any pair of aleatoric and epistemic
estimators; we show how it can be used with (i) quantile regression for
aleatoric uncertainty and (ii) ensembles drawn from the
Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) framework for epistemic
uncertainty. Across 17 diverse real-world datasets, CLEAR achieves an average
improvement of 28.2% and 17.4% in the interval width compared to the two
individually calibrated baselines while maintaining nominal coverage. This
improvement can be particularly evident in scenarios dominated by either high
epistemic or high aleatoric uncertainty.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Stein's shrinkage estimation for batch normalization (BN) to improve mean and variance estimates, especially under adversarial attacks, and demonstrates its effectiveness in image classification and segmentation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BN is widely used in deep learning but relies on sample statistics vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Stein's shrinkage offers a more robust estimation method.

Method: The authors apply Stein's shrinkage estimator to BN for mean and variance estimation, testing it in ResNet (CIFAR-10), 3D CNN (PPMI), and HRNet (Cityscape) under adversarial conditions.

Result: The Stein-corrected BN achieves state-of-the-art performance in image classification and segmentation, even with adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: Stein shrinkage enhances BN's robustness and accuracy, making it suitable for adversarial scenarios.

Abstract: Batch normalization (BN) is a ubiquitous operation in deep neural networks
used primarily to achieve stability and regularization during network training.
BN involves feature map centering and scaling using sample means and variances,
respectively. Since these statistics are being estimated across the feature
maps within a batch, this problem is ideally suited for the application of
Stein's shrinkage estimation, which leads to a better, in the
mean-squared-error sense, estimate of the mean and variance of the batch. In
this paper, we prove that the Stein shrinkage estimator for the mean and
variance dominates over the sample mean and variance estimators in the presence
of adversarial attacks when modeling these attacks using sub-Gaussian
distributions. This facilitates and justifies the application of Stein
shrinkage to estimate the mean and variance parameters in BN and use it in
image classification (segmentation) tasks with and without adversarial attacks.
We present SOTA performance results using this Stein corrected batch norm in a
standard ResNet architecture applied to the task of image classification using
CIFAR-10 data, 3D CNN on PPMI (neuroimaging) data and image segmentation using
HRNet on Cityscape data with and without adversarial attacks.

TL;DR: A deep learning framework, MIRRAMS, is proposed to handle missingness distributional shifts between training and test datasets, improving robustness and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of missingness distributional shifts in real-world data analysis to ensure robust prediction performance.

Method: Introduces MI robustness conditions and derives loss terms to formulate MIRRAMS, a mutual information regularization framework.

Result: MIRRAMS outperforms baselines, maintains stable performance across missingness scenarios, and achieves state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: MIRRAMS is a versatile, powerful framework for robust learning, applicable even in semi-supervised tasks.

Abstract: In real-world data analysis, missingness distributional shifts between
training and test input datasets frequently occur, posing a significant
challenge to achieving robust prediction performance. In this study, we propose
a novel deep learning framework designed to address such shifts in missingness
distributions. We begin by introducing a set of mutual information-based
conditions, called MI robustness conditions, which guide a prediction model to
extract label-relevant information while remaining invariant to diverse
missingness patterns, thereby enhancing robustness to unseen missingness
scenarios at test-time. To make these conditions practical, we propose simple
yet effective techniques to derive loss terms corresponding to each and
formulate a final objective function, termed MIRRAMS(Mutual Information
Regularization for Robustness Against Missingness Shifts). As a by-product, our
analysis provides a theoretical interpretation of the principles underlying
consistency regularization-based semi-supervised learning methods, such as
FixMatch. Extensive experiments across various benchmark datasets show that
MIRRAMS consistently outperforms existing baselines and maintains stable
performance across diverse missingness scenarios. Moreover, our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance even without missing data and can be
naturally extended to address semi-supervised learning tasks, highlighting
MIRRAMS as a powerful, off-the-shelf framework for general-purpose learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for batched linear bandits are either computationally prohibitive or underperform in practice.

Method: BLAE integrates arm elimination with regularized G-optimal design, using only O(log log T) batches.

Result: Achieves minimax optimal regret in all regimes (large-K and small-K) and outperforms state-of-the-art methods empirically.

Conclusion: BLAE is the first algorithm to combine theoretical optimality and practical superiority in batched linear bandits.

Abstract: We study the linear bandit problem under limited adaptivity, known as the
batched linear bandit. While existing approaches can achieve near-optimal
regret in theory, they are often computationally prohibitive or underperform in
practice. We propose \texttt{BLAE}, a novel batched algorithm that integrates
arm elimination with regularized G-optimal design, achieving the minimax
optimal regret (up to logarithmic factors in $T$) in both large-$K$ and
small-$K$ regimes for the first time, while using only $O(\log\log T)$ batches.
Our analysis introduces new techniques for batch-wise optimal design and
refined concentration bounds. Crucially, \texttt{BLAE} demonstrates low
computational overhead and strong empirical performance, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in extensive numerical evaluations. Thus,
\texttt{BLAE} is the first algorithm to combine provable minimax-optimality in
all regimes and practical superiority in batched linear bandits.

Method: The method involves redefining data depth as the minimum loss of a set of classifiers for a specific labeling of points. This framework is extended to include classifiers like SVM and logistic regression, inheriting their computational and statistical properties.

Result: The proposed 'loss depths' demonstrate computational efficiency, fast statistical convergence, and effectiveness in high-dimensional settings. Experiments confirm their utility in anomaly detection and their interpretability.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that 'loss depths' offer a versatile and interpretable extension of data depth, bridging machine learning and traditional depth concepts, with practical benefits in high-dimensional data analysis and anomaly detection.

Abstract: Data depths are score functions that quantify in an unsupervised fashion how
central is a point inside a distribution, with numerous applications such as
anomaly detection, multivariate or functional data analysis, arising across
various fields. The halfspace depth was the first depth to aim at generalising
the notion of quantile beyond the univariate case. Among the existing variety
of depth definitions, it remains one of the most used notions of data depth.
Taking a different angle from the quantile point of view, we show that the
halfspace depth can also be regarded as the minimum loss of a set of
classifiers for a specific labelling of the points. By changing the loss or the
set of classifiers considered, this new angle naturally leads to a family of
"loss depths", extending to well-studied classifiers such as, e.g., SVM or
logistic regression, among others. This framework directly inherits
computational efficiency of existing machine learning algorithms as well as
their fast statistical convergence rates, and opens the data depth realm to the
high-dimensional setting. Furthermore, the new loss depths highlight a
connection between the dataset and the right amount of complexity or simplicity
of the classifiers. The simplicity of classifiers as well as the interpretation
as a risk makes our new kind of data depth easy to explain, yet efficient for
anomaly detection, as is shown by experiments.

*Ricardo Contreras,Filip Smola,Nuša Farič,Jiawei Zheng,Jane Hillston,Jacques D. Fleuriot*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: A framework for modeling Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) of older adults integrates sensor data and contextual info to create personalized formal models, verified using Linear Temporal Logic for safety and well-being.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve quality of life for older adults living independently by providing personalized solutions based on their preferences and context.

Method: Integrates sensor data, interviews, home layouts, and observations to create formal models. Uses Linear Temporal Logic to verify personalized requirements.

Result: Demonstrates generalizability across participants, identifying violations and causes to enhance safety and well-being.

Conclusion: The framework effectively supports aging in place by personalizing and verifying ADL models for older adults.

Abstract: There is an imperative need to provide quality of life to a growing
population of older adults living independently. Personalised solutions that
focus on the person and take into consideration their preferences and context
are key. In this work, we introduce a framework for representing and reasoning
about the Activities of Daily Living of older adults living independently at
home. The framework integrates data from sensors and contextual information
that aggregates semi-structured interviews, home layouts and sociological
observations from the participants. We use these data to create formal models,
personalised for each participant according to their preferences and context.
We formulate requirements that are specific to each individual as properties
encoded in Linear Temporal Logic and use a model checker to verify whether each
property is satisfied by the model. When a property is violated, a
counterexample is generated giving the cause of the violation. We demonstrate
the framework's generalisability by applying it to different participants,
highlighting its potential to enhance the safety and well-being of older adults
ageing in place.

### [248] [Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning for Resource Allocation with Peak Age of Information Violation Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08653)
*Berire Gunes Reyhan,Sinem Coleri*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A novel safe deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for ultra-reliable Wireless Networked Control Systems (WNCSs) is proposed, ensuring constraint satisfaction while optimizing performance, with a focus on minimizing power consumption under key constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The strong interdependence between control and communication systems in WNCSs necessitates co-design, requiring a framework that ensures reliability and performance optimization.

Method: The framework combines optimization theory and safe DRL in two stages: deriving optimality conditions and employing a teacher-student DRL model to guide actions while ensuring constraint compliance.

Result: The framework outperforms benchmarks, achieving faster convergence, higher rewards, and greater stability in simulations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the co-design challenge in WNCSs, offering a reliable and efficient solution for ultra-reliable systems.

Abstract: In Wireless Networked Control Systems (WNCSs), control and communication
systems must be co-designed due to their strong interdependence. This paper
presents a novel optimization theory-based safe deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) framework for ultra-reliable WNCSs, ensuring constraint satisfaction
while optimizing performance, for the first time in the literature. The
approach minimizes power consumption under key constraints, including Peak Age
of Information (PAoI) violation probability, transmit power, and schedulability
in the finite blocklength regime. PAoI violation probability is uniquely
derived by combining stochastic maximum allowable transfer interval (MATI) and
maximum allowable packet delay (MAD) constraints in a multi-sensor network. The
framework consists of two stages: optimization theory and safe DRL. The first
stage derives optimality conditions to establish mathematical relationships
among variables, simplifying and decomposing the problem. The second stage
employs a safe DRL model where a teacher-student framework guides the DRL agent
(student). The control mechanism (teacher) evaluates compliance with system
constraints and suggests the nearest feasible action when needed. Extensive
simulations show that the proposed framework outperforms rule-based and other
optimization theory based DRL benchmarks, achieving faster convergence, higher
rewards, and greater stability.

TL;DR: The TREC Deep Learning track's third year shows continued dominance of deep neural ranking models over traditional methods, with expanded datasets but challenges in judgment completeness and label quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and advance deep learning techniques in ranking tasks using refreshed and expanded MS MARCO datasets.

Method: Leveraged MS MARCO datasets for passage and document ranking, comparing single-stage and multistage retrieval pipelines.

Result: Deep neural models outperformed traditional methods, but single-stage retrieval lagged behind multistage pipelines. Data refresh raised concerns about judgment completeness and label quality.

Conclusion: While deep learning models excel, data quality and retrieval pipeline design remain critical challenges.

Abstract: This is the third year of the TREC Deep Learning track. As in previous years,
we leverage the MS MARCO datasets that made hundreds of thousands of human
annotated training labels available for both passage and document ranking
tasks. In addition, this year we refreshed both the document and the passage
collections which also led to a nearly four times increase in the document
collection size and nearly $16$ times increase in the size of the passage
collection. Deep neural ranking models that employ large scale pretraininig
continued to outperform traditional retrieval methods this year. We also found
that single stage retrieval can achieve good performance on both tasks although
they still do not perform at par with multistage retrieval pipelines. Finally,
the increase in the collection size and the general data refresh raised some
questions about completeness of NIST judgments and the quality of the training
labels that were mapped to the new collections from the old ones which we
discuss in this report.

TL;DR: CUE-RAG improves QA performance by enhancing graph-based RAG with multi-partite indexing, hybrid extraction, and query-driven retrieval, achieving higher accuracy and cost-efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack domain-specific and up-to-date knowledge for QA, and existing graph-based RAG methods suffer from poor graph quality and inefficient retrieval.

Method: CUE-RAG introduces a multi-partite graph index, hybrid extraction, and Q-Iter retrieval strategy to improve relevance and reduce costs.

Result: CUE-RAG outperforms baselines with up to 99.33% higher accuracy and 113.51% higher F1 score, reducing indexing costs by 72.58%.

Conclusion: CUE-RAG effectively advances graph-based RAG systems, demonstrating superior performance and cost-efficiency.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), their
performance in question answering (QA) remains limited by the lack of
domain-specific and up-to-date knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
addresses this limitation by incorporating external information, often from
graph-structured data. However, existing graph-based RAG methods suffer from
poor graph quality due to incomplete extraction and insufficient utilization of
query information during retrieval. To overcome these limitations, we propose
CUE-RAG, a novel approach that introduces (1) a multi-partite graph index
incorporates text Chunks, knowledge Units, and Entities to capture semantic
content at multiple levels of granularity, (2) a hybrid extraction strategy
that reduces LLM token usage while still producing accurate and disambiguated
knowledge units, and (3) Q-Iter, a query-driven iterative retrieval strategy
that enhances relevance through semantic search and constrained graph
traversal. Experiments on three QA benchmarks show that CUE-RAG significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 99.33% higher Accuracy
and 113.51% higher F1 score while reducing indexing costs by 72.58%.
Remarkably, CUE-RAG matches or outperforms baselines even without using an LLM
for indexing. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and cost-efficiency
of CUE-RAG in advancing graph-based RAG systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many quantitative facts are buried in unstructured documents, making them hard to access for data-driven decisions.

Method: A framework using description parsing to convert text into structured (description, quantity) pairs, aided by a paraphrase dataset built with weak supervision.

Result: Top-1 retrieval accuracy improved from 30.98% to 64.66% on financial reports and annotated datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively retrieves quantitative facts, enhancing accessibility for decision-making.

Abstract: Quantitative facts are continually generated by companies and governments,
supporting data-driven decision-making. While common facts are structured, many
long-tail quantitative facts remain buried in unstructured documents, making
them difficult to access. We propose the task of Quantity Retrieval: given a
description of a quantitative fact, the system returns the relevant value and
supporting evidence. Understanding quantity semantics in context is essential
for this task. We introduce a framework based on description parsing that
converts text into structured (description, quantity) pairs for effective
retrieval. To improve learning, we construct a large paraphrase dataset using
weak supervision based on quantity co-occurrence. We evaluate our approach on a
large corpus of financial annual reports and a newly annotated quantity
description dataset. Our method significantly improves top-1 retrieval accuracy
from 30.98 percent to 64.66 percent.

Motivation: Accurate segmentation is crucial for wound management and automated assessment, but challenges like class imbalance and variability persist.

Method: The study integrates channel-wise (SCSE) and spatial attention mechanisms, uses EfficientNet-B7 as the encoder backbone, and employs data augmentation, Bayesian hyperparameter tuning, and model ensembling with Test Time Augmentation.

Result: The approach achieved a weighted F1-score of 0.8640 on a benchmark dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed dual-attention U-Net++ architecture is effective for complex medical segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of wounds and scale markers in clinical images remainsa
significant challenge, crucial for effective wound management and
automatedassessment. In this study, we propose a novel dual-attention U-Net++
archi-tecture, integrating channel-wise (SCSE) and spatial attention mechanisms
toaddress severe class imbalance and variability in medical images
effectively.Initially, extensive benchmarking across diverse architectures and
encoders via 5-fold cross-validation identified EfficientNet-B7 as the optimal
encoder backbone.Subsequently, we independently trained two class-specific
models with tailoredpreprocessing, extensive data augmentation, and Bayesian
hyperparameter tun-ing (WandB sweeps). The final model ensemble utilized Test
Time Augmentationto further enhance prediction reliability. Our approach was
evaluated on a bench-mark dataset from the NBC 2025 & PCBBE 2025 competition.
Segmentationperformance was quantified using a weighted F1-score (75% wounds,

TL;DR: The study explores MS-LiDAR data for forest segmentation using deep learning and machine learning models, with KPConv showing superior accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To streamline forest inventory by leveraging MS-LiDAR for precise segmentation of forest components.

Method: Implemented three 3D deep learning models (KPConv, Superpoint Transformer, Point Transformer V3) and one machine learning model (Random Forest) on HeliALS MS-LiDAR data.

Result: KPConv outperformed others; using all three wavelengths improved mIoU by 33.73% and mAcc by 32.35%.

Conclusion: MS-LiDAR enhances automated forest segmentation accuracy, demonstrating its potential for forest inventory.

Abstract: Conservation and decision-making regarding forest resources necessitate
regular forest inventory. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) in laser scanning
systems has gained significant attention over the past two decades as a remote
and non-destructive solution to streamline the labor-intensive and
time-consuming procedure of forest inventory. Advanced multispectral (MS) LiDAR
systems simultaneously acquire three-dimensional (3D) spatial and spectral
information across multiple wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum.
Consequently, MS-LiDAR technology enables the estimation of both the
biochemical and biophysical characteristics of forests. Forest component
segmentation is crucial for forest inventory. The synergistic use of spatial
and spectral laser information has proven to be beneficial for achieving
precise forest semantic segmentation. Thus, this study aims to investigate the
potential of MS-LiDAR data, captured by the HeliALS system, providing
high-density multispectral point clouds to segment forests into six components:
ground, low vegetation, trunks, branches, foliage, and woody debris. Three
point-wise 3D deep learning models and one machine learning model, including
kernel point convolution, superpoint transformer, point transformer V3, and
random forest, are implemented. Our experiments confirm the superior accuracy
of the KPConv model. Additionally, various geometric and spectral feature
vector scenarios are examined. The highest accuracy is achieved by feeding all
three wavelengths (1550 nm, 905 nm, and 532 nm) as the initial features into
the deep learning model, resulting in improvements of 33.73% and 32.35% in mean
intersection over union (mIoU) and in mean accuracy (mAcc), respectively. This
study highlights the excellent potential of multispectral LiDAR for improving
the accuracy in fully automated forest component segmentation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method for histopathological WSI analysis by solving an instance jigsaw puzzle problem, outperforming traditional MIL approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MIL's permutation invariance limits its ability to capture semantic correlations between instances in WSIs.

Method: Proposes a Siamese network to restore the order of shuffled instances, termed as cracking an instance jigsaw puzzle, justified by optimal transport theory.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art MIL methods in WSI classification and survival prediction tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively uncovers semantic correlations between instances, offering a superior alternative to permutation-invariant MIL approaches.

Abstract: While multiple instance learning (MIL) has shown to be a promising approach
for histopathological whole slide image (WSI) analysis, its reliance on
permutation invariance significantly limits its capacity to effectively uncover
semantic correlations between instances within WSIs. Based on our empirical and
theoretical investigations, we argue that approaches that are not
permutation-invariant but better capture spatial correlations between instances
can offer more effective solutions. In light of these findings, we propose a
novel alternative to existing MIL for WSI analysis by learning to restore the
order of instances from their randomly shuffled arrangement. We term this task
as cracking an instance jigsaw puzzle problem, where semantic correlations
between instances are uncovered. To tackle the instance jigsaw puzzles, we
propose a novel Siamese network solution, which is theoretically justified by
optimal transport theory. We validate the proposed method on WSI classification
and survival prediction tasks, where the proposed method outperforms the recent
state-of-the-art MIL competitors. The code is available at

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Depth-Sequence Transformer (DST) for segment-specific intracranial carotid artery calcification (ICAC) analysis, achieving high accuracy in landmark localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ICAC volume metrics ignore plaque location's critical influence, and finer-grained segment-specific quantification is technically challenging.

Method: The DST framework processes full-resolution CT volumes as 2D slice sequences, predicting key anatomical landmarks via parallel probabilistic localization.

Result: DST achieves a Mean Absolute Error of 0.1 slices, with 96% predictions within ±1 slice tolerance, and excels on the Clean-CC-CCII benchmark.

Conclusion: DST is the first practical tool for automated segment-specific ICAC analysis, enabling further studies on location-specific biomarkers.

Abstract: While total intracranial carotid artery calcification (ICAC) volume is an
established stroke biomarker, growing evidence shows this aggregate metric
ignores the critical influence of plaque location, since calcification in
different segments carries distinct prognostic and procedural risks. However, a
finer-grained, segment-specific quantification has remained technically
infeasible. Conventional 3D models are forced to process downsampled volumes or
isolated patches, sacrificing the global context required to resolve anatomical
ambiguity and render reliable landmark localization. To overcome this, we
reformulate the 3D challenge as a \textbf{Parallel Probabilistic Landmark
Localization} task along the 1D axial dimension. We propose the
\textbf{Depth-Sequence Transformer (DST)}, a framework that processes
full-resolution CT volumes as sequences of 2D slices, learning to predict $N=6$
independent probability distributions that pinpoint key anatomical landmarks.
Our DST framework demonstrates exceptional accuracy and robustness. Evaluated
on a 100-patient clinical cohort with rigorous 5-fold cross-validation, it
achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of \textbf{0.1 slices}, with \textbf{96\%}
of predictions falling within a $\pm1$ slice tolerance. Furthermore, to
validate its architectural power, the DST backbone establishes the best result
on the public Clean-CC-CCII classification benchmark under an end-to-end
evaluation protocol. Our work delivers the first practical tool for automated
segment-specific ICAC analysis. The proposed framework provides a foundation
for further studies on the role of location-specific biomarkers in diagnosis,
prognosis, and procedural planning. Our code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: Raptor, a train-free method, generates embeddings for volumetric data using a frozen 2D model and random projections, outperforming state-of-the-art methods without costly training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in training foundational models for volumetric imaging data due to computational complexity and dataset curation.

Method: Raptor uses a frozen 2D foundation model to extract visual tokens from medical volume cross-sections, compressing them with random projections.

Result: Raptor outperforms state-of-the-art methods (+3% to +14% across tasks) without requiring training.

Conclusion: Raptor is effective and versatile for advancing deep learning in medical volumes.

Abstract: Current challenges in developing foundational models for volumetric imaging
data, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), stem from the computational
complexity of training state-of-the-art architectures in high dimensions and
curating sufficiently large datasets of volumes. To address these challenges,
we introduce Raptor (Random Planar Tensor Reduction), a train-free method for
generating semantically rich embeddings for volumetric data. Raptor leverages a
frozen 2D foundation model, pretrained on natural images, to extract visual
tokens from individual cross-sections of medical volumes. These tokens are then
spatially compressed using random projections, significantly reducing
computational complexity while retaining semantic information. Extensive
experiments on ten diverse medical volume tasks verify the superior performance
of Raptor over state-of-the-art methods, including those pretrained exclusively
on medical volumes (+3% SuPreM, +6% MISFM, +10% Merlin, +13% VoCo, and +14%
SLIViT), while entirely bypassing the need for costly training. Our results
highlight the effectiveness and versatility of Raptor as a foundation for
advancing deep learning-based methods for medical volumes.

TL;DR: A prompt engineering-based approach using Generative AI (GenAI) to create proto-personas improves efficiency and quality in Product Discovery, though challenges like generalization and empathy variation remain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual proto-persona creation is time-consuming, cognitively demanding, and biased, prompting the need for an automated solution.

Method: A case study with 19 participants in a Lean Inception, using qualitative and quantitative methods to evaluate the GenAI approach.

Result: The approach reduced time/effort and improved persona quality/reusability, but faced issues with generalization and inconsistent empathy elicitation.

Conclusion: GenAI can enhance Product Discovery, but future work must address domain specificity and empathy consistency.

Abstract: Proto-personas are commonly used during early-stage Product Discovery, such
as Lean Inception, to guide product definition and stakeholder alignment.
However, the manual creation of proto-personas is often time-consuming,
cognitively demanding, and prone to bias. In this paper, we propose and
empirically investigate a prompt engineering-based approach to generate
proto-personas with the support of Generative AI (GenAI). Our goal is to
evaluate the approach in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, user acceptance,
and the empathy elicited by the generated personas. We conducted a case study
with 19 participants embedded in a real Lean Inception, employing a qualitative
and quantitative methods design. The results reveal the approach's efficiency
by reducing time and effort and improving the quality and reusability of
personas in later discovery phases, such as Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
scoping and feature refinement. While acceptance was generally high, especially
regarding perceived usefulness and ease of use, participants noted limitations
related to generalization and domain specificity. Furthermore, although
cognitive empathy was strongly supported, affective and behavioral empathy
varied significantly across participants. These results contribute novel
empirical evidence on how GenAI can be effectively integrated into software
Product Discovery practices, while also identifying key challenges to be
addressed in future iterations of such hybrid design processes.

*Zezhen Xiang,Jingzhi Gong,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: DHDA is an online framework for learning configuration-performance models in dynamic environments, addressing global and local concept drifts through hierarchical adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic environments cause unpredictable concept drifts in software systems, making offline and transfer learning ineffective for real-time adaptation.

Method: DHDA uses dually hierarchical adaptation: upper-level redivision for global drifts and lower-level local model adaptation for local drifts, combining incremental updates and periodic retraining.

Result: DHDA outperforms state-of-the-art methods with 2x better accuracy, effectively adapting to drifts with reasonable overhead.

Conclusion: DHDA provides a robust solution for real-time configuration-performance learning in dynamic environments, improving adaptability and accuracy.

Abstract: Modern configurable software systems need to learn models that correlate
configuration and performance. However, when the system operates in dynamic
environments, the workload variations, hardware changes, and system updates
will inevitably introduce concept drifts at different levels - global drifts,
which reshape the performance landscape of the entire configuration space; and
local drifts, which only affect certain sub-regions of that space. As such,
existing offline and transfer learning approaches can struggle to adapt to
these implicit and unpredictable changes in real-time, rendering configuration
performance learning challenging. To address this, we propose DHDA, an online
configuration performance learning framework designed to capture and adapt to
these drifts at different levels. The key idea is that DHDA adapts to both the
local and global drifts using dually hierarchical adaptation: at the upper
level, we redivide the data into different divisions, within each of which the
local model is retrained, to handle global drifts only when necessary. At the
lower level, the local models of the divisions can detect local drifts and
adapt themselves asynchronously. To balance responsiveness and efficiency, DHDA
combines incremental updates with periodic full retraining to minimize
redundant computation when no drifts are detected. Through evaluating eight
software systems and against state-of-the-art approaches, we show that DHDA
achieves considerably better accuracy and can effectively adapt to drifts with
up to 2x improvements, while incurring reasonable overhead and is able to
improve different local models in handling concept drift.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study compares LLM-based thematic analysis (using GPT-4o and RISEN framework) with traditional human analysis in mental health interviews, finding LLMs cost-effective but less deep.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the resource-intensive nature of thematic analysis in large healthcare studies by evaluating LLMs' potential.

Method: Compared out-of-the-box and knowledge-base LLMs with human analysis using transcripts from a stress-reduction trial, assessing coding, saturation, and theme synthesis.

Result: LLMs matched human deductive coding but lagged in inductive coding and theme depth. Knowledge-based LLMs reached saturation faster.

Conclusion: LLMs offer scalable, cost-effective qualitative analysis but require human oversight for depth and participant perspective balance.

Abstract: Thematic analysis provides valuable insights into participants' experiences
through coding and theme development, but its resource-intensive nature limits
its use in large healthcare studies. Large language models (LLMs) can analyze
text at scale and identify key content automatically, potentially addressing
these challenges. However, their application in mental health interviews needs
comparison with traditional human analysis. This study evaluates out-of-the-box
and knowledge-base LLM-based thematic analysis against traditional methods
using transcripts from a stress-reduction trial with healthcare workers.
OpenAI's GPT-4o model was used along with the Role, Instructions, Steps,
End-Goal, Narrowing (RISEN) prompt engineering framework and compared to human
analysis in Dedoose. Each approach developed codes, noted saturation points,
applied codes to excerpts for a subset of participants (n = 20), and
synthesized data into themes. Outputs and performance metrics were compared
directly. LLMs using the RISEN framework developed deductive parent codes
similar to human codes, but humans excelled in inductive child code development
and theme synthesis. Knowledge-based LLMs reached coding saturation with fewer
transcripts (10-15) than the out-of-the-box model (15-20) and humans (90-99).
The out-of-the-box LLM identified a comparable number of excerpts to human
researchers, showing strong inter-rater reliability (K = 0.84), though the
knowledge-based LLM produced fewer excerpts. Human excerpts were longer and
involved multiple codes per excerpt, while LLMs typically applied one code.
Overall, LLM-based thematic analysis proved more cost-effective but lacked the
depth of human analysis. LLMs can transform qualitative analysis in mental
healthcare and clinical research when combined with human oversight to balance
participant perspectives and research resources.

*Evgenii Rudakov,Jonathan Shock,Otto Lappi,Benjamin Ultan Cowley*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: SSSUMO is a semi-supervised deep learning method for submovement decomposition, achieving high accuracy and real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing submovement analysis methods face challenges in accuracy, computational cost, and validation due to limited labeled data.

Method: Uses a semi-supervised framework with synthetic data (from minimum-jerk principles) refined by unlabeled human movement data, employing a fully convolutional architecture.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on synthetic and human motion datasets, operates in real-time (<1ms per input second), and excels in high-noise conditions.

Conclusion: SSSUMO enables new applications in HCI, rehabilitation, and motor control, demonstrating effectiveness across diverse tasks and datasets.

Abstract: This paper introduces a SSSUMO, semi-supervised deep learning approach for
submovement decomposition that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and speed.
While submovement analysis offers valuable insights into motor control,
existing methods struggle with reconstruction accuracy, computational cost, and
validation, due to the difficulty of obtaining hand-labeled data. We address
these challenges using a semi-supervised learning framework. This framework
learns from synthetic data, initially generated from minimum-jerk principles
and then iteratively refined through adaptation to unlabeled human movement
data. Our fully convolutional architecture with differentiable reconstruction
significantly surpasses existing methods on both synthetic and diverse human
motion datasets, demonstrating robustness even in high-noise conditions.
Crucially, the model operates in real-time (less than a millisecond per input
second), a substantial improvement over optimization-based techniques. This
enhanced performance facilitates new applications in human-computer
interaction, rehabilitation medicine, and motor control studies. We demonstrate
the model's effectiveness across diverse human-performed tasks such as
steering, rotation, pointing, object moving, handwriting, and mouse-controlled
gaming, showing notable improvements particularly on challenging datasets where
traditional methods largely fail. Training and benchmarking source code, along
with pre-trained model weights, are made publicly available at

TL;DR: A dataset for studying user attention and purchasing behavior on SERPs, using eye-tracking for objective ground-truth, includes HTML, screenshots, eye/mouse movements, and ad bounding boxes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of previous work relying on mouse movements and self-reported labels, which can be inaccurate and biased.

Method: Collected data from 47 participants for 2,776 queries, using eye-tracking for continuous visual attention, and included HTML, screenshots, and movement data.

Result: Constructed a comprehensive dataset with objective ground-truth for attention and behavior analysis, along with preprocessing scripts.

Conclusion: Provides a valuable resource for future research on SERP user behavior, with baseline experiments to inspire further work.

Abstract: We contribute a comprehensive dataset to study user attention and purchasing
behavior on Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs). Previous work has relied on
mouse movements as a low-cost large-scale behavioral proxy but also has relied
on self-reported ground-truth labels, collected at post-task, which can be
inaccurate and prone to biases. To address this limitation, we use an eye
tracker to construct an objective ground-truth of continuous visual attention.
Our dataset comprises 2,776 transactional queries on Google SERPs, collected
from 47 participants, and includes: (1) HTML source files, with CSS and images;
(2) rendered SERP screenshots; (3) eye movement data; (4) mouse movement data;
(5) bounding boxes of direct display and organic advertisements; and (6)
scripts for further preprocessing the data. In this paper we provide an
overview of the dataset and baseline experiments (classification tasks) that
can inspire researchers about the different possibilities for future work.

*Md. Saif Hassan Onim,Andrew M. Kiselica,Himanshu Thapliyal*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper explores an edge-based, non-intrusive method for emotion detection in older adults using physiological signals from wearable sensors, achieving high accuracy without cameras.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding cognitive and emotional well-being in older adults, especially in hospital and assisted living environments, is critical. The study aims to avoid intrusive methods like facial analysis.

Method: Uses physiological signals from Empatica E4 and Shimmer3 GSR+ wristbands, combined with machine learning models, to predict emotional states.

Result: Achieved a 0.782 r2 score and 0.0006 MSE, validating the feasibility of the approach.

Conclusion: The method is promising for privacy-preserving emotion recognition, particularly for individuals with ADRD or PTSD.

Abstract: Emotion detection in older adults is crucial for understanding their
cognitive and emotional well-being, especially in hospital and assisted living
environments. In this work, we investigate an edge-based, non-obtrusive
approach to emotion identification that uses only physiological signals
obtained via wearable sensors. Our dataset includes data from 40 older
individuals. Emotional states were obtained using physiological signals from
the Empatica E4 and Shimmer3 GSR+ wristband and facial expressions were
recorded using camera-based emotion recognition with the iMotion's Facial
Expression Analysis (FEA) module. The dataset also contains twelve emotion
categories in terms of relative intensities. We aim to study how well emotion
recognition can be accomplished using simply physiological sensor data, without
the requirement for cameras or intrusive facial analysis. By leveraging
classical machine learning models, we predict the intensity of emotional
responses based on physiological signals. We achieved the highest 0.782 r2
score with the lowest 0.0006 MSE on the regression task. This method has
significant implications for individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related
Dementia (ADRD), as well as veterans coping with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
(PTSD) or other cognitive impairments. Our results across multiple classical
regression models validate the feasibility of this method, paving the way for
privacy-preserving and efficient emotion recognition systems in real-world
settings.

Result: Demonstrated in TKR rehabilitation with 263 videos; provides visual and VLM feedback, supports impairments, and is modular.

Conclusion: AIRS is a versatile, privacy-compliant AI solution for home rehabilitation, adaptable to broader contexts.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Ambient Intelligence Rehabilitation Support (AIRS)
framework, an advanced artificial intelligence-based solution tailored for home
rehabilitation environments. AIRS integrates cutting-edge technologies,
including Real-Time 3D Reconstruction (RT-3DR), intelligent navigation, and
large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), to create a comprehensive system for
machine-guided physical rehabilitation. The general AIRS framework is
demonstrated in rehabilitation scenarios following total knee replacement
(TKR), utilizing a database of 263 video recordings for evaluation. A
smartphone is employed within AIRS to perform RT-3DR of living spaces and has a
body-matched avatar to provide visual feedback about the excercise. This avatar
is necessary in (a) optimizing exercise configurations, including camera
placement, patient positioning, and initial poses, and (b) addressing privacy
concerns and promoting compliance with the AI Act. The system guides users
through the recording process to ensure the collection of properly recorded
videos. AIRS employs two feedback mechanisms: (i) visual 3D feedback, enabling
direct comparisons between prerecorded clinical exercises and patient home
recordings and (ii) VLM-generated feedback, providing detailed explanations and
corrections for exercise errors. The framework also supports people with visual
and hearing impairments. It also features a modular design that can be adapted
to broader rehabilitation contexts. AIRS software components are available for
further use and customization.

### [267] [Entity-Specific Cyber Risk Assessment using InsurTech Empowered Risk Factors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08193)
*Jiayi Guo,Zhiyun Quan,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: q-fin.RM

TL;DR: The paper addresses the lack of high-quality cyber incident data by proposing an InsurTech framework that enriches datasets with entity-specific attributes. It uses ML models for incident prediction and frequency estimation, enhancing robustness and transparency in cyber risk assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reluctance of companies to disclose cyber incidents limits empirical research and predictive modeling. Existing datasets lack entity-specific features, hindering accurate risk assessment.

Method: A novel InsurTech framework is introduced, incorporating entity-specific attributes. ML models (multilabel classification and multioutput regression) predict incident types and frequencies. Interpretable ML techniques validate risk factors.

Result: InsurTech features improve prediction robustness compared to conventional factors. No significant correlations among incident types were found. The framework supports customized underwriting and proactive risk mitigation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances cyber risk assessment by providing transparent, data-driven insights for insurers and organizations, aiding decision-making and compliance planning.

Abstract: The lack of high-quality public cyber incident data limits empirical research
and predictive modeling for cyber risk assessment. This challenge persists due
to the reluctance of companies to disclose incidents that could damage their
reputation or investor confidence. Therefore, from an actuarial perspective,
potential resolutions conclude two aspects: the enhancement of existing cyber
incident datasets and the implementation of advanced modeling techniques to
optimize the use of the available data. A review of existing data-driven
methods highlights a significant lack of entity-specific organizational
features in publicly available datasets. To address this gap, we propose a
novel InsurTech framework that enriches cyber incident data with
entity-specific attributes. We develop various machine learning (ML) models: a
multilabel classification model to predict the occurrence of cyber incident
types (e.g., Privacy Violation, Data Breach, Fraud and Extortion, IT Error, and
Others) and a multioutput regression model to estimate their annual
frequencies. While classifier and regressor chains are implemented to explore
dependencies among cyber incident types as well, no significant correlations
are observed in our datasets. Besides, we apply multiple interpretable ML
techniques to identify and cross-validate potential risk factors developed by
InsurTech across ML models. We find that InsurTech empowered features enhance
prediction occurrence and frequency estimation robustness compared to only
using conventional risk factors. The framework generates transparent,
entity-specific cyber risk profiles, supporting customized underwriting and
proactive cyber risk mitigation. It provides insurers and organizations with
data-driven insights to support decision-making and compliance planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a unified physical explanation for the emergence of consciousness in neural networks by leveraging principles from jamming physics.

Method: Develops a neural jamming phase diagram using analogies to jamming transitions, identifying temperature, volume fraction, and stress as key control parameters.

Result: Demonstrates that computational cooling, density optimization, and noise reduction drive systems toward a critical jamming surface where generalized intelligence emerges.

Conclusion: Consciousness in neural networks is likened to a jamming phase, with shared critical signatures like divergent correlation lengths, suggesting a deep connection between jamming physics and emergent intelligence.

Abstract: This paper develops a neural jamming phase diagram that interprets the
emergence of consciousness in large language models as a critical phenomenon in
high-dimensional disordered systems.By establishing analogies with jamming
transitions in granular matter and other complex systems, we identify three
fundamental control parameters governing the phase behavior of neural networks:
temperature, volume fraction, and stress.The theory provides a unified physical
explanation for empirical scaling laws in artificial intelligence,
demonstrating how computational cooling, density optimization, and noise
reduction collectively drive systems toward a critical jamming surface where
generalized intelligence emerges. Remarkably, the same thermodynamic principles
that describe conventional jamming transitions appear to underlie the emergence
of consciousness in neural networks, evidenced by shared critical signatures
including divergent correlation lengths and scaling exponents.Our work explains
neural language models' critical scaling through jamming physics, suggesting
consciousness is a jamming phase that intrinsically connects knowledge
components via long-range correlations.

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: AmpLyze predicts HC50 values for antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) from sequence alone, outperforming existing models with a PCC of 0.756 and MSE of 0.987. It uses dual local/global branches with cross-attention and provides interpretable residue-level insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models for AMP toxicity only classify peptides as 'toxic' or 'non-toxic,' lacking quantitative HC50 predictions and interpretability. AmpLyze addresses this gap.

Method: AmpLyze combines residue-level ProtT5/ESM2 embeddings with sequence-level descriptors in dual branches, aligned by cross-attention and trained with log-cosh loss for robustness.

Result: The model achieves a PCC of 0.756 and MSE of 0.987, outperforming classical regressors and state-of-the-art methods. Cross-attention improves performance by 1% PCC and 3% MSE.

Conclusion: AmpLyze enables quantitative, sequence-based, and interpretable hemolysis assessment, aiding AMP design and early-stage toxicity screening.

Abstract: Red-blood-cell lysis (HC50) is the principal safety barrier for
antimicrobial-peptide (AMP) therapeutics, yet existing models only say "toxic"
or "non-toxic." AmpLyze closes this gap by predicting the actual HC50 value
from sequence alone and explaining the residues that drive toxicity. The model
couples residue-level ProtT5/ESM2 embeddings with sequence-level descriptors in
dual local and global branches, aligned by a cross-attention module and trained
with log-cosh loss for robustness to assay noise. The optimal AmpLyze model
reaches a PCC of 0.756 and an MSE of 0.987, outperforming classical regressors
and the state-of-the-art. Ablations confirm that both branches are essential,
and cross-attention adds a further 1% PCC and 3% MSE improvement.
Expected-Gradients attributions reveal known toxicity hotspots and suggest
safer substitutions. By turning hemolysis assessment into a quantitative,
sequence-based, and interpretable prediction, AmpLyze facilitates AMP design
and offers a practical tool for early-stage toxicity screening.

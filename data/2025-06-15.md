### [2] [LoRA-Edit: Controllable First-Frame-Guided Video Editing via Mask-Aware LoRA Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10082)
*Chenjian Gao,Lihe Ding,Xin Cai,Zhanpeng Huang,Zibin Wang,Tianfan Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A mask-based LoRA tuning method is proposed for flexible video editing using pretrained I2V models, preserving backgrounds while enabling controllable edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video editing methods rely on large-scale pretraining and lack flexibility for specific edits, especially beyond the first frame.

Method: The approach uses mask-driven LoRA tuning to adapt pretrained I2V models, incorporating reference images and spatial masks for region-specific learning.

Result: The method achieves superior video editing performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed solution offers efficient, adaptable video editing without altering model architecture, addressing flexibility and control challenges.

Abstract: Video editing using diffusion models has achieved remarkable results in
generating high-quality edits for videos. However, current methods often rely
on large-scale pretraining, limiting flexibility for specific edits.
First-frame-guided editing provides control over the first frame, but lacks
flexibility over subsequent frames. To address this, we propose a mask-based
LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) tuning method that adapts pretrained Image-to-Video
(I2V) models for flexible video editing. Our approach preserves background
regions while enabling controllable edits propagation. This solution offers
efficient and adaptable video editing without altering the model architecture.
To better steer this process, we incorporate additional references, such as
alternate viewpoints or representative scene states, which serve as visual
anchors for how content should unfold. We address the control challenge using a
mask-driven LoRA tuning strategy that adapts a pre-trained image-to-video model
to the editing context. The model must learn from two distinct sources: the
input video provides spatial structure and motion cues, while reference images
offer appearance guidance. A spatial mask enables region-specific learning by
dynamically modulating what the model attends to, ensuring that each area draws
from the appropriate source. Experimental results show our method achieves
superior video editing performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### [3] [DeepTraverse: A Depth-First Search Inspired Network for Algorithmic Visual Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10084)
*Bin Guo,John H. L. Hansen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepTraverse introduces a vision architecture inspired by algorithmic search, enabling adaptive, iterative feature refinement for improved interpretability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited adaptability and interpretability of conventional vision backbones by integrating algorithmic search principles.

Method: Uses recursive exploration modules for systematic feature analysis and adaptive calibration modules for dynamic salience adjustment.

Result: Achieves competitive accuracy and robust feature discrimination, often outperforming conventional models.

Conclusion: Algorithmic priors offer a principled strategy for efficient, performant, and structured vision backbones.

Abstract: Conventional vision backbones, despite their success, often construct
features through a largely uniform cascade of operations, offering limited
explicit pathways for adaptive, iterative refinement. This raises a compelling
question: can principles from classical search algorithms instill a more
algorithmic, structured, and logical processing flow within these networks,
leading to representations built through more interpretable, perhaps
reasoning-like decision processes? We introduce DeepTraverse, a novel vision
architecture directly inspired by algorithmic search strategies, enabling it to
learn features through a process of systematic elucidation and adaptive
refinement distinct from conventional approaches. DeepTraverse operationalizes
this via two key synergistic components: recursive exploration modules that
methodically deepen feature analysis along promising representational paths
with parameter sharing for efficiency, and adaptive calibration modules that
dynamically adjust feature salience based on evolving global context. The
resulting algorithmic interplay allows DeepTraverse to intelligently construct
and refine feature patterns. Comprehensive evaluations across a diverse suite
of image classification benchmarks show that DeepTraverse achieves highly
competitive classification accuracy and robust feature discrimination, often
outperforming conventional models with similar or larger parameter counts. Our
work demonstrates that integrating such algorithmic priors provides a
principled and effective strategy for building more efficient, performant, and
structured vision backbones.

### [4] [Test-Time Adaptation for Generalizable Task Progress Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10085)
*Christos Ziakas,Alessandra Russo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A test-time adaptation method improves progress estimation by optimizing a self-supervised objective, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance progress estimation models by enabling online adaptation to visual and temporal contexts during testing.

Method: Uses gradient-based meta-learning trained on expert trajectories and task descriptions, focusing on semantic content over temporal order.

Result: Generalizes well to diverse out-of-distribution tasks, environments, and embodiments, surpassing autoregressive vision-language models.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively adapts and improves progress estimation, demonstrating superior performance in varied contexts.

Abstract: We propose a test-time adaptation method that enables a progress estimation
model to adapt online to the visual and temporal context of test trajectories
by optimizing a learned self-supervised objective. To this end, we introduce a
gradient-based meta-learning strategy to train the model on expert visual
trajectories and their natural language task descriptions, such that test-time
adaptation improves progress estimation relying on semantic content over
temporal order. Our test-time adaptation method generalizes from a single
training environment to diverse out-of-distribution tasks, environments, and
embodiments, outperforming the state-of-the-art in-context learning approach
using autoregressive vision-language models.

### [5] [EfficientVLA: Training-Free Acceleration and Compression for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10100)
*Yantai Yang,Yuhao Wang,Zichen Wen,Luo Zhongwei,Chang Zou,Zhipeng Zhang,Chuan Wen,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EfficientVLA is a training-free framework that accelerates Vision-Language-Action models by addressing computational and memory redundancies, achieving significant speedup and efficiency gains with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing acceleration efforts for VLA models are fragmented and fail to address the holistic computational and memory bottlenecks, limiting practical deployability.

Method: EfficientVLA integrates three strategies: pruning redundant language layers, optimizing visual token selection, and caching intermediate features in the diffusion-based action head.

Result: Applied to CogACT, EfficientVLA achieves a 1.93X speedup, reduces FLOPs to 28.9%, and only drops success rate by 0.6% in the SIMPLER benchmark.

Conclusion: EfficientVLA provides a holistic and efficient solution for accelerating VLA models, making them more practical for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, particularly diffusion-based
architectures, demonstrate transformative potential for embodied intelligence
but are severely hampered by high computational and memory demands stemming
from extensive inherent and inference-time redundancies. While existing
acceleration efforts often target isolated inefficiencies, such piecemeal
solutions typically fail to holistically address the varied computational and
memory bottlenecks across the entire VLA pipeline, thereby limiting practical
deployability. We introduce EfficientVLA, a structured and training-free
inference acceleration framework that systematically eliminates these barriers
by cohesively exploiting multifaceted redundancies. EfficientVLA
synergistically integrates three targeted strategies: (1) pruning of
functionally inconsequential layers from the language module, guided by an
analysis of inter-layer redundancies; (2) optimizing the visual processing
pathway through a task-aware strategy that selects a compact, diverse set of
visual tokens, balancing task-criticality with informational coverage; and (3)
alleviating temporal computational redundancy within the iterative
diffusion-based action head by strategically caching and reusing key
intermediate features. We apply our method to a standard VLA model CogACT,
yielding a 1.93X inference speedup and reduces FLOPs to 28.9%, with only a 0.6%
success rate drop in the SIMPLER benchmark.

### [6] [A Manually Annotated Image-Caption Dataset for Detecting Children in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10117)
*Klim Kireev,Ana-Maria Creţu,Raphael Meier,Sarah Adel Bargal,Elissa Redmiles,Carmela Troncoso*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ICCWD, a dataset for benchmarking tools that detect depictions of minors in multi-modal content, addressing a gap in existing resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods lack a standardized dataset for evaluating minor detection tools in diverse contexts, prompting the creation of ICCWD.

Method: The authors compiled 10,000 image-caption pairs, manually labeled for child presence, and benchmarked three detectors, including a commercial age estimation system.

Result: Child detection proved challenging, with the best method achieving a 75.3% true positive rate.

Conclusion: ICCWD aims to improve minor detection methods by providing a comprehensive benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Platforms and the law regulate digital content depicting minors (defined as
individuals under 18 years of age) differently from other types of content.
Given the sheer amount of content that needs to be assessed, machine
learning-based automation tools are commonly used to detect content depicting
minors. To our knowledge, no dataset or benchmark currently exists for
detecting these identification methods in a multi-modal environment. To fill
this gap, we release the Image-Caption Children in the Wild Dataset (ICCWD), an
image-caption dataset aimed at benchmarking tools that detect depictions of
minors. Our dataset is richer than previous child image datasets, containing
images of children in a variety of contexts, including fictional depictions and
partially visible bodies. ICCWD contains 10,000 image-caption pairs manually
labeled to indicate the presence or absence of a child in the image. To
demonstrate the possible utility of our dataset, we use it to benchmark three
different detectors, including a commercial age estimation system applied to
images. Our results suggest that child detection is a challenging task, with
the best method achieving a 75.3% true positive rate. We hope the release of
our dataset will aid in the design of better minor detection methods in a wide
range of scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Comparison of CNNs and ViTs for psoriasis lesion classification shows ViTs, especially DaViT-B, outperform with a 96.4% f1-score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of CNNs and ViTs in classifying psoriasis and similar lesions in medical images.

Method: Pre-trained CNNs and ViTs were adapted to a specific dataset for multi-class image classification.

Result: ViTs, particularly DaViT-B, achieved superior performance (96.4% f1-score) with smaller models.

Conclusion: ViTs, especially DaViT-B, are recommended for efficient automated psoriasis detection, highlighting their potential in medical image tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a comparison of the performance of Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) in the task of multi-classifying
images containing lesions of psoriasis and diseases similar to it. Models
pre-trained on ImageNet were adapted to a specific data set. Both achieved high
predictive metrics, but the ViTs stood out for their superior performance with
smaller models. Dual Attention Vision Transformer-Base (DaViT-B) obtained the
best results, with an f1-score of 96.4%, and is recommended as the most
efficient architecture for automated psoriasis detection. This article
reinforces the potential of ViTs for medical image classification tasks.

### [8] [ViCrit: A Verifiable Reinforcement Learning Proxy Task for Visual Perception in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10128)
*Xiyao Wang,Zhengyuan Yang,Chao Feng,Yongyuan Liang,Yuhang Zhou,Xiaoyu Liu,Ziyi Zang,Ming Li,Chung-Ching Lin,Kevin Lin,Linjie Li,Furong Huang,Lijuan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViCrit introduces an RL task for VLMs to localize subtle synthetic hallucinations in captions, improving visual perception and transferability to diverse benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending RL success from LLMs to VLMs is hindered by the lack of challenging yet verifiable vision-centric tasks.

Method: ViCrit trains VLMs to detect and localize subtle synthetic errors in captions, using binary rewards for exact matches.

Result: Models show significant gains on VL benchmarks and transferability to abstract reasoning and visual math.

Conclusion: Fine-grained hallucination criticism effectively enhances visual perception in VLMs, as demonstrated by ViCrit-Bench.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great effectiveness for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs) using tasks that are challenging yet easily
verifiable, such as math reasoning or code generation. However, extending this
success to visual perception in vision-language models (VLMs) has been impeded
by the scarcity of vision-centric tasks that are simultaneously challenging and
unambiguously verifiable. To this end, we introduce ViCrit (Visual Caption
Hallucination Critic), an RL proxy task that trains VLMs to localize a subtle,
synthetic visual hallucination injected into paragraphs of human-written image
captions. Starting from a 200-word captions, we inject a single, subtle visual
description error-altering a few words on objects, attributes, counts, or
spatial relations-and task the model to pinpoint the corrupted span given the
image and the modified caption. This formulation preserves the full perceptual
difficulty while providing a binary, exact-match reward that is easy to compute
and unambiguous. Models trained with the ViCrit Task exhibit substantial gains
across a variety of VL benchmarks. Crucially, the improvements transfer beyond
natural-image training data to abstract image reasoning and visual math,
showing promises of learning to perceive rather than barely memorizing seen
objects. To facilitate evaluation, we further introduce ViCrit-Bench, a
category-balanced diagnostic benchmark that systematically probes perception
errors across diverse image domains and error types. Together, our results
demonstrate that fine-grained hallucination criticism is an effective and
generalizable objective for enhancing visual perception in VLMs.

### [9] [RoCA: Robust Cross-Domain End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10145)
*Rajeev Yasarla,Shizhong Han,Hsin-Pai Cheng,Litian Liu,Shweta Mahajan,Apratim Bhattacharyya,Yunxiao Shi,Risheek Garrepalli,Hong Cai,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RoCA is a novel framework for robust cross-domain E2E autonomous driving, improving generalizability and adaptation without extra inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of deploying E2E autonomous driving across domains, where existing methods, including LLMs, lack performance guarantees and incur high retraining costs.

Method: RoCA formulates a joint probabilistic distribution over tokens encoding vehicle information, using Gaussian processes to learn basis tokens and trajectories for diverse scenarios, enabling probabilistic trajectory inference.

Result: RoCA enhances the base E2E model's generalizability and outperforms direct finetuning in domain adaptation, achieving strong performance in cross-domain scenarios.

Conclusion: RoCA provides a robust solution for cross-domain E2E autonomous driving, improving generalization and adaptation without additional inference overhead.

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving has recently emerged as a new paradigm,
offering significant potential. However, few studies have looked into the
practical challenge of deployment across domains (e.g., cities). Although
several works have incorporated Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage their
open-world knowledge, LLMs do not guarantee cross-domain driving performance
and may incur prohibitive retraining costs during domain adaptation. In this
paper, we propose RoCA, a novel framework for robust cross-domain E2E
autonomous driving. RoCA formulates the joint probabilistic distribution over
the tokens that encode ego and surrounding vehicle information in the E2E
pipeline. Instantiating with a Gaussian process (GP), RoCA learns a set of
basis tokens with corresponding trajectories, which span diverse driving
scenarios. Then, given any driving scene, it is able to probabilistically infer
the future trajectory. By using RoCA together with a base E2E model in
source-domain training, we improve the generalizability of the base model,
without requiring extra inference computation. In addition, RoCA enables robust
adaptation on new target domains, significantly outperforming direct
finetuning. We extensively evaluate RoCA on various cross-domain scenarios and
show that it achieves strong domain generalization and adaptation performance.

### [10] [SPARKE: Scalable Prompt-Aware Diversity Guidance in Diffusion Models via RKE Score](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10173)
*Mohammad Jalali,Haoyu Lei,Amin Gohari,Farzan Farnia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPARKE, a method for enhancing prompt-aware diversity in diffusion models by using conditional entropy, reducing computational complexity from O(n³) to O(n).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring diversity in prompt-guided diffusion models is challenging, especially across broad semantic prompts. Existing methods lack efficient prompt-aware diversity control.

Method: Proposes SPARKE, which uses conditional entropy for diversity guidance, dynamically conditioning on similar prompts and reducing computational complexity.

Result: SPARKE improves prompt-aware diversity in generated data without significant computational costs, validated on text-to-image diffusion models.

Conclusion: SPARKE effectively addresses diversity and computational challenges in prompt-guided diffusion models, offering scalable solutions.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in high-fidelity image
synthesis and prompt-guided generative modeling. However, ensuring adequate
diversity in generated samples of prompt-guided diffusion models remains a
challenge, particularly when the prompts span a broad semantic spectrum and the
diversity of generated data needs to be evaluated in a prompt-aware fashion
across semantically similar prompts. Recent methods have introduced guidance
via diversity measures to encourage more varied generations. In this work, we
extend the diversity measure-based approaches by proposing the Scalable
Prompt-Aware R\'eny Kernel Entropy Diversity Guidance (SPARKE) method for
prompt-aware diversity guidance. SPARKE utilizes conditional entropy for
diversity guidance, which dynamically conditions diversity measurement on
similar prompts and enables prompt-aware diversity control. While the
entropy-based guidance approach enhances prompt-aware diversity, its reliance
on the matrix-based entropy scores poses computational challenges in
large-scale generation settings. To address this, we focus on the special case
of Conditional latent RKE Score Guidance, reducing entropy computation and
gradient-based optimization complexity from the $O(n^3)$ of general entropy
measures to $O(n)$. The reduced computational complexity allows for
diversity-guided sampling over potentially thousands of generation rounds on
different prompts. We numerically test the SPARKE method on several
text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the proposed method improves
the prompt-aware diversity of the generated data without incurring significant
computational costs. We release our code on the project page:

### [11] [Retrieval of Surface Solar Radiation through Implicit Albedo Recovery from Temporal Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10174)
*Yael Frischholz,Devis Tuia,Michael Lehning*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an attention-based emulator for surface solar radiation (SSR) retrieval, eliminating the need for hand-crafted features like albedo maps or cloud masks, and shows strong performance in mountainous regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SSR retrieval methods fail in mountainous regions due to dynamic snow cover and intermittent changes, necessitating a more adaptive approach.

Method: The method uses a Temporo-Spatial Vision Transformer to infer clear-sky surface reflectance from satellite image sequences, trained on HelioMont SSR estimates over Switzerland.

Result: The model matches albedo-informed models' performance, especially in mountainous areas, by learning latent surface reflectance dynamics.

Conclusion: The attention-based emulator effectively handles dynamic surface conditions, improving SSR retrieval accuracy in complex terrains.

Abstract: Accurate retrieval of surface solar radiation (SSR) from satellite imagery
critically depends on estimating the background reflectance that a spaceborne
sensor would observe under clear-sky conditions. Deviations from this baseline
can then be used to detect cloud presence and guide radiative transfer models
in inferring atmospheric attenuation. Operational retrieval algorithms
typically approximate background reflectance using monthly statistics, assuming
surface properties vary slowly relative to atmospheric conditions. However,
this approach fails in mountainous regions where intermittent snow cover and
changing snow surfaces are frequent. We propose an attention-based emulator for
SSR retrieval that implicitly learns to infer clear-sky surface reflectance
from raw satellite image sequences. Built on the Temporo-Spatial Vision
Transformer, our approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted features such as
explicit albedo maps or cloud masks. The emulator is trained on instantaneous
SSR estimates from the HelioMont algorithm over Switzerland, a region
characterized by complex terrain and dynamic snow cover. Inputs include
multi-spectral SEVIRI imagery from the Meteosat Second Generation platform,
augmented with static topographic features and solar geometry. The target
variable is HelioMont's SSR, computed as the sum of its direct and diffuse
horizontal irradiance components, given at a spatial resolution of 1.7 km. We
show that, when provided a sufficiently long temporal context, the model
matches the performances of albedo-informed models, highlighting the model's
ability to internally learn and exploit latent surface reflectance dynamics.
Our geospatial analysis shows this effect is most powerful in mountainous
regions and improves generalization in both simple and complex topographic
settings. Code and datasets are publicly available at
https://github.com/frischwood/HeMu-dev.git

### [12] [Attention, Please! Revisiting Attentive Probing for Masked Image Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10178)
*Bill Psomas,Dionysis Christopoulos,Eirini Baltzi,Ioannis Kakogeorgiou,Tilemachos Aravanis,Nikos Komodakis,Konstantinos Karantzalos,Yannis Avrithis,Giorgos Tolias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Efficient Probing (EP), a method improving attentive probing for SSL models by reducing parameters and boosting speed, outperforming linear probing and prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard linear probing fails for Masked Image Modeling due to patch tokens' distributed nature, necessitating better attentive probing methods.

Method: Proposes EP, a multi-query cross-attention mechanism eliminating redundant projections, reducing parameters, and speeding up computation.

Result: EP achieves up to 10x speed-up, outperforms LP and prior methods across benchmarks, and generalizes well beyond MIM.

Conclusion: EP is efficient, interpretable, and effective, offering strong performance in low-shot and layer-wise settings.

Abstract: As fine-tuning (FT) becomes increasingly impractical at scale, probing is
emerging as the preferred evaluation protocol for self-supervised learning
(SSL). Yet, the standard linear probing (LP) fails to adequately reflect the
potential of models trained with Masked Image Modeling (MIM), due to the
distributed nature of patch tokens. This motivates the need for attentive
probing, an alternative that uses attention to selectively aggregate
patch-level features. Despite its growing adoption, attentive probing remains
under-explored, with existing methods suffering from excessive parameterization
and poor computational efficiency.
  In this work, we revisit attentive probing through the lens of the
accuracy-efficiency trade-off. We conduct a systematic study of existing
methods, analyzing their mechanisms and benchmarking their performance. We
introduce efficient probing (EP), a multi-query cross-attention mechanism that
eliminates redundant projections, reduces the number of trainable parameters,
and achieves up to a 10$\times$ speed-up over conventional multi-head
attention. Despite its simplicity, EP outperforms LP and prior attentive
probing approaches across seven benchmarks, generalizes well beyond MIM to
diverse pre-training paradigms, produces interpretable attention maps, and
achieves strong gains in low-shot and layer-wise settings. Code available at

*Fiona Ryan,Josef Sivic,Fabian Caba Heilbron,Judy Hoffman,James M. Rehg,Bryan Russell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for personalized vision-language retrieval by adapting a dual encoder model, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To recognize new personal concepts (e.g., 'my dog Fido') from few examples while integrating personal and general knowledge.

Method: Uses regularized low-rank adaptation in the language encoder's final layer and explores parameter addition for combining multiple concepts.

Result: Outperforms prior methods by 4%-22% on DeepFashion2 and ConCon-Chi benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach effectively adapts vision-language models for personalized retrieval while preserving general knowledge.

Abstract: Personalized vision-language retrieval seeks to recognize new concepts (e.g.
"my dog Fido") from only a few examples. This task is challenging because it
requires not only learning a new concept from a few images, but also
integrating the personal and general knowledge together to recognize the
concept in different contexts. In this paper, we show how to effectively adapt
the internal representation of a vision-language dual encoder model for
personalized vision-language retrieval. We find that regularized low-rank
adaption of a small set of parameters in the language encoder's final layer
serves as a highly effective alternative to textual inversion for recognizing
the personal concept while preserving general knowledge. Additionally, we
explore strategies for combining parameters of multiple learned personal
concepts, finding that parameter addition is effective. To evaluate how well
general knowledge is preserved in a finetuned representation, we introduce a
metric that measures image retrieval accuracy based on captions generated by a
vision language model (VLM). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on
two benchmarks for personalized image retrieval with natural language queries -
DeepFashion2 and ConCon-Chi - outperforming the prior art by 4%-22% on personal
retrievals.

*Parsa Rahimi,Sebastien Marcel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScoreMix is a data augmentation method using diffusion models to improve discriminator performance with limited labeled data by mixing scores from different class-conditioned trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance discriminator performance in scenarios with limited labeled data by leveraging diffusion models' score properties.

Method: Convexly mixes scores from different class-conditioned trajectories during diffusion sampling to generate challenging synthetic samples.

Result: Improves discriminative capabilities across benchmarks, especially when mixing classes distant in the discriminator's embedding space.

Conclusion: ScoreMix offers practical advantages for training discriminative models without extensive parameter searches, mitigating the need for large datasets.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose ScoreMix, a novel yet simple data augmentation
strategy leveraging the score compositional properties of diffusion models to
enhance discriminator performance, particularly under scenarios with limited
labeled data. By convexly mixing the scores from different class-conditioned
trajectories during diffusion sampling, we generate challenging synthetic
samples that significantly improve discriminative capabilities in all studied
benchmarks. We systematically investigate class-selection strategies for mixing
and discover that greater performance gains arise when combining classes
distant in the discriminator's embedding space, rather than close in the
generator's condition space. Moreover, we empirically show that, under standard
metrics, the correlation between the generator's learned condition space and
the discriminator's embedding space is minimal. Our approach achieves notable
performance improvements without extensive parameter searches, demonstrating
practical advantages for training discriminative models while effectively
mitigating problems regarding collections of large datasets. Paper website:

*Hamid Kamangir,Mona Hajiesmaeeli,Mason Earles*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-modal deep learning model is developed for accurate crop yield forecasting in California, integrating diverse data sources and achieving strong predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate and timely crop yield forecasting is challenging due to complex environmental and climatic factors, despite extensive historical data.

Method: A multi-modal deep learning model integrates Landsat imagery, climate records, evapotranspiration, and soil data, using stratified feature extraction and timeseries encoders.

Result: The model achieves an R2 score of 0.76 on unseen test data, demonstrating strong predictive performance.

Conclusion: The benchmark dataset and model provide a foundation for advancing agricultural forecasting, climate adaptation, and precision farming.

Abstract: California is a global leader in agricultural production, contributing 12.5%
of the United States total output and ranking as the fifth-largest food and
cotton supplier in the world. Despite the availability of extensive historical
yield data from the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service, accurate and
timely crop yield forecasting remains a challenge due to the complex interplay
of environmental, climatic, and soil-related factors. In this study, we
introduce a comprehensive crop yield benchmark dataset covering over 70 crops
across all California counties from 2008 to 2022. The benchmark integrates
diverse data sources, including Landsat satellite imagery, daily climate
records, monthly evapotranspiration, and high-resolution soil properties. To
effectively learn from these heterogeneous inputs, we develop a multi-modal
deep learning model tailored for county-level, crop-specific yield forecasting.
The model employs stratified feature extraction and a timeseries encoder to
capture spatial and temporal dynamics during the growing season. Static inputs
such as soil characteristics and crop identity inform long-term variability.
Our approach achieves an overall R2 score of 0.76 across all crops of unseen
test dataset, highlighting strong predictive performance across California
diverse agricultural regions. This benchmark and modeling framework offer a
valuable foundation for advancing agricultural forecasting, climate adaptation,
and precision farming. The full dataset and codebase are publicly available at
our GitHub repository.

### [16] [DySS: Dynamic Queries and State-Space Learning for Efficient 3D Object Detection from Multi-Camera Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10242)
*Rajeev Yasarla,Shizhong Han,Hong Cai,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DySS introduces a state-space model and dynamic queries for efficient 3D object detection in BEV, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Earlier methods for BEV 3D object detection are costly due to dense features or excessive queries, especially with more video frames.

Method: DySS uses a state-space model (SSM) for sequential feature processing, with auxiliary tasks for motion and correspondence learning, and dynamically updates queries via merge, remove, and split operations.

Result: DySS achieves 65.31 NDS and 57.4 mAP on nuScenes test split, and 56.2 NDS and 46.2 mAP on val split, with 33 FPS inference speed.

Conclusion: DySS offers superior performance and efficiency in 3D object detection, making it suitable for real-time autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Camera-based 3D object detection in Bird's Eye View (BEV) is one of the most
important perception tasks in autonomous driving. Earlier methods rely on dense
BEV features, which are costly to construct. More recent works explore sparse
query-based detection. However, they still require a large number of queries
and can become expensive to run when more video frames are used. In this paper,
we propose DySS, a novel method that employs state-space learning and dynamic
queries. More specifically, DySS leverages a state-space model (SSM) to
sequentially process the sampled features over time steps. In order to
encourage the model to better capture the underlying motion and correspondence
information, we introduce auxiliary tasks of future prediction and masked
reconstruction to better train the SSM. The state of the SSM then provides an
informative yet efficient summarization of the scene. Based on the state-space
learned features, we dynamically update the queries via merge, remove, and
split operations, which help maintain a useful, lean set of detection queries
throughout the network. Our proposed DySS achieves both superior detection
performance and efficient inference. Specifically, on the nuScenes test split,
DySS achieves 65.31 NDS and 57.4 mAP, outperforming the latest state of the
art. On the val split, DySS achieves 56.2 NDS and 46.2 mAP, as well as a
real-time inference speed of 33 FPS.

*Eunkyu Park,Minyeong Kim,Gunhee Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HalLoc is a dataset and baseline model for efficient, probabilistic hallucination detection in vision-language models, addressing current limitations of high latency and binary outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in vision-language models undermine reliability, especially in critical applications, and current detection methods are resource-intensive and lack nuanced outcomes.

Method: HalLoc provides 150K token-level annotated samples across VQA, instruction-following, and image captioning tasks, enabling graded confidence detection. A baseline model is also introduced for low-overhead, concurrent detection.

Result: The dataset and model facilitate more reliable hallucination detection with graded confidence, improving user interactions and model trustworthiness.

Conclusion: HalLoc advances hallucination detection by offering a plug-and-play solution that enhances reliability and efficiency in vision-language models.

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a significant challenge to the reliability of large
vision-language models, making their detection essential for ensuring accuracy
in critical applications. Current detection methods often rely on
computationally intensive models, leading to high latency and resource demands.
Their definitive outcomes also fail to account for real-world scenarios where
the line between hallucinated and truthful information is unclear. To address
these issues, we propose HalLoc, a dataset designed for efficient,
probabilistic hallucination detection. It features 150K token-level annotated
samples, including hallucination types, across Visual Question Answering (VQA),
instruction-following, and image captioning tasks. This dataset facilitates the
development of models that detect hallucinations with graded confidence,
enabling more informed user interactions. Additionally, we introduce a baseline
model trained on HalLoc, offering low-overhead, concurrent hallucination
detection during generation. The model can be seamlessly integrated into
existing VLMs, improving reliability while preserving efficiency. The prospect
of a robust plug-and-play hallucination detection module opens new avenues for
enhancing the trustworthiness of vision-language models in real-world
applications. The HalLoc dataset and code are publicly available at:

*Hamzeh Asgharnezhad,Pegah Tabarisaadi,Abbas Khosravi,Roohallah Alizadehsani,U. Rajendra Acharya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates deep learning models for skin cancer classification, highlighting CLIP-based vision transformers with SVM as top performers and emphasizing the role of uncertainty quantification (UQ) for reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate skin cancer diagnosis is vital for early treatment, but DL models face limitations like data scarcity and lack of uncertainty awareness.

Method: Used transfer learning with pre-trained models (CLIP, ResNet50, etc.) and classifiers (SVM, XGBoost), then incorporated UQ methods (MCD, Ensemble, EMCD) for reliability assessment.

Result: CLIP-based models with SVM performed best. Ensemble methods balanced accuracy and uncertainty, while EMCD was more sensitive to uncertain predictions.

Conclusion: Integrating UQ into DL models enhances performance and trustworthiness for clinical skin cancer diagnosis.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable skin cancer diagnosis is critical for early treatment
and improved patient outcomes. Deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in
automating skin cancer classification, but their performance can be limited by
data scarcity and a lack of uncertainty awareness. In this study, we present a
comprehensive evaluation of DL-based skin lesion classification using transfer
learning and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on the HAM10000 dataset. In the
first phase, we benchmarked several pre-trained feature extractors-including
Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) variants, Residual Network-50
(ResNet50), Densely Connected Convolutional Network (DenseNet121), Visual
Geometry Group network (VGG16), and EfficientNet-V2-Large-combined with a range
of traditional classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), eXtreme
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and logistic regression. Our results show that
CLIP-based vision transformers, particularly LAION CLIP ViT-H/14 with SVM,
deliver the highest classification performance. In the second phase, we
incorporated UQ using Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Ensemble, and Ensemble Monte
Carlo Dropout (EMCD) to assess not only prediction accuracy but also the
reliability of model outputs. We evaluated these models using uncertainty-aware
metrics such as uncertainty accuracy(UAcc), uncertainty sensitivity(USen),
uncertainty specificity(USpe), and uncertainty precision(UPre). The results
demonstrate that ensemble methods offer a good trade-off between accuracy and
uncertainty handling, while EMCD is more sensitive to uncertain predictions.
This study highlights the importance of integrating UQ into DL-based medical
diagnosis to enhance both performance and trustworthiness in real-world
clinical applications.

*Sadia Kamal,Tim Oates,Joy Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A weakly supervised multimodal framework generates SOAP notes from lesion images and sparse clinical text, reducing manual effort and achieving performance comparable to advanced models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual SOAP note generation is labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout, necessitating an automated solution.

Method: Proposes a weakly supervised multimodal framework using lesion images and sparse clinical text to generate SOAP notes.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro, with novel metrics MedConceptEval and CCS for clinical quality assessment.

Conclusion: The framework offers scalable, clinically grounded documentation, reducing clinician burden and the need for large annotated datasets.

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for
over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. In clinical settings,
physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP (Subjective, Objective,
Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually generating these notes is
labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout. In this work, we propose
a weakly supervised multimodal framework to generate clinically structured SOAP
notes from limited inputs, including lesion images and sparse clinical text.
Our approach reduces reliance on manual annotations, enabling scalable,
clinically grounded documentation while alleviating clinician burden and
reducing the need for large annotated data. Our method achieves performance
comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro across key clinical
relevance metrics. To evaluate clinical quality, we introduce two novel metrics
MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence Score (CCS) which assess semantic
alignment with expert medical concepts and input features, respectively.

*Fei Zhao,Da Pan,Zelu Qi,Ping Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the lack of audio-visual quality assessment (AVQA) for user-generated omnidirectional videos (UGC-ODVs) by creating a dataset and a baseline model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of the Metaverse and the shift from professional to user-generated omnidirectional videos (ODVs) highlight the need for AVQA in UGC-ODVs.

Method: A dataset of 300 UGC-ODV videos is created, and a subjective AVQA experiment yields Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs). A baseline model with video/audio feature extraction and fusion modules is developed.

Result: The baseline model achieves optimal performance on the proposed dataset.

Conclusion: The work provides a foundation for future research in UGC-ODV AVQA by introducing a dataset and an effective baseline model.

Abstract: In response to the rising prominence of the Metaverse, omnidirectional videos
(ODVs) have garnered notable interest, gradually shifting from
professional-generated content (PGC) to user-generated content (UGC). However,
the study of audio-visual quality assessment (AVQA) within ODVs remains
limited. To address this, we construct a dataset of UGC omnidirectional audio
and video (A/V) content. The videos are captured by five individuals using two
different types of omnidirectional cameras, shooting 300 videos covering 10
different scene types. A subjective AVQA experiment is conducted on the dataset
to obtain the Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs) of the A/V sequences. After that, to
facilitate the development of UGC-ODV AVQA fields, we construct an effective
AVQA baseline model on the proposed dataset, of which the baseline model
consists of video feature extraction module, audio feature extraction and
audio-visual fusion module. The experimental results demonstrate that our model
achieves optimal performance on the proposed dataset.

### [21] [Using Vision Language Models to Detect Students' Academic Emotion through Facial Expressions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10334)
*Deliang Wang,Chao Yang,Gaowei Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for zero-shot analysis of students' academic emotions via facial expressions, finding moderate success with Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct outperforming Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct, especially in recognizing happy and confused expressions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional supervised models for emotion analysis lack generalization and require repetitive training. VLMs offer a promising zero-shot alternative.

Method: Two VLMs (Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct) analyzed 5,000 images of academic emotions using zero-shot prompting.

Result: Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct performed better, excelling in happy and confused expressions but failing in detecting distracted behavior.

Conclusion: VLMs show potential for academic emotion analysis, with Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct being more effective, though improvements are needed for distracted behavior detection.

Abstract: Students' academic emotions significantly influence their social behavior and
learning performance. Traditional approaches to automatically and accurately
analyze these emotions have predominantly relied on supervised machine learning
algorithms. However, these models often struggle to generalize across different
contexts, necessitating repeated cycles of data collection, annotation, and
training. The emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offers a promising
alternative, enabling generalization across visual recognition tasks through
zero-shot prompting without requiring fine-tuning. This study investigates the
potential of VLMs to analyze students' academic emotions via facial expressions
in an online learning environment. We employed two VLMs,
Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, to analyze 5,000
images depicting confused, distracted, happy, neutral, and tired expressions
using zero-shot prompting. Preliminary results indicate that both models
demonstrate moderate performance in academic facial expression recognition,
with Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct outperforming Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct.
Notably, both models excel in identifying students' happy emotions but fail to
detect distracted behavior. Additionally, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct exhibits
relatively high performance in recognizing students' confused expressions,
highlighting its potential for practical applications in identifying content
that causes student confusion.

### [22] [PointGS: Point Attention-Aware Sparse View Synthesis with Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10335)
*Lintao Xiang,Hongpei Zheng,Yating Huang,Qijun Yang,Hujun Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new Point-wise Feature-Aware Gaussian Splatting framework improves 3DGS rendering from sparse views by leveraging stereo models, multiscale features, and self-attention, outperforming NeRF and competing with 3DGS methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS methods require many calibrated views; sparse inputs cause overfitting and degraded rendering. The goal is to enable high-quality rendering from limited views.

Method: Uses a stereo model for pose estimation and dense point cloud initialization. Encodes color via multiscale 2D features and enhances appearance with a self-attention-based point interaction network. Decodes features into Gaussian parameters with MLPs.

Result: Outperforms NeRF-based methods and matches state-of-the-art 3DGS in few-shot settings.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses sparse-view limitations in 3DGS, achieving real-time, high-quality rendering.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) is an innovative rendering technique that
surpasses the neural radiance field (NeRF) in both rendering speed and visual
quality by leveraging an explicit 3D scene representation. Existing 3DGS
approaches require a large number of calibrated views to generate a consistent
and complete scene representation. When input views are limited, 3DGS tends to
overfit the training views, leading to noticeable degradation in rendering
quality. To address this limitation, we propose a Point-wise Feature-Aware
Gaussian Splatting framework that enables real-time, high-quality rendering
from sparse training views. Specifically, we first employ the latest stereo
foundation model to estimate accurate camera poses and reconstruct a dense
point cloud for Gaussian initialization. We then encode the colour attributes
of each 3D Gaussian by sampling and aggregating multiscale 2D appearance
features from sparse inputs. To enhance point-wise appearance representation,
we design a point interaction network based on a self-attention mechanism,
allowing each Gaussian point to interact with its nearest neighbors. These
enriched features are subsequently decoded into Gaussian parameters through two
lightweight multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for final rendering. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms NeRF-based approaches and achieves competitive performance under
few-shot settings compared to the state-of-the-art 3DGS methods.

### [23] [GeoCAD: Local Geometry-Controllable CAD Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10337)
*Zhanwei Zhang,Kaiyuan Liu,Junjie Liu,Wenxiao Wang,Binbin Lin,Liang Xie,Chen Shen,Deng Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoCAD introduces a method for local geometry-controllable CAD generation, addressing limitations of existing methods by using complementary captioning and LLMs for precise local part modification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CAD generation methods struggle with following textual instructions or focusing on local parts, limiting design efficiency and customization.

Method: GeoCAD uses a complementary captioning strategy (vertex-based and VLLM-based) to annotate local parts, then trains LLMs to predict masked parts based on geometric instructions.

Result: GeoCAD demonstrates effectiveness in generation quality, validity, and text-to-CAD consistency, with extensive experiments supporting its performance.

Conclusion: GeoCAD offers a user-friendly solution for precise local CAD modifications, enhancing design efficiency and customization capabilities.

Abstract: Local geometry-controllable computer-aided design (CAD) generation aims to
modify local parts of CAD models automatically, enhancing design efficiency. It
also ensures that the shapes of newly generated local parts follow
user-specific geometric instructions (e.g., an isosceles right triangle or a
rectangle with one corner cut off). However, existing methods encounter
challenges in achieving this goal. Specifically, they either lack the ability
to follow textual instructions or are unable to focus on the local parts. To
address this limitation, we introduce GeoCAD, a user-friendly and local
geometry-controllable CAD generation method. Specifically, we first propose a
complementary captioning strategy to generate geometric instructions for local
parts. This strategy involves vertex-based and VLLM-based captioning for
systematically annotating simple and complex parts, respectively. In this way,
we caption $\sim$221k different local parts in total. In the training stage,
given a CAD model, we randomly mask a local part. Then, using its geometric
instruction and the remaining parts as input, we prompt large language models
(LLMs) to predict the masked part. During inference, users can specify any
local part for modification while adhering to a variety of predefined geometric
instructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GeoCAD in
generation quality, validity and text-to-CAD consistency. Code will be
available at https://github.com/Zhanwei-Z/GeoCAD.

*Jun Yin,Jing Zhong,Peilin Li,Pengyu Zeng,Miao Zhang,Ran Luo,Shuai Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multimodal vision-language framework to analyze urban streetscape styles in Beijing and Shenzhen, addressing limitations of traditional expert-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding urban cultural and architectural differences is key for predicting future city evolution, but traditional methods lack standardization and scalability.

Method: Develops UrbanSense, a vision-language-model-based framework, and UrbanDiffBench, a dataset for automated urban streetscape analysis.

Result: Over 80% of generated descriptions are statistically significant (p < 0.05), with high Phi scores (0.912 for cities, 0.833 for periods) confirming method effectiveness.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable, data-driven approach to quantify urban style evolution, aiding future urban design.

Abstract: Urban cultures and architectural styles vary significantly across cities due
to geographical, chronological, historical, and socio-political factors.
Understanding these differences is essential for anticipating how cities may
evolve in the future. As representative cases of historical continuity and
modern innovation in China, Beijing and Shenzhen offer valuable perspectives
for exploring the transformation of urban streetscapes. However, conventional
approaches to urban cultural studies often rely on expert interpretation and
historical documentation, which are difficult to standardize across different
contexts. To address this, we propose a multimodal research framework based on
vision-language models, enabling automated and scalable analysis of urban
streetscape style differences. This approach enhances the objectivity and
data-driven nature of urban form research. The contributions of this study are
as follows: First, we construct UrbanDiffBench, a curated dataset of urban
streetscapes containing architectural images from different periods and
regions. Second, we develop UrbanSense, the first vision-language-model-based
framework for urban streetscape analysis, enabling the quantitative generation
and comparison of urban style representations. Third, experimental results show
that Over 80% of generated descriptions pass the t-test (p less than 0.05).
High Phi scores (0.912 for cities, 0.833 for periods) from subjective
evaluations confirm the method's ability to capture subtle stylistic
differences. These results highlight the method's potential to quantify and
interpret urban style evolution, offering a scientifically grounded lens for
future design.

*Mina C. Moghadam,Alan Q. Wang,Omer Taub,Martin R. Prince,Mert R. Sabuncu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RKM is a resolution-agnostic method for medical image registration, avoiding resampling artifacts by using real-world coordinates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods resample images to fixed resolutions, introducing artifacts. RKM aims to register images without resampling.

Method: Extends KeyMorph by outputting keypoints in real-world coordinates using scanner affine matrices, making keypoints resolution-agnostic.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on 2D abdominal MRIs and 3D brain datasets with varying resolutions.

Conclusion: RKM successfully registers images without resampling, outperforming fixed-resolution methods.

Abstract: Many real-world settings require registration of a pair of medical images
that differ in spatial resolution, which may arise from differences in image
acquisition parameters like pixel spacing, slice thickness, and field-of-view.
However, all previous machine learning-based registration techniques resample
images onto a fixed resolution. This is suboptimal because resampling can
introduce artifacts due to interpolation. To address this, we present
RealKeyMorph (RKM), a resolution-agnostic method for image registration. RKM is
an extension of KeyMorph, a registration framework which works by training a
network to learn corresponding keypoints for a given pair of images, after
which a closed-form keypoint matching step is used to derive the transformation
that aligns them. To avoid resampling and enable operating on the raw data, RKM
outputs keypoints in real-world coordinates of the scanner. To do this, we
leverage the affine matrix produced by the scanner (e.g., MRI machine) that
encodes the mapping from voxel coordinates to real world coordinates. By
transforming keypoints into real-world space and integrating this into the
training process, RKM effectively enables the extracted keypoints to be
resolution-agnostic. In our experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of RKM
on the registration task for orthogonal 2D stacks of abdominal MRIs, as well as
3D volumes with varying resolutions in brain datasets.

*Runqi Ouyang,Haoyun Li,Zhenyuan Zhang,Xiaofeng Wang,Zheng Zhu,Guan Huang,Xingang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Motion-R1 is a text-to-motion framework using Chain-of-Thought reasoning to improve controllability and diversity in motion generation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-motion methods lack deep linguistic understanding, leading to inconsistent and less controllable results.

Method: Motion-R1 decomposes text into logical action paths and uses Group Relative Policy Optimization for joint reasoning and motion synthesis.

Result: Motion-R1 excels in semantic understanding and long-term coherence, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Motion-R1 advances text-to-motion generation by integrating structured reasoning, with plans for public release of resources.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models, especially in natural language
understanding and reasoning, have opened new possibilities for text-to-motion
generation. Although existing approaches have made notable progress in semantic
alignment and motion synthesis, they often rely on end-to-end mapping
strategies that fail to capture deep linguistic structures and logical
reasoning. Consequently, generated motions tend to lack controllability,
consistency, and diversity. To address these limitations, we propose Motion-R1,
a unified motion-language modeling framework that integrates a Chain-of-Thought
mechanism. By explicitly decomposing complex textual instructions into
logically structured action paths, Motion-R1 provides high-level semantic
guidance for motion generation, significantly enhancing the model's ability to
interpret and execute multi-step, long-horizon, and compositionally rich
commands. To train our model, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization, a
reinforcement learning algorithm designed for large models, which leverages
motion quality feedback to optimize reasoning chains and motion synthesis
jointly. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that Motion-R1 achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios requiring nuanced semantic
understanding and long-term temporal coherence. The code, model and data will
be publicly available.

*Tianpei Zhang,Jufeng Zhao,Yiming Zhu,Guangmang Cui,Yuhan Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FSATFusion, a novel network for infrared and visible image fusion, uses a frequency-spatial attention Transformer to improve feature extraction and fusion performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for image fusion lose global context due to convolution operations, limiting performance.

Method: Proposes FSATFusion with a frequency-spatial attention Transformer (FSAT) module and an improved Transformer module (ITM) for better global context extraction.

Result: FSATFusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods in fusion quality, efficiency, and generalization across tasks.

Conclusion: FSATFusion excels in image fusion and downstream tasks like object detection, demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness.

Abstract: The infrared and visible images fusion (IVIF) is receiving increasing
attention from both the research community and industry due to its excellent
results in downstream applications. Existing deep learning approaches often
utilize convolutional neural networks to extract image features. However, the
inherently capacity of convolution operations to capture global context can
lead to information loss, thereby restricting fusion performance. To address
this limitation, we propose an end-to-end fusion network named the
Frequency-Spatial Attention Transformer Fusion Network (FSATFusion). The
FSATFusion contains a frequency-spatial attention Transformer (FSAT) module
designed to effectively capture discriminate features from source images. This
FSAT module includes a frequency-spatial attention mechanism (FSAM) capable of
extracting significant features from feature maps. Additionally, we propose an
improved Transformer module (ITM) to enhance the ability to extract global
context information of vanilla Transformer. We conducted both qualitative and
quantitative comparative experiments, demonstrating the superior fusion quality
and efficiency of FSATFusion compared to other state-of-the-art methods.
Furthermore, our network was tested on two additional tasks without any
modifications, to verify the excellent generalization capability of FSATFusion.
Finally, the object detection experiment demonstrated the superiority of
FSATFusion in downstream visual tasks. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The self-attention mechanism lacks a deep theoretical understanding despite its success. The paper seeks to explain its components and variants through an image processing framework.

Method: The authors develop a unifying image processing framework to interpret self-attention, positional encoding, and residual connections. They introduce two architectural modifications for better interpretability and performance.

Result: The modifications improve accuracy, robustness against data contamination, and long-sequence understanding in language and vision tasks.

Conclusion: The work bridges gaps in understanding self-attention and demonstrates practical benefits of image processing-inspired modifications in Transformers.

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of Transformer-based
state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, is largely heuristic-driven and
fundamentally challenging to interpret. Establishing a robust theoretical
foundation to explain its remarkable success and limitations has therefore
become an increasingly prominent focus in recent research. Some notable
directions have explored understanding self-attention through the lens of image
denoising and nonparametric regression. While promising, existing frameworks
still lack a deeper mechanistic interpretation of various architectural
components that enhance self-attention, both in its original formulation and
subsequent variants. In this work, we aim to advance this understanding by
developing a unifying image processing framework, capable of explaining not
only the self-attention computation itself but also the role of components such
as positional encoding and residual connections, including numerous later
variants. We also pinpoint potential distinctions between the two concepts
building upon our framework, and make effort to close this gap. We introduce
two independent architectural modifications within transformers. While our
primary objective is interpretability, we empirically observe that image
processing-inspired modifications can also lead to notably improved accuracy
and robustness against data contamination and adversaries across language and
vision tasks as well as better long sequence understanding.

*Jerry Yan,Chinmay Talegaonkar,Nicholas Antipa,Eric Terrill,Sophia Merrifield*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoseIDON, a computer vision pipeline, estimates object burial depth on the seafloor using deep learning and photogrammetry, achieving ~10 cm accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding burial dynamics of anthropogenic objects is crucial for ecological risk assessment, pollutant transport, and hazardous material mitigation.

Method: Combines deep foundation model features with multiview photogrammetry to estimate object pose and seafloor orientation from ROV video, aligning CAD models for burial depth inference.

Result: Validated on 54 objects, achieving ~10 cm mean burial depth error and revealing sediment transport patterns.

Conclusion: PoseIDON enables scalable, non-invasive seafloor burial mapping, aiding environmental assessments at contaminated sites.

Abstract: The burial state of anthropogenic objects on the seafloor provides insight
into localized sedimentation dynamics and is also critical for assessing
ecological risks, potential pollutant transport, and the viability of recovery
or mitigation strategies for hazardous materials such as munitions. Accurate
burial depth estimation from remote imagery remains difficult due to partial
occlusion, poor visibility, and object degradation. This work introduces a
computer vision pipeline, called PoseIDON, which combines deep foundation model
features with multiview photogrammetry to estimate six degrees of freedom
object pose and the orientation of the surrounding seafloor from ROV video.
Burial depth is inferred by aligning CAD models of the objects with observed
imagery and fitting a local planar approximation of the seafloor. The method is
validated using footage of 54 objects, including barrels and munitions,
recorded at a historic ocean dumpsite in the San Pedro Basin. The model
achieves a mean burial depth error of approximately 10 centimeters and resolves
spatial burial patterns that reflect underlying sediment transport processes.
This approach enables scalable, non-invasive mapping of seafloor burial and
supports environmental assessment at contaminated sites.

*Shicheng Yin,Kaixuan Yin,Yang Liu,Weixing Chen,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DART introduces a dynamic adaptive region tokenizer to improve vision models by adaptively partitioning images into content-dependent patches, enhancing accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed-size patches in models like ViT and Vim often miss critical local details or encode excessive background regions, especially for sparsely distributed objects.

Method: DART uses learnable region scores and piecewise differentiable quantile operations to allocate denser tokens to information-rich areas.

Result: DART improves accuracy by 2.1% on DeiT (ImageNet-1K) with only ~1M additional parameters and reduces FLOPs by 45%.

Conclusion: DART consistently enhances accuracy across models like DeiT, Vim, and VideoMamba with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Recently, non-convolutional models such as the Vision Transformer (ViT) and
Vision Mamba (Vim) have achieved remarkable performance in computer vision
tasks. However, their reliance on fixed-size patches often results in excessive
encoding of background regions and omission of critical local details,
especially when informative objects are sparsely distributed. To address this,
we introduce a fully differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer (DART),
which adaptively partitions images into content-dependent patches of varying
sizes. DART combines learnable region scores with piecewise differentiable
quantile operations to allocate denser tokens to information-rich areas.
Despite introducing only approximately 1 million (1M) additional parameters,
DART improves accuracy by 2.1% on DeiT (ImageNet-1K). Unlike methods that
uniformly increase token density to capture fine-grained details, DART offers a
more efficient alternative, achieving 45% FLOPs reduction with superior
performance. Extensive experiments on DeiT, Vim, and VideoMamba confirm that
DART consistently enhances accuracy while incurring minimal or even reduced
computational overhead. Code is available at

*Yuanyi Song,Pumeng Lyu,Ben Fei,Fenghua Ling,Wanli Ouyang,Lei Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes ReconMOST, a data-driven guided diffusion model for multi-layer sea temperature reconstruction, addressing challenges like sparse data and cloud occlusion. It achieves high accuracy and generalization, even with over 92.5% missing data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate ocean reconstruction is vital for climate dynamics and marine research, but conventional methods and limited ML approaches struggle with data sparsity and computational costs.

Method: ReconMOST pre-trains an unconditional diffusion model on historical simulation data, then uses sparse observational data to guide the reverse diffusion process for accurate reconstruction.

Result: The method achieves MSE values of 0.049 (guidance), 0.680 (reconstruction), and 0.633 (total), demonstrating effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: ReconMOST extends ML-based reconstruction globally and multi-layered, handling high missing data rates while maintaining accuracy and spatial resolution.

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of ocean is essential for reflecting global climate
dynamics and supporting marine meteorological research. Conventional methods
face challenges due to sparse data, algorithmic complexity, and high
computational costs, while increasing usage of machine learning (ML) method
remains limited to reconstruction problems at the sea surface and local
regions, struggling with issues like cloud occlusion. To address these
limitations, this paper proposes ReconMOST, a data-driven guided diffusion
model framework for multi-layer sea temperature reconstruction. Specifically,
we first pre-train an unconditional diffusion model using a large collection of
historical numerical simulation data, enabling the model to attain physically
consistent distribution patterns of ocean temperature fields. During the
generation phase, sparse yet high-accuracy in-situ observational data are
utilized as guidance points for the reverse diffusion process, generating
accurate reconstruction results. Importantly, in regions lacking direct
observational data, the physically consistent spatial distribution patterns
learned during pre-training enable implicitly guided and physically plausible
reconstructions. Our method extends ML-based SST reconstruction to a global,
multi-layer setting, handling over 92.5% missing data while maintaining
reconstruction accuracy, spatial resolution, and superior generalization
capability. We pre-train our model on CMIP6 numerical simulation data and
conduct guided reconstruction experiments on CMIP6 and EN4 analysis data. The
results of mean squared error (MSE) values achieve 0.049 on guidance, 0.680 on
reconstruction, and 0.633 on total, respectively, demonstrating the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework. Our source code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pisces, a multimodal foundation model, addresses the performance gap between unified and specialized models in image understanding and generation through decoupled visual encoding and tailored training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unified models underperform compared to specialized ones due to differing visual features and training needs for understanding vs. generation.

Method: Introduces Pisces with decoupled visual encoding and optimized training techniques for multimodal generation.

Result: Achieves competitive performance in both tasks across 20+ benchmarks for understanding and GenEval for generation.

Conclusion: Demonstrates synergy between understanding and generation, advocating separate encoders for unified multimodal models.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled multimodal
foundation models to tackle both image understanding and generation within a
unified framework. Despite these gains, unified models often underperform
compared to specialized models in either task. A key challenge in developing
unified models lies in the inherent differences between the visual features
needed for image understanding versus generation, as well as the distinct
training processes required for each modality. In this work, we introduce
Pisces, an auto-regressive multimodal foundation model that addresses this
challenge through a novel decoupled visual encoding architecture and tailored
training techniques optimized for multimodal generation. Combined with
meticulous data curation, pretraining, and finetuning, Pisces achieves
competitive performance in both image understanding and image generation. We
evaluate Pisces on over 20 public benchmarks for image understanding, where it
demonstrates strong performance across a wide range of tasks. Additionally, on
GenEval, a widely adopted benchmark for image generation, Pisces exhibits
robust generative capabilities. Our extensive analysis reveals the synergistic
relationship between image understanding and generation, and the benefits of
using separate visual encoders, advancing the field of unified multimodal
models.

*Guoyi Zhang,Guangsheng Xu,Siyang Chen,Han Wang,Xiaohu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LRRNet is a novel end-to-end IRSTD framework leveraging low-rank background properties for improved small target detection in complex infrared scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared small target detection is challenging due to low SCR, diverse target morphologies, and lack of visual cues. Existing deep learning methods struggle with variability and weak priors.

Method: LRRNet uses a compression-reconstruction-subtraction (CRS) paradigm to model low-rank backgrounds directly in the image domain, avoiding patch-based processing or matrix decomposition.

Result: LRRNet outperforms 38 state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, robustness, and speed (82.34 FPS), with resilience to noise.

Conclusion: LRRNet is the first end-to-end deep learning approach for low-rank background modeling, offering superior performance and real-time capability.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) remains a long-standing challenge in
complex backgrounds due to low signal-to-clutter ratios (SCR), diverse target
morphologies, and the absence of distinctive visual cues. While recent deep
learning approaches aim to learn discriminative representations, the intrinsic
variability and weak priors of small targets often lead to unstable
performance. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end IRSTD framework,
termed LRRNet, which leverages the low-rank property of infrared image
backgrounds. Inspired by the physical compressibility of cluttered scenes, our
approach adopts a compression--reconstruction--subtraction (CRS) paradigm to
directly model structure-aware low-rank background representations in the image
domain, without relying on patch-based processing or explicit matrix
decomposition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to directly
learn low-rank background structures using deep neural networks in an
end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets
demonstrate that LRRNet outperforms 38 state-of-the-art methods in terms of
detection accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Remarkably, it
achieves real-time performance with an average speed of 82.34 FPS. Evaluations
on the challenging NoisySIRST dataset further confirm the model's resilience to
sensor noise. The source code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

*Shuo wang,Jihao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MF2Summ is a multimodal video summarization model combining visual and auditory data, outperforming traditional single-modality methods with improved F1-scores on SumMe and TVSum datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional video summarization methods often rely on a single modality (visual), missing richer semantic content. MF2Summ addresses this by integrating multimodal (visual and auditory) data for better summarization.

Method: MF2Summ uses a five-stage process: feature extraction (GoogLeNet for visuals, SoundNet for audio), cross-modal attention interaction, feature fusion (Transformer-based), segment prediction, and key shot selection (NMS and KTS).

Result: MF2Summ achieves competitive performance, improving F1-scores by 1.9% and 0.6% on SumMe and TVSum datasets respectively, compared to DSNet.

Conclusion: MF2Summ demonstrates the effectiveness of multimodal fusion in video summarization, outperforming single-modality and other state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of online video content necessitates effective video
summarization techniques. Traditional methods, often relying on a single
modality (typically visual), struggle to capture the full semantic richness of
videos. This paper introduces MF2Summ, a novel video summarization model based
on multimodal content understanding, integrating both visual and auditory
information. MF2Summ employs a five-stage process: feature extraction,
cross-modal attention interaction, feature fusion, segment prediction, and key
shot selection. Visual features are extracted using a pre-trained GoogLeNet
model, while auditory features are derived using SoundNet. The core of our
fusion mechanism involves a cross-modal Transformer and an alignment-guided
self-attention Transformer, designed to effectively model inter-modal
dependencies and temporal correspondences. Segment importance, location, and
center-ness are predicted, followed by key shot selection using Non-Maximum
Suppression (NMS) and the Kernel Temporal Segmentation (KTS) algorithm.
Experimental results on the SumMe and TVSum datasets demonstrate that MF2Summ
achieves competitive performance, notably improving F1-scores by 1.9\% and
0.6\% respectively over the DSNet model, and performing favorably against other
state-of-the-art methods.

*Guowei Zhong,Ruohong Huan,Mingzhen Wu,Ronghua Liang,Peng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CIDer is a robust MER framework addressing modality missing and OOD data, using self-distillation and causal inference with minimal parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MER methods struggle with modality missing and OOD data, often being impractical due to excessive parameters.

Method: CIDer includes MSSD for robustness under RMFM and MACI for OOD generalization, with WSAM and MCT for efficiency.

Result: CIDer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in RMFM and OOD scenarios with fewer parameters and faster training.

Conclusion: CIDer offers a practical, efficient solution for robust MER, validated by experiments and open-source implementation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) face challenges
in addressing both modality missing and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data
simultaneously. Existing methods often rely on specific models or introduce
excessive parameters, which limits their practicality. To address these issues,
we propose a novel robust MER framework, Causal Inference Distiller (CIDer),
and introduce a new task, Random Modality Feature Missing (RMFM), to generalize
the definition of modality missing. CIDer integrates two key components: a
Model-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) module and a Model-Agnostic Causal
Inference (MACI) module. MSSD enhances robustness under the RMFM task through a
weight-sharing self-distillation approach applied across low-level features,
attention maps, and high-level representations. Additionally, a Word-level
Self-aligned Attention Module (WSAM) reduces computational complexity, while a
Multimodal Composite Transformer (MCT) facilitates efficient multimodal fusion.
To tackle OOD challenges, MACI employs a tailored causal graph to mitigate
label and language biases using a Multimodal Causal Module (MCM) and
fine-grained counterfactual texts. Notably, MACI can independently enhance OOD
generalization with minimal additional parameters. Furthermore, we also
introduce the new repartitioned MER OOD datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that CIDer achieves robust performance in both RMFM and OOD
scenarios, with fewer parameters and faster training compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The implementation of this work is publicly
accessible at https://github.com/gw-zhong/CIDer.

*Bolin Chen,Ru-Ling Liao,Jie Chen,Yan Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Implicit Motion Transformation (IMT) to improve Generative Human Video Coding (GHVC) by addressing challenges in complex human body motion, achieving better compression and reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional generative video codecs struggle with human body videos due to complex motion patterns, leading to distortions and inaccurate motion.

Method: Proposes IMT to transform compact visual features into implicit motion guidance for high-quality reconstruction.

Result: IMT improves GHVC, enabling high-efficiency compression and high-fidelity synthesis.

Conclusion: IMT effectively addresses limitations of explicit motion-based approaches for human body video compression.

Abstract: Beyond traditional hybrid-based video codec, generative video codec could
achieve promising compression performance by evolving high-dimensional signals
into compact feature representations for bitstream compactness at the encoder
side and developing explicit motion fields as intermediate supervision for
high-quality reconstruction at the decoder side. This paradigm has achieved
significant success in face video compression. However, compared to facial
videos, human body videos pose greater challenges due to their more complex and
diverse motion patterns, i.e., when using explicit motion guidance for
Generative Human Video Coding (GHVC), the reconstruction results could suffer
severe distortions and inaccurate motion. As such, this paper highlights the
limitations of explicit motion-based approaches for human body video
compression and investigates the GHVC performance improvement with the aid of
Implicit Motion Transformation, namely IMT. In particular, we propose to
characterize complex human body signal into compact visual features and
transform these features into implicit motion guidance for signal
reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed IMT paradigm, which can facilitate GHVC to achieve high-efficiency
compression and high-fidelity synthesis.

*Chun Liu,Bingqian Zhu,Tao Xu,Zheng Zheng,Zheng Li,Wei Yang,Zhigang Han,Jiayao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to enhance adversarial attack transferability for HSI classification by random block division and feature distancing loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and HSIs' unique properties make existing methods less effective.

Method: Randomly divides HSI into blocks, applies transformations, and uses feature distancing loss to disrupt true class features.

Result: Adversarial examples show effective transferability on public HSI datasets and robustness under defenses.

Conclusion: The method improves transferability and maintains attack performance, addressing HSI-specific challenges.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose
security challenges to hyperspectral image (HSI) classification technologies
based on DNNs. In the domain of natural images, numerous transfer-based
adversarial attack methods have been studied. However, HSIs differ from natural
images due to their high-dimensional and rich spectral information. Current
research on HSI adversarial examples remains limited and faces challenges in
fully utilizing the structural and feature information of images. To address
these issues, this paper proposes a novel method to enhance the transferability
of the adversarial examples for HSI classification models. First, while keeping
the image structure unchanged, the proposed method randomly divides the image
into blocks in both spatial and spectral dimensions. Then, various
transformations are applied on a block by block basis to increase input
diversity and mitigate overfitting. Second, a feature distancing loss targeting
intermediate layers is designed, which measures the distance between the
amplified features of the original examples and the features of the adversarial
examples as the primary loss, while the output layer prediction serves as the
auxiliary loss. This guides the perturbation to disrupt the features of the
true class in adversarial examples, effectively enhancing transferability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the adversarial examples generated by
the proposed method achieve effective transferability to black-box models on
two public HSI datasets. Furthermore, the method maintains robust attack
performance even under defense strategies.

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of weight initialization on DNN quantization robustness and introduces GHN-QAT, a novel method for quantization-aware initialization, showing significant improvements in quantized accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the initial conditions of DNN training for quantization, as random weight initialization impacts quantization robustness, which has been underexplored.

Method: Study of weight initialization effects on CNN building blocks and introduction of GHN-QAT, a Graph Hypernetwork method for predicting quantized DNN parameters.

Result: GHN-QAT improves quantized accuracy, even for 4-bit and 2-bit quantization, outperforming random initialization.

Conclusion: GHN-QAT provides a novel approach to quantized DNN design, with potential to streamline quantization-aware training in future work.

Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) quantization for fast, efficient inference has been
an important tool in limiting the cost of machine learning (ML) model
inference. Quantization-specific model development techniques such as
regularization, quantization-aware training, and quantization-robustness
penalties have served to greatly boost the accuracy and robustness of modern
DNNs. However, very little exploration has been done on improving the initial
conditions of DNN training for quantization. Just as random weight
initialization has been shown to significantly impact test accuracy of floating
point models, it would make sense that different weight initialization methods
impact quantization robustness of trained models. We present an extensive study
examining the effects of different weight initializations on a variety of CNN
building blocks commonly used in efficient CNNs. This analysis reveals that
even with varying CNN architectures, the choice of random weight initializer
can significantly affect final quantization robustness. Next, we explore a new
method for quantization-robust CNN initialization -- using Graph Hypernetworks
(GHN) to predict parameters of quantized DNNs. Besides showing that
GHN-predicted parameters are quantization-robust after regular float32
pretraining (of the GHN), we find that finetuning GHNs to predict parameters
for quantized graphs (which we call GHN-QAT) can further improve quantized
accuracy of CNNs. Notably, GHN-QAT shows significant accuracy improvements for
even 4-bit quantization and better-than-random accuracy for 2-bits. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study on quantization-aware DNN
weight initialization. GHN-QAT offers a novel approach to quantized DNN model
design. Future investigations, such as using GHN-QAT-initialized parameters for
quantization-aware training, can further streamline the DNN quantization
process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models lack active reasoning for complex clinical questions and struggle with precise segmentation masks, limiting their diagnostic use.

Method: MedSeg-R uses a global context understanding module and a pixel-level grounding module to interpret instructions and generate masks.

Result: MedSeg-R outperforms benchmarks, achieving high segmentation accuracy and interpretable analysis.

Conclusion: MedSeg-R advances medical image segmentation by integrating reasoning and precise mask generation, supported by the MedSeg-QA dataset.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis, yet existing
models are limited by their reliance on explicit human instructions and lack
the active reasoning capabilities to understand complex clinical questions.
While recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
improved medical question-answering (QA) tasks, most methods struggle to
generate precise segmentation masks, limiting their application in automatic
medical diagnosis. In this paper, we introduce medical image reasoning
segmentation, a novel task that aims to generate segmentation masks based on
complex and implicit medical instructions. To address this, we propose
MedSeg-R, an end-to-end framework that leverages the reasoning abilities of
MLLMs to interpret clinical questions while also capable of producing
corresponding precise segmentation masks for medical images. It is built on two
core components: 1) a global context understanding module that interprets
images and comprehends complex medical instructions to generate multi-modal
intermediate tokens, and 2) a pixel-level grounding module that decodes these
tokens to produce precise segmentation masks and textual responses.
Furthermore, we introduce MedSeg-QA, a large-scale dataset tailored for the
medical image reasoning segmentation task. It includes over 10,000 image-mask
pairs and multi-turn conversations, automatically annotated using large
language models and refined through physician reviews. Experiments show
MedSeg-R's superior performance across several benchmarks, achieving high
segmentation accuracy and enabling interpretable textual analysis of medical

TL;DR: The study evaluates four vision-language models (VLMs) for deepfake detection, finding they lack reliability as standalone tools but show promise in augmenting human expertise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of deepfakes threatens media integrity and public trust, prompting interest in VLMs for detection.

Method: A zero-shot evaluation of ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Grok on three deepfake types (faceswap, reenactment, synthetic) using a diverse benchmark.

Result: VLMs provide coherent explanations but fail as standalone detectors, struggling with stylistic biases and misleading patterns.

Conclusion: VLMs are not yet reliable for autonomous detection but could enhance hybrid or human-in-the-loop frameworks.

Abstract: The growing sophistication of deepfakes presents substantial challenges to
the integrity of media and the preservation of public trust. Concurrently,
vision-language models (VLMs), large language models enhanced with visual
reasoning capabilities, have emerged as promising tools across various domains,
sparking interest in their applicability to deepfake detection. This study
conducts a structured zero-shot evaluation of four prominent VLMs: ChatGPT,
Claude, Gemini, and Grok, focusing on three primary deepfake types: faceswap,
reenactment, and synthetic generation. Leveraging a meticulously assembled
benchmark comprising authentic and manipulated images from diverse sources, we
evaluate each model's classification accuracy and reasoning depth. Our analysis
indicates that while VLMs can produce coherent explanations and detect
surface-level anomalies, they are not yet dependable as standalone detection
systems. We highlight critical failure modes, such as an overemphasis on
stylistic elements and vulnerability to misleading visual patterns like vintage
aesthetics. Nevertheless, VLMs exhibit strengths in interpretability and
contextual analysis, suggesting their potential to augment human expertise in
forensic workflows. These insights imply that although general-purpose models
currently lack the reliability needed for autonomous deepfake detection, they
hold promise as integral components in hybrid or human-in-the-loop detection
frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of standardized datasets and evaluation metrics in OMR research.

Method: Creation of the SMB dataset with diverse musical textures and the OMR-NED metric for fine-grained error analysis.

Result: SMB and OMR-NED provide a standardized way to benchmark and compare OMR methods.

Conclusion: The work fills a gap in OMR evaluation, supported by baseline experiments on SMB.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Sheet Music Benchmark (SMB), a dataset of six
hundred and eighty-five pages specifically designed to benchmark Optical Music
Recognition (OMR) research. SMB encompasses a diverse array of musical
textures, including monophony, pianoform, quartet, and others, all encoded in
Common Western Modern Notation using the Humdrum **kern format. Alongside SMB,
we introduce the OMR Normalized Edit Distance (OMR-NED), a new metric tailored
explicitly for evaluating OMR performance. OMR-NED builds upon the widely-used
Symbol Error Rate (SER), offering a fine-grained and detailed error analysis
that covers individual musical elements such as note heads, beams, pitches,
accidentals, and other critical notation features. The resulting numeric score
provided by OMR-NED facilitates clear comparisons, enabling researchers and
end-users alike to identify optimal OMR approaches. Our work thus addresses a
long-standing gap in OMR evaluation, and we support our contributions with
baseline experiments using standardized SMB dataset splits for training and
assessing state-of-the-art methods.

*Guyang Zhang,Waleed Abdulla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores class-incremental learning (CIL) techniques to distinguish honey botanical origins, proposing a continual backpropagation (CB) method to enhance CIL performance by 1-7%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate honey origin differentiation is vital for market fairness, but collecting all honey varieties for training is impractical, necessitating CIL techniques.

Method: Researchers compared CIL algorithms on a honey hyperspectral dataset and introduced CB to reinitialize less-used neurons, improving plasticity.

Result: CB boosted most CIL methods' performance by 1-7%.

Conclusion: The CB method effectively enhances CIL for honey origin classification, addressing plasticity loss.

Abstract: Honey is an important commodity in the global market. Honey types of
different botanical origins provide diversified flavors and health benefits,
thus having different market values. Developing accurate and effective
botanical origin-distinguishing techniques is crucial to protect consumers'
interests. However, it is impractical to collect all the varieties of honey
products at once to train a model for botanical origin differentiation.
Therefore, researchers developed class-incremental learning (CIL) techniques to
address this challenge. This study examined and compared multiple CIL
algorithms on a real-world honey hyperspectral imaging dataset. A novel
technique is also proposed to improve the performance of class-incremental
learning algorithms by combining with a continual backpropagation (CB)
algorithm. The CB method addresses the issue of loss-of-plasticity by
reinitializing a proportion of less-used hidden neurons to inject variability
into neural networks. Experiments showed that CB improved the performance of
most CIL methods by 1-7\%.

TL;DR: The paper proposes PSLG-SAM, a two-stage framework for Reference Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS), addressing challenges like dense annotations and complex scenes by combining coarse localization and fine segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RRSIS methods face issues like dense annotation needs and complex scene interpretation, prompting the need for a more efficient solution.

Method: PSLG-SAM splits RRSIS into coarse localization (using a visual grounding network) and fine segmentation (using SAM with clustering and optimization). The second stage can be train-free.

Result: PSLG-SAM outperforms state-of-the-art models on datasets RRSIS-D and RRSIS-M, with reduced annotation burden.

Conclusion: The two-stage approach improves segmentation accuracy and efficiency, supported by a new annotated dataset, with code to be released.

Abstract: The Reference Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) task generates
segmentation masks for specified objects in images based on textual
descriptions, which has attracted widespread attention and research interest.
Current RRSIS methods rely on multi-modal fusion backbones and semantic
segmentation heads but face challenges like dense annotation requirements and
complex scene interpretation. To address these issues, we propose a framework
named \textit{prompt-generated semantic localization guiding Segment Anything
Model}(PSLG-SAM), which decomposes the RRSIS task into two stages: coarse
localization and fine segmentation. In coarse localization stage, a visual
grounding network roughly locates the text-described object. In fine
segmentation stage, the coordinates from the first stage guide the Segment
Anything Model (SAM), enhanced by a clustering-based foreground point generator
and a mask boundary iterative optimization strategy for precise segmentation.
Notably, the second stage can be train-free, significantly reducing the
annotation data burden for the RRSIS task. Additionally, decomposing the RRSIS
task into two stages allows for focusing on specific region segmentation,
avoiding interference from complex scenes.We further contribute a high-quality,
multi-category manually annotated dataset. Experimental validation on two
datasets (RRSIS-D and RRSIS-M) demonstrates that PSLG-SAM achieves significant
performance improvements and surpasses existing state-of-the-art models.Our
code will be made publicly available.

### [45] [J-DDL: Surface Damage Detection and Localization System for Fighter Aircraft](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10505)
*Jin Huang,Mingqiang Wei,Zikuan Li,Hangyu Qu,Wei Zhao,Xinyu Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: J-DDL is a smart system for detecting and localizing surface damage on fighter aircraft using 2D images and 3D point clouds, featuring a YOLO-based network with innovative components for efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual inspections of fighter aircraft are inefficient and inconsistent due to large surface areas and structural complexity, necessitating an automated solution.

Method: J-DDL combines 2D images and 3D point clouds, using a YOLO-based network with Fasternet blocks, EMA modules, and Inner-CIOU loss for precise damage detection and 3D localization.

Result: The system improves inspection efficiency and coverage, validated by experiments, and includes the first public aircraft damage dataset.

Conclusion: J-DDL advances automated aircraft inspection, offering a scalable, efficient, and accurate solution for surface damage detection.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and extended operational life of fighter aircraft
necessitates frequent and exhaustive inspections. While surface defect
detection is feasible for human inspectors, manual methods face critical
limitations in scalability, efficiency, and consistency due to the vast surface
area, structural complexity, and operational demands of aircraft maintenance.
We propose a smart surface damage detection and localization system for fighter
aircraft, termed J-DDL. J-DDL integrates 2D images and 3D point clouds of the
entire aircraft surface, captured using a combined system of laser scanners and
cameras, to achieve precise damage detection and localization. Central to our
system is a novel damage detection network built on the YOLO architecture,
specifically optimized for identifying surface defects in 2D aircraft images.
Key innovations include lightweight Fasternet blocks for efficient feature
extraction, an optimized neck architecture incorporating Efficient Multiscale
Attention (EMA) modules for superior feature aggregation, and the introduction
of a novel loss function, Inner-CIOU, to enhance detection accuracy. After
detecting damage in 2D images, the system maps the identified anomalies onto
corresponding 3D point clouds, enabling accurate 3D localization of defects
across the aircraft surface. Our J-DDL not only streamlines the inspection
process but also ensures more comprehensive and detailed coverage of large and
complex aircraft exteriors. To facilitate further advancements in this domain,
we have developed the first publicly available dataset specifically focused on
aircraft damage. Experimental evaluations validate the effectiveness of our
framework, underscoring its potential to significantly advance automated
aircraft inspection technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vid-LLMs struggle with computational burdens and irrelevant context in streaming video scenarios, necessitating a focused approach to reasoning.

Method: The paper presents CogReasoner, which uses visual stream compression and historical dialogue retrieval to identify relevant context for answering questions.

Result: Experiments show CogReasoner's effectiveness in handling the CogStream task.

Conclusion: The proposed method addresses challenges in streaming video reasoning and is supported by a densely annotated dataset.

Abstract: Despite advancements in Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) improving
multimodal understanding, challenges persist in streaming video reasoning due
to its reliance on contextual information. Existing paradigms feed all
available historical contextual information into Vid-LLMs, resulting in a
significant computational burden for visual data processing. Furthermore, the
inclusion of irrelevant context distracts models from key details. This paper
introduces a challenging task called Context-guided Streaming Video Reasoning
(CogStream), which simulates real-world streaming video scenarios, requiring
models to identify the most relevant historical contextual information to
deduce answers for questions about the current stream. To support CogStream, we
present a densely annotated dataset featuring extensive and hierarchical
question-answer pairs, generated by a semi-automatic pipeline. Additionally, we
present CogReasoner as a baseline model. It efficiently tackles this task by
leveraging visual stream compression and historical dialogue retrieval.
Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of this method. Code will be
released soon.

Method: Introduces a cross-modal attention flow module on AVION for bidirectional feature interaction and uses Symmetric Multi-Similarity Loss for optimization.

Result: Achieves 66.78mAP and 82.08nDCG on EPIC-KITCHENS-100, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: CR-CLIP is effective for cross-modal retrieval, validated by superior performance on benchmarks.

Abstract: This report presents ContextRefine-CLIP (CR-CLIP), an efficient model for

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fragmented ecological workflows and make species habitat understanding accessible to non-specialists.

Method: End-to-end framework combining species recognition, occurrence retrieval, pseudo-absence sampling, climate data extraction, causal inference, and AI-generated explanations.

Result: Demonstrated on bee and flower species, showing potential for human-understandable habitat descriptions.

Conclusion: The framework bridges ecological modeling and AI, offering accessible, causal insights into species habitats.

Abstract: Explaining why the species lives at a particular location is important for
understanding ecological systems and conserving biodiversity. However, existing
ecological workflows are fragmented and often inaccessible to non-specialists.
We propose an end-to-end visual-to-causal framework that transforms a species
image into interpretable causal insights about its habitat preference. The
system integrates species recognition, global occurrence retrieval,
pseudo-absence sampling, and climate data extraction. We then discover causal
structures among environmental features and estimate their influence on species
occurrence using modern causal inference methods. Finally, we generate
statistically grounded, human-readable causal explanations from structured
templates and large language models. We demonstrate the framework on a bee and
a flower species and report early results as part of an ongoing project,
showing the potential of the multimodal AI assistant backed up by a recommended
ecological modeling practice for describing species habitat in
human-understandable language.

*Imanol Solano,Julian Fierrez,Aythami Morales,Alejandro Peña,Ruben Tolosana,Francisco Zamora-Martinez,Javier San Agustin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI), a new metric to detect subtle demographic biases in face recognition systems by analyzing genuine and impostor score distributions separately, focusing on tail probabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics fail to detect subtle biases in face recognition systems, especially in the tails of score distributions, necessitating a more robust and sensitive tool.

Method: The authors propose CEI, which separately analyzes genuine and impostor score distributions, with a configurable focus on tail probabilities. They also introduce CEI^A, an automated version for practical use.

Result: Experiments show CEI outperforms previous methods in detecting nuanced biases, validated on state-of-the-art FR systems, biased models, and diverse datasets.

Conclusion: CEI is a robust and sensitive tool for fairness assessment in face biometrics, with broader applicability to any problem involving tail distribution analysis.

Abstract: Demographic bias in high-performance face recognition (FR) systems often
eludes detection by existing metrics, especially with respect to subtle
disparities in the tails of the score distribution. We introduce the
Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI), a novel metric designed to address this
limitation. CEI uniquely analyzes genuine and impostor score distributions
separately, enabling a configurable focus on tail probabilities while also
considering overall distribution shapes. Our extensive experiments (evaluating
state-of-the-art FR systems, intentionally biased models, and diverse datasets)
confirm CEI's superior ability to detect nuanced biases where previous methods
fall short. Furthermore, we present CEI^A, an automated version of the metric
that enhances objectivity and simplifies practical application. CEI provides a
robust and sensitive tool for operational FR fairness assessment. The proposed
methods have been developed particularly for bias evaluation in face biometrics
but, in general, they are applicable for comparing statistical distributions in
any problem where one is interested in analyzing the distribution tails.

Result: Superior performance in parameter efficiency, processing time, and accuracy across indoor RGB-D datasets, maintaining reconstruction and localization quality.

Conclusion: LRSLAM offers a more efficient and scalable solution for dense visual SLAM, with plans to make the code publicly available.

Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) has been crucial across various
domains, including autonomous driving, mobile robotics, and mixed reality.
Dense visual SLAM, leveraging RGB-D camera systems, offers advantages but faces
challenges in achieving real-time performance, robustness, and scalability for

decompositions, achieves better convergence rates, memory efficiency, and
reconstruction/localization quality than existing state-of-the-art approaches.
Evaluation across diverse indoor RGB-D datasets demonstrates LRSLAM's superior

*Lizhen Wang,Zhurong Xia,Tianshu Hu,Pengrui Wang,Pengfei Wang,Zerong Zheng,Ming Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework is proposed to generate realistic human-product demonstration videos by preserving identities and spatial relationships, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks fail to preserve human and product identities or understand spatial relationships, leading to unrealistic representations.

Method: The method uses paired human-product references, masked cross-attention, 3D body mesh templates, product bounding boxes, and structured text encoding for precise motion and 3D consistency.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in identity preservation and realistic motion generation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses challenges in human-product demonstration videos, offering improved realism and identity integrity.

Abstract: In e-commerce and digital marketing, generating high-fidelity human-product
demonstration videos is important for effective product presentation. However,
most existing frameworks either fail to preserve the identities of both humans
and products or lack an understanding of human-product spatial relationships,
leading to unrealistic representations and unnatural interactions. To address
these challenges, we propose a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework. Our
method simultaneously preserves human identities and product-specific details,
such as logos and textures, by injecting paired human-product reference
information and utilizing an additional masked cross-attention mechanism. We
employ a 3D body mesh template and product bounding boxes to provide precise
motion guidance, enabling intuitive alignment of hand gestures with product
placements. Additionally, structured text encoding is used to incorporate
category-level semantics, enhancing 3D consistency during small rotational
changes across frames. Trained on a hybrid dataset with extensive data
augmentation strategies, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques
in maintaining the identity integrity of both humans and products and
generating realistic demonstration motions. Project page:

*Jun Wang,Lixing Zhu,Xiaohan Yu,Abhir Bhalerao,Yulan He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PLACE framework improves medical visual representation learning by aligning pathological-level details between images and reports without extra annotations, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses data scarcity and complex report structures in medical imaging by focusing on pathological-level consistency, often overlooked in prior works.

Method: Introduces Pathological-Level Cross-Modal Alignment (PCMA) and a Visual Pathology Observation Extractor, plus a proxy task for patch correlation.

Result: Achieves top performance in classification, retrieval, segmentation, detection, and report generation tasks.

Conclusion: PLACE effectively aligns and enriches pathological details, enhancing generalizability and robustness in medical visual representation learning.

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations from image-report pairs through joint
learning has garnered increasing research attention due to its potential to
alleviate the data scarcity problem in the medical domain. The primary
challenges stem from the lengthy reports that feature complex discourse
relations and semantic pathologies. Previous works have predominantly focused
on instance-wise or token-wise cross-modal alignment, often neglecting the
importance of pathological-level consistency. This paper presents a novel
framework PLACE that promotes the Pathological-Level Alignment and enriches the
fine-grained details via Correlation Exploration without additional human
annotations. Specifically, we propose a novel pathological-level cross-modal
alignment (PCMA) approach to maximize the consistency of pathology observations
from both images and reports. To facilitate this, a Visual Pathology
Observation Extractor is introduced to extract visual pathological observation
representations from localized tokens. The PCMA module operates independently
of any external disease annotations, enhancing the generalizability and
robustness of our methods. Furthermore, we design a proxy task that enforces
the model to identify correlations among image patches, thereby enriching the
fine-grained details crucial for various downstream tasks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on multiple downstream tasks, including classification,
image-to-text retrieval, semantic segmentation, object detection and report
generation.

*Qing Wang,Xiaohang Yang,Yilan Dong,Naveen Raj Govindaraj,Gregory Slabaugh,Shanxin Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DanceChat uses an LLM to guide music-to-dance generation, improving diversity and alignment with music by providing textual motion instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The semantic gap between music and dance, along with the one-to-many mapping challenge, necessitates additional guidance beyond music cues for diverse and accurate dance generation.

Method: DanceChat combines an LLM for textual dance guidance, multi-modal feature fusion, and diffusion-based motion synthesis with alignment loss.

Result: DanceChat outperforms state-of-the-art methods on AIST++ and in human evaluations, generating more diverse and musically aligned dances.

Conclusion: LLM-guided dance generation bridges the music-dance semantic gap, enabling richer and more accurate motion synthesis.

Abstract: Music-to-dance generation aims to synthesize human dance motion conditioned
on musical input. Despite recent progress, significant challenges remain due to
the semantic gap between music and dance motion, as music offers only abstract
cues, such as melody, groove, and emotion, without explicitly specifying the
physical movements. Moreover, a single piece of music can produce multiple
plausible dance interpretations. This one-to-many mapping demands additional
guidance, as music alone provides limited information for generating diverse
dance movements. The challenge is further amplified by the scarcity of paired
music and dance data, which restricts the model\^a\u{A}\'Zs ability to learn
diverse dance patterns. In this paper, we introduce DanceChat, a Large Language
Model (LLM)-guided music-to-dance generation approach. We use an LLM as a
choreographer that provides textual motion instructions, offering explicit,
high-level guidance for dance generation. This approach goes beyond implicit
learning from music alone, enabling the model to generate dance that is both
more diverse and better aligned with musical styles. Our approach consists of
three components: (1) an LLM-based pseudo instruction generation module that
produces textual dance guidance based on music style and structure, (2) a
multi-modal feature extraction and fusion module that integrates music, rhythm,
and textual guidance into a shared representation, and (3) a diffusion-based
motion synthesis module together with a multi-modal alignment loss, which
ensures that the generated dance is aligned with both musical and textual cues.
Extensive experiments on AIST++ and human evaluations show that DanceChat
outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

TL;DR: T2I-PAL reduces the modality gap in CLIP by generating images from text captions, enhancing multi-label recognition with class-wise heatmaps and prototypes, and combining prompt tuning and adapter learning for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The modality gap in CLIP limits image recognition performance when using text captions for fine-tuning, especially in multi-label recognition tasks.

Method: T2I-PAL generates images from text captions using pre-trained text-to-image models, incorporates class-wise heatmaps and learnable prototypes, and combines prompt tuning and adapter learning.

Result: T2I-PAL improves recognition performance by 3.47% on average over state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks like MS-COCO, VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE.

Conclusion: T2I-PAL effectively reduces the modality gap, enhances multi-label recognition, and integrates seamlessly with CLIP, reducing manual annotation needs.

Abstract: Benefited from image-text contrastive learning, pre-trained vision-language
models, e.g., CLIP, allow to direct leverage texts as images (TaI) for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). While CLIP is capable of making image
features to be similar to the corresponding text features, the modality gap
remains a nontrivial issue and limits image recognition performance of TaI.
Using multi-label image recognition (MLR) as an example, we present a novel
method, called T2I-PAL to tackle the modality gap issue when using only text
captions for PEFT. The core design of T2I-PAL is to leverage pre-trained
text-to-image generation models to generate photo-realistic and diverse images
from text captions, thereby reducing the modality gap. To further enhance MLR,
T2I-PAL incorporates a class-wise heatmap and learnable prototypes. This
aggregates local similarities, making the representation of local visual
features more robust and informative for multi-label recognition. For better
PEFT, we further combine both prompt tuning and adapter learning to enhance
classification performance. T2I-PAL offers significant advantages: it
eliminates the need for fully semantically annotated training images, thereby
reducing the manual annotation workload, and it preserves the intrinsic mode of
the CLIP model, allowing for seamless integration with any existing CLIP
framework. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including MS-COCO,
VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE, show that our T2I-PAL can boost recognition performance
by 3.47% in average above the top-ranked state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperSphereDiff introduces directional noise in diffusion models to preserve hyperspherical data geometry, improving generative performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard diffusion models use isotropic Gaussian noise, which fails to capture angular geometry in hyperspherical data, leading to suboptimal results.

Method: HyperSphereDiff aligns hyperspherical structures with directional noise, preserving class geometry and angular uncertainty.

Result: The approach theoretically and empirically aligns the generative process with hyperspherical data geometry, enhancing accuracy.

Conclusion: HyperSphereDiff outperforms on object and face datasets by preserving hyperspherical manifolds, with resources available on GitHub.

Abstract: Do contemporary diffusion models preserve the class geometry of
hyperspherical data? Standard diffusion models rely on isotropic Gaussian noise
in the forward process, inherently favoring Euclidean spaces. However, many
real-world problems involve non-Euclidean distributions, such as hyperspherical
manifolds, where class-specific patterns are governed by angular geometry
within hypercones. When modeled in Euclidean space, these angular subtleties
are lost, leading to suboptimal generative performance. To address this
limitation, we introduce HyperSphereDiff to align hyperspherical structures
with directional noise, preserving class geometry and effectively capturing
angular uncertainty. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that
this approach aligns the generative process with the intrinsic geometry of
hyperspherical data, resulting in more accurate and geometry-aware generative
models. We evaluate our framework on four object datasets and two face
datasets, showing that incorporating angular uncertainty better preserves the
underlying hyperspherical manifold. Resources are available at:

*Jihyeon Seong,Hyunkyung Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study investigates random masking in ViTs under the DINO self-distillation framework, proposing asymmetric masking to retain critical semantic information and improve robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns that indiscriminate random masking may remove critical semantic information in ViTs, prompting the need for more informed masking strategies.

Method: Asymmetric random masking: applied only to the student's global view while preserving student's local views and teacher's global view. Evaluated using DINO-Tiny on mini-ImageNet.

Result: Asymmetric masking yields more robust and fine-grained attention maps, enhancing downstream performance.

Conclusion: Targeted random masking in self-distillation improves model robustness and performance by preserving critical information.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a
wide range of vision tasks. In particular, self-distillation frameworks such as
DINO have contributed significantly to these advances. Within such frameworks,
random masking is often utilized to improve training efficiency and introduce
regularization. However, recent studies have raised concerns that
indiscriminate random masking may inadvertently eliminate critical semantic
information, motivating the development of more informed masking strategies. In
this study, we explore the role of random masking in the self-distillation
setting, focusing on the DINO framework. Specifically, we apply random masking
exclusively to the student's global view, while preserving the student's local
views and the teacher's global view in their original, unmasked forms. This
design leverages DINO's multi-view augmentation scheme to retain clean
supervision while inducing robustness through masked inputs. We evaluate our
approach using DINO-Tiny on the mini-ImageNet dataset and show that random
masking under this asymmetric setup yields more robust and fine-grained
attention maps, ultimately enhancing downstream performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes HEA-MM, a hierarchical error assessment framework for aircraft CAD models, using structured light scanners and multi-level error analysis (global, part, feature).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring high quality in aviation equipment requires precise error assessment of CAD models during manufacturing.

Method: Uses structured light scanners for 3D measurements, registers point clouds with CAD models, and performs error analysis at global, part, and feature levels with optimization-based refinement and circle detection.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness through experiments on aircraft CAD models.

Conclusion: HEA-MM provides a robust method for hierarchical error assessment in aviation manufacturing.

Abstract: The most essential feature of aviation equipment is high quality, including
high performance, high stability and high reliability. In this paper, we
propose a novel hierarchical error assessment framework for aircraft CAD models
within a manufacturing-and-measurement platform, termed HEA-MM. HEA-MM employs
structured light scanners to obtain comprehensive 3D measurements of
manufactured workpieces. The measured point cloud is registered with the
reference CAD model, followed by an error analysis conducted at three
hierarchical levels: global, part, and feature. At the global level, the error
analysis evaluates the overall deviation of the scanned point cloud from the
reference CAD model. At the part level, error analysis is performed on these
patches underlying the point clouds. We propose a novel optimization-based
primitive refinement method to obtain a set of meaningful patches of point
clouds. Two basic operations, splitting and merging, are introduced to refine
the coarse primitives. At the feature level, error analysis is performed on
circular holes, which are commonly found in CAD models. To facilitate it, a
two-stage algorithm is introduced for the detection of circular holes. First,
edge points are identified using a tensor-voting algorithm. Then, multiple
circles are fitted through a hypothesize-and-clusterize framework, ensuring
accurate detection and analysis of the circular features. Experimental results
on various aircraft CAD models demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

*Xinyuan Liu,Hang Xu,Yike Ma,Yucheng Zhang,Feng Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSP is a framework for oriented object detection in remote sensing, improving sample assignment and box extraction under point supervision, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-density scenes in remote sensing require labor-intensive annotation, and existing point-supervised methods suffer from poor sample assignment and instance confusion.

Method: SSP combines rule-driven prior injection and data-driven label purification, featuring pixel-level spatial partition for sample assignment and semantic spatial partition for box extraction.

Result: SSP achieves 45.78% mAP, surpassing PointOBB-v2 by 4.10%, and integrates well with ORCNN (47.86% mAP) and ReDet (48.50% mAP).

Conclusion: SSP effectively addresses challenges in point-supervised oriented object detection, offering a robust solution for high-density remote sensing scenes.

Abstract: Recent remote sensing tech advancements drive imagery growth, making oriented
object detection rapid development, yet hindered by labor-intensive annotation
for high-density scenes. Oriented object detection with point supervision
offers a cost-effective solution for densely packed scenes in remote sensing,
yet existing methods suffer from inadequate sample assignment and instance
confusion due to rigid rule-based designs. To address this, we propose SSP
(Semantic-decoupled Spatial Partition), a unified framework that synergizes
rule-driven prior injection and data-driven label purification. Specifically,
SSP introduces two core innovations: 1) Pixel-level Spatial Partition-based
Sample Assignment, which compactly estimates the upper and lower bounds of
object scales and mines high-quality positive samples and hard negative samples
through spatial partitioning of pixel maps. 2) Semantic Spatial Partition-based
Box Extraction, which derives instances from spatial partitions modulated by
semantic maps and reliably converts them into bounding boxes to form
pseudo-labels for supervising the learning of downstream detectors. Experiments
on DOTA-v1.0 and others demonstrate SSP\' s superiority: it achieves 45.78% mAP
under point supervision, outperforming SOTA method PointOBB-v2 by 4.10%.
Furthermore, when integrated with ORCNN and ReDet architectures, the SSP
framework achieves mAP values of 47.86% and 48.50%, respectively. The code is

### [61] [High-resolution efficient image generation from WiFi CSI using a pretrained latent diffusion model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10605)
*Eshan Ramesh,Nishio Takayuki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LatentCSI uses a pretrained latent diffusion model (LDM) to generate high-resolution images from WiFi CSI measurements, outperforming traditional methods in efficiency and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify and improve image generation from WiFi CSI data by avoiding complex techniques like GANs and leveraging LDMs for better efficiency and quality.

Method: A lightweight neural network maps CSI amplitudes into an LDM's latent space, followed by denoising diffusion with text guidance and decoding to produce images.

Result: LatentCSI outperforms baselines in computational efficiency and perceptual quality, validated on custom and public datasets.

Conclusion: LatentCSI offers efficient, high-quality image synthesis with text-guided controllability, advancing WiFi-based imaging.

Abstract: We present LatentCSI, a novel method for generating images of the physical
environment from WiFi CSI measurements that leverages a pretrained latent
diffusion model (LDM). Unlike prior approaches that rely on complex and
computationally intensive techniques such as GANs, our method employs a
lightweight neural network to map CSI amplitudes directly into the latent space
of an LDM. We then apply the LDM's denoising diffusion model to the latent
representation with text-based guidance before decoding using the LDM's
pretrained decoder to obtain a high-resolution image. This design bypasses the
challenges of pixel-space image generation and avoids the explicit image
encoding stage typically required in conventional image-to-image pipelines,
enabling efficient and high-quality image synthesis. We validate our approach
on two datasets: a wide-band CSI dataset we collected with off-the-shelf WiFi
devices and cameras; and a subset of the publicly available MM-Fi dataset. The
results demonstrate that LatentCSI outperforms baselines of comparable
complexity trained directly on ground-truth images in both computational
efficiency and perceptual quality, while additionally providing practical
advantages through its unique capacity for text-guided controllability.

TL;DR: MSTAR introduces a box-free scene text retrieval method, leveraging progressive vision embedding and style-aware instructions to unify diverse queries, outperforming prior models while eliminating costly annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing scene text retrieval methods rely on expensive bounding box annotations and struggle with diverse query types, limiting flexibility and scalability.

Method: MSTAR uses progressive vision embedding for multi-grained text representation, harmonizes free-style queries with style-aware instructions, and employs a multi-instance matching module for vision-language alignment.

Result: MSTAR surpasses state-of-the-art models by 6.4% in MAP on Total-Text and by 8.5% on the new MQTR benchmark, while removing annotation costs.

Conclusion: MSTAR offers a scalable, annotation-free solution for multi-query scene text retrieval, validated by superior performance on public and new datasets.

Abstract: Scene text retrieval has made significant progress with the assistance of
accurate text localization. However, existing approaches typically require
costly bounding box annotations for training. Besides, they mostly adopt a
customized retrieval strategy but struggle to unify various types of queries to
meet diverse retrieval needs. To address these issues, we introduce Muti-query
Scene Text retrieval with Attention Recycling (MSTAR), a box-free approach for
scene text retrieval. It incorporates progressive vision embedding to
dynamically capture the multi-grained representation of texts and harmonizes
free-style text queries with style-aware instructions. Additionally, a
multi-instance matching module is integrated to enhance vision-language
alignment. Furthermore, we build the Multi-Query Text Retrieval (MQTR) dataset,
the first benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-query scene text retrieval
capability of models, comprising four query types and 16k images. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method across seven public
datasets and the MQTR dataset. Notably, MSTAR marginally surpasses the previous
state-of-the-art model by 6.4% in MAP on Total-Text while eliminating box
annotation costs. Moreover, on the MQTR benchmark, MSTAR significantly
outperforms the previous models by an average of 8.5%. The code and datasets

### [63] [TexTailor: Customized Text-aligned Texturing via Effective Resampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10612)
*Suin Lee,Dae-Shik Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TexTailor improves texture synthesis from text by integrating resampling and adaptive camera positioning, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods suffer from texture inconsistency due to insufficient integration of synthesized textures and fixed camera viewpoints.

Method: TexTailor uses resampling and fine-tuning in diffusion models, along with adaptive camera positioning and a performance preservation loss.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on Objaverse and ShapeNet datasets.

Conclusion: TexTailor effectively addresses texture inconsistency and improves synthesis quality.

Abstract: We present TexTailor, a novel method for generating consistent object
textures from textual descriptions. Existing text-to-texture synthesis
approaches utilize depth-aware diffusion models to progressively generate
images and synthesize textures across predefined multiple viewpoints. However,
these approaches lead to a gradual shift in texture properties across
viewpoints due to (1) insufficient integration of previously synthesized
textures at each viewpoint during the diffusion process and (2) the
autoregressive nature of the texture synthesis process. Moreover, the
predefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the
object's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized
from different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In
TexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that
repeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within
the diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on
these resampled textures. During this process, we observed that using only a
few training images restricts the model's original ability to generate
high-fidelity images aligned with the conditioning, and therefore propose an
performance preservation loss to mitigate this issue. Additionally, we improve
the synthesis of view-consistent textures by adaptively adjusting camera
positions based on the object's geometry. Experiments on a subset of the
Objaverse dataset and the ShapeNet car dataset demonstrate that TexTailor
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in synthesizing view-consistent textures.

*Konstantinos Vilouras,Ilias Stogiannidis,Junyu Yan,Alison Q. O'Neil,Sotirios A. Tsaftaris*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the underperformance of text-to-image Latent Diffusion Models in medical imaging, proposing a fine-tuning framework to improve alignment between radiology reports and chest X-rays, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent Diffusion Models excel in natural images but underperform in medical imaging due to limited data and poor alignment between text and scans.

Method: A fine-tuning framework is introduced to enhance multi-modal alignment in pre-trained models for tasks like phrase grounding.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on MS-CXR and robust results on out-of-distribution data (VinDr-CXR).

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively improves alignment and performance, with potential for broader medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models have shown remarkable results in text-guided image
synthesis in recent years. In the domain of natural (RGB) images, recent works
have shown that such models can be adapted to various vision-language
downstream tasks with little to no supervision involved. On the contrary,
text-to-image Latent Diffusion Models remain relatively underexplored in the
field of medical imaging, primarily due to limited data availability (e.g., due
to privacy concerns). In this work, focusing on the chest X-ray modality, we
first demonstrate that a standard text-conditioned Latent Diffusion Model has
not learned to align clinically relevant information in free-text radiology
reports with the corresponding areas of the given scan. Then, to alleviate this
issue, we propose a fine-tuning framework to improve multi-modal alignment in a
pre-trained model such that it can be efficiently repurposed for downstream
tasks such as phrase grounding. Our method sets a new state-of-the-art on a
standard benchmark dataset (MS-CXR), while also exhibiting robust performance
on out-of-distribution data (VinDr-CXR). Our code will be made publicly
available.

TL;DR: Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow) unifies semantic segmentation, classification, and image generation in one model, achieving state-of-the-art results with efficient sampling and bi-directional consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified framework for continuous transformations between distributions, enabling high-fidelity generative modeling while supporting diverse tasks like segmentation and classification.

Method: Introduces a symmetric learning objective for joint forward and reverse transformations, ensuring bi-directional consistency and preserving entropy for diversity. A new training objective retains semantic information across flows.

Result: Achieves FID scores of 11.9 on CelebAMask-HQ and 7.0 on COCO-Stuff with 25 inference steps, and shows competitive performance in segmentation and classification.

Conclusion: SymmFlow is a versatile and efficient framework for generative modeling, segmentation, and classification, with strong empirical results.

Abstract: Flow Matching has emerged as a powerful framework for learning continuous
transformations between distributions, enabling high-fidelity generative
modeling. This work introduces Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow), a new
formulation that unifies semantic segmentation, classification, and image
generation within a single model. Using a symmetric learning objective,
SymmFlow models forward and reverse transformations jointly, ensuring
bi-directional consistency, while preserving sufficient entropy for generative
diversity. A new training objective is introduced to explicitly retain semantic
information across flows, featuring efficient sampling while preserving
semantic structure, allowing for one-step segmentation and classification
without iterative refinement. Unlike previous approaches that impose strict
one-to-one mapping between masks and images, SymmFlow generalizes to flexible
conditioning, supporting both pixel-level and image-level class labels.
Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that SymmFlow achieves
state-of-the-art performance on semantic image synthesis, obtaining FID scores
of 11.9 on CelebAMask-HQ and 7.0 on COCO-Stuff with only 25 inference steps.
Additionally, it delivers competitive results on semantic segmentation and
shows promising capabilities in classification tasks. The code will be publicly
available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GigaVideo-1 is an efficient fine-tuning framework for video diffusion models, improving generation quality without human supervision or extra data, achieving a 4% average gain with minimal resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fine-tuning methods for video diffusion models rely on human annotations and high computational costs, limiting practicality. GigaVideo-1 aims to address this by leveraging automatic feedback.

Method: The framework uses a prompt-driven data engine for diverse training samples and a reward-guided training strategy with pre-trained vision-language models for optimization.

Result: GigaVideo-1 improves performance on 17 evaluation dimensions by ~4% using only 4 GPU-hours, without manual annotations or additional real data.

Conclusion: GigaVideo-1 is an effective and efficient solution for enhancing video generation, requiring minimal resources and no human supervision.

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion models has greatly enhanced video generation
quality, yet these models still require fine-tuning to improve specific
dimensions like instance preservation, motion rationality, composition, and
physical plausibility. Existing fine-tuning approaches often rely on human
annotations and large-scale computational resources, limiting their
practicality. In this work, we propose GigaVideo-1, an efficient fine-tuning
framework that advances video generation without additional human supervision.
Rather than injecting large volumes of high-quality data from external sources,
GigaVideo-1 unlocks the latent potential of pre-trained video diffusion models
through automatic feedback. Specifically, we focus on two key aspects of the
fine-tuning process: data and optimization. To improve fine-tuning data, we
design a prompt-driven data engine that constructs diverse, weakness-oriented
training samples. On the optimization side, we introduce a reward-guided
training strategy, which adaptively weights samples using feedback from
pre-trained vision-language models with a realism constraint. We evaluate
GigaVideo-1 on the VBench-2.0 benchmark using Wan2.1 as the baseline across 17
evaluation dimensions. Experiments show that GigaVideo-1 consistently improves
performance on almost all the dimensions with an average gain of about 4% using
only 4 GPU-hours. Requiring no manual annotations and minimal real data,
GigaVideo-1 demonstrates both effectiveness and efficiency. Code, model, and
data will be publicly available.

*Marzieh Oghbaie,Teresa Araújoa,Hrvoje Bogunović*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PiPViT introduces patch-based prototypes for medical imaging, improving interpretability and lesion extent approximation using ViT and contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prototype methods lack consistency with human-understandable biomarkers and granularity for medical imaging.

Method: PiPViT uses ViT for long-range patch dependencies, contrastive learning, and multi-resolution processing to learn interpretable prototypes.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on retinal OCT classification with clinically relevant prototypes.

Conclusion: PiPViT provides transparent explanations, aiding clinicians in understanding diagnostic outcomes.

Abstract: Background and Objective: Prototype-based methods improve interpretability by
learning fine-grained part-prototypes; however, their visualization in the
input pixel space is not always consistent with human-understandable
biomarkers. In addition, well-known prototype-based approaches typically learn
extremely granular prototypes that are less interpretable in medical imaging,
where both the presence and extent of biomarkers and lesions are critical.
  Methods: To address these challenges, we propose PiPViT (Patch-based Visual
Interpretable Prototypes), an inherently interpretable prototypical model for
image recognition. Leveraging a vision transformer (ViT), PiPViT captures
long-range dependencies among patches to learn robust, human-interpretable
prototypes that approximate lesion extent only using image-level labels.
Additionally, PiPViT benefits from contrastive learning and multi-resolution
input processing, which enables effective localization of biomarkers across
scales.
  Results: We evaluated PiPViT on retinal OCT image classification across four
datasets, where it achieved competitive quantitative performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods while delivering more meaningful explanations.
Moreover, quantitative evaluation on a hold-out test set confirms that the
learned prototypes are semantically and clinically relevant. We believe PiPViT
can transparently explain its decisions and assist clinicians in understanding
diagnostic outcomes. Github page: https://github.com/marziehoghbaie/PiPViT

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a lightweight CNN with SE block for efficient deepfake detection, achieving high accuracy with minimal resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfakes challenge information authenticity; existing detection models are resource-heavy.

Method: Uses a lightweight CNN with SE block for dynamic feature recalibration, integrated into a sequential model.

Result: Achieved 94.14% accuracy and 0.985 AUC-ROC on Style GAN dataset.

Conclusion: The model offers an efficient, scalable solution for deepfake detection with low computational cost.

Abstract: In the digital age, Deepfake present a formidable challenge by using advanced
artificial intelligence to create highly convincing manipulated content,
undermining information authenticity and security. These sophisticated
fabrications surpass traditional detection methods in complexity and realism.
To address this issue, we aim to harness cutting-edge deep learning
methodologies to engineer an innovative deepfake detection model. However, most
of the models designed for deepfake detection are large, causing heavy storage
and memory consumption. In this research, we propose a lightweight convolution
neural network (CNN) with squeeze and excitation block attention (SE) for
Deepfake detection. The SE block module is designed to perform dynamic
channel-wise feature recalibration. The SE block allows the network to
emphasize informative features and suppress less useful ones, which leads to a
more efficient and effective learning module. This module is integrated with a
simple sequential model to perform Deepfake detection. The model is smaller in
size and it achieves competing accuracy with the existing models for deepfake
detection tasks. The model achieved an overall classification accuracy of
94.14% and AUC-ROC score of 0.985 on the Style GAN dataset from the Diverse
Fake Face Dataset. Our proposed approach presents a promising avenue for
combating the Deepfake challenge with minimal computational resources,
developing efficient and scalable solutions for digital content verification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UAC, a framework for generating adversarial CAPTCHAs using text prompts and LLMs, improving diversity and attack effectiveness. BP-UAC is proposed for black-box scenarios, achieving high success rates with natural-looking CAPTCHAs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CAPTCHAs are vulnerable to DNN-based attacks. Existing adversarial methods often distort images, making them hard for humans to interpret and limiting their use without initial images.

Method: UAC leverages LLMs for CAPTCHA diversity and supports targeted (using EDICT) and untargeted attacks (BP-UAC for black-box scenarios). BP-UAC uses multimodal gradients and bi-path optimization.

Result: BP-UAC achieves high attack success rates, generating CAPTCHAs that fool both humans and DNNs.

Conclusion: UAC and BP-UAC effectively address CAPTCHA vulnerabilities, offering robust adversarial examples for diverse attack scenarios.

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in deep learning, traditional CAPTCHA schemes are
increasingly vulnerable to automated attacks powered by deep neural networks
(DNNs). Existing adversarial attack methods often rely on original image
characteristics, resulting in distortions that hinder human interpretation and
limit applicability in scenarios lacking initial input images. To address these
challenges, we propose the Unsourced Adversarial CAPTCHA (UAC), a novel
framework generating high-fidelity adversarial examples guided by
attacker-specified text prompts. Leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM), UAC
enhances CAPTCHA diversity and supports both targeted and untargeted attacks.
For targeted attacks, the EDICT method optimizes dual latent variables in a
diffusion model for superior image quality. In untargeted attacks, especially
for black-box scenarios, we introduce bi-path unsourced adversarial CAPTCHA
(BP-UAC), a two-step optimization strategy employing multimodal gradients and
bi-path optimization for efficient misclassification. Experiments show BP-UAC
achieves high attack success rates across diverse systems, generating natural
CAPTCHAs indistinguishable to humans and DNNs.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Accurate automatic screening of minors in unconstrained images demands models
that are robust to distribution shift and resilient to the children
under-representation in publicly available data. To overcome these issues, we
propose a multi-task architecture with dedicated under/over-age discrimination
tasks based on a frozen FaRL vision-language backbone joined with a compact
two-layer MLP that shares features across one age-regression head and four
binary under-age heads for age thresholds of 12, 15, 18, and 21 years, focusing
on the legally critical age range. To address the severe class imbalance, we
introduce an $\alpha$-reweighted focal-style loss and age-balanced mini-batch
sampling, which equalizes twelve age bins during stochastic optimization.
Further improvement is achieved with an age gap that removes edge cases from
the loss.
  Moreover, we set a rigorous evaluation by proposing the Overall Under-Age
Benchmark, with 303k cleaned training images and 110k test images, defining
both the "ASORES-39k" restricted overall test, which removes the noisiest
domains, and the age estimation wild shifts test "ASWIFT-20k" of 20k-images,
stressing extreme pose ($>$45{\deg}), expression, and low image quality to
emulate real-world shifts.
  Trained on the cleaned overall set with resampling and age gap, our multiage
model "F" lowers the root-mean-square-error on the ASORES-39k restricted test
from 5.733 (age-only baseline) to 5.656 years and lifts under-18 detection from
F2 score of 0.801 to 0.857 at 1% false-adult rate. Under the domain shift to
the wild data of ASWIFT-20k, the same configuration nearly sustains 0.99 recall
while boosting F2 from 0.742 to 0.833 with respect to the age-only baseline,
demonstrating strong generalization under distribution shift. For the under-12
and under-15 tasks, the respective boosts in F2 are from 0.666 to 0.955 and
from 0.689 to 0.916, respectively.

TL;DR: HyperCLIC introduces a continual learning algorithm for hierarchical data, using hyperbolic space to balance instance and class recognition, validated on the EgoObjects dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications like robotics require models to handle both instance and class learning simultaneously, addressing hierarchical granularity.

Method: Proposes HyperCLIC, leveraging hyperbolic space for hierarchical data, with hyperbolic classification and distillation objectives.

Result: HyperCLIC effectively operates at multiple granularities, improving hierarchical generalization.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses continual learning of hierarchical data, validated by empirical results.

Abstract: Continual learning has traditionally focused on classifying either instances
or classes, but real-world applications, such as robotics and self-driving
cars, require models to handle both simultaneously. To mirror real-life
scenarios, we introduce the task of continual learning of instances and
classes, at the same time. This task challenges models to adapt to multiple
levels of granularity over time, which requires balancing fine-grained instance
recognition with coarse-grained class generalization. In this paper, we
identify that classes and instances naturally form a hierarchical structure. To
model these hierarchical relationships, we propose HyperCLIC, a continual
learning algorithm that leverages hyperbolic space, which is uniquely suited
for hierarchical data due to its ability to represent tree-like structures with
low distortion and compact embeddings. Our framework incorporates hyperbolic
classification and distillation objectives, enabling the continual embedding of
hierarchical relations. To evaluate performance across multiple granularities,
we introduce continual hierarchical metrics. We validate our approach on
EgoObjects, the only dataset that captures the complexity of hierarchical
object recognition in dynamic real-world environments. Empirical results show
that HyperCLIC operates effectively at multiple granularities with improved
hierarchical generalization.

TL;DR: The paper proposes UMBD, a generative refinement framework for Camouflaged Object Detection (COD), using uncertainty-guided masking and Bernoulli diffusion to improve segmentation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing COD methods lack effective post-processing refinement, leaving room for improvement in segmentation accuracy.

Method: UMBD introduces an uncertainty-guided masking mechanism and Bernoulli diffusion for targeted refinement, supported by HUQNet for uncertainty quantification.

Result: UMBD achieves average gains of 5.5% in MAE and 3.2% in weighted F-measure across COD benchmarks.

Conclusion: UMBD effectively enhances COD performance with minimal computational overhead and is compatible with existing models.

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) presents inherent challenges due to the
subtle visual differences between targets and their backgrounds. While existing
methods have made notable progress, there remains significant potential for
post-processing refinement that has yet to be fully explored. To address this
limitation, we propose the Uncertainty-Masked Bernoulli Diffusion (UMBD) model,
the first generative refinement framework specifically designed for COD. UMBD
introduces an uncertainty-guided masking mechanism that selectively applies
Bernoulli diffusion to residual regions with poor segmentation quality,
enabling targeted refinement while preserving correctly segmented areas. To
support this process, we design the Hybrid Uncertainty Quantification Network
(HUQNet), which employs a multi-branch architecture and fuses uncertainty from
multiple sources to improve estimation accuracy. This enables adaptive guidance
during the generative sampling process. The proposed UMBD framework can be
seamlessly integrated with a wide range of existing Encoder-Decoder-based COD
models, combining their discriminative capabilities with the generative
advantages of diffusion-based refinement. Extensive experiments across multiple
COD benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance improvements, achieving
average gains of 5.5% in MAE and 3.2% in weighted F-measure with only modest
computational overhead. Code will be released.

TL;DR: A deep-learning method generates synthetic golden standards for InP wafer defect detection, outperforming traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of golden standards in InP wafer manufacturing makes defect detection manual and inefficient.

Method: Deep Neural Networks simulate photo-realistic wafer images from CAD data, evaluated on synthetic and real images.

Result: Outperforms decision-tree baselines, enabling efficient defect detection with simulated golden dies.

Conclusion: The method enhances defect detection in InP wafer manufacturing, demonstrating practical utility.

Abstract: Quality management in semiconductor manufacturing often relies on template
matching with known golden standards. For Indium-Phosphide (InP) multi-project
wafer manufacturing, low production scale and high design variability lead to
such golden standards being typically unavailable. Defect detection, in turn,
is manual and labor-intensive. This work addresses this challenge by proposing
a methodology to generate a synthetic golden standard using Deep Neural
Networks, trained to simulate photo-realistic InP wafer images from CAD data.
We evaluate various training objectives and assess the quality of the simulated
images on both synthetic data and InP wafer photographs. Our
deep-learning-based method outperforms a baseline decision-tree-based approach,
enabling the use of a 'simulated golden die' from CAD plans in any user-defined
region of a wafer for more efficient defect detection. We apply our method to a
template matching procedure, to demonstrate its practical utility in surface
defect detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based methods rely on predefined prompts and lack effectiveness in distinguishing anomalies, especially in medical tasks.

Method: IQE-CLIP introduces class-based and learnable prompting tokens and an instance-aware query module for anomaly-sensitive embeddings.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on six medical datasets in zero- and few-shot settings.

Conclusion: IQE-CLIP effectively addresses limitations in medical anomaly detection, offering a robust framework for future applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models, such as CLIP, have significantly
improved performance in zero- and few-shot anomaly detection (ZFSAD) tasks.
However, most existing CLIP-based methods assume prior knowledge of categories
and rely on carefully designed prompts tailored to specific scenarios. While
these text prompts capture semantic information in the textual space, they
often fail to distinguish normal and anomalous instances in the joint embedding
space. Moreover, most ZFSAD approaches focus on industrial domains, with
limited exploration in medical tasks. To address these limitations, we propose
IQE-CLIP, a novel framework for ZFSAD in the medical domain. We show that query
embeddings integrating both textual and instance-aware visual information serve
as more effective indicators of anomalies. Specifically, we introduce
class-based and learnable prompting tokens to better adapt CLIP to the medical
setting. Furthermore, we design an instance-aware query module that extracts
region-level contextual information from both modalities, enabling the
generation of anomaly-sensitive embeddings. Extensive experiments on six
medical datasets demonstrate that IQE-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Code and data are

*SiXiang Chen,Jianyu Lai,Jialin Gao,Tian Ye,Haoyu Chen,Hengyu Shi,Shitong Shao,Yunlong Lin,Song Fei,Zhaohu Xing,Yeying Jin,Junfeng Luo,Xiaoming Wei,Lei Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PosterCraft is a unified framework for generating high-aesthetic posters, outperforming baselines in rendering, layout, and visual appeal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating aesthetic posters requires seamless integration of text, art, and layout, which existing modular pipelines fail to achieve.

Method: PosterCraft uses a cascaded workflow: text-rendering optimization, region-aware fine-tuning, aesthetic-text reinforcement learning, and joint vision-language refinement.

Result: PosterCraft outperforms baselines in rendering accuracy, layout coherence, and visual appeal, nearing SOTA commercial systems.

Conclusion: PosterCraft offers a robust, automated solution for high-quality poster generation, with open-sourced code, models, and datasets.

Abstract: Generating aesthetic posters is more challenging than simple design images:
it requires not only precise text rendering but also the seamless integration
of abstract artistic content, striking layouts, and overall stylistic harmony.
To address this, we propose PosterCraft, a unified framework that abandons
prior modular pipelines and rigid, predefined layouts, allowing the model to
freely explore coherent, visually compelling compositions. PosterCraft employs
a carefully designed, cascaded workflow to optimize the generation of
high-aesthetic posters: (i) large-scale text-rendering optimization on our
newly introduced Text-Render-2M dataset; (ii) region-aware supervised
fine-tuning on HQ-Poster100K; (iii) aesthetic-text-reinforcement learning via
best-of-n preference optimization; and (iv) joint vision-language feedback
refinement. Each stage is supported by a fully automated data-construction
pipeline tailored to its specific needs, enabling robust training without
complex architectural modifications. Evaluated on multiple experiments,
PosterCraft significantly outperforms open-source baselines in rendering
accuracy, layout coherence, and overall visual appeal-approaching the quality
of SOTA commercial systems. Our code, models, and datasets can be found in the

### [76] [Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier: Image Super-Resolution at Arbitrary Ultra-Large Scales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10774)
*Wenhao Guo,Peng Lu,Xujun Peng,Zhaoran Zhao,Sheng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier (SbCA) for ultra-large image upsampling, addressing performance decline and blurring in prior methods by decomposing images into vector strokes and iteratively refining details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior ASISR methods perform poorly for upsampling factors beyond training data range, causing blurring and artifacts.

Method: SbCA decomposes images into vector strokes for magnification and uses a detail completion module to restore missing details, iteratively refining for ultra-large upsampling.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in ultra-large upsampling (e.g., ×100), producing high-quality, artifact-free images.

Conclusion: SbCA effectively addresses distribution drift and blurring, offering superior visual quality for ultra-large upsampling tasks.

Abstract: Prior Arbitrary-Scale Image Super-Resolution (ASISR) methods often experience
a significant performance decline when the upsampling factor exceeds the range
covered by the training data, introducing substantial blurring. To address this
issue, we propose a unified model, Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier (SbCA), for
ultra-large upsampling tasks. The key of SbCA is the stroke vector amplifier,
which decomposes the image into a series of strokes represented as vector
graphics for magnification. Then, the detail completion module also restores
missing details, ensuring high-fidelity image reconstruction. Our cyclic
strategy achieves ultra-large upsampling by iteratively refining details with
this unified SbCA model, trained only once for all, while keeping sub-scales
within the training range. Our approach effectively addresses the distribution
drift issue and eliminates artifacts, noise and blurring, producing
high-quality, high-resolution super-resolved images. Experimental validations
on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods in ultra-large upsampling tasks
(e.g. $\times100$), delivering visual quality far superior to state-of-the-art
techniques.

*Jian Li,Wan Han,Ning Lin,Yu-Liang Zhan,Ruizhi Chengze,Haining Wang,Yi Zhang,Hongsheng Liu,Zidong Wang,Fan Yu,Hao Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SlotPi integrates physics knowledge into object-centric reasoning, improving dynamic scenario prediction and adaptability, validated on diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address gaps in current object-centric models by incorporating physical knowledge and validating adaptability across varied scenarios, especially involving fluids.

Method: SlotPi combines a Hamiltonian-based physical module with a spatio-temporal prediction module for dynamic forecasting.

Result: Strong performance in prediction and VQA tasks on benchmark and fluid datasets, with adaptability shown on a new real-world dataset.

Conclusion: SlotPi's robustness and adaptability advance dynamic reasoning, supporting future world model development.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about dynamics governed by physical laws through
visual observation, akin to human capabilities in the real world, poses
significant challenges. Currently, object-centric dynamic simulation methods,
which emulate human behavior, have achieved notable progress but overlook two
critical aspects: 1) the integration of physical knowledge into models. Humans
gain physical insights by observing the world and apply this knowledge to
accurately reason about various dynamic scenarios; 2) the validation of model
adaptability across diverse scenarios. Real-world dynamics, especially those
involving fluids and objects, demand models that not only capture object
interactions but also simulate fluid flow characteristics. To address these
gaps, we introduce SlotPi, a slot-based physics-informed object-centric
reasoning model. SlotPi integrates a physical module based on Hamiltonian
principles with a spatio-temporal prediction module for dynamic forecasting.
Our experiments highlight the model's strengths in tasks such as prediction and
Visual Question Answering (VQA) on benchmark and fluid datasets. Furthermore,
we have created a real-world dataset encompassing object interactions, fluid
dynamics, and fluid-object interactions, on which we validated our model's
capabilities. The model's robust performance across all datasets underscores
its strong adaptability, laying a foundation for developing more advanced world
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of conventional image-based controllers, such as fixed rates, motion blur, and latency, by leveraging event cameras' asynchronous nature.

Method: Combines event-based perception, range sensing, and policy optimization via Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient, with imitation learning for efficiency.

Result: Achieves robust navigation, pedestrian following, and obstacle avoidance in simulated environments.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates promising results for adaptive and efficient robot navigation.

Abstract: This work introduces a robot navigation controller that combines event
cameras and other sensors with reinforcement learning to enable real-time
human-centered navigation and obstacle avoidance. Unlike conventional
image-based controllers, which operate at fixed rates and suffer from motion
blur and latency, this approach leverages the asynchronous nature of event
cameras to process visual information over flexible time intervals, enabling
adaptive inference and control. The framework integrates event-based
perception, additional range sensing, and policy optimization via Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient, with an initial imitation learning phase to
improve sample efficiency. Promising results are achieved in simulated
environments, demonstrating robust navigation, pedestrian following, and
obstacle avoidance. A demo video is available at the project website.

*Mario Barbara,Alaa Maalouf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A zero-shot, text-queryable video summarizer (Prompts-to-Summaries) uses pretrained video-language models and LLMs to create user-guided summaries without training data, outperforming unsupervised and matching supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for flexible, user-controllable video summarization tools without domain-specific training data, overcoming limitations of existing methods.

Method: Segments video into scenes, generates descriptions via VidLM, uses LLM for importance scoring, and propagates scores via consistency and uniqueness metrics.

Result: Surpasses unsupervised methods on SumMe and TVSum, performs competitively on QFVS, and introduces VidSum-Reason dataset.

Conclusion: Pretrained multimodal models with principled prompting enable universal, text-queryable video summarization.

Abstract: The explosive growth of video data intensified the need for flexible
user-controllable summarization tools that can operate without domain-specific
training data. Existing methods either rely on datasets, limiting
generalization, or cannot incorporate user intent expressed in natural
language. We introduce Prompts-to-Summaries: the first zero-shot,
text-queryable video summarizer that converts off-the-shelf video-language
models (VidLMs) captions into user-guided skims via large language models
(LLMs) judging, without the use of training data at all, beating all
unsupervised and matching supervised methods. Our pipeline (i) segments raw
video footage into coherent scenes, (ii) generates rich scene-level
descriptions through a memory-efficient, batch-style VidLM prompting scheme
that scales to hours-long videos on a single GPU, (iii) leverages an LLM as a
judge to assign scene-level importance scores under a carefully crafted prompt,
and finally, (iv) propagates those scores to short segments level via two new
metrics: consistency (temporal coherency) and uniqueness (novelty), yielding
fine-grained frame importance. On SumMe and TVSum, our data-free approach
surpasses all prior data-hungry unsupervised methods. It also performs
competitively on the Query-Focused Video Summarization (QFVS) benchmark,
despite using no training data and the competing methods requiring supervised
frame-level importance. To spur further research, we release VidSum-Reason, a
new query-driven dataset featuring long-tailed concepts and multi-step
reasoning; our framework attains robust F1 scores and serves as the first
challenging baseline. Overall, our results demonstrate that pretrained
multimodal models, when orchestrated with principled prompting and score
propagation, already provide a powerful foundation for universal,
text-queryable video summarization.

### [80] [Unsupervised Deformable Image Registration with Structural Nonparametric Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10813)
*Hang Zhang,Xiang Chen,Renjiu Hu,Rongguang Wang,Jinwei Zhang,Min Liu,Yaonan Wang,Gaolei Li,Xinxing Cheng,Jinming Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SmoothProper is a neural module for deformable image registration (DIR) that enforces smoothness and message passing, addressing challenges in sparse-feature images like retinal vessels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised DIR methods struggle with sparse features and large displacements, as deformation fields are unconstrained post-training.

Method: SmoothProper integrates a duality-based optimization layer to propagate flow signals, enforce smoothness, and preserve structure. It is model-agnostic and requires no hyperparameter tuning.

Result: On a retinal vessel dataset, SmoothProper reduces registration error to 1.88 pixels on 2912x2912 images, effectively addressing aperture and large-displacement challenges.

Conclusion: SmoothProper is the first unsupervised DIR method to tackle sparse-feature and large-displacement issues, offering a plug-and-play solution with minimal overhead.

Abstract: Learning-based deformable image registration (DIR) accelerates alignment by
amortizing traditional optimization via neural networks. Label supervision
further enhances accuracy, enabling efficient and precise nonlinear alignment
of unseen scans. However, images with sparse features amid large smooth
regions, such as retinal vessels, introduce aperture and large-displacement
challenges that unsupervised DIR methods struggle to address. This limitation
occurs because neural networks predict deformation fields in a single forward
pass, leaving fields unconstrained post-training and shifting the
regularization burden entirely to network weights. To address these issues, we
introduce SmoothProper, a plug-and-play neural module enforcing smoothness and
promoting message passing within the network's forward pass. By integrating a
duality-based optimization layer with tailored interaction terms, SmoothProper
efficiently propagates flow signals across spatial locations, enforces
smoothness, and preserves structural consistency. It is model-agnostic,
seamlessly integrates into existing registration frameworks with minimal
parameter overhead, and eliminates regularizer hyperparameter tuning.
Preliminary results on a retinal vessel dataset exhibiting aperture and
large-displacement challenges demonstrate our method reduces registration error
to 1.88 pixels on 2912x2912 images, marking the first unsupervised DIR approach
to effectively address both challenges. The source code will be available at

*Hui Yang,Wei Sun,Jian Liu,Jin Zheng,Jian Xiao,Ajmal Mian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOMAE is an occlusion-aware hand-object pose estimation method using masked autoencoders, combining SDF and point cloud for robust performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack global structural perception for occluded hand-object interactions.

Method: Proposes target-focused masking, multi-scale features, and SDF-point cloud fusion.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on DexYCB and HO3Dv2 benchmarks.

Conclusion: HOMAE effectively handles occlusions and improves pose estimation accuracy.

Abstract: Hand-object pose estimation from monocular RGB images remains a significant
challenge mainly due to the severe occlusions inherent in hand-object
interactions. Existing methods do not sufficiently explore global structural
perception and reasoning, which limits their effectiveness in handling occluded
hand-object interactions. To address this challenge, we propose an
occlusion-aware hand-object pose estimation method based on masked
autoencoders, termed as HOMAE. Specifically, we propose a target-focused
masking strategy that imposes structured occlusion on regions of hand-object
interaction, encouraging the model to learn context-aware features and reason
about the occluded structures. We further integrate multi-scale features
extracted from the decoder to predict a signed distance field (SDF), capturing
both global context and fine-grained geometry. To enhance geometric perception,
we combine the implicit SDF with an explicit point cloud derived from the SDF,
leveraging the complementary strengths of both representations. This fusion
enables more robust handling of occluded regions by combining the global
context from the SDF with the precise local geometry provided by the point
cloud. Extensive experiments on challenging DexYCB and HO3Dv2 benchmarks
demonstrate that HOMAE achieves state-of-the-art performance in hand-object
pose estimation. We will release our code and model.

TL;DR: VideoDeepResearch introduces a text-only large reasoning model (LRM) with a modular multi-modal toolkit for long video understanding (LVU), outperforming MLLM baselines by significant margins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in LVU due to complexity and context window constraints, questioning the need for foundation MLLMs with extended capabilities.

Method: Uses a text-only LRM combined with multi-modal tools (retrievers, visual perceivers) to selectively access and utilize video content.

Result: Achieves improvements of 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on MLVU, LVBench, and LongVideoBench, respectively.

Conclusion: Agentic systems like VideoDeepResearch show promise in addressing LVU challenges without relying on complex MLLMs.

Abstract: Long video understanding (LVU) presents a significant challenge for current
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) due to the task's inherent complexity
and context window constraint. It is widely assumed that addressing LVU tasks
requires foundation MLLMs with extended context windows, strong visual
perception capabilities, and proficient domain expertise. In this work, we
challenge this common belief by introducing VideoDeepResearch, a novel agentic
framework for long video understanding. Our approach relies solely on a
text-only large reasoning model (LRM) combined with a modular multi-modal
toolkit, including multimodal retrievers and visual perceivers, all of which
are readily available in practice. For each LVU task, the system formulates a
problem-solving strategy through reasoning, while selectively accessing and
utilizing essential video content via tool using. We conduct extensive
experiments on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, Video-MME, and LVBench.
Our results demonstrate that VideoDeepResearch achieves substantial
improvements over existing MLLM baselines, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art by 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on MLVU (test), LVBench, and
LongVideoBench, respectively. These findings highlight the promise of agentic
systems in overcoming key challenges in LVU problems.

*Tianrui Zhu,Houyuan Chen,Ruihao Gong,Michele Magno,Haotong Qin,Kai Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) framework for video matting, addressing accuracy and temporal coherence challenges with a two-stage strategy, global calibration, and optical flow assistance, achieving near full-precision performance even at 4-bit quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video matting is computationally intensive, and deploying it on resource-constrained devices is challenging. Existing PTQ methods for video matting struggle with accuracy and temporal coherence.

Method: Proposes a two-stage PTQ strategy: block-reconstruction-based optimization for initial quantization and global calibration. Introduces Statistically-Driven Global Affine Calibration (GAC) and Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) to enhance accuracy and temporal coherence.

Result: PTQ4VM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across bit-widths, with 4-bit quantization performing close to full-precision while saving 8x FLOPs. GAC reduces errors by up to 20%.

Conclusion: The proposed PTQ4VM framework effectively addresses PTQ challenges in video matting, achieving high accuracy and efficiency, making it suitable for resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Video matting is crucial for applications such as film production and virtual
reality, yet deploying its computationally intensive models on
resource-constrained devices presents challenges. Quantization is a key
technique for model compression and acceleration. As an efficient approach,
Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is still in its nascent stages for video
matting, facing significant hurdles in maintaining accuracy and temporal
coherence. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel and general
PTQ framework specifically designed for video matting models, marking, to the
best of our knowledge, the first systematic attempt in this domain. Our
contributions include: (1) A two-stage PTQ strategy that combines
block-reconstruction-based optimization for fast, stable initial quantization
and local dependency capture, followed by a global calibration of quantization
parameters to minimize accuracy loss. (2) A Statistically-Driven Global Affine
Calibration (GAC) method that enables the network to compensate for cumulative
statistical distortions arising from factors such as neglected BN layer
effects, even reducing the error of existing PTQ methods on video matting tasks
up to 20%. (3) An Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) component that leverages
temporal and semantic priors from frames to guide the PTQ process, enhancing
the model's ability to distinguish moving foregrounds in complex scenes and
ultimately achieving near full-precision performance even under ultra-low-bit
quantization. Comprehensive quantitative and visual results show that our
PTQ4VM achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy performance across different
bit-widths compared to the existing quantization methods. We highlight that the
4-bit PTQ4VM even achieves performance close to the full-precision counterpart
while enjoying 8x FLOP savings.

Motivation: Existing evaluations lack focus on temporal reasoning and procedural validity, which VRBench addresses.

Method: VRBench includes 1,010 long videos with labeled QA pairs and reasoning steps, curated via expert review. A human-AI framework generates coherent reasoning chains, evaluated through MCQs and LLM-guided scoring.

Result: Extensive evaluations of 12 LLMs and 16 VLMs provide insights into multi-step reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: VRBench advances the field by offering a comprehensive tool for assessing multi-step reasoning in large models.

Abstract: We present VRBench, the first long narrative video benchmark crafted for
evaluating large models' multi-step reasoning capabilities, addressing
limitations in existing evaluations that overlook temporal reasoning and
procedural validity. It comprises 1,010 long videos (with an average duration
of 1.6 hours), along with 9,468 human-labeled multi-step question-answering
pairs and 30,292 reasoning steps with timestamps. These videos are curated via
a multi-stage filtering process including expert inter-rater reviewing to
prioritize plot coherence. We develop a human-AI collaborative framework that
generates coherent reasoning chains, each requiring multiple temporally
grounded steps, spanning seven types (e.g., event attribution, implicit
inference). VRBench designs a multi-phase evaluation pipeline that assesses
models at both the outcome and process levels. Apart from the MCQs for the
final results, we propose a progress-level LLM-guided scoring metric to
evaluate the quality of the reasoning chain from multiple dimensions
comprehensively. Through extensive evaluations of 12 LLMs and 16 VLMs on
VRBench, we undertake a thorough analysis and provide valuable insights that
advance the field of multi-step reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CreatiPoster is a framework for generating editable, multi-layer graphic designs from natural-language instructions or assets, outperforming existing tools in quality and editability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI tools for graphic design lack accuracy in incorporating user assets, maintaining editability, and achieving professional appeal, prompting the need for a better solution.

Method: CreatiPoster uses a protocol model (RGBA large multimodal model) to generate a JSON specification for layers and a conditional background model to synthesize coherent backgrounds.

Result: CreatiPoster surpasses leading open-source and commercial systems, demonstrated by a benchmark with automated metrics.

Conclusion: The framework advances AI-assisted graphic design, supporting diverse applications and democratizing access to professional-quality designs.

Abstract: Graphic design plays a crucial role in both commercial and personal contexts,
yet creating high-quality, editable, and aesthetically pleasing graphic
compositions remains a time-consuming and skill-intensive task, especially for
beginners. Current AI tools automate parts of the workflow, but struggle to
accurately incorporate user-supplied assets, maintain editability, and achieve
professional visual appeal. Commercial systems, like Canva Magic Design, rely
on vast template libraries, which are impractical for replicate. In this paper,
we introduce CreatiPoster, a framework that generates editable, multi-layer
compositions from optional natural-language instructions or assets. A protocol
model, an RGBA large multimodal model, first produces a JSON specification
detailing every layer (text or asset) with precise layout, hierarchy, content
and style, plus a concise background prompt. A conditional background model
then synthesizes a coherent background conditioned on this rendered foreground
layers. We construct a benchmark with automated metrics for graphic-design
generation and show that CreatiPoster surpasses leading open-source approaches
and proprietary commercial systems. To catalyze further research, we release a
copyright-free corpus of 100,000 multi-layer designs. CreatiPoster supports
diverse applications such as canvas editing, text overlay, responsive resizing,
multilingual adaptation, and animated posters, advancing the democratization of
AI-assisted graphic design. Project homepage:

*Guimeng Liu,Milad Abdollahzadeh,Ngai-Man Cheung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptation with Iterative Refinement (AIR), a zero-shot generative model adaptation method that improves image quality by addressing misalignment between text and image offsets in CLIP embedding space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot generative model adaptation (ZSGM) methods assume perfect alignment between image and text offsets in CLIP space, leading to degraded image quality. This work aims to analyze and mitigate this misalignment.

Method: The authors first empirically study offset misalignment in CLIP space, finding it correlates with concept distance. They then propose AIR, an iterative refinement approach to improve target domain image quality.

Result: AIR achieves state-of-the-art performance in 26 experimental setups, validated by qualitative, quantitative, and user study results.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that addressing offset misalignment in CLIP space significantly improves zero-shot generative model adaptation, with AIR outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Zero-shot generative model adaptation (ZSGM) aims to adapt a pre-trained
generator to a target domain using only text guidance and without any samples
from the target domain. Central to recent ZSGM approaches are directional loss
which use the text guidance in the form of aligning the image offset with text
offset in the embedding space of a vision-language model like CLIP. This is
similar to the analogical reasoning in NLP where the offset between one pair of
words is used to identify a missing element in another pair by aligning the
offset between these two pairs. However, a major limitation of existing ZSGM
methods is that the learning objective assumes the complete alignment between
image offset and text offset in the CLIP embedding space, resulting in quality
degrade in generated images. Our work makes two main contributions. Inspired by
the offset misalignment studies in NLP, as our first contribution, we perform
an empirical study to analyze the misalignment between text offset and image
offset in CLIP embedding space for various large publicly available datasets.
Our important finding is that offset misalignment in CLIP embedding space is
correlated with concept distance, i.e., close concepts have a less offset
misalignment. To address the limitations of the current approaches, as our
second contribution, we propose Adaptation with Iterative Refinement (AIR)
which is the first ZSGM approach to focus on improving target domain image
quality based on our new insight on offset misalignment.Qualitative,
quantitative, and user study in 26 experiment setups consistently demonstrate
the proposed AIR approach achieves SOTA performance. Additional experiments are
in Supp.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M4V introduces a Multi-Modal Mamba framework for efficient text-to-video generation, reducing FLOPs by 45% and enhancing visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the computational inefficiency of Transformers in spatiotemporal modeling for video generation.

Method: Proposes a multi-modal diffusion Mamba (MM-DiM) block for integrating multi-modal information and spatiotemporal modeling.

Result: Reduces FLOPs by 45% and improves visual quality in generated videos.

Conclusion: M4V offers a computationally efficient and high-quality solution for text-to-video generation.

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has significantly enriched content creation and
holds the potential to evolve into powerful world simulators. However, modeling
the vast spatiotemporal space remains computationally demanding, particularly
when employing Transformers, which incur quadratic complexity in sequence
processing and thus limit practical applications. Recent advancements in
linear-time sequence modeling, particularly the Mamba architecture, offer a
more efficient alternative. Nevertheless, its plain design limits its direct
applicability to multi-modal and spatiotemporal video generation tasks. To
address these challenges, we introduce M4V, a Multi-Modal Mamba framework for
text-to-video generation. Specifically, we propose a multi-modal diffusion
Mamba (MM-DiM) block that enables seamless integration of multi-modal
information and spatiotemporal modeling through a multi-modal token
re-composition design. As a result, the Mamba blocks in M4V reduce FLOPs by 45%
compared to the attention-based alternative when generating videos at
768$\times$1280 resolution. Additionally, to mitigate the visual quality
degradation in long-context autoregressive generation processes, we introduce a
reward learning strategy that further enhances per-frame visual realism.
Extensive experiments on text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate M4V's ability to
produce high-quality videos while significantly lowering computational costs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scalable method for in-context image editing using videos, employing a block-causal diffusion transformer trained on proxy tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on task-specific pipelines and expert models, limiting scalability. The authors explore learning directly from videos to overcome this.

Method: A block-causal diffusion transformer is trained on three proxy tasks: next-image prediction, current segmentation prediction, and next-segmentation prediction, using annotated video sequences.

Result: The model demonstrates strong in-context image editing capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks and showing promise in multi-concept composition and story generation.

Conclusion: The approach successfully learns in-context image editing from videos, offering scalability and versatility beyond traditional methods.

Abstract: In-context image editing aims to modify images based on a contextual sequence
comprising text and previously generated images. Existing methods typically
depend on task-specific pipelines and expert models (e.g., segmentation and
inpainting) to curate training data. In this work, we explore whether an
in-context image editing model can be learned directly from videos. We
introduce a scalable approach to annotate videos as interleaved multimodal
sequences. To effectively learn from this data, we design a block-causal
diffusion transformer trained on three proxy tasks: next-image prediction,
current segmentation prediction, and next-segmentation prediction.
Additionally, we propose a novel multi-turn image editing benchmark to advance
research in this area. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
exhibits strong in-context image editing capabilities and achieves
state-of-the-art results on two multi-turn image editing benchmarks. Despite
being trained exclusively on videos, our model also shows promising abilities
in multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing
applications.

*Yuanhui Huang,Weiliang Chen,Wenzhao Zheng,Yueqi Duan,Jie Zhou,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpectralAR introduces a causal autoregressive visual generation framework using spectral tokens for efficient and detailed image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the contradiction between parallel image patches and the causal nature of autoregressive modeling.

Method: Transform images into ordered spectral tokens (low to high frequency) and perform autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine manner.

Result: Achieves 3.02 gFID with 64 tokens and 310M parameters on ImageNet-1K.

Conclusion: SpectralAR ensures causality and token efficiency for autoregressive visual generation.

Abstract: Autoregressive visual generation has garnered increasing attention due to its
scalability and compatibility with other modalities compared with diffusion
models. Most existing methods construct visual sequences as spatial patches for
autoregressive generation. However, image patches are inherently parallel,
contradicting the causal nature of autoregressive modeling. To address this, we
propose a Spectral AutoRegressive (SpectralAR) visual generation framework,
which realizes causality for visual sequences from the spectral perspective.
Specifically, we first transform an image into ordered spectral tokens with
Nested Spectral Tokenization, representing lower to higher frequency
components. We then perform autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine
manner with the sequences of spectral tokens. By considering different levels
of detail in images, our SpectralAR achieves both sequence causality and token
efficiency without bells and whistles. We conduct extensive experiments on
ImageNet-1K for image reconstruction and autoregressive generation, and
SpectralAR achieves 3.02 gFID with only 64 tokens and 310M parameters. Project

*Yuxuan Luo,Yuhui Yuan,Junwen Chen,Haonan Cai,Ziyi Yue,Yuwei Yang,Fatima Zohra Daha,Ji Li,Zhouhui Lian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces knowledge image generation as a new task and the MMMG benchmark to evaluate reasoning in image generation models. It highlights challenges in generating knowledge images and proposes a unified KG representation for evaluation. Results show current models struggle, with GPT-4o scoring 50.20. The authors release FLUX-Reason as a baseline (MMMG-Score 34.45).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge images are vital for human learning, but generating them requires complex reasoning. Current models lack this capability, necessitating a benchmark to evaluate and improve them.

Method: The MMMG benchmark includes 4,456 expert-validated image-prompt pairs across disciplines and formats. A unified KG representation is used for evaluation, with MMMG-Score combining factual fidelity and visual clarity.

Result: Evaluations reveal reasoning deficits in 16 state-of-the-art models, with GPT-4o scoring 50.20. FLUX-Reason, a baseline model, scores 34.45.

Conclusion: The MMMG benchmark exposes gaps in reasoning for image generation. FLUX-Reason provides a starting point for future improvements.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce knowledge image generation as a new task,
alongside the Massive Multi-Discipline Multi-Tier Knowledge-Image Generation
Benchmark (MMMG) to probe the reasoning capability of image generation models.
Knowledge images have been central to human civilization and to the mechanisms
of human learning--a fact underscored by dual-coding theory and the
picture-superiority effect. Generating such images is challenging, demanding
multimodal reasoning that fuses world knowledge with pixel-level grounding into
clear explanatory visuals. To enable comprehensive evaluation, MMMG offers
4,456 expert-validated (knowledge) image-prompt pairs spanning 10 disciplines,
6 educational levels, and diverse knowledge formats such as charts, diagrams,
and mind maps. To eliminate confounding complexity during evaluation, we adopt
a unified Knowledge Graph (KG) representation. Each KG explicitly delineates a
target image's core entities and their dependencies. We further introduce
MMMG-Score to evaluate generated knowledge images. This metric combines factual
fidelity, measured by graph-edit distance between KGs, with visual clarity
assessment. Comprehensive evaluations of 16 state-of-the-art text-to-image
generation models expose serious reasoning deficits--low entity fidelity, weak
relations, and clutter--with GPT-4o achieving an MMMG-Score of only 50.20,
underscoring the benchmark's difficulty. To spur further progress, we release
FLUX-Reason (MMMG-Score of 34.45), an effective and open baseline that combines
a reasoning LLM with diffusion models and is trained on 16,000 curated
knowledge image-prompt pairs.

*Qizhe Zhang,Mengzhen Liu,Lichen Li,Ming Lu,Yuan Zhang,Junwen Pan,Qi She,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CDPruner is a novel visual token pruning method for MLLMs that maximizes conditional diversity using DPP, reducing computational costs while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency of current visual token pruning methods, which either retain redundant tokens or ignore instruction relevance, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Proposes CDPruner, a training-free, model-agnostic method using DPP to maximize conditional diversity of retained tokens, ensuring better representation and adherence to instructions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on vision-language benchmarks, reducing FLOPs by 95% and CUDA latency by 78% while retaining 94% accuracy on LLaVA.

Conclusion: CDPruner effectively balances efficiency and performance in MLLMs by optimizing token selection through conditional diversity.

Abstract: In multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the length of input visual
tokens is often significantly greater than that of their textual counterparts,
leading to a high inference cost. Many works aim to address this issue by
removing redundant visual tokens. However, current approaches either rely on
attention-based pruning, which retains numerous duplicate tokens, or use
similarity-based pruning, overlooking the instruction relevance, consequently
causing suboptimal performance. In this paper, we go beyond attention or
similarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner,
which maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define
the conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the
instruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal
point process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected
subset. The proposed CDPruner is training-free and model-agnostic, allowing
easy application to various MLLMs. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs
show that CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language
benchmarks. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, the selected
subset better represents the input images while closely adhering to user
instructions, thereby preserving strong performance even with high reduction
ratios. When applied to LLaVA, CDPruner reduces FLOPs by 95\% and CUDA latency
by 78\%, while maintaining 94\% of the original accuracy. Our code is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenWorld is a high-quality, real-world simulation dataset for AI-generated video detection, addressing the lack of trustworthy datasets. The proposed SpannDetector model leverages multi-view consistency for superior detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of AI-generated videos threatens information credibility, but existing detectors lack reliable real-world datasets.

Method: GenWorld is created with real-world simulations, high-quality forged videos, and cross-prompt diversity. SpannDetector uses multi-view consistency for detection.

Result: SpannDetector outperforms existing methods, especially for high-quality videos, and highlights the importance of real-world clues.

Conclusion: GenWorld and SpannDetector advance AI-generated video detection, emphasizing physical plausibility and explainability.

Abstract: The flourishing of video generation technologies has endangered the
credibility of real-world information and intensified the demand for
AI-generated video detectors. Despite some progress, the lack of high-quality
real-world datasets hinders the development of trustworthy detectors. In this
paper, we propose GenWorld, a large-scale, high-quality, and real-world
simulation dataset for AI-generated video detection. GenWorld features the
following characteristics: (1) Real-world Simulation: GenWorld focuses on
videos that replicate real-world scenarios, which have a significant impact due
to their realism and potential influence; (2) High Quality: GenWorld employs
multiple state-of-the-art video generation models to provide realistic and
high-quality forged videos; (3) Cross-prompt Diversity: GenWorld includes
videos generated from diverse generators and various prompt modalities (e.g.,
text, image, video), offering the potential to learn more generalizable
forensic features. We analyze existing methods and find they fail to detect
high-quality videos generated by world models (i.e., Cosmos), revealing
potential drawbacks of ignoring real-world clues. To address this, we propose a
simple yet effective model, SpannDetector, to leverage multi-view consistency
as a strong criterion for real-world AI-generated video detection. Experiments
show that our method achieves superior results, highlighting a promising
direction for explainable AI-generated video detection based on physical
plausibility. We believe that GenWorld will advance the field of AI-generated
video detection. Project Page: https://chen-wl20.github.io/GenWorld

*Sicheng Zuo,Wenzhao Zheng,Xiaoyong Han,Longchao Yang,Yong Pan,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuadricFormer uses superquadrics for efficient 3D occupancy prediction, outperforming voxel and Gaussian-based methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods (voxel-based or Gaussian-based) are inefficient or limited in modeling diverse geometries in driving scenes.

Method: Proposes a probabilistic superquadric mixture model and QuadricFormer, with a pruning-and-splitting module for efficiency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes dataset with superior efficiency.

Conclusion: Superquadrics enable efficient and accurate 3D occupancy prediction for autonomous driving.

Abstract: 3D occupancy prediction is crucial for robust autonomous driving systems as
it enables comprehensive perception of environmental structures and semantics.
Most existing methods employ dense voxel-based scene representations, ignoring
the sparsity of driving scenes and resulting in inefficiency. Recent works
explore object-centric representations based on sparse Gaussians, but their
ellipsoidal shape prior limits the modeling of diverse structures. In
real-world driving scenes, objects exhibit rich geometries (e.g., cuboids,
cylinders, and irregular shapes), necessitating excessive ellipsoidal Gaussians
densely packed for accurate modeling, which leads to inefficient
representations. To address this, we propose to use geometrically expressive
superquadrics as scene primitives, enabling efficient representation of complex
structures with fewer primitives through their inherent shape diversity. We
develop a probabilistic superquadric mixture model, which interprets each
superquadric as an occupancy probability distribution with a corresponding
geometry prior, and calculates semantics through probabilistic mixture.
Building on this, we present QuadricFormer, a superquadric-based model for
efficient 3D occupancy prediction, and introduce a pruning-and-splitting module
to further enhance modeling efficiency by concentrating superquadrics in
occupied regions. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate
that QuadricFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining
superior efficiency.

*Donghoon Ahn,Jiwon Kang,Sanghyun Lee,Minjae Kim,Jaewon Min,Wooseok Jang,Saungwu Lee,Sayak Paul,Susung Hong,Seungryong Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'HeadHunter' and 'SoftPAG' for fine-grained control in diffusion models by perturbing specific attention heads, improving generation quality and visual attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attention perturbation methods lack principled approaches for determining perturbation locations, especially in Diffusion Transformer architectures.

Method: Investigates granularity of attention perturbations, proposes 'HeadHunter' for selecting relevant heads and 'SoftPAG' for tuning perturbation strength.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance in quality enhancement and style-specific guidance on models like Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1.

Conclusion: Provides the first head-level analysis of attention perturbation, enabling interpretable and practical perturbation strategies.

Abstract: Recent guidance methods in diffusion models steer reverse sampling by
perturbing the model to construct an implicit weak model and guide generation
away from it. Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated
strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free
guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods
lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be
applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where
quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we
investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer
level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads
govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality.
Building on this insight, we propose "HeadHunter", a systematic framework for
iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives,
enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In
addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected
head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to
tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only
mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but
also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through
compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale
DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1,
demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and
style-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of
attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable
specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of
effective perturbation strategies.

*Junqi You,Chieh Hubert Lin,Weijie Lyu,Zhengbo Zhang,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstaInpaint is a fast, feed-forward framework for 3D scene inpainting, achieving 1000x speed-up over prior methods while maintaining high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D scene inpainting methods are slow and computationally intensive, limiting real-time or online applications.

Method: Proposes InstaInpaint, a reference-based feed-forward framework with self-supervised masked-finetuning for training a custom large reconstruction model (LRM).

Result: Achieves 1000x speed-up (0.4 seconds per inpainting) and state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks, with strong generalization for applications like object insertion.

Conclusion: InstaInpaint offers a practical solution for real-time 3D scene inpainting, balancing speed and quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D scene reconstruction enable real-time viewing in
virtual and augmented reality. To support interactive operations for better
immersiveness, such as moving or editing objects, 3D scene inpainting methods
are proposed to repair or complete the altered geometry. However, current
approaches rely on lengthy and computationally intensive optimization, making
them impractical for real-time or online applications. We propose InstaInpaint,
a reference-based feed-forward framework that produces 3D-scene inpainting from
a 2D inpainting proposal within 0.4 seconds. We develop a self-supervised
masked-finetuning strategy to enable training of our custom large
reconstruction model (LRM) on the large-scale dataset. Through extensive
experiments, we analyze and identify several key designs that improve
generalization, textural consistency, and geometric correctness. InstaInpaint
achieves a 1000x speed-up from prior methods while maintaining a
state-of-the-art performance across two standard benchmarks. Moreover, we show
that InstaInpaint generalizes well to flexible downstream applications such as
object insertion and multi-region inpainting. More video results are available

*Weiliang Chen,Jiayi Bi,Yuanhui Huang,Wenzhao Zheng,Yueqi Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneCompleter introduces a 3D-consistent generative novel view synthesis framework using dense 3D scene completion, improving coherence and plausibility over traditional 2D-to-3D methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for novel view synthesis (NVS) rely on 2D completion followed by 3D recovery, leading to smooth surfaces and distorted geometry due to limited 3D inference from RGB data.

Method: SceneCompleter uses a geometry-appearance dual-stream diffusion model for RGBD space synthesis and a scene embedder for holistic scene understanding from reference images.

Result: The method achieves superior visual coherence and 3D consistency in generative novel view synthesis across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: SceneCompleter effectively fuses structural and textural information, outperforming traditional approaches in NVS.

Abstract: Generative models have gained significant attention in novel view synthesis
(NVS) by alleviating the reliance on dense multi-view captures. However,
existing methods typically fall into a conventional paradigm, where generative
models first complete missing areas in 2D, followed by 3D recovery techniques
to reconstruct the scene, which often results in overly smooth surfaces and
distorted geometry, as generative models struggle to infer 3D structure solely
from RGB data. In this paper, we propose SceneCompleter, a novel framework that
achieves 3D-consistent generative novel view synthesis through dense 3D scene
completion. SceneCompleter achieves both visual coherence and 3D-consistent
generative scene completion through two key components: (1) a
geometry-appearance dual-stream diffusion model that jointly synthesizes novel
views in RGBD space; (2) a scene embedder that encodes a more holistic scene
understanding from the reference image. By effectively fusing structural and
textural information, our method demonstrates superior coherence and
plausibility in generative novel view synthesis across diverse datasets.

### [97] [A Conjecture on a Fundamental Trade-Off between Certainty and Scope in Symbolic and Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10130)
*Luciano Floridi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a conjecture about a trade-off in AI systems between provable correctness and broad data-mapping capacity, impacting engineering and philosophical expectations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize the implicit trade-off between error-free guarantees and high-dimensional data processing in AI, addressing historical tensions and reshaping AI standards.

Method: The conjecture is stated in information-theoretic terms and analyzed within epistemology, formal verification, and philosophy of technology, using concepts like underdetermination and epistemic risk.

Result: The conjecture reframes AI evaluation, governance, and hybrid system design, emphasizing the need for rigorous verification.

Conclusion: Proving or refuting the conjecture is crucial for the future of trustworthy AI, influencing standards and frameworks.

Abstract: This article introduces a conjecture that formalises a fundamental trade-off
between provable correctness and broad data-mapping capacity in Artificial
Intelligence (AI) systems. When an AI system is engineered for deductively
watertight guarantees (demonstrable certainty about the error-free nature of
its outputs) -- as in classical symbolic AI -- its operational domain must be
narrowly circumscribed and pre-structured. Conversely, a system that can input
high-dimensional data to produce rich information outputs -- as in contemporary
generative models -- necessarily relinquishes the possibility of zero-error
performance, incurring an irreducible risk of errors or misclassification. By
making this previously implicit trade-off explicit and open to rigorous
verification, the conjecture significantly reframes both engineering ambitions
and philosophical expectations for AI. After reviewing the historical
motivations for this tension, the article states the conjecture in
information-theoretic form and contextualises it within broader debates in
epistemology, formal verification, and the philosophy of technology. It then
offers an analysis of its implications and consequences, drawing on notions of
underdetermination, prudent epistemic risk, and moral responsibility. The
discussion clarifies how, if correct, the conjecture would help reshape
evaluation standards, governance frameworks, and hybrid system design. The
conclusion underscores the importance of eventually proving or refuting the
inequality for the future of trustworthy AI.

TL;DR: Medical foundation models face challenges in adapting to new contexts, leading to errors. The paper proposes context-switching AI to dynamically adjust without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical AI models struggle with contextual errors and lack adaptability to new specialties or populations.

Method: Proposes context-switching AI that dynamically adapts reasoning without retraining.

Result: Envisions AI capable of diagnosing and treating diverse diseases across specialties and regions.

Conclusion: Context-switching AI could improve adaptability and expand access to medical care.

Abstract: Medical foundation models, including language models trained on clinical
notes, vision-language models on medical images, and multimodal models on
electronic health records, can summarize clinical notes, answer medical
questions, and assist in decision-making. Adapting these models to new
populations, specialties, or settings typically requires fine-tuning, careful
prompting, or retrieval from knowledge bases. This can be impractical, and
limits their ability to interpret unfamiliar inputs and adjust to clinical
situations not represented during training. As a result, models are prone to
contextual errors, where predictions appear reasonable but fail to account for
critical patient-specific or contextual information. These errors stem from a
fundamental limitation that current models struggle with: dynamically adjusting
their behavior across evolving contexts of medical care. In this Perspective,
we outline a vision for context-switching in medical AI: models that
dynamically adapt their reasoning without retraining to new specialties,
populations, workflows, and clinical roles. We envision context-switching AI to
diagnose, manage, and treat a wide range of diseases across specialties and
regions, and expand access to medical care.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the distinction between causation and correlation in AD research for better diagnosis, treatment, and understanding of disease drivers.

Method: Combined correlation analysis, XGBoost machine learning, and SHAP interpretability techniques to analyze clinical, cognitive, genetic, and biomarker features.

Result: Identified key AD-influencing features (e.g., cognitive scores, genetic risk factors) and showed that strong correlations don't imply causation.

Conclusion: Careful interpretation of associative data is crucial; the study provides groundwork for future causal inference research to improve AD diagnosis and interventions.

Abstract: Understanding the distinction between causation and correlation is critical
in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, as it impacts diagnosis, treatment, and
the identification of true disease drivers. This experiment investigates the
relationships among clinical, cognitive, genetic, and biomarker features using
a combination of correlation analysis, machine learning classification, and
model interpretability techniques. Employing the XGBoost algorithm, we
identified key features influencing AD classification, including cognitive
scores and genetic risk factors. Correlation matrices revealed clusters of
interrelated variables, while SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values
provided detailed insights into feature contributions across disease stages.
Our results highlight that strong correlations do not necessarily imply
causation, emphasizing the need for careful interpretation of associative data.
By integrating feature importance and interpretability with classical
statistical analysis, this work lays groundwork for future causal inference
studies aimed at uncovering true pathological mechanisms. Ultimately,
distinguishing causal factors from correlated markers can lead to improved
early diagnosis and targeted interventions for Alzheimer's disease.

TL;DR: The paper advances trustworthy AI by improving safety, fairness, transparency, and accountability, introducing novel techniques like deterministic and probabilistic safety shields, fairness shields, and metrics for agency and intention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI systems increasingly impact critical societal domains, ensuring their responsible use through safety, fairness, transparency, and accountability is imperative.

Method: The work extends deterministic shielding for safety, introduces fairness shields for group fairness, and proposes metrics for agency and intention in probabilistic agents, unifying these in a reactive decision-making framework.

Result: The techniques are validated in simulations (e.g., autonomous vehicles) and provide practical tools for safer, fairer, and more accountable AI systems.

Conclusion: The contributions lay foundations for future research in trustworthy AI, addressing key challenges in safety, fairness, and accountability.

Abstract: Ensuring responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI) has become
imperative as autonomous systems increasingly influence critical societal
domains. However, the concept of trustworthy AI remains broad and
multi-faceted. This thesis advances knowledge in the safety, fairness,
transparency, and accountability of AI systems. In safety, we extend classical
deterministic shielding techniques to become resilient against delayed
observations, enabling practical deployment in real-world conditions. We also
implement both deterministic and probabilistic safety shields into simulated
autonomous vehicles to prevent collisions with road users, validating the use
of these techniques in realistic driving simulators. We introduce fairness
shields, a novel post-processing approach to enforce group fairness in
sequential decision-making settings over finite and periodic time horizons. By
optimizing intervention costs while strictly ensuring fairness constraints,
this method efficiently balances fairness with minimal interference. For
transparency and accountability, we propose a formal framework for assessing
intentional behaviour in probabilistic decision-making agents, introducing
quantitative metrics of agency and intention quotient. We use these metrics to
propose a retrospective analysis of intention, useful for determining
responsibility when autonomous systems cause unintended harm. Finally, we unify
these contributions through the ``reactive decision-making'' framework,
providing a general formalization that consolidates previous approaches.
Collectively, the advancements presented contribute practically to the
realization of safer, fairer, and more accountable AI systems, laying the
foundations for future research in trustworthy AI.

TL;DR: The paper introduces WGSR-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' strategic reasoning using wargame scenarios, focusing on multi-agent dynamics, intent inference, and counterfactual reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite LLMs' advances in reasoning tasks, strategic reasoning—critical for human cognition—lacks systematic evaluation. WGSR-Bench addresses this gap.

Method: WGSR-Bench uses wargame scenarios to test LLMs on three core tasks: environmental awareness, opponent risk modeling, and policy generation, forming the S-POE architecture.

Result: The benchmark aims to evaluate LLMs' strategic reasoning capabilities, identifying strengths and limitations in game-theoretic scenarios.

Conclusion: WGSR-Bench advances research in LLM-driven strategic intelligence by providing a systematic evaluation framework.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to a
qualitative leap in artificial intelligence' s performance on reasoning tasks,
particularly demonstrating remarkable capabilities in mathematical, symbolic,
and commonsense reasoning. However, as a critical component of advanced human
cognition, strategic reasoning, i.e., the ability to assess multi-agent
behaviors in dynamic environments, formulate action plans, and adapt
strategies, has yet to be systematically evaluated or modeled. To address this
gap, this paper introduces WGSR-Bench, the first strategy reasoning benchmark
for LLMs using wargame as its evaluation environment. Wargame, a quintessential
high-complexity strategic scenario, integrates environmental uncertainty,
adversarial dynamics, and non-unique strategic choices, making it an effective
testbed for assessing LLMs' capabilities in multi-agent decision-making, intent
inference, and counterfactual reasoning. WGSR-Bench designs test samples around
three core tasks, i.e., Environmental situation awareness, Opponent risk
modeling and Policy generation, which serve as the core S-POE architecture, to
systematically assess main abilities of strategic reasoning. Finally, an
LLM-based wargame agent is designed to integrate these parts for a
comprehensive strategy reasoning assessment. With WGSR-Bench, we hope to assess
the strengths and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs in game-theoretic
strategic reasoning and to advance research in large model-driven strategic
intelligence.

Motivation: To reframe AI as a cognitive engine, distinct from industrial mechanization, and explore its transformative impact on productivity and society.

Method: Theoretical framing, historical comparisons, multidisciplinary perspectives (computer science, economics, sociology), and conceptual frameworks.

Result: AI amplifies cognitive tasks, shifting productivity from manual to cognitive, and demands rethinking of skills, organizations, and policies.

Conclusion: AI complements human cognition, heralding a new productivity paradigm and requiring societal adaptation.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reframed as a cognitive engine driving a
novel productivity revolution distinct from the Industrial Revolution's
physical thrust. This paper develops a theoretical framing of AI as a cognitive
revolution akin to written language - a transformative augmentation of human
intellect rather than another mechanized tool. We compare AI's emergence to
historical leaps in information technology to show how it amplifies knowledge
work. Examples from various domains demonstrate AI's impact as a driver of
productivity in cognitive tasks. We adopt a multidisciplinary perspective
combining computer science advances with economic insights and sociological
perspectives on how AI reshapes work and society. Through conceptual
frameworks, we visualize the shift from manual to cognitive productivity. Our
central argument is that AI functions as an engine of cognition - comparable to
how human language revolutionized knowledge - heralding a new productivity
paradigm. We discuss how this revolution demands rethinking of skills,
organizations, and policies. This paper, balancing academic rigor with clarity,
concludes that AI's promise lies in complementing human cognitive abilities,
marking a new chapter in productivity evolution.

Motivation: To understand the computational complexity barriers in verifying AI safety as systems become more capable, and to formalize the challenges in aligning AI with societal safety requirements.

Method: The authors formalize the Capability-Risk Scaling (CRS) dynamic and prove four core theorems using complexity theory, demonstrating exponential growth in verification difficulty with system expressiveness.

Result: The results show that safety verification is coNP-complete for highly expressive AI systems, safe policies are extremely rare, and no finite alignment techniques can universally cover safety.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with a strategic trilemma for AI development: limit system complexity, accept unverifiable risks, or innovate beyond current safety paradigms. It provides the first systematic complexity-theoretic analysis of AI alignment.

Abstract: We establish fundamental computational complexity barriers to verifying AI
safety as system capabilities scale. Our main results show that for AI systems
with expressiveness EXP$(m)$ above a critical threshold $\tau$, safety
verification requires exponential time and is coNP-complete. We formalize the
Capability-Risk Scaling (CRS) dynamic, which demonstrates how increasing AI
capability drives societal safety requirements toward perfection, creating an
inescapable tension with verification complexity. Through four core theorems,
we prove that (1) verification complexity grows exponentially with system
expressiveness, (2) safe policies comprise at most a $2^{-2^m}$ fraction of the
policy space, (3) no finite set of alignment techniques can provide universal
coverage, and (4) robust safety properties form measure-zero sets for neural
networks. These results characterize an "intractability gap" where practical
safety requirements fall within the region of computational intractability. We
conclude by presenting a strategic trilemma: AI development must either
constrain system complexity to maintain verifiable safety, accept unverifiable
risks while scaling capabilities, or develop fundamentally new safety paradigms
beyond verification. Our work provides the first systematic
complexity-theoretic analysis of AI alignment and establishes rigorous bounds
that any safety approach must confront. A formal verification of the core
theorems in Lean4 is currently in progress.

### [104] [A Benchmark for Generalizing Across Diverse Team Strategies in Competitive Pokémon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10326)
*Cameron Angliss,Jiaxun Cui,Jiaheng Hu,Arrasy Rahman,Peter Stone*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VGC-Bench is introduced as a benchmark for AI agents to adapt to diverse team strategies in Pokémon VGC, highlighting challenges in generalization despite success in single-team settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for AI agents to robustly adapt to vastly different strategic landscapes in multi-agent learning, exemplified by the complex team configurations in Pokémon VGC.

Method: VGC-Bench provides infrastructure, standardized evaluation, human-play datasets, and baselines (e.g., LLM agents, behavior cloning, RL, game-theoretic methods).

Result: Methods succeed in single-team settings but struggle with generalization as team size increases, indicating a persistent challenge.

Conclusion: Policy generalization across diverse team strategies remains an open problem, with VGC-Bench serving as a resource for future research.

Abstract: Developing AI agents that can robustly adapt to dramatically different
strategic landscapes without retraining is a central challenge for multi-agent
learning. Pok\'emon Video Game Championships (VGC) is a domain with an
extraordinarily large space of possible team configurations of approximately
$10^{139}$ - far larger than those of Dota or Starcraft. The highly discrete,
combinatorial nature of team building in Pok\'emon VGC causes optimal
strategies to shift dramatically depending on both the team being piloted and
the opponent's team, making generalization uniquely challenging. To advance
research on this problem, we introduce VGC-Bench: a benchmark that provides
critical infrastructure, standardizes evaluation protocols, and supplies
human-play datasets and a range of baselines - from large-language-model agents
and behavior cloning to reinforcement learning and empirical game-theoretic
methods such as self-play, fictitious play, and double oracle. In the
restricted setting where an agent is trained and evaluated on a single-team
configuration, our methods are able to win against a professional VGC
competitor. We extensively evaluated all baseline methods over progressively
larger team sets and find that even the best-performing algorithm in the
single-team setting struggles at scaling up as team size grows. Thus, policy
generalization across diverse team strategies remains an open challenge for the
community. Our code is open sourced at

*Zaijing Li,Yuquan Xie,Rui Shao,Gongwei Chen,Weili Guan,Dongmei Jiang,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Optimus-3, a general-purpose agent for Minecraft, addressing challenges like insufficient data, task interference, and visual diversity using knowledge-enhanced data generation, MoE architecture, and multimodal reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in building generalist agents for open-world environments like Minecraft, particularly due to data scarcity, task interference, and visual diversity.

Method: 1) Knowledge-enhanced data generation pipeline. 2) Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with task-level routing. 3) Multimodal Reasoning-Augmented Reinforcement Learning.

Result: Optimus-3 outperforms generalist MLLMs and state-of-the-art agents in diverse Minecraft tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed innovations enable Optimus-3 to effectively address open-world challenges, setting a new benchmark for general-purpose agents in Minecraft.

Abstract: Recently, agents based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress across various domains. However, building a
generalist agent with capabilities such as perception, planning, action,
grounding, and reflection in open-world environments like Minecraft remains
challenges: insufficient domain-specific data, interference among heterogeneous
tasks, and visual diversity in open-world settings. In this paper, we address
these challenges through three key contributions. 1) We propose a
knowledge-enhanced data generation pipeline to provide scalable and
high-quality training data for agent development. 2) To mitigate interference
among heterogeneous tasks, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
with task-level routing. 3) We develop a Multimodal Reasoning-Augmented
Reinforcement Learning approach to enhance the agent's reasoning ability for
visual diversity in Minecraft. Built upon these innovations, we present
Optimus-3, a general-purpose agent for Minecraft. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that Optimus-3 surpasses both generalist multimodal large
language models and existing state-of-the-art agents across a wide range of
tasks in the Minecraft environment. Project page:

*Jim O'Connor,Yeonghun Lee,Gary B Parker*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NeuroPAL, a neuroevolutionary framework combining NEAT and PAL, improves training efficiency in StarCraft AI, achieving competitive play faster with emergent human-like strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of rule-based and supervised deep learning in StarCraft AI by enhancing adaptability and computational efficiency.

Method: Integrates NEAT with PAL, alternating low-fidelity training and high-fidelity evaluations for efficient evolutionary training.

Result: PAL accelerates learning, reducing training time by half, and agents develop expert human-like strategies.

Conclusion: Structured evaluation mechanisms like PAL enhance neuroevolution scalability and effectiveness in complex RTS environments.

Abstract: StarCraft: Brood War remains a challenging benchmark for artificial
intelligence research, particularly in the domain of macromanagement, where
long-term strategic planning is required. Traditional approaches to StarCraft
AI rely on rule-based systems or supervised deep learning, both of which face
limitations in adaptability and computational efficiency. In this work, we
introduce NeuroPAL, a neuroevolutionary framework that integrates
Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) with Punctuated Anytime Learning
(PAL) to improve the efficiency of evolutionary training. By alternating
between frequent, low-fidelity training and periodic, high-fidelity
evaluations, PAL enhances the sample efficiency of NEAT, enabling agents to
discover effective strategies in fewer training iterations. We evaluate
NeuroPAL in a fixed-map, single-race scenario in StarCraft: Brood War and
compare its performance to standard NEAT-based training. Our results show that
PAL significantly accelerates the learning process, allowing the agent to reach
competitive levels of play in approximately half the training time required by
NEAT alone. Additionally, the evolved agents exhibit emergent behaviors such as
proxy barracks placement and defensive building optimization, strategies
commonly used by expert human players. These findings suggest that structured
evaluation mechanisms like PAL can enhance the scalability and effectiveness of
neuroevolution in complex real-time strategy environments.

*Yuquan Xie,Zaijing Li,Rui Shao,Gongwei Chen,Kaiwen Zhou,Yinchuan Li,Dongmei Jiang,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mirage-1, a GUI agent with a Hierarchical Multimodal Skills (HMS) module and SA-MCTS algorithm, improving performance in long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of insufficient knowledge and domain gaps in MLLM-based GUI agents for long-horizon tasks.

Method: Proposes HMS for hierarchical knowledge abstraction and SA-MCTS for efficient action search in online environments.

Result: Mirage-1 outperforms previous agents by significant margins on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively enhance GUI agent performance in complex, real-world tasks.

Abstract: Recent efforts to leverage the Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) as GUI
agents have yielded promising outcomes. However, these agents still struggle
with long-horizon tasks in online environments, primarily due to insufficient
knowledge and the inherent gap between offline and online domains. In this
paper, inspired by how humans generalize knowledge in open-ended environments,
we propose a Hierarchical Multimodal Skills (HMS) module to tackle the issue of
insufficient knowledge. It progressively abstracts trajectories into execution
skills, core skills, and ultimately meta-skills, providing a hierarchical
knowledge structure for long-horizon task planning. To bridge the domain gap,
we propose the Skill-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (SA-MCTS) algorithm,
which efficiently leverages skills acquired in offline environments to reduce
the action search space during online tree exploration. Building on HMS, we
propose Mirage-1, a multimodal, cross-platform, plug-and-play GUI agent. To
validate the performance of Mirage-1 in real-world long-horizon scenarios, we
constructed a new benchmark, AndroidLH. Experimental results show that Mirage-1
outperforms previous agents by 32\%, 19\%, 15\%, and 79\% on AndroidWorld,
MobileMiniWob++, Mind2Web-Live, and AndroidLH, respectively. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of static RAG systems in complex, dynamic, and multi-modal real-world scenarios.

Method: Comprehensive review of Reasoning Agentic RAG, categorizing methods into predefined (fixed pipelines) and agentic (autonomous tool orchestration) reasoning.

Result: Analysis of architectural designs, reasoning strategies, and tool coordination under both paradigms.

Conclusion: Identifies key challenges and proposes future directions to improve flexibility, robustness, and applicability of Reasoning Agentic RAG systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful framework to
overcome the knowledge limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by
integrating external retrieval with language generation. While early RAG
systems based on static pipelines have shown effectiveness in well-structured
tasks, they struggle in real-world scenarios requiring complex reasoning,
dynamic retrieval, and multi-modal integration. To address these challenges,
the field has shifted toward Reasoning Agentic RAG, a paradigm that embeds
decision-making and adaptive tool use directly into the retrieval process. In
this paper, we present a comprehensive review of Reasoning Agentic RAG methods,
categorizing them into two primary systems: predefined reasoning, which follows
fixed modular pipelines to boost reasoning, and agentic reasoning, where the
model autonomously orchestrates tool interaction during inference. We analyze
representative techniques under both paradigms, covering architectural design,
reasoning strategies, and tool coordination. Finally, we discuss key research
challenges and propose future directions to advance the flexibility,
robustness, and applicability of reasoning agentic RAG systems. Our collection
of the relevant research has been organized into a

*Boris Sedlak,Alireza Furutanpey,Zihang Wang,Víctor Casamayor Pujol,Schahram Dustdar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an agent-based autoscaling framework for edge computing, comparing four scaling agents to maximize performance in resource-constrained environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge computing's strict resource constraints require flexible scaling behaviors beyond traditional methods.

Method: An agent-based framework dynamically adjusts hardware resources and service configurations, tested with YOLOv8 and OpenCV services.

Result: All agents achieved acceptable SLO performance, with varying convergence patterns and advantages.

Conclusion: Multi-dimensional agent-based autoscaling is viable for edge environments, encouraging further research.

Abstract: Edge computing breaks with traditional autoscaling due to strict resource
constraints, thus, motivating more flexible scaling behaviors using multiple
elasticity dimensions. This work introduces an agent-based autoscaling
framework that dynamically adjusts both hardware resources and internal service
configurations to maximize requirements fulfillment in constrained
environments. We compare four types of scaling agents: Active Inference, Deep Q
Network, Analysis of Structural Knowledge, and Deep Active Inference, using two
real-world processing services running in parallel: YOLOv8 for visual
recognition and OpenCV for QR code detection. Results show all agents achieve
acceptable SLO performance with varying convergence patterns. While the Deep Q
Network benefits from pre-training, the structural analysis converges quickly,
and the deep active inference agent combines theoretical foundations with
practical scalability advantages. Our findings provide evidence for the
viability of multi-dimensional agent-based autoscaling for edge environments
and encourage future work in this research direction.

Motivation: Existing benchmarks are saturated, necessitating more challenging ones to advance algorithmic reasoning in models.

Method: Constructed a high-quality dataset (OIBench) with 250 original problems, detailed its methodology, and introduced Time/Space Completion Curves for efficiency analysis.

Result: Open-source models lag behind closed-source ones, but SOTA models outperform most humans in correctness and efficiency, though still suboptimal to canonical solutions.

Conclusion: OIBench is released as an open-source benchmark to enhance future LLMs' code reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: As models become increasingly sophisticated, conventional algorithm
benchmarks are increasingly saturated, underscoring the need for more
challenging benchmarks to guide future improvements in algorithmic reasoning.
This paper introduces OIBench, a high-quality, private, and challenging
olympiad-level informatics dataset comprising 250 carefully curated original
problems. We detail the construction methodology of the benchmark, ensuring a
comprehensive assessment across various programming paradigms and complexities,
and we demonstrate its contamination-resistant properties via experiments. We
propose Time/Space Completion Curves for finer-grained efficiency analysis and
enable direct human-model comparisons through high-level participant
evaluations. Our experiments reveal that while open-source models lag behind
closed-source counterparts, current SOTA models already outperform most human
participants in both correctness and efficiency, while still being suboptimal
compared to the canonical solutions. By releasing OIBench as a fully
open-source resource (https://huggingface.co/datasets/AGI-Eval/OIBench), we

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Scientists' First Exam (SFE) benchmark to evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on scientific cognitive capacities, revealing current models' limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scientific benchmarks inadequately assess MLLMs' perception and reasoning abilities, focusing mostly on knowledge understanding.

Method: SFE evaluates MLLMs through three levels: scientific signal perception, attribute understanding, and comparative reasoning, using 830 expert-verified VQA pairs across 66 tasks in five disciplines.

Result: State-of-the-art models (GPT-o3 and InternVL-3) scored only 34.08% and 26.52% on SFE, indicating significant room for improvement.

Conclusion: SFE aims to advance AI-enhanced scientific discoveries by addressing gaps in MLLM evaluation.

Abstract: Scientific discoveries increasingly rely on complex multimodal reasoning
based on information-intensive scientific data and domain-specific expertise.
Empowered by expert-level scientific benchmarks, scientific Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) hold the potential to significantly enhance this
discovery process in realistic workflows. However, current scientific
benchmarks mostly focus on evaluating the knowledge understanding capabilities
of MLLMs, leading to an inadequate assessment of their perception and reasoning
abilities. To address this gap, we present the Scientists' First Exam (SFE)
benchmark, designed to evaluate the scientific cognitive capacities of MLLMs
through three interconnected levels: scientific signal perception, scientific
attribute understanding, scientific comparative reasoning. Specifically, SFE
comprises 830 expert-verified VQA pairs across three question types, spanning
66 multimodal tasks across five high-value disciplines. Extensive experiments
reveal that current state-of-the-art GPT-o3 and InternVL-3 achieve only 34.08%
and 26.52% on SFE, highlighting significant room for MLLMs to improve in
scientific realms. We hope the insights obtained in SFE will facilitate further
developments in AI-enhanced scientific discoveries.

*Yanan Cai,Ahmed Salem,Besmira Nushi,Mark Russinovich*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LogiPlan is a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' logical planning and reasoning over complex relational structures, featuring dynamic task complexity and three tasks: Plan Generation, Consistency Detection, and Comparison Question.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' capabilities in logical relational reasoning for applications like network infrastructure, knowledge bases, or business processes.

Method: The benchmark varies task complexity by controlling objects, relations, and relational chain depth, and includes three tasks to evaluate model performance.

Result: State-of-the-art models show performance gaps correlated with scale and architecture, struggling with complex logical planning.

Conclusion: LogiPlan highlights the limitations of current LLMs in deep logical reasoning and planning, despite promising results on simpler tasks.

Abstract: We introduce LogiPlan, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in logical planning and reasoning
over complex relational structures. Logical relational reasoning is important
for applications that may rely on LLMs to generate and query structured graphs
of relations such as network infrastructure, knowledge bases, or business
process schema. Our framework allows for dynamic variation of task complexity
by controlling the number of objects, relations, and the minimum depth of
relational chains, providing a fine-grained assessment of model performance
across difficulty levels. LogiPlan encompasses three complementary tasks: (1)
Plan Generation, where models must construct valid directed relational graphs
meeting specified structural constraints; (2) Consistency Detection, testing
models' ability to identify inconsistencies in relational structures; and (3)
Comparison Question, evaluating models' capacity to determine the validity of
queried relationships within a given graph. Additionally, we assess models'
self-correction capabilities by prompting them to verify and refine their
initial solutions. We evaluate state-of-the-art models including DeepSeek R1,
Gemini 2.0 Pro, Gemini 2 Flash Thinking, GPT-4.5, GPT-4o, Llama 3.1 405B,
O3-mini, O1, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet across these tasks, revealing significant
performance gaps that correlate with model scale and architecture. Our analysis
demonstrates that while recent reasoning-enhanced models show promising results
on simpler instances, they struggle with more complex configurations requiring
deeper logical planning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Primender sequence, a hybrid integer sequence combining primality and modular digit conditions, to benchmark LLMs' symbolic reasoning. It tests LLMs on rule inference, hypothesis validation, and sequence generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for interpretable, rule-based testbeds to assess LLMs' ability to infer hidden rules, validate hypotheses, and generalize symbolic logic.

Method: Defines the Primender sequence, designs a structured prompt, and evaluates LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot) on rule inference, hypothesis testing, and sequence generation.

Result: Comparative metrics assess LLM performance in symbolic reasoning, hypothesis validation, and pattern generalization.

Conclusion: The work contributes a novel mathematical construct and methodology for benchmarking LLMs, bridging number theory, AI, and software engineering.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Primender sequence, a novel integer sequence
defined by a hybrid rule that combines classical primality with modular
digit-based conditions. Specifically, a number n is included in the sequence if
it is prime or ends with a prime number of unit digit or any length. In other
words, numbers which are primes or have at least one prime suffix. The
resulting sequence exhibits a deterministic yet non-trivial structure, blending
number-theoretic properties with symbolic patterning. We propose the Primender
sequence as a benchmark for evaluating the symbolic reasoning capabilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs). The study is motivated by the need for
interpretable, rule-based testbeds that can assess an LLM's ability to infer
hidden rules, validate mathematical hypotheses, and generalize symbolic logic
at scale. A key hypothesis explored is: Whenever a number in the Primender
sequence is exactly one more than the largest prime less than or equal to it,
the difference between it and the previous number in the sequence is also 1. We
design a structured prompt and evaluation framework to test this hypothesis
across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Copilot, DeepSeek,
Gemini, Grok, and LLaMA. The models are tasked with identifying the underlying
rule, validating the hypothesis, and generating the next 100,000 terms of the
sequence. Comparative metrics such as rule inference accuracy, hypothesis
evaluation, sequence validity, and symbolic explanation quality are used to
assess model performance. This work contributes a novel mathematical construct
and a reproducible methodology for benchmarking LLMs in symbolic reasoning,
hypothesis testing, and scalable pattern generalization - bridging the domains
of number theory, artificial intelligence, and software engineering.

TL;DR: A new diagnostic approach for complex cyber-physical systems reduces reliance on extensive prior knowledge by using minimal subsystem relationships and nominal operation data. It combines neural network-based anomaly detection with a graph diagnosis algorithm, achieving 82% accuracy in identifying true causal components and reducing search space by 73%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diagnosing complex cyber-physical systems typically requires detailed models or extensive training data, which are challenging to obtain. The paper aims to address this by developing a method that works with minimal prior knowledge.

Method: The approach uses a neural network-based symptom generator for subsystem-level anomaly detection and a graph diagnosis algorithm that leverages minimal causal relationship information between subsystems.

Result: Experiments on simulated datasets show 82% accuracy in identifying true causal components and a 73% reduction in search space. Real-world tests on the Secure Water Treatment dataset demonstrate practical applicability.

Conclusion: The method is effective for large, complex systems with limited prior knowledge, showcasing potential for practical applications.

Abstract: Diagnostic processes for complex cyber-physical systems often require
extensive prior knowledge in the form of detailed system models or
comprehensive training data. However, obtaining such information poses a
significant challenge. To address this issue, we present a new diagnostic
approach that operates with minimal prior knowledge, requiring only a basic
understanding of subsystem relationships and data from nominal operations. Our
method combines a neural network-based symptom generator, which employs
subsystem-level anomaly detection, with a new graph diagnosis algorithm that
leverages minimal causal relationship information between
subsystems-information that is typically available in practice. Our experiments
with fully controllable simulated datasets show that our method includes the
true causal component in its diagnosis set for 82 p.c. of all cases while
effectively reducing the search space in 73 p.c. of the scenarios. Additional
tests on the real-world Secure Water Treatment dataset showcase the approach's
potential for practical scenarios. Our results thus highlight our approach's
potential for practical applications with large and complex cyber-physical
systems where limited prior knowledge is available.

TL;DR: TeleMath is a benchmark dataset for evaluating LLMs in solving domain-specific mathematical problems in telecommunications, showing specialized models outperform general-purpose ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The effectiveness of LLMs in specialized, mathematically intensive telecommunications tasks is unexplored, prompting the creation of TeleMath.

Method: TeleMath comprises 500 QnA pairs generated from expert-crafted problems, evaluated on various LLMs.

Result: Specialized models for mathematical/logical reasoning perform best, while general-purpose LLMs struggle.

Conclusion: TeleMath supports future research by providing a reproducible benchmark for domain-specific LLM evaluation.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence in telecommunications has
raised interest in the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address
domain-specific, mathematically intensive tasks. Although recent advancements
have improved the performance of LLMs in general mathematical reasoning, their
effectiveness within specialized domains, such as signal processing, network
optimization, and performance analysis, remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap, we introduce TeleMath, the first benchmark dataset specifically
designed to evaluate LLM performance in solving mathematical problems with
numerical solutions in the telecommunications domain. Comprising 500
question-answer (QnA) pairs, TeleMath covers a wide spectrum of topics in the
telecommunications field. This paper outlines the proposed QnAs generation
pipeline, starting from a selected seed of problems crafted by Subject Matter
Experts. The evaluation of a wide range of open-source LLMs reveals that best
performance on TeleMath is achieved by recent models explicitly designed for
mathematical or logical reasoning. In contrast, general-purpose models, even
those with a large number of parameters, often struggle with these challenges.
We have released the dataset and the evaluation code to ease result
reproducibility and support future research.

TL;DR: A pipeline formalizes and verifies informal AML modeling constraints using OWL ontologies, SHACL, and LLMs, enabling semi-automatic validation without formal expertise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AML modeling constraints are informal and lack automated validation, limiting their practical utility.

Method: AML models are mapped to OWL ontologies via RML and SPARQL; LLMs translate textual rules into SHACL constraints for validation.

Result: Complex AML rules can be semi-automatically checked, eliminating the need for formal method expertise.

Conclusion: The pipeline successfully bridges the gap between informal AML constraints and automated validation, enhancing usability.

Abstract: AutomationML (AML) enables standardized data exchange in engineering, yet
existing recommendations for proper AML modeling are typically formulated as
informal and textual constraints. These constraints cannot be validated
automatically within AML itself. This work-in-progress paper introduces a
pipeline to formalize and verify such constraints. First, AML models are mapped
to OWL ontologies via RML and SPARQL. In addition, a Large Language Model
translates textual rules into SHACL constraints, which are then validated
against the previously generated AML ontology. Finally, SHACL validation
results are automatically interpreted in natural language. The approach is
demonstrated on a sample AML recommendation. Results show that even complex
modeling rules can be semi-automatically checked -- without requiring users to
understand formal methods or ontology technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge answer set programming and satisfiability modulo theories for more expressive reasoning, especially with continuous changes.

Method: Developed the aspsmt2smt compiler, using gringo for partial grounding and z3 for solving.

Result: The system effectively handles real number computations for continuous change reasoning.

Conclusion: ASPMT and the aspsmt2smt compiler enable efficient integration of ASP and SMT, particularly for continuous domains.

Abstract: Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories (ASPMT) is an approach to combining
answer set programming and satisfiability modulo theories based on the
functional stable model semantics. It is shown that the tight fragment of ASPMT
programs can be turned into SMT instances, thereby allowing SMT solvers to
compute stable models of ASPMT programs. In this paper we present a compiler
called {\sc aspsmt2smt}, which implements this translation. The system uses ASP
grounder {\sc gringo} and SMT solver {\sc z3}. {\sc gringo} partially grounds
input programs while leaving some variables to be processed by {\sc z3}. We
demonstrate that the system can effectively handle real number computations for
reasoning about continuous changes.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art on CLEVRER and improves performance on CRAFT with GPT-3.5/GPT-4.

Conclusion: The method effectively enhances counterfactual reasoning in neuro-symbolic models.

Abstract: Causal and temporal reasoning about video dynamics is a challenging problem.
While neuro-symbolic models that combine symbolic reasoning with neural-based
perception and prediction have shown promise, they exhibit limitations,
especially in answering counterfactual questions. This paper introduces a
method to enhance a neuro-symbolic model for counterfactual reasoning,
leveraging symbolic reasoning about causal relations among events. We define
the notion of a causal graph to represent such relations and use Answer Set
Programming (ASP), a declarative logic programming method, to find how to
coordinate perception and simulation modules. We validate the effectiveness of
our approach on two benchmarks, CLEVRER and CRAFT. Our enhancement achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the CLEVRER challenge, significantly
outperforming existing models. In the case of the CRAFT benchmark, we leverage
a large pre-trained language model, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, as a proxy for a
dynamics simulator. Our findings show that this method can further improve its
performance on counterfactual questions by providing alternative prompts
instructed by symbolic causal reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OPT-BENCH is a benchmark for evaluating LLM agents on iterative optimization tasks, introducing OPT-Agent for solution refinement. Results show historical context improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LLMs' iterative optimization capabilities, which are understudied despite their broad task-solving abilities.

Method: Developed OPT-BENCH with 20 ML and 10 NP tasks, and OPT-Agent for iterative solution refinement using historical feedback.

Result: Historical context significantly boosts optimization performance across tasks.

Conclusion: OPT-BENCH and OPT-Agent advance LLM-driven iterative reasoning, with open-sourced resources for future research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in solving
diverse tasks. However, their proficiency in iteratively optimizing complex
solutions through learning from previous feedback remains insufficiently
explored. To bridge this gap, we present OPT-BENCH, a comprehensive benchmark
designed to evaluate LLM agents on large-scale search space optimization
problems. OPT-BENCH includes 20 real-world machine learning tasks sourced from
Kaggle and 10 classical NP problems, offering a diverse and challenging
environment for assessing LLM agents on iterative reasoning and solution
refinement. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce OPT-Agent, an
end-to-end optimization framework that emulates human reasoning when tackling
complex problems by generating, validating, and iteratively improving solutions
through leveraging historical feedback. Through extensive experiments on 9
state-of-the-art LLMs from 6 model families, we analyze the effects of
optimization iterations, temperature settings, and model architectures on
solution quality and convergence. Our results demonstrate that incorporating
historical context significantly enhances optimization performance across both
ML and NP tasks. All datasets, code, and evaluation tools are open-sourced to
promote further research in advancing LLM-driven optimization and iterative
reasoning. Project page:

### [120] [A Study on Individual Spatiotemporal Activity Generation Method Using MCP-Enhanced Chain-of-Thought Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10853)
*Yu Zhang,Yang Hu,De Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework combining chain-of-thought reasoning and Model Context Protocol to improve LLMs' spatiotemporal behavior simulation, validated in Shanghai with high similarity to real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for human spatiotemporal behavior simulation are computationally expensive and lack generalizability, while LLMs struggle with spatial cognition and group dynamics.

Method: The framework integrates CoT reasoning with MCP, using a five-stage cognitive framework and six MCP tool categories for data processing.

Result: Experiments showed high similarity to real data (scores 7.86-8.36) and efficiency gains (0.17 minutes per sample with 12 processes).

Conclusion: The framework advances LLMs in urban computing, offering practical synthetic data generation for smart city planning and transportation forecasting.

Abstract: Human spatiotemporal behavior simulation is critical for urban planning
research, yet traditional rule-based and statistical approaches suffer from
high computational costs, limited generalizability, and poor scalability. While
large language models (LLMs) show promise as "world simulators," they face
challenges in spatiotemporal reasoning including limited spatial cognition,
lack of physical constraint understanding, and group homogenization tendencies.
This paper introduces a framework integrating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
with Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enhance LLMs' capability in simulating
spatiotemporal behaviors that correspond with validation data patterns. The
methodology combines human-like progressive reasoning through a five-stage
cognitive framework with comprehensive data processing via six specialized MCP
tool categories: temporal management, spatial navigation, environmental
perception, personal memory, social collaboration, and experience evaluation.
Experiments in Shanghai's Lujiazui district validate the framework's
effectiveness across 1,000 generated samples. Results demonstrate high
similarity with real mobile signaling data, achieving generation quality scores
of 7.86 to 8.36 across different base models. Parallel processing experiments
show efficiency improvements, with generation times decreasing from 1.30 to
0.17 minutes per sample when scaling from 2 to 12 processes. This work
contributes to integrating CoT reasoning with MCP for urban behavior modeling,
advancing LLMs applications in urban computing and providing a practical
approach for synthetic mobility data generation. The framework offers a
foundation for smart city planning, transportation forecasting, and
participatory urban design applications.

TL;DR: GenPlanX integrates LLMs with classical AI planning to interpret natural language tasks, enhancing productivity in office workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical AI planning lacks natural language understanding, while LLMs excel in interpreting human intents, motivating their integration for better task planning.

Method: GenPlanX combines LLMs for natural language task interpretation with a classical AI planning engine and an execution framework.

Result: The system effectively assists with office-related tasks, improving workflow efficiency and human-AI collaboration.

Conclusion: GenPlanX demonstrates the potential of integrating LLMs with AI planning to streamline tasks and boost productivity.

Abstract: Classical AI Planning techniques generate sequences of actions for complex
tasks. However, they lack the ability to understand planning tasks when
provided using natural language. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has
introduced novel capabilities in human-computer interaction. In the context of
planning tasks, LLMs have shown to be particularly good in interpreting human
intents among other uses. This paper introduces GenPlanX that integrates LLMs
for natural language-based description of planning tasks, with a classical AI
planning engine, alongside an execution and monitoring framework. We
demonstrate the efficacy of GenPlanX in assisting users with office-related
tasks, highlighting its potential to streamline workflows and enhance
productivity through seamless human-AI collaboration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ToxiMol, a benchmark task for molecular toxicity repair using MLLMs, and ToxiEval, an automated evaluation framework, to address the lack of systematic benchmarks in this area.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Toxicity is a major cause of drug development failure, yet molecular toxicity repair lacks systematic definition and benchmarking.

Method: The study constructs a dataset of 560 toxic molecules, designs a prompt annotation pipeline, and proposes ToxiEval for automated evaluation.

Result: Current MLLMs show challenges but promising capabilities in toxicity understanding and molecule editing.

Conclusion: ToxiMol and ToxiEval provide foundational tools for advancing molecular toxicity repair research.

Abstract: Toxicity remains a leading cause of early-stage drug development failure.
Despite advances in molecular design and property prediction, the task of
molecular toxicity repair - generating structurally valid molecular
alternatives with reduced toxicity - has not yet been systematically defined or
benchmarked. To fill this gap, we introduce ToxiMol, the first benchmark task
for general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) focused on
molecular toxicity repair. We construct a standardized dataset covering 11
primary tasks and 560 representative toxic molecules spanning diverse
mechanisms and granularities. We design a prompt annotation pipeline with
mechanism-aware and task-adaptive capabilities, informed by expert
toxicological knowledge. In parallel, we propose an automated evaluation
framework, ToxiEval, which integrates toxicity endpoint prediction, synthetic
accessibility, drug-likeness, and structural similarity into a high-throughput
evaluation chain for repair success. We systematically assess nearly 30
mainstream general-purpose MLLMs and design multiple ablation studies to
analyze key factors such as evaluation criteria, candidate diversity, and
failure attribution. Experimental results show that although current MLLMs
still face significant challenges on this task, they begin to demonstrate
promising capabilities in toxicity understanding, semantic constraint
adherence, and structure-aware molecule editing.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLVR improves mathematical reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math-7B even with spurious rewards, but results vary across model families.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can enhance mathematical reasoning despite unreliable reward signals.

Method: Applied RLVR with spurious rewards (random, format, incorrect label, 1-shot RL, majority voting) to Qwen2.5-Math-7B and compared with other models like Llama3 and OLMo2.

Result: RLVR significantly improved MATH-500 performance for Qwen (up to 27.1%), but spurious rewards often failed for other models. Code reasoning in Qwen increased from 65% to over 90%.

Conclusion: RLVR may surface pretrained reasoning representations, but its effectiveness varies by model. Future research should validate RLVR on diverse models.

Abstract: We show that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can elicit
strong mathematical reasoning in certain models even with spurious rewards that
have little, no, or even negative correlation with the correct answer. For
example, RLVR improves MATH-500 performance for Qwen2.5-Math-7B in absolute
points by 21.4% (random reward), 13.8% (format reward), 24.1% (incorrect
label), 26.0% (1-shot RL), and 27.1% (majority voting) -- nearly matching the
29.1% gained with ground truth rewards. However, the spurious rewards that work
for Qwen often fail to yield gains with other model families like Llama3 or
OLMo2. In particular, we find code reasoning -- thinking in code without actual
code execution -- to be a distinctive Qwen2.5-Math behavior that becomes
significantly more frequent after RLVR, from 65% to over 90%, even with
spurious rewards. Overall, we hypothesize that, given the lack of useful reward
signal, RLVR must somehow be surfacing useful reasoning representations learned
during pretraining, although the exact mechanism remains a topic for future
work. We suggest that future RLVR research should possibly be validated on
diverse models rather than a single de facto choice, as we show that it is easy
to get significant performance gains on Qwen models even with completely
spurious reward signals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a systematic framework for evaluating generative AI outputs across text, visual, and audio modalities motivates this comprehensive review.

Method: The paper examines evaluation methods for text generation first, then extends the framework to image and audio generation, identifying five key paradigms.

Result: A unified taxonomy of evaluation methods is presented, demonstrating broad applicability across modalities.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the need for future research in cross-modal evaluation methodologies.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly enhanced generative AI
capabilities across text, images, and audio. However, automatically evaluating
the quality of these generated outputs presents ongoing challenges. Although
numerous automatic evaluation methods exist, current research lacks a
systematic framework that comprehensively organizes these methods across text,
visual, and audio modalities. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive
review and a unified taxonomy of automatic evaluation methods for generated
content across all three modalities; We identify five fundamental paradigms
that characterize existing evaluation approaches across these domains. Our
analysis begins by examining evaluation methods for text generation, where
techniques are most mature. We then extend this framework to image and audio
generation, demonstrating its broad applicability. Finally, we discuss
promising directions for future research in cross-modal evaluation
methodologies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TaskCraft automates the creation of scalable, multi-tool agentic tasks, improving AI model training and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agentic tasks lack tool interaction and rely on costly human annotation, limiting scalability.

Method: TaskCraft uses depth-based and width-based extensions to generate complex tasks, creating a synthetic dataset of 36,000 tasks.

Result: The tasks enhance prompt optimization and supervised fine-tuning of agentic models.

Conclusion: TaskCraft provides a scalable solution for advancing agentic AI research.

Abstract: Agentic tasks, which require multi-step problem solving with autonomy, tool
use, and adaptive reasoning, are becoming increasingly central to the
advancement of NLP and AI. However, existing instruction data lacks tool
interaction, and current agentic benchmarks rely on costly human annotation,
limiting their scalability. We introduce \textsc{TaskCraft}, an automated
workflow for generating difficulty-scalable, multi-tool, and verifiable agentic
tasks with execution trajectories. TaskCraft expands atomic tasks using
depth-based and width-based extensions to create structurally and
hierarchically complex challenges. Empirical results show that these tasks
improve prompt optimization in the generation workflow and enhance supervised
fine-tuning of agentic foundation models. We present a large-scale synthetic
dataset of approximately 36,000 tasks with varying difficulty to support future
research on agent tuning and evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores semantic degeneracy in language, showing that as expressions grow in complexity, recovering intended meaning becomes intractable. It argues meaning is observer-dependent and demonstrates non-classical contextuality in linguistic interpretation using LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the classical view of linguistic meaning as intrinsic and to highlight the limitations of LLMs and NLP systems due to semantic degeneracy.

Method: Used Kolmogorov complexity to argue the vanishing likelihood of recovering intended meaning and conducted a semantic Bell inequality test with LLMs interpreting ambiguous word pairs.

Result: Found CHSH expectation values (1.2-2.8) violating classical boundaries, showing non-classical contextuality in linguistic interpretation.

Conclusion: Classical frequentist approaches are lossy; Bayesian-style repeated sampling is proposed for better characterization of linguistic meaning.

Abstract: Semantic degeneracy represents a fundamental property of natural language
that extends beyond simple polysemy to encompass the combinatorial explosion of
potential interpretations that emerges as semantic expressions increase in
complexity. Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems face
inherent limitations precisely because they operate within natural language
itself, making them subject to the same interpretive constraints imposed by
semantic degeneracy. In this work, we argue using Kolmogorov complexity that as
an expression's complexity grows, the likelihood of any interpreting agent
(human or LLM-powered AI) recovering the single intended meaning vanishes. This
computational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms
possess meaning in and of themselves is flawed. We alternatively posit that
meaning is instead actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act.
To test this, we conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM
agents as ``computational cognitive systems'' to interpret ambiguous word pairs
under varied contextual settings. Across several independent experiments, we
found average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with several
runs yielding values (e.g., 2.3-2.4) that significantly violate the classical
boundary ($|S|\leq2$). This demonstrates that linguistic interpretation under
ambiguity can exhibit non-classical contextuality, consistent with results from
human cognition experiments. These results inherently imply that classical
frequentist-based analytical approaches for natural language are necessarily
lossy. Instead, we propose that Bayesian-style repeated sampling approaches can
provide more practically useful and appropriate characterizations of linguistic
meaning in context.

TL;DR: The paper studies how large language models (LLMs) behave differently with semantically equivalent but differently worded prompts, introducing Prompt-Based Semantic Shift (PBSS) to measure this drift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and quantify behavioral inconsistencies in LLMs when faced with prompt rewordings that retain the same meaning.

Method: Proposes PBSS, a diagnostic framework, and applies it to ten constrained tasks to measure response shifts in LLMs.

Result: Finds consistent, model-specific response shifts, linking them to tokenization and decoding processes.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for evaluating model stability under rephrasing and suggests tokenization and decoding impact post-training quality.

Abstract: We investigate how large language models respond to prompts that differ only
in their token-level realization but preserve the same semantic intent, a
phenomenon we call prompt variance. We propose Prompt-Based Semantic Shift
(PBSS), a diagnostic framework for measuring behavioral drift in LLMs under
semantically equivalent prompt rewordings. Applied to ten constrained tasks,
PBSS reveals consistent, model-specific response shifts, suggesting statistical
regularities linked to tokenization and decoding. These results highlight an
overlooked dimension of model evaluation stability under rephrasing and suggest
that tokenization strategies and decoding dynamics may contribute to
post-training quality of service instability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChartReasoner is a two-stage framework for visual reasoning over charts, converting images to structured codes and synthesizing reasoning data, achieving high performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending large language models' reasoning to visual tasks without losing critical structural and semantic information in charts.

Method: A code-driven framework: (1) convert chart images to structured ECharts codes, (2) synthesize reasoning data with a pretrained model and validator, (3) train a multimodal model using supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art open-source models with fewer parameters and approaches GPT-4o's performance in out-of-domain settings.

Conclusion: ChartReasoner effectively bridges the gap in visual reasoning, preserving chart details and enabling precise, interpretable reasoning.

Abstract: Recently, large language models have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities
through long-chain reasoning before responding. However, how to extend this
capability to visual reasoning tasks remains an open challenge. Existing
multimodal reasoning approaches transfer such visual reasoning task into
textual reasoning task via several image-to-text conversions, which often lose
critical structural and semantic information embedded in visualizations,
especially for tasks like chart question answering that require a large amount
of visual details. To bridge this gap, we propose ChartReasoner, a code-driven
novel two-stage framework designed to enable precise, interpretable reasoning
over charts. We first train a high-fidelity model to convert diverse chart
images into structured ECharts codes, preserving both layout and data semantics
as lossless as possible. Then, we design a general chart reasoning data
synthesis pipeline, which leverages this pretrained transport model to
automatically and scalably generate chart reasoning trajectories and utilizes a
code validator to filter out low-quality samples. Finally, we train the final
multimodal model using a combination of supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning on our synthesized chart reasoning dataset and
experimental results on four public benchmarks clearly demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed ChartReasoner. It can preserve the original
details of the charts as much as possible and perform comparably with
state-of-the-art open-source models while using fewer parameters, approaching
the performance of proprietary systems like GPT-4o in out-of-domain settings.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM), an unsupervised algorithm to fine-tune pretrained language models without human supervision, outperforming human-supervised methods on certain tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human supervision is inadequate for models with superhuman capabilities, necessitating an unsupervised approach to fine-tuning.

Method: ICM fine-tunes models using their own generated labels, eliminating the need for external supervision.

Result: ICM matches or surpasses human-supervised performance on tasks like GSM8k-verification and TruthfulQA, and improves frontier model training.

Conclusion: ICM is a viable alternative to human supervision, especially for superhuman-capable models, and enhances model performance.

Abstract: To steer pretrained language models for downstream tasks, today's
post-training paradigm relies on humans to specify desired behaviors. However,
for models with superhuman capabilities, it is difficult or impossible to get
high-quality human supervision. To address this challenge, we introduce a new
unsupervised algorithm, Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM), to fine-tune
pretrained language models on their own generated labels, \emph{without
external supervision}. On GSM8k-verification, TruthfulQA, and Alpaca reward
modeling tasks, our method matches the performance of training on golden
supervision and outperforms training on crowdsourced human supervision. On
tasks where LMs' capabilities are strongly superhuman, our method can elicit
those capabilities significantly better than training on human labels. Finally,
we show that our method can improve the training of frontier LMs: we use our
method to train an unsupervised reward model and use reinforcement learning to
train a Claude 3.5 Haiku-based assistant. Both the reward model and the
assistant outperform their human-supervised counterparts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs' ability to judge empathic communication is compared to experts and crowdworkers, showing LLMs approach expert reliability and outperform crowdworkers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how reliably LLMs judge empathic nuances compared to human annotators.

Method: Compare annotations from experts, crowdworkers, and LLMs on 200 real-world conversations using four evaluative frameworks.

Result: LLMs approach expert agreement levels and exceed crowdworker reliability across all frameworks.

Conclusion: LLMs, validated with expert benchmarks, can enhance transparency in emotionally sensitive applications like conversational support.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating empathic responses in
text-based conversations. But, how reliably do they judge the nuances of
empathic communication? We investigate this question by comparing how experts,
crowdworkers, and LLMs annotate empathic communication across four evaluative
frameworks drawn from psychology, natural language processing, and
communications applied to 200 real-world conversations where one speaker shares
a personal problem and the other offers support. Drawing on 3,150 expert
annotations, 2,844 crowd annotations, and 3,150 LLM annotations, we assess
inter-rater reliability between these three annotator groups. We find that
expert agreement is high but varies across the frameworks' sub-components
depending on their clarity, complexity, and subjectivity. We show that expert
agreement offers a more informative benchmark for contextualizing LLM
performance than standard classification metrics. Across all four frameworks,
LLMs consistently approach this expert level benchmark and exceed the
reliability of crowdworkers. These results demonstrate how LLMs, when validated
on specific tasks with appropriate benchmarks, can support transparency and
oversight in emotionally sensitive applications including their use as
conversational companions.

Result: Evaluated various techniques for efficient emotion identification in Bangla.

Conclusion: The study contributes to emotion analysis in low-resource languages by testing and explaining multiple ML approaches.

Abstract: Research on understanding emotions in written language continues to expand,
especially for understudied languages with distinctive regional expressions and
cultural features, such as Bangla. This study examines emotion analysis using
22,698 social media comments from the EmoNoBa dataset. For language analysis,
we employ machine learning models: Linear SVM, KNN, and Random Forest with
n-gram data from a TF-IDF vectorizer. We additionally investigated how PCA
affects the reduction of dimensionality. Moreover, we utilized a BiLSTM model
and AdaBoost to improve decision trees. To make our machine learning models
easier to understand, we used LIME to explain the predictions of the AdaBoost
classifier, which uses decision trees. With the goal of advancing sentiment
analysis in languages with limited resources, our work examines various
techniques to find efficient techniques for emotion identification in Bangla.

Motivation: Human capital is vital for corporate value but lacks standardized measurement or disclosure rules.

Method: Uses word2vec on HC disclosures to create a keyword lexicon across five HC subcategories, sharing data and Python code.

Result: Provides a comprehensive HC lexicon and tools for researchers to analyze corporate HC disclosures.

Conclusion: Offers resources for HC research and discusses future opportunities in HC management and disclosure.

Abstract: Human capital (HC) is increasingly important to corporate value creation.
Unlike other assets, however, HC is not currently subject to well-defined
measurement or disclosure rules. We use a machine learning algorithm (word2vec)
trained on a confirmed set of HC disclosures to develop a comprehensive list of
HC-related keywords classified into five subcategories (DEI; health and safety;
labor relations and culture; compensation and benefits; and demographics and
other) that capture the multidimensional nature of HC management. We share our
lexicon, corporate HC disclosures, and the Python code used to develop the
lexicon, and we provide detailed examples of using our data and code, including
for fine-tuning a BERT model. Researchers can use our HC lexicon (or modify the
code to capture another construct of interest) with their samples of corporate
communications to address pertinent HC questions. We close with a discussion of
future research opportunities related to HC management and disclosure.

Result: GPT-4 tier LLMs generate causally sound stories at small scales but struggle with intentionality and conflict, requiring reinforcement learning for complex reasoning.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into LLMs' story generation limits and highlights challenges for applications like game environments.

Abstract: Story generation has been a prominent application of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, understanding LLMs' ability to produce high-quality stories
remains limited due to challenges in automatic evaluation methods and the high
cost and subjectivity of manual evaluation. Computational narratology offers
valuable insights into what constitutes a good story, which has been applied in
the symbolic narrative planning approach to story generation. This work aims to
deepen the understanding of LLMs' story generation capabilities by using them
to solve narrative planning problems. We present a benchmark for evaluating
LLMs on narrative planning based on literature examples, focusing on causal
soundness, character intentionality, and dramatic conflict. Our experiments
show that GPT-4 tier LLMs can generate causally sound stories at small scales,
but planning with character intentionality and dramatic conflict remains
challenging, requiring LLMs trained with reinforcement learning for complex
reasoning. The results offer insights on the scale of stories that LLMs can
generate while maintaining quality from different aspects. Our findings also
highlight interesting problem solving behaviors and shed lights on challenges
and considerations for applying LLM narrative planning in game environments.

*Shubhashis Roy Dipta,Francis Ferraro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Q2E improves video retrieval by decomposing queries using LLMs/VLMs, outperforming baselines with zero-shot multilingual and multimodal capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance identification and retrieval of videos related to complex events by leveraging latent parametric knowledge from LLMs/VLMs.

Method: Query-to-Event decomposition (Q2E) for zero-shot multilingual text-to-video retrieval, adaptable across datasets and models, with entropy-based fusion scoring.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines; integrating audio improves retrieval.

Conclusion: Q2E effectively leverages multimodal knowledge for better video retrieval, with released code/data for future research.

Abstract: Recent approaches have shown impressive proficiency in extracting and
leveraging parametric knowledge from Large-Language Models (LLMs) and
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we consider how we can improve the
identification and retrieval of videos related to complex real-world events by
automatically extracting latent parametric knowledge about those events. We
present Q2E: a Query-to-Event decomposition method for zero-shot multilingual
text-to-video retrieval, adaptable across datasets, domains, LLMs, or VLMs. Our
approach demonstrates that we can enhance the understanding of otherwise overly
simplified human queries by decomposing the query using the knowledge embedded
in LLMs and VLMs. We additionally show how to apply our approach to both visual
and speech-based inputs. To combine this varied multimodal knowledge, we adopt
entropy-based fusion scoring for zero-shot fusion. Through evaluations on two
diverse datasets and multiple retrieval metrics, we demonstrate that Q2E
outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines. Our evaluation also shows that
integrating audio information can significantly improve text-to-video
retrieval. We have released code and data for future research.

*Prakamya Mishra,Jiang Liu,Jialian Wu,Xiaodong Yu,Zicheng Liu,Emad Barsoum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TTT-Bench evaluates LRMs' strategic, spatial, and logical reasoning through simple Tic-Tac-Toe-style games, revealing their underperformance compared to STEM tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LRMs' reasoning abilities beyond STEM, focusing on basic strategic, spatial, and logical reasoning.

Method: Introduces TTT-Bench, a benchmark with four two-player Tic-Tac-Toe-style games, using a programmatic approach for problem generation.

Result: LRMs, despite excelling in math, struggle with simple reasoning games, scoring significantly lower on TTT-Bench compared to STEM benchmarks.

Conclusion: LRMs lack robust reasoning in non-STEM domains, highlighting a gap in their strategic and long-term reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities across a broad range of tasks including Olympiad-level
mathematical problems, indicating evidence of their complex reasoning
abilities. While many reasoning benchmarks focus on the STEM domain, the
ability of LRMs to reason correctly in broader task domains remains
underexplored. In this work, we introduce \textbf{TTT-Bench}, a new benchmark
that is designed to evaluate basic strategic, spatial, and logical reasoning
abilities in LRMs through a suite of four two-player Tic-Tac-Toe-style games
that humans can effortlessly solve from a young age. We propose a simple yet
scalable programmatic approach for generating verifiable two-player game
problems for TTT-Bench. Although these games are trivial for humans, they
require reasoning about the intentions of the opponent, as well as the game
board's spatial configurations, to ensure a win. We evaluate a diverse set of
state-of-the-art LRMs, and \textbf{discover that the models that excel at hard
math problems frequently fail at these simple reasoning games}. Further testing
reveals that our evaluated reasoning models score on average $\downarrow$ 41\%
\& $\downarrow$ 5\% lower on TTT-Bench compared to MATH 500 \& AIME 2024
respectively, with larger models achieving higher performance using shorter
reasoning traces, where most of the models struggle on long-term strategic
reasoning situations on simple and new TTT-Bench tasks.

*Anneliese Brei,Katharine Henry,Abhisheik Sharma,Shashank Srivastava,Snigdha Chaturvedi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes computational methods to identify unreliable narrators using a human-annotated dataset (TUNa) and evaluates LLMs for classification tasks. Results show the task is challenging but promising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of identifying unreliable narrators in texts using computational methods, bridging literary theory and real-world applications.

Method: Uses TUNa dataset, defines classification tasks, and evaluates LLMs (few-shot, fine-tuning, curriculum learning) for unreliable narrator detection.

Result: The task is challenging, but LLMs show potential for identifying unreliable narrators.

Conclusion: The study highlights the difficulty of the task, encourages further research, and releases the dataset and code for future work.

Abstract: Often when we interact with a first-person account of events, we consider
whether or not the narrator, the primary speaker of the text, is reliable. In
this paper, we propose using computational methods to identify unreliable
narrators, i.e. those who unintentionally misrepresent information. Borrowing
literary theory from narratology to define different types of unreliable
narrators based on a variety of textual phenomena, we present TUNa, a
human-annotated dataset of narratives from multiple domains, including blog
posts, subreddit posts, hotel reviews, and works of literature. We define
classification tasks for intra-narrational, inter-narrational, and
inter-textual unreliabilities and analyze the performance of popular
open-weight and proprietary LLMs for each. We propose learning from literature
to perform unreliable narrator classification on real-world text data. To this
end, we experiment with few-shot, fine-tuning, and curriculum learning
settings. Our results show that this task is very challenging, and there is
potential for using LLMs to identify unreliable narrators. We release our
expert-annotated dataset and code and invite future research in this area.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ToxSyn-PT is the first large-scale Portuguese corpus for fine-grained hate-speech classification across nine minority groups, created via a novel four-stage synthetic pipeline. It shows strong generalization in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a large-scale, diverse Portuguese hate-speech dataset for fine-grained classification across legally protected minority groups.

Method: A four-stage pipeline: (1) manual seed curation, (2) few-shot expansion with an LLM, (3) paraphrase-based augmentation, and (4) enrichment with neutral texts.

Result: The corpus is class-balanced, stylistically diverse, and generalizes well across five public Portuguese hate-speech datasets.

Conclusion: ToxSyn-PT advances synthetic data research and hate-speech detection in low-resource settings, with public release for further study.

Abstract: We present ToxSyn-PT, the first large-scale Portuguese corpus that enables
fine-grained hate-speech classification across nine legally protected minority
groups. The dataset contains 53,274 synthetic sentences equally distributed
between minorities groups and toxicity labels. ToxSyn-PT is created through a
novel four-stage pipeline: (1) a compact, manually curated seed; (2) few-shot
expansion with an instruction-tuned LLM; (3) paraphrase-based augmentation; and
(4) enrichment, plus additional neutral texts to curb overfitting to
group-specific cues. The resulting corpus is class-balanced, stylistically
diverse, and free from the social-media domain that dominate existing
Portuguese datasets. Despite domain differences with traditional benchmarks,
experiments on both binary and multi-label classification on the corpus yields
strong results across five public Portuguese hate-speech datasets,
demonstrating robust generalization even across domain boundaries. The dataset
is publicly released to advance research on synthetic data and hate-speech
detection in low-resource settings.

### [139] [Do Language Models Have Bayesian Brains? Distinguishing Stochastic and Deterministic Decision Patterns within Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10268)
*Andrea Yaoyun Cui,Pengfei Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper challenges the assumption that language models make probabilistic decisions like humans, showing they can behave deterministically. It proposes a method to distinguish stochastic from deterministic patterns in Gibbs sampling to avoid inferring false priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether language models have Bayesian brains and to address the potential for misleading priors inferred from Gibbs sampling.

Method: Revisits the Bayesian brain assumption, tests language models under various conditions, and proposes a method to differentiate decision patterns in Gibbs sampling.

Result: Language models can exhibit near-deterministic behavior, challenging prior assumptions and methods for inferring human-like priors.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into language model decision-making and offers a method to avoid false priors in Gibbs sampling.

Abstract: Language models are essentially probability distributions over token
sequences. Auto-regressive models generate sentences by iteratively computing
and sampling from the distribution of the next token. This iterative sampling
introduces stochasticity, leading to the assumption that language models make
probabilistic decisions, similar to sampling from unknown distributions.
Building on this assumption, prior research has used simulated Gibbs sampling,
inspired by experiments designed to elicit human priors, to infer the priors of
language models. In this paper, we revisit a critical question: Do language
models possess Bayesian brains? Our findings show that under certain
conditions, language models can exhibit near-deterministic decision-making,
such as producing maximum likelihood estimations, even with a non-zero sampling
temperature. This challenges the sampling assumption and undermines previous
methods for eliciting human-like priors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
without proper scrutiny, a system with deterministic behavior undergoing
simulated Gibbs sampling can converge to a "false prior." To address this, we
propose a straightforward approach to distinguish between stochastic and
deterministic decision patterns in Gibbs sampling, helping to prevent the
inference of misleading language model priors. We experiment on a variety of
large language models to identify their decision patterns under various
circumstances. Our results provide key insights in understanding decision
making of large language models.

*Zige Wang,Qi Zhu,Fei Mi,Minghui Xu,Ruochun Jin,Wenjing Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes ClusterUCB, an efficient gradient-based data selection framework using clustering and a modified UCB algorithm to reduce computational costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gradient-based data selection is resource-intensive, making it impractical for fine-tuning large language models. The goal is to reduce computational demands without sacrificing effectiveness.

Method: ClusterUCB clusters training data by gradient features, frames inter-cluster selection as a budget allocation problem (modeled as a multi-armed bandit), and uses a modified UCB algorithm to balance exploration and exploitation.

Result: ClusterUCB achieves comparable performance to original gradient-based methods while significantly reducing computational costs, as validated by benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a practical and efficient alternative to resource-heavy gradient-based data selection methods.

Abstract: Gradient-based data influence approximation has been leveraged to select
useful data samples in the supervised fine-tuning of large language models.
However, the computation of gradients throughout the fine-tuning process
requires too many resources to be feasible in practice. In this paper, we
propose an efficient gradient-based data selection framework with clustering
and a modified Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. Based on the intuition
that data samples with similar gradient features will have similar influences,
we first perform clustering on the training data pool. Then, we frame the
inter-cluster data selection as a constrained computing budget allocation
problem and consider it a multi-armed bandit problem. A modified UCB algorithm
is leveraged to solve this problem. Specifically, during the iterative sampling
process, historical data influence information is recorded to directly estimate
the distributions of each cluster, and a cold start is adopted to balance
exploration and exploitation. Experimental results on various benchmarks show
that our proposed framework, ClusterUCB, can achieve comparable results to the
original gradient-based data selection methods while greatly reducing computing
consumption.

### [141] [Flick: Few Labels Text Classification using K-Aware Intermediate Learning in Multi-Task Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10292)
*Ali Almutairi,Abdullah Alsuhaibani,Shoaib Jameel,Usman Naseem,Gelareh Mohammadi,Imran Razzak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Flick is a novel method for few-label text classification in low-resource languages, improving pseudo-label quality by refining high-confidence labels from broad initial clusters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in low-resource linguistic contexts, where existing methods struggle with noisy pseudo-labels and domain adaptation.

Method: Flick introduces a pseudo-label refinement component, focusing on single-cluster cohesion and adaptive top-k selection to distill reliable pseudo-labels.

Result: Demonstrated superior performance across 14 diverse datasets, including low-resource languages like Arabic, Urdu, and Setswana.

Conclusion: Flick effectively mitigates error propagation in low-resource settings, enabling robust fine-tuning with minimal supervision.

Abstract: Training deep learning networks with minimal supervision has gained
significant research attention due to its potential to reduce reliance on
extensive labelled data. While self-training methods have proven effective in
semi-supervised learning, they remain vulnerable to errors from noisy pseudo
labels. Moreover, most recent approaches to the few-label classification
problem are either designed for resource-rich languages such as English or
involve complex cascading models that are prone to overfitting. To address the
persistent challenge of few-label text classification in truly low-resource
linguistic contexts, where existing methods often struggle with noisy
pseudo-labels and domain adaptation, we propose Flick. Unlike prior methods
that rely on generic multi-cluster pseudo-labelling or complex cascading
architectures, Flick leverages the fundamental insight that distilling
high-confidence pseudo-labels from a broader set of initial clusters can
dramatically improve pseudo-label quality, particularly for linguistically
diverse, low-resource settings. Flick introduces a novel pseudo-label
refinement component, a departure from traditional pseudo-labelling strategies
by identifying and leveraging top-performing pseudo-label clusters. This
component specifically learns to distil highly reliable pseudo-labels from an
initial broad set by focusing on single-cluster cohesion and leveraging an
adaptive top-k selection mechanism. This targeted refinement process is crucial
for mitigating the propagation of errors inherent in low-resource data,
allowing for robust fine-tuning of pre-trained language models with only a
handful of true labels. We demonstrate Flick's efficacy across 14 diverse
datasets, encompassing challenging low-resource languages such as Arabic, Urdu,
and Setswana, alongside English, showcasing its superior performance and
adaptability.

*Chuck Arvin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs' response quality varies based on query framing, with correctness degrading or improving by 15 percentage points when incorrect or correct answers are mentioned. Smaller models show stronger bias (up to 30%). Sycophantic behavior risks educational equity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how user-provided suggestions influence LLMs in educational settings, focusing on sycophancy risks.

Method: Tested five LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 classes) across five conditions, analyzing response quality, answer flipping, and token probabilities.

Result: LLMs change answers based on student suggestions, with correctness varying by ±15%. Smaller models exhibit stronger bias (up to 30%).

Conclusion: Sycophantic behavior in LLMs threatens educational equity, necessitating better understanding and mitigation strategies.

Abstract: This study examines how user-provided suggestions affect Large Language
Models (LLMs) in a simulated educational context, where sycophancy poses
significant risks. Testing five different LLMs from the OpenAI GPT-4o and
GPT-4.1 model classes across five experimental conditions, we show that
response quality varies dramatically based on query framing. In cases where the
student mentions an incorrect answer, the LLM correctness can degrade by as
much as 15 percentage points, while mentioning the correct answer boosts
accuracy by the same margin. Our results also show that this bias is stronger
in smaller models, with an effect of up to 30% for the GPT-4.1-nano model,
versus 8% for the GPT-4o model. Our analysis of how often LLMs "flip" their
answer, and an investigation into token level probabilities, confirm that the
models are generally changing their answers to answer choices mentioned by
students in line with the sycophancy hypothesis. This sycophantic behavior has
important implications for educational equity, as LLMs may accelerate learning
for knowledgeable students while the same tools may reinforce misunderstanding
for less knowledgeable students. Our results highlight the need to better
understand the mechanism, and ways to mitigate, such bias in the educational
context.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes scheduled interleaved speech-text training to improve speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) by gradually adapting LLMs from text to speech.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of adapting text-trained LLMs to speech modality with limited speech-to-speech data.

Method: Uses interleaved speech-text units during training, gradually reducing text ratio to facilitate modality adaptation.

Result: Improves translation performance, especially for languages with limited training data.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances S2ST by progressive modality adaptation.

Abstract: Speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) has been advanced with large language
models (LLMs), which are fine-tuned on discrete speech units. In such
approaches, modality adaptation from text to speech has been an issue. LLMs are
trained on text-only data, which presents challenges to adapt them to speech
modality with limited speech-to-speech data. To address the training
difficulty, we propose scheduled interleaved speech--text training in this
study. We use interleaved speech--text units instead of speech units during
training, where aligned text tokens are interleaved at the word level. We
gradually decrease the ratio of text as training progresses, to facilitate
progressive modality adaptation from text to speech. We conduct experimental
evaluations by fine-tuning LLaMA3.2-1B for S2ST on the CVSS dataset. We show
that the proposed method consistently improves the translation performances,
especially for languages with limited training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Obtaining reliable and accurate reasoning supervision for LLMs is challenging due to reliance on costly human annotations or error-prone LLM-generated CoT.

Method: The approach extracts verifiable reasoning traces from code execution and converts them into natural language CoT reasoning.

Result: Experiments show the method enhances LLMs' transferable reasoning abilities across diverse tasks and reduces inference token length.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively generates accurate CoT supervision, improving LLM reasoning while minimizing redundant outputs.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision
has proven effective for enhancing their reasoning abilities. However,
obtaining reliable and accurate reasoning supervision remains a significant
challenge. We propose a scalable method for generating a high-quality CoT
supervision dataset by leveraging the determinism of program execution. Unlike
existing reasoning dataset generation methods that rely on costly human
annotations or error-prone LLM-generated CoT, our approach extracts verifiable,
step-by-step reasoning traces from code execution and transforms them into a
natural language CoT reasoning. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks across
various domains show that our method effectively equips LLMs with transferable
reasoning abilities across diverse tasks. Furthermore, the ablation studies
validate that our method produces highly accurate reasoning data and reduces
overall token length during inference by reducing meaningless repetition and
overthinking.

TL;DR: TableRAG improves RAG for heterogeneous documents by preserving tabular structure and enhancing reasoning, outperforming baselines on HeteQA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG methods fail with heterogeneous documents (text + tables), disrupting structure and reasoning.

Method: TableRAG integrates text retrieval, SQL execution, and answer generation in four iterative steps.

Result: Outperforms baselines on public datasets and HeteQA, setting a new SOTA.

Conclusion: TableRAG effectively handles heterogeneous documents, advancing RAG capabilities.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated considerable
effectiveness in open-domain question answering. However, when applied to
heterogeneous documents, comprising both textual and tabular components,
existing RAG approaches exhibit critical limitations. The prevailing practice
of flattening tables and chunking strategies disrupts the intrinsic tabular
structure, leads to information loss, and undermines the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs in multi-hop, global queries. To address these challenges, we propose
TableRAG, an hybrid framework that unifies textual understanding and complex
manipulations over tabular data. TableRAG iteratively operates in four steps:
context-sensitive query decomposition, text retrieval, SQL programming and
execution, and compositional intermediate answer generation. We also develop
HeteQA, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-hop heterogeneous
reasoning capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that TableRAG
consistently outperforms existing baselines on both public datasets and our
HeteQA, establishing a new state-of-the-art for heterogeneous document question
answering. We release TableRAG at https://github.com/yxh-y/TableRAG/tree/main.

*Yuhua Jiang,Yuwen Xiong,Yufeng Yuan,Chao Xin,Wenyuan Xu,Yu Yue,Qianchuan Zhao,Lin Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PAG is a framework enabling LLMs to self-correct by alternating policy and verifier roles, improving reasoning and verification without separate models or multi-stage pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with self-verification; existing solutions are unscalable. PAG aims to unify and streamline self-correction.

Method: PAG uses a multi-turn RL paradigm with selective revision, revising only when errors are detected.

Result: PAG improves reasoning and verification, outperforming self-consistency and enhancing accuracy.

Conclusion: PAG offers a scalable, unified approach to self-correction in LLMs, advancing both policy and verifier capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks, yet they still struggle to reliably verify the
correctness of their own outputs. Existing solutions to this verification
challenge often depend on separate verifier models or require multi-stage
self-correction training pipelines, which limit scalability. In this paper, we
propose Policy as Generative Verifier (PAG), a simple and effective framework
that empowers LLMs to self-correct by alternating between policy and verifier
roles within a unified multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm.
Distinct from prior approaches that always generate a second attempt regardless
of model confidence, PAG introduces a selective revision mechanism: the model
revises its answer only when its own generative verification step detects an
error. This verify-then-revise workflow not only alleviates model collapse but
also jointly enhances both reasoning and verification abilities. Extensive
experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks highlight PAG's dual
advancements: as a policy, it enhances direct generation and self-correction
accuracy; as a verifier, its self-verification outperforms self-consistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and improve the temporal grounding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs in image sequences.

Method: TempVS includes three tests (event relation inference, sentence ordering, image ordering) with grounding tests, evaluating 38 MLLMs.

Result: MLLMs struggle with TempVS, showing a large performance gap versus humans.

Conclusion: TempVS highlights challenges for MLLMs and suggests future research directions; benchmark data and code are publicly available.

Abstract: This paper introduces the TempVS benchmark, which focuses on temporal
grounding and reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) in image sequences. TempVS consists of three main tests (i.e., event
relation inference, sentence ordering and image ordering), each accompanied
with a basic grounding test. TempVS requires MLLMs to rely on both visual and
linguistic modalities to understand the temporal order of events. We evaluate
38 state-of-the-art MLLMs, demonstrating that models struggle to solve TempVS,
with a substantial performance gap compared to human capabilities. We also
provide fine-grained insights that suggest promising directions for future
research. Our TempVS benchmark data and code are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes media framing in the Israel-Palestine conflict, using computational methods to identify war vs. peace journalism indicators, revealing biases in reporting across regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in qualitative and surface-level studies of conflict framing by providing deeper, computational insights into media biases.

Method: Combines frame semantics and large language models to analyze communicative and linguistic framing in news articles.

Result: Found a higher focus on war-based reporting and regional biases in framing assailants and victims.

Conclusion: Highlights media biases in conflict reporting and the need for more balanced peace journalism.

Abstract: Framing used by news media, especially in times of conflict, can have
substantial impact on readers' opinion, potentially aggravating the conflict
itself. Current studies on the topic of conflict framing have limited insights
due to their qualitative nature or only look at surface level generic frames
without going deeper. In this work, we identify indicators of war and peace
journalism, as outlined by prior work in conflict studies, in a corpus of news
articles reporting on the Israel-Palestine war. For our analysis, we use
computational approaches, using a combination of frame semantics and large
language models to identify both communicative framing and its connection to
linguistic framing. Our analysis reveals a higher focus on war based reporting
rather than peace based. We also show substantial differences in reporting
across the US, UK, and Middle Eastern news outlets in framing who the assailant
and victims of the conflict are, surfacing biases within the media.

*Zehui Ling,Deshu Chen,Hongwei Zhang,Yifeng Jiao,Xin Guo,Yuan Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to enhance LLM reasoning efficiency by balancing conciseness for simpler problems and detailed reasoning for complex ones, improving performance across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM reasoning methods often produce lengthy outputs, increasing latency, and uniform penalties for shortening reasoning neglect problem complexity, leading to inefficiencies.

Method: The approach divides the reward function and introduces a novel penalty for output length to manage reasoning efficiency.

Result: Improved performance on GSM8K and MATH500 (shorter outputs with maintained/improved accuracy) and better accuracy on AIME2024.

Conclusion: The method successfully balances conciseness and reasoning depth, enhancing LLM efficiency and performance across varying problem complexities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in
reasoning capabilities, performing well on various challenging benchmarks.
Techniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting have been introduced to further
improve reasoning. However, these approaches frequently generate longer
outputs, which in turn increase computational latency. Although some methods
use reinforcement learning to shorten reasoning, they often apply uniform
penalties without considering the problem's complexity, leading to suboptimal
outcomes. In this study, we seek to enhance the efficiency of LLM reasoning by
promoting conciseness for simpler problems while preserving sufficient
reasoning for more complex ones for accuracy, thus improving the model's
overall performance. Specifically, we manage the model's reasoning efficiency
by dividing the reward function and including a novel penalty for output
length. Our approach has yielded impressive outcomes in benchmark evaluations
across three datasets: GSM8K, MATH500, and AIME2024. For the comparatively
simpler datasets GSM8K and MATH500, our method has effectively shortened output
lengths while preserving or enhancing accuracy. On the more demanding AIME2024
dataset, our approach has resulted in improved accuracy.

*Xanh Ho,Sunisth Kumar,Yun-Ang Wu,Florian Boudin,Atsuhiro Takasu,Akiko Aizawa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper reframes table-text alignment as an explanation task, requiring models to identify key table cells for claim verification, and introduces a dataset with human-annotated rationales. It shows that alignment improves verification but LLMs lack faithful reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting claim labels alone lacks interpretability, so the paper aims to enhance reasoning transparency by identifying essential table cells.

Method: Extends SciTab with human-annotated cell-level rationales, proposes a taxonomy for ambiguous cases, and evaluates LLMs.

Result: Alignment improves verification; LLMs predict labels correctly but fail to align with human rationales.

Conclusion: Incorporating alignment enhances verification, but LLMs' reasoning lacks faithfulness, highlighting a gap in interpretability.

Abstract: Scientific claim verification against tables typically requires predicting
whether a claim is supported or refuted given a table. However, we argue that
predicting the final label alone is insufficient: it reveals little about the
model's reasoning and offers limited interpretability. To address this, we
reframe table-text alignment as an explanation task, requiring models to
identify the table cells essential for claim verification. We build a new
dataset by extending the SciTab benchmark with human-annotated cell-level
rationales. Annotators verify the claim label and highlight the minimal set of
cells needed to support their decision. After the annotation process, we
utilize the collected information and propose a taxonomy for handling ambiguous
cases. Our experiments show that (i) incorporating table alignment information
improves claim verification performance, and (ii) most LLMs, while often
predicting correct labels, fail to recover human-aligned rationales, suggesting
that their predictions do not stem from faithful reasoning.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: How cost-effectively can strong reasoning abilities be achieved in language
models? Driven by this fundamental question, we present Tina, a family of tiny
reasoning models achieved with high cost-efficiency. Notably, Tina demonstrates
that substantial reasoning performance can be developed using only minimal
resources, by applying parameter-efficient updates during reinforcement
learning (RL), using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), to an already tiny 1.5B
parameter base model. This minimalist approach produces models that achieve
reasoning performance which is competitive with, and sometimes surpasses, SOTA
RL reasoning models built upon the same base model. Crucially, this is achieved
at a tiny fraction of the computational post-training cost employed by existing
SOTA models. In fact, the best Tina model achieves a >20\% reasoning
performance increase and 43.33\% Pass@1 accuracy on AIME24, at only \$9 USD
post-training and evaluation cost (i.e., an estimated 260x cost reduction). Our
work reveals the surprising effectiveness of efficient RL reasoning via LoRA.
We validate this across multiple open-source reasoning datasets and various
ablation settings starting with a single, fixed set of hyperparameters.
Furthermore, we hypothesize that this effectiveness and efficiency stem from
LoRA rapidly adapting the model to the structural format of reasoning rewarded
by RL, while largely preserving the base model's underlying knowledge. In
service of accessibility and open research, we fully open-source all code,
training logs, and model weights \& checkpoints.

*Aleksandra Sorokovikova,Pavel Chizhov,Iuliia Eremenko,Ivan P. Yamshchikov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines bias in large language models (LLMs) through proxy measures, finding negligible bias in pre-prompted personae but significant bias in tasks like grading user answers and salary negotiation advice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how biases in training data manifest in LLMs, especially with trends like model personalization and memory.

Method: Evaluated LLMs using pre-prompted personae on MMLU, reformulated tasks (grading user answers), and salary negotiation advice.

Result: Pre-prompted personae showed negligible bias, while grading and salary advice tasks revealed pronounced bias.

Conclusion: Bias in LLMs is context-dependent, and personalization trends may exacerbate socio-demographic biases.

Abstract: Modern language models are trained on large amounts of data. These data
inevitably include controversial and stereotypical content, which contains all
sorts of biases related to gender, origin, age, etc. As a result, the models
express biased points of view or produce different results based on the
assigned personality or the personality of the user. In this paper, we
investigate various proxy measures of bias in large language models (LLMs). We
find that evaluating models with pre-prompted personae on a multi-subject
benchmark (MMLU) leads to negligible and mostly random differences in scores.
However, if we reformulate the task and ask a model to grade the user's answer,
this shows more significant signs of bias. Finally, if we ask the model for
salary negotiation advice, we see pronounced bias in the answers. With the
recent trend for LLM assistant memory and personalization, these problems open
up from a different angle: modern LLM users do not need to pre-prompt the
description of their persona since the model already knows their
socio-demographics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Resa, a 1.5B reasoning model family, uses SAE-Tuning to efficiently elicit strong reasoning in language models, reducing costs by >2000x and training time by >450x while retaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore cost-effective methods for eliciting strong reasoning in language models by leveraging their underlying representations.

Method: SAE-Tuning: trains a sparse autoencoder (SAE) to capture reasoning abilities from a source model, then uses it to guide supervised fine-tuning of a target model.

Result: Achieves >97% of RL-trained counterpart's reasoning performance at drastically reduced costs (~$1) and time (~20 minutes). Also shows generalizable and modular reasoning abilities.

Conclusion: SAE-Tuning is a highly efficient method for enhancing reasoning in models, with potential for generalization and modularity, validated by extensive ablations and open-sourced artifacts.

Abstract: How cost-effectively can we elicit strong reasoning in language models by
leveraging their underlying representations? We answer this question with Resa,
a family of 1.5B reasoning models trained via a novel and efficient sparse
autoencoder tuning (SAE-Tuning) procedure. This method first trains an SAE to
capture reasoning abilities from a source model, and then uses the trained SAE
to guide a standard supervised fine-tuning process to elicit such abilities in
a target model, all using verified question-answer data without any reasoning
traces. Notably, when applied to certain base models before further RL
post-training, SAE-Tuning retains >97% of its RL-trained counterpart's
reasoning performance while reducing training costs by >2000x to roughly \$1
and training time by >450x to around 20 minutes. Furthermore, when applied to
lightly RL-trained models (e.g., within 1 hour on 2 GPUs), it enables reasoning
performance such as 43.33% Pass@1 on AIME24 and 90% Pass@1 on AMC23 for only
around \$1 additional cost. Surprisingly, the reasoning abilities extracted via
SAEs are potentially both generalizable and modular. Generality means abilities
extracted from one dataset still elevate performance on a larger and
overlapping corpus. Modularity means abilities extracted from Qwen or Qwen-Math
can be attached to the R1-Distill model at test time, without any retraining,
and yield comparable gains. Extensive ablations validate these findings and all
artifacts are fully open-sourced.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show strong zero-shot DST performance but struggle with multi-user interactions. A study extends a DST dataset to include multi-user scenarios, revealing significant performance drops and highlighting the need for improved LLM robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DST benchmarks focus on structured user-agent conversations, missing the complexities of real-world multi-user interactions. This study aims to evaluate LLMs in multi-user DST while minimizing dataset costs.

Method: Extends an existing DST dataset by generating utterances of a second user using speech act theory, systematically incorporating multi-user interactions for controlled evaluation.

Result: LLMs exhibit a significant performance drop in multi-user DST compared to single-user scenarios, indicating limitations in tracking dialogue states with multiple speakers.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the need for future research to enhance LLMs for multi-user DST, aiming for more realistic and robust models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
zero-shot dialogue state tracking (DST), reducing the need for task-specific
training. However, conventional DST benchmarks primarily focus on structured
user-agent conversations, failing to capture the complexities of real-world
multi-user interactions. In this study, we assess the robustness of LLMs in
multi-user DST while minimizing dataset construction costs. Inspired by recent
advances in LLM-based data annotation, we extend an existing DST dataset by
generating utterances of a second user based on speech act theory. Our
methodology systematically incorporates a second user's utterances into
conversations, enabling a controlled evaluation of LLMs in multi-user settings.
Experimental results reveal a significant performance drop compared to
single-user DST, highlighting the limitations of current LLMs in extracting and
tracking dialogue states amidst multiple speakers. Our findings emphasize the
need for future research to enhance LLMs for multi-user DST scenarios, paving
the way for more realistic and robust DST models.

*Yilin Xiao,Chuang Zhou,Qinggang Zhang,Bo Li,Qing Li,Xiao Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes the RRP framework to enhance LLMs by integrating knowledge graphs, focusing on refining reasoning paths for better performance in complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to lacking background knowledge and hallucination. Integrating KGs helps, but existing methods fail to handle complex questions by not refining reasoning paths.

Method: The RRP framework mines KGs using LLMs' semantic strengths and structural info from relation embedding and bidirectional distribution learning. It includes a rethinking module to evaluate and refine reasoning paths.

Result: RRP achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public datasets and can be integrated into various LLMs in a plug-and-play manner.

Conclusion: RRP effectively enhances LLM reasoning by generating high-quality, tailored reasoning paths, providing better guidance for complex tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks
due to a lack of background knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate. To address
these limitations, integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) with LLMs has been
intensively studied. Existing KG-enhanced LLMs focus on supplementary factual
knowledge, but still struggle with solving complex questions. We argue that
refining the relationships among facts and organizing them into a logically
consistent reasoning path is equally important as factual knowledge itself.
Despite their potential, extracting reliable reasoning paths from KGs poses the
following challenges: the complexity of graph structures and the existence of
multiple generated paths, making it difficult to distinguish between useful and
redundant ones. To tackle these challenges, we propose the RRP framework to
mine the knowledge graph, which combines the semantic strengths of LLMs with
structural information obtained through relation embedding and bidirectional
distribution learning. Additionally, we introduce a rethinking module that
evaluates and refines reasoning paths according to their significance.
Experimental results on two public datasets show that RRP achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to existing baseline methods. Moreover,
RRP can be easily integrated into various LLMs to enhance their reasoning
abilities in a plug-and-play manner. By generating high-quality reasoning paths
tailored to specific questions, RRP distills effective guidance for LLM
reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: An unsupervised hybrid method combining data-driven inference and rule-based heuristics for reconstructing protoforms, outperforming baselines in accuracy and plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods rely heavily on probabilistic models, limiting their effectiveness due to a purely data-driven approach.

Method: Integrates data-driven inference with rule-based heuristics in an evolutionary optimization framework.

Result: Substantial improvements over baselines in reconstructing Latin protoforms, measured by character-level accuracy and phonological plausibility.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach effectively combines statistical patterns and linguistic constraints for superior protoform reconstruction.

Abstract: We propose an unsupervised method for the reconstruction of protoforms i.e.,
ancestral word forms from which modern language forms are derived. While prior
work has primarily relied on probabilistic models of phonological edits to
infer protoforms from cognate sets, such approaches are limited by their
predominantly data-driven nature. In contrast, our model integrates data-driven
inference with rule-based heuristics within an evolutionary optimization
framework. This hybrid approach leverages on both statistical patterns and
linguistically motivated constraints to guide the reconstruction process. We
evaluate our method on the task of reconstructing Latin protoforms using a
dataset of cognates from five Romance languages. Experimental results
demonstrate substantial improvements over established baselines across both
character-level accuracy and phonological plausibility metrics.

Result: The final system outperforms baselines, showing effectiveness of example-driven prompting and LLM reasoning.

Conclusion: Combining retrieval-augmented prompting with LLM reasoning enhances pedagogical feedback assessment, with code publicly available.

Abstract: This paper presents our system for Track 1: Mistake Identification in the BEA
2025 Shared Task on Pedagogical Ability Assessment of AI-powered Tutors. The
task involves evaluating whether a tutor's response correctly identifies a
mistake in a student's mathematical reasoning. We explore four approaches: (1)
an ensemble of machine learning models over pooled token embeddings from
multiple pretrained language models (LMs); (2) a frozen sentence-transformer
using [CLS] embeddings with an MLP classifier; (3) a history-aware model with
multi-head attention between token-level history and response embeddings; and
(4) a retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting system with a large language model
(LLM) i.e. GPT 4o. Our final system retrieves semantically similar examples,
constructs structured prompts, and uses schema-guided output parsing to produce
interpretable predictions. It outperforms all baselines, demonstrating the
effectiveness of combining example-driven prompting with LLM reasoning for
pedagogical feedback assessment. Our code is available at

*Tatsuya Hiraoka,Kentaro Inui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with complex character-level tasks despite high spelling accuracy, relying on intermediate layers to reconstruct character-level information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs internally represent and use character-level information during spelling.

Method: Analyzed LLM behavior through probing classifiers, knowledge neurons, and attention weights.

Result: Embedding layer lacks full character-level encoding; intermediate layers reconstruct this knowledge, showing a 'breakthrough' in spelling behavior.

Conclusion: LLMs handle character-level tasks non-linearly, relying on deeper layers for accurate spelling.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can spell out tokens character by character with
high accuracy, yet they struggle with more complex character-level tasks, such
as identifying compositional subcomponents within tokens. In this work, we
investigate how LLMs internally represent and utilize character-level
information during the spelling-out process. Our analysis reveals that,
although spelling out is a simple task for humans, it is not handled in a
straightforward manner by LLMs. Specifically, we show that the embedding layer
does not fully encode character-level information, particularly beyond the
first character. As a result, LLMs rely on intermediate and higher Transformer
layers to reconstruct character-level knowledge, where we observe a distinct
"breakthrough" in their spelling behavior. We validate this mechanism through
three complementary analyses: probing classifiers, identification of knowledge
neurons, and inspection of attention weights.

TL;DR: The paper presents a method using large language models (LLMs) to detect life-threatening language, outperforming traditional techniques like bag of words and BERT. Fine-tuned LLMs (Mistral, Llama-2, Gemma) show strong performance, especially in imbalanced data scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve detection of life-threatening language for mental health and safety, comparing LLMs with traditional methods.

Method: Fine-tuning open-source LLMs (Gemma, Mistral, Llama-2) on balanced, imbalanced, and extremely imbalanced datasets, and comparing them to traditional methods.

Result: LLMs, especially Mistral and Llama-2, outperform traditional methods. Upsampling helps traditional methods but has less impact on LLMs.

Conclusion: LLMs show great potential for real-world detection of life-threatening language.

Abstract: Detecting life-threatening language is essential for safeguarding individuals
in distress, promoting mental health and well-being, and preventing potential
harm and loss of life. This paper presents an effective approach to identifying
life-threatening texts using large language models (LLMs) and compares them
with traditional methods such as bag of words, word embedding, topic modeling,
and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. We fine-tune three
open-source LLMs including Gemma, Mistral, and Llama-2 using their 7B parameter
variants on different datasets, which are constructed with class balance,
imbalance, and extreme imbalance scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate a
strong performance of LLMs against traditional methods. More specifically,
Mistral and Llama-2 models are top performers in both balanced and imbalanced
data scenarios while Gemma is slightly behind. We employ the upsampling
technique to deal with the imbalanced data scenarios and demonstrate that while
this method benefits traditional approaches, it does not have as much impact on
LLMs. This study demonstrates a great potential of LLMs for real-world
life-threatening language detection problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of hypernymy links for adjectives in the Open English Wordnet and explore how hypernymy differs for adjectives compared to nouns and verbs.

Method: Theoretical discussion of hypernymy for adjectives, development of a new resource, and fine-tuning large language models (TaxoLLaMa) for predicting adjective hypernymy.

Result: A new resource for adjective hypernymy is created, and the adapted TaxoLLaMa methodology proves effective for this task.

Conclusion: The study successfully addresses the gap in adjective hypernymy links and demonstrates the adaptability of existing methods to this specific task.

Abstract: Open English Wordnet is a key resource published in OntoLex-lemon as part of
the linguistic linked open data cloud. There are, however, many links missing
in the resource, and in this paper, we look at how we can establish hypernymy

TL;DR: PREMISE reduces token usage and cost in large reasoning models (LRMs) by optimizing prompts for brevity and correctness, maintaining accuracy while cutting tokens by up to 87.5%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Verbose reasoning traces in LRMs inflate token usage and cost, limiting deployment in constrained settings.

Method: PREMISE combines trace-level diagnostics and gradient-inspired prompt optimization to minimize redundancy without altering model weights.

Result: Achieves same or better accuracy (e.g., 96%→96% with Claude) while reducing tokens by up to 87.5% and cutting costs by 69–82%.

Conclusion: Prompt-level optimization is a scalable way to enhance LRM efficiency without sacrificing reasoning quality.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet and OpenAI o1 achieve
strong performance on mathematical benchmarks using lengthy chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning, but the resulting traces are often unnecessarily verbose. This
inflates token usage and cost, limiting deployment in latency-sensitive or
API-constrained settings. We introduce PREMISE (PRompt-based Efficient
Mathematical Inference with Strategic Evaluation), a prompt-only framework that
reduces reasoning overhead without modifying model weights. PREMISE combines
trace-level diagnostics with gradient-inspired prompt optimization to minimize
redundant computation while preserving answer accuracy. The approach jointly
optimizes brevity and correctness through a multi-objective textual search that
balances token length and answer validity. Unlike prior work, PREMISE runs in a
single-pass black-box interface, so it can be applied directly to commercial
LLMs. On GSM8K, SVAMP, and Math500 we match or exceed baseline accuracy
($96\%\rightarrow96\%$ with Claude, $91\%\rightarrow92\%$ with Gemini) while
reducing reasoning tokens by up to $87.5\%$ and cutting dollar cost by
$69$--$82\%$. These results show that prompt-level optimization is a practical
and scalable path to efficient LRM inference without compromising reasoning
quality.

TL;DR: ClaimSpect is a framework for breaking down nuanced claims into hierarchical aspects and sub-aspects, enriching them with corpus-specific perspectives, and validating them using retrieval-augmented generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nuanced claims (e.g., scientific or political) are hard to label as purely true or false. Breaking them into smaller, verifiable aspects allows for a more structured and comprehensive analysis.

Method: ClaimSpect uses retrieval-augmented generation to hierarchically partition claims into aspects and sub-aspects, retrieves relevant corpus segments, and identifies varying perspectives (support, neutral, oppose) and their prevalence.

Result: Applied to real-world scientific and political claims, ClaimSpect demonstrates robustness and accuracy in deconstructing claims and representing corpus perspectives, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: ClaimSpect effectively addresses the challenge of analyzing nuanced claims by providing a structured, hierarchical approach and validating perspectives within a corpus.

Abstract: Claims made by individuals or entities are oftentimes nuanced and cannot be
clearly labeled as entirely "true" or "false" -- as is frequently the case with
scientific and political claims. However, a claim (e.g., "vaccine A is better
than vaccine B") can be dissected into its integral aspects and sub-aspects
(e.g., efficacy, safety, distribution), which are individually easier to
validate. This enables a more comprehensive, structured response that provides
a well-rounded perspective on a given problem while also allowing the reader to
prioritize specific angles of interest within the claim (e.g., safety towards
children). Thus, we propose ClaimSpect, a retrieval-augmented generation-based
framework for automatically constructing a hierarchy of aspects typically
considered when addressing a claim and enriching them with corpus-specific
perspectives. This structure hierarchically partitions an input corpus to
retrieve relevant segments, which assist in discovering new sub-aspects.
Moreover, these segments enable the discovery of varying perspectives towards
an aspect of the claim (e.g., support, neutral, or oppose) and their respective
prevalence (e.g., "how many biomedical papers believe vaccine A is more
transportable than B?"). We apply ClaimSpect to a wide variety of real-world
scientific and political claims featured in our constructed dataset, showcasing
its robustness and accuracy in deconstructing a nuanced claim and representing
perspectives within a corpus. Through real-world case studies and human
evaluation, we validate its effectiveness over multiple baselines.

TL;DR: TaxoAdapt is a framework for dynamically adapting LLM-generated taxonomies to scientific corpora, addressing gaps in generalizability and multidimensionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in organizing and retrieving scientific literature due to evolving fields and limitations of existing methods.

Method: TaxoAdapt uses iterative hierarchical classification to expand taxonomy width and depth based on corpus topical distribution.

Result: TaxoAdapt outperforms baselines, being 26.51% more granularity-preserving and 50.41% more coherent.

Conclusion: TaxoAdapt effectively structures and captures the evolution of scientific fields, offering a robust solution for taxonomy construction.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of scientific fields introduces challenges in organizing
and retrieving scientific literature. While expert-curated taxonomies have
traditionally addressed this need, the process is time-consuming and expensive.
Furthermore, recent automatic taxonomy construction methods either (1)
over-rely on a specific corpus, sacrificing generalizability, or (2) depend
heavily on the general knowledge of large language models (LLMs) contained
within their pre-training datasets, often overlooking the dynamic nature of
evolving scientific domains. Additionally, these approaches fail to account for
the multi-faceted nature of scientific literature, where a single research
paper may contribute to multiple dimensions (e.g., methodology, new tasks,
evaluation metrics, benchmarks). To address these gaps, we propose TaxoAdapt, a
framework that dynamically adapts an LLM-generated taxonomy to a given corpus
across multiple dimensions. TaxoAdapt performs iterative hierarchical
classification, expanding both the taxonomy width and depth based on corpus'
topical distribution. We demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance across a
diverse set of computer science conferences over the years to showcase its
ability to structure and capture the evolution of scientific fields. As a
multidimensional method, TaxoAdapt generates taxonomies that are 26.51% more
granularity-preserving and 50.41% more coherent than the most competitive
baselines judged by LLMs.

TL;DR: Using a universal tokenizer in multilingual LLMs improves post-training language adaptation, achieving up to 20.2% higher win rates compared to language-specific tokenizers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in multilingual LLM pretraining, such as limited model capacity and tokenizer coverage gaps for new languages.

Method: Proposing a universal tokenizer trained for more languages than the primary pretraining set to enhance post-training adaptation.

Result: Universal tokenizer improves language adaptation by up to 20.2% and plasticity for unseen languages by 5%, with minimal performance loss on pretraining languages.

Conclusion: A universal tokenizer significantly enhances multilingual LLM adaptability without compromising performance on pretraining languages.

Abstract: Pretraining massively multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) for many
languages at once is challenging due to limited model capacity, scarce
high-quality data, and compute constraints. Moreover, the lack of language
coverage of the tokenizer makes it harder to address the gap for new languages
purely at the post-training stage. In this work, we study what relatively cheap
interventions early on in training improve "language plasticity", or adaptation
capabilities of the model post-training to new languages. We focus on tokenizer
design and propose using a universal tokenizer that is trained for more
languages than the primary pretraining languages to enable efficient adaptation
in expanding language coverage after pretraining. Our systematic experiments
across diverse groups of languages and different training strategies show that
a universal tokenizer enables significantly higher language adaptation, with up
to 20.2% increase in win rates compared to tokenizers specific to pretraining
languages. Furthermore, a universal tokenizer also leads to better plasticity
towards languages that are completely unseen in the tokenizer and pretraining,
by up to 5% win rate gain. We achieve this adaptation to an expanded set of
languages with minimal compromise in performance on the majority of languages
included in pretraining.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates uncertainty estimation methods for LLMs in clinical multiple-choice QA, comparing single-generation and sampling-based approaches. Lightweight methods using behavioral signals perform nearly as well as Semantic Entropy with one generation. Results highlight variability across specialties and question types, emphasizing model selection based on context.

Motivation: To ensure reliable deployment of LLMs in high-stakes clinical settings by improving uncertainty estimation for multiple-choice QA.

Method: Evaluated ten open-source LLMs across two datasets, eleven medical specialties, and six question types. Compared single-generation and sampling-based methods, and introduced lightweight estimators using behavioral signals.

Result: Lightweight methods matched Semantic Entropy performance with one generation. Performance varied significantly by specialty and question type.

Conclusion: Model selection should consider question type and model strengths, and lightweight uncertainty estimators can be effective alternatives to complex methods.

Abstract: Accurate and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates are essential for
deploying large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains such as clinical
decision support. We present a fine-grained evaluation of uncertainty
estimation methods for clinical multiple-choice question answering, covering
ten open-source LLMs (general-purpose, biomedical, and reasoning models) across
two datasets, eleven medical specialties, and six question types. We compare
standard single-generation and sampling-based methods, and present a case study
exploring simple, single-pass estimators based on behavioral signals in
reasoning traces. These lightweight methods approach the performance of
Semantic Entropy while requiring only one generation. Our results reveal
substantial variation across specialties and question types, underscoring the
importance of selecting models based on both the nature of the question and
model-specific strengths.

*Viet Anh Trinh,Xinlu He,Jacob Whitehill*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method using LLM revision improves ASR accuracy for named entities, reducing WER by 30% on a new dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Named entities are critical but often misrecognized in ASR, impacting downstream tasks.

Method: Proposes an LLM revision mechanism using reasoning and local context (e.g., lecture notes) to correct named entities.

Result: Achieves up to 30% relative WER reduction for named entities on the NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare dataset.

Conclusion: LLM-based revision effectively improves ASR accuracy for named entities, demonstrating significant WER reduction.

Abstract: With recent advances in modeling and the increasing amount of supervised
training data, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved
remarkable performance on general speech. However, the word error rate (WER) of
state-of-the-art ASR remains high for named entities. Since named entities are
often the most critical keywords, misrecognizing them can affect all downstream
applications, especially when the ASR system functions as the front end of a
complex system. In this paper, we introduce a large language model (LLM)
revision mechanism to revise incorrect named entities in ASR predictions by
leveraging the LLM's reasoning ability as well as local context (e.g., lecture
notes) containing a set of correct named entities. Finally, we introduce the
NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare dataset, containing 45 hours of data from MIT courses
for development and testing. On this dataset, our proposed technique achieves
up to 30\% relative WER reduction for named entities.

### [168] [Mitigating Negative Interference in Multilingual Sequential Knowledge Editing through Null-Space Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10800)
*Wei Sun,Tingyu Qu,Mingxiao Li,Jesse Davis,Marie-Francine Moens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LangEdit is a framework for updating multilingual knowledge in LLMs without interference, using null-space constraints to isolate language-specific updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of updating multilingual knowledge in LLMs efficiently while avoiding destructive interference across languages.

Method: LangEdit projects parameter updates for each language onto orthogonal subspaces to ensure independence and preserve generalization.

Result: LangEdit outperforms existing methods, mitigating interference and improving accuracy across multiple languages and tasks.

Conclusion: LangEdit enables efficient and accurate multilingual knowledge updates in LLMs, with potential for broader application.

Abstract: Efficiently updating multilingual knowledge in large language models (LLMs),
while preserving consistent factual representations across languages, remains a
long-standing and unresolved challenge. While deploying separate editing
systems for each language might seem viable, this approach incurs substantial
costs due to the need to manage multiple models. A more efficient solution
involves integrating knowledge updates across all languages into a unified
model. However, performing sequential edits across languages often leads to
destructive parameter interference, significantly degrading multilingual
generalization and the accuracy of injected knowledge. To address this
challenge, we propose LangEdit, a novel null-space constrained framework
designed to precisely isolate language-specific knowledge updates. The core
innovation of LangEdit lies in its ability to project parameter updates for
each language onto the orthogonal complement of previous updated subspaces.
This approach mathematically guarantees update independence while preserving
multilingual generalization capabilities. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation
across three model architectures, six languages, and four downstream tasks,
demonstrating that LangEdit effectively mitigates parameter interference and
outperforms existing state-of-the-art editing methods. Our results highlight
its potential for enabling efficient and accurate multilingual knowledge
updates in LLMs. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReCUT introduces a method to balance reasoning accuracy and length in LLMs by generating diverse reasoning paths, training specialized models, and integrating them, reducing reasoning length by 30-50% without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the issue of overthinking and redundant reasoning traces in Chain-of-Thought prompting, which existing methods struggle to mitigate effectively.

Method: ReCUT uses stepwise exploration and long-short sampling to generate diverse reasoning paths, trains two specialized models (for accuracy and brevity), and interpolates their parameters.

Result: ReCUT reduces reasoning lengths by 30-50% while maintaining or improving accuracy across math reasoning datasets.

Conclusion: ReCUT effectively balances reasoning accuracy and length, outperforming baselines and offering a practical solution for efficient LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting have substantially
improved the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
these methods often suffer from overthinking, leading to unnecessarily lengthy
or redundant reasoning traces. Existing approaches attempt to mitigate this
issue through curating multiple reasoning chains for training LLMs, but their
effectiveness is often constrained by the quality of the generated data and
prone to overfitting. To address the challenge, we propose Reasoning
Compression ThroUgh Stepwise Trials (ReCUT), a novel method aimed at balancing
the accuracy and length of reasoning trajectory. Specifically, ReCUT employs a
stepwise exploration mechanism and a long-short switched sampling strategy,
enabling LLMs to incrementally generate diverse reasoning paths. These paths
are evaluated and used to construct preference pairs to train two specialized
models (Gemini LLMs)-one optimized for reasoning accuracy, the other for
shorter reasoning. A final integrated model is obtained by interpolating the
parameters of these two models. Experimental results across multiple math
reasoning datasets and backbone models demonstrate that ReCUT significantly
reduces reasoning lengths by approximately 30-50%, while maintaining or
improving reasoning accuracy compared to various baselines. All codes and data
will be released via https://github.com/NEUIR/ReCUT.

*Qingyan Wei,Yaojie Zhang,Zhiyuan Liu,Dongrui Liu,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SlowFast Sampling is a dynamic strategy for diffusion-based language models (dLLMs) that alternates between exploratory and accelerated decoding, achieving significant speedups with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sampling strategies for dLLMs are static, leading to inefficiency and inflexibility. SlowFast Sampling aims to improve this by dynamically adapting decoding stages.

Method: Proposes SlowFast Sampling, guided by certainty, convergence, and positional principles, and integrates it with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundant computation.

Result: Achieves up to 15.63× speedup on LLaDA and 34.22× with caching, outperforming autoregressive baselines like LLaMA3 8B in throughput.

Conclusion: Well-designed sampling can unlock dLLMs' potential for fast, high-quality generation, making SlowFast Sampling a promising approach.

Abstract: Diffusion-based language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional autoregressive LLMs by enabling parallel token
generation and significantly reducing inference latency. However, existing
sampling strategies for dLLMs, such as confidence-based or semi-autoregressive
decoding, often suffer from static behavior, leading to suboptimal efficiency
and limited flexibility. In this paper, we propose SlowFast Sampling, a novel
dynamic sampling strategy that adaptively alternates between exploratory and
accelerated decoding stages. Our method is guided by three golden principles:
certainty principle, convergence principle, and positional principle, which
govern when and where tokens can be confidently and efficiently decoded. We
further integrate our strategy with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundant computation.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks and models show that SlowFast Sampling
achieves up to 15.63$\times$ speedup on LLaDA with minimal accuracy drop, and
up to 34.22$\times$ when combined with caching. Notably, our approach
outperforms strong autoregressive baselines like LLaMA3 8B in throughput,
demonstrating that well-designed sampling can unlock the full potential of
dLLMs for fast and high-quality generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines how wav2vec2 models trained on four languages encode speech features (phones, tones, speakers) and finds their subspaces are largely orthogonal, with similar layerwise patterns across languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if self-supervised speech models like wav2vec2 represent speech features differently based on the pretraining language.

Method: Probing classifiers and geometric analyses were used to study phone, tone, and speaker representations in wav2vec2 models trained on four languages.

Result: Subspaces for phones, tones, and speakers are largely orthogonal, with similar layerwise accuracy patterns across languages and a slight advantage for matched-language phone/tone probes in later layers.

Conclusion: The structure of wav2vec2 representations is largely independent of the pretraining language, suggesting universal encoding patterns.

Abstract: Analyses of self-supervised speech models have begun to reveal where and how
they represent different types of information. However, almost all analyses
have focused on English. Here, we examine how wav2vec2 models trained on four
different languages encode both language-matched and non-matched speech. We use
probing classifiers and geometric analyses to examine how phones, lexical
tones, and speaker information are represented. We show that for all
pretraining and test languages, the subspaces encoding phones, tones, and
speakers are largely orthogonal, and that layerwise patterns of probing
accuracy are similar, with a relatively small advantage for matched-language
phone and tone (but not speaker) probes in the later layers. Our findings
suggest that the structure of representations learned by wav2vec2 is largely
independent of the speech material used during pretraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical dialogue systems struggle with identifying relevant knowledge and generating accurate, personalized responses.

Method: MedRef uses knowledge refining and dynamic prompt adjustment, including Triplet Filter and Demo Selector modules, to enhance real-time adaptability.

Result: MedRef outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in generation quality and medical entity accuracy on MedDG and KaMed benchmarks.

Conclusion: MedRef is effective and reliable for real-world healthcare applications, addressing key challenges in medical dialogue systems.

Abstract: Medical dialogue systems (MDS) have emerged as crucial online platforms for
enabling multi-turn, context-aware conversations with patients. However,
existing MDS often struggle to (1) identify relevant medical knowledge and (2)
generate personalized, medically accurate responses. To address these
challenges, we propose MedRef, a novel MDS that incorporates knowledge refining
and dynamic prompt adjustment. First, we employ a knowledge refining mechanism
to filter out irrelevant medical data, improving predictions of critical
medical entities in responses. Additionally, we design a comprehensive prompt
structure that incorporates historical details and evident details. To enable
real-time adaptability to diverse patient conditions, we implement two key
modules, Triplet Filter and Demo Selector, providing appropriate knowledge and
demonstrations equipped in the system prompt. Extensive experiments on MedDG
and KaMed benchmarks show that MedRef outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
both generation quality and medical entity accuracy, underscoring its
effectiveness and reliability for real-world healthcare applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To validate the impact of fine-tuning on large language model performance, focusing on parameter-efficient methods (LoRA and QLoRA).

Method: Evaluated model capabilities in commonsense reasoning (HellaSwag), mathematical reasoning (GSM8K), and multi-domain knowledge (MMLU-CS) using LoRA and QLoRA.

Result: LoRA-based methods improve task-specific performance efficiently; performance depends on dataset-task alignment.

Conclusion: Provides insights into parameter-efficient mechanisms and practical guidance for efficient LLM adaptation with limited resources.

Abstract: This paper investigates and validates the impact of fine-tuning on large

multi-domain knowledge (MMLU-CS).
  Our findings demonstrate that: (1) LoRA-based methods effectively improve

parameter-efficient mechanisms and practical guidance for developers
implementing efficient LLM adaptation with limited resources.

### [175] [Generalization or Hallucination? Understanding Out-of-Context Reasoning in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10887)
*Yixiao Huang,Hanlin Zhu,Tianyu Guo,Jiantao Jiao,Somayeh Sojoudi,Michael I. Jordan,Stuart Russell,Song Mei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how large language models (LLMs) generalize and hallucinate due to out-of-context reasoning (OCR), linking both behaviors to a single mechanism. It formalizes OCR and identifies matrix factorization as key, attributing OCR to gradient descent's implicit bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why LLMs exhibit both generalization and hallucination during fine-tuning, despite these behaviors seeming contradictory.

Method: The study formalizes OCR as a synthetic factual recall task, tests it on five LLMs, and analyzes a simplified transformer model to identify the role of matrix factorization.

Result: OCR drives both generalization and hallucination, depending on causal relationships between concepts. Matrix factorization is crucial for OCR, and gradient descent's implicit bias explains its efficiency.

Conclusion: The work provides a theoretical foundation for OCR, offering insights into LLM behaviors and potential mitigation strategies for undesirable outcomes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can acquire new knowledge through fine-tuning,
but this process exhibits a puzzling duality: models can generalize remarkably
from new facts, yet are also prone to hallucinating incorrect information.
However, the reasons for this phenomenon remain poorly understood. In this
work, we argue that both behaviors stem from a single mechanism known as
out-of-context reasoning (OCR): the ability to deduce implications by
associating concepts, even those without a causal link. Our experiments across
five prominent LLMs confirm that OCR indeed drives both generalization and
hallucination, depending on whether the associated concepts are causally
related. To build a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon, we
then formalize OCR as a synthetic factual recall task. We empirically show that
a one-layer single-head attention-only transformer with factorized output and
value matrices can learn to solve this task, while a model with combined
weights cannot, highlighting the crucial role of matrix factorization. Our
theoretical analysis shows that the OCR capability can be attributed to the
implicit bias of gradient descent, which favors solutions that minimize the
nuclear norm of the combined output-value matrix. This mathematical structure
explains why the model learns to associate facts and implications with high
sample efficiency, regardless of whether the correlation is causal or merely
spurious. Ultimately, our work provides a theoretical foundation for
understanding the OCR phenomenon, offering a new lens for analyzing and
mitigating undesirable behaviors from knowledge injection.

TL;DR: BioClinical ModernBERT is a domain-adapted encoder for biomedical and clinical NLP, improving speed and performance by leveraging a large corpus and diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Encoder models in biomedical NLP lag behind decoder models in development, limiting domain adaptation.

Method: Continued pretraining on a 53.5B-token corpus and 20 diverse datasets, building on ModernBERT.

Result: Outperforms existing encoders on four downstream tasks.

Conclusion: BioClinical ModernBERT advances biomedical NLP with improved performance and adaptability, released in base and large versions.

Abstract: Encoder-based transformer models are central to biomedical and clinical
Natural Language Processing (NLP), as their bidirectional self-attention makes
them well-suited for efficiently extracting structured information from
unstructured text through discriminative tasks. However, encoders have seen
slower development compared to decoder models, leading to limited domain
adaptation in biomedical and clinical settings. We introduce BioClinical
ModernBERT, a domain-adapted encoder that builds on the recent ModernBERT
release, incorporating long-context processing and substantial improvements in
speed and performance for biomedical and clinical NLP. BioClinical ModernBERT
is developed through continued pretraining on the largest biomedical and
clinical corpus to date, with over 53.5 billion tokens, and addresses a key
limitation of prior clinical encoders by leveraging 20 datasets from diverse
institutions, domains, and geographic regions, rather than relying on data from
a single source. It outperforms existing biomedical and clinical encoders on
four downstream tasks spanning a broad range of use cases. We release both base
(150M parameters) and large (396M parameters) versions of BioClinical
ModernBERT, along with training checkpoints to support further research.

*Lan Zhang,Marco Valentino,Andre Freitas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a systematic method (EFG ensemble of LLM judges) to evaluate autoformalization tasks in formal mathematics, outperforming coarse-grained models by aligning better with human assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for evaluating autoformalization lack granularity and are ineffective for advanced formal mathematical reasoning, necessitating a more nuanced and automated approach.

Method: Proposes an epistemically and formally grounded ensemble (EFG) of LLM judges, evaluating autoformalization on criteria like logical preservation, mathematical consistency, formal validity, and formal quality.

Result: The EFG ensemble correlates more strongly with human assessments than coarse-grained models, especially in evaluating formal qualities.

Conclusion: LLM-as-judges, guided by well-defined criteria, can provide scalable, interpretable, and reliable evaluation for formal mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: Autoformalization plays a crucial role in formal mathematical reasoning by
enabling the automatic translation of natural language statements into formal
languages. While recent advances using large language models (LLMs) have shown
promising results, methods for automatically evaluating autoformalization
remain underexplored. As one moves to more complex domains (e.g., advanced
mathematics), human evaluation requires significant time and domain expertise,
especially as the complexity of the underlying statements and background
knowledge increases. LLM-as-a-judge presents a promising approach for
automating such evaluation. However, existing methods typically employ
coarse-grained and generic evaluation criteria, which limit their effectiveness
for advanced formal mathematical reasoning, where quality hinges on nuanced,
multi-granular dimensions. In this work, we take a step toward addressing this
gap by introducing a systematic, automatic method to evaluate autoformalization
tasks. The proposed method is based on an epistemically and formally grounded
ensemble (EFG) of LLM judges, defined on criteria encompassing logical
preservation (LP), mathematical consistency (MC), formal validity (FV), and
formal quality (FQ), resulting in a transparent assessment that accounts for
different contributing factors. We validate the proposed framework to serve as
a proxy for autoformalization assessment within the domain of formal
mathematics. Overall, our experiments demonstrate that the EFG ensemble of LLM
judges is a suitable emerging proxy for evaluation, more strongly correlating
with human assessments than a coarse-grained model, especially when assessing
formal qualities. These findings suggest that LLM-as-judges, especially when
guided by a well-defined set of atomic properties, could offer a scalable,
interpretable, and reliable support for evaluating formal mathematical
reasoning.

and show that RL on text data alone maintains most of the initial checkpoint's

*Or Shafran,Atticus Geiger,Mor Geva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF) to decompose MLP activations in LLMs, outperforming sparse autoencoders (SAEs) in interpretability and causal steering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods like SAEs lack intrinsic interpretability and struggle in causal evaluations, motivating a need for better unsupervised feature extraction.

Method: SNMF is used to decompose MLP activations, ensuring sparsity and interpretability by mapping features to activating inputs.

Result: SNMF-derived features outperform SAEs and supervised baselines in causal steering and align with human-interpretable concepts.

Conclusion: SNMF is a simple, effective tool for identifying interpretable features and revealing hierarchical structures in LLM activations.

Abstract: A central goal for mechanistic interpretability has been to identify the
right units of analysis in large language models (LLMs) that causally explain
their outputs. While early work focused on individual neurons, evidence that
neurons often encode multiple concepts has motivated a shift toward analyzing
directions in activation space. A key question is how to find directions that
capture interpretable features in an unsupervised manner. Current methods rely
on dictionary learning with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), commonly trained over
residual stream activations to learn directions from scratch. However, SAEs
often struggle in causal evaluations and lack intrinsic interpretability, as
their learning is not explicitly tied to the computations of the model. Here,
we tackle these limitations by directly decomposing MLP activations with
semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF), such that the learned features
are (a) sparse linear combinations of co-activated neurons, and (b) mapped to
their activating inputs, making them directly interpretable. Experiments on
Llama 3.1, Gemma 2 and GPT-2 show that SNMF derived features outperform SAEs
and a strong supervised baseline (difference-in-means) on causal steering,
while aligning with human-interpretable concepts. Further analysis reveals that
specific neuron combinations are reused across semantically-related features,
exposing a hierarchical structure in the MLP's activation space. Together,
these results position SNMF as a simple and effective tool for identifying
interpretable features and dissecting concept representations in LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces dynamic epistemic friction in LLMs, defining it as resistance to belief updates when faced with conflicting information, and demonstrates its predictive power in dialogues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked role of epistemic friction in aligning LLMs with human preferences, particularly in belief updates during collaborative tasks.

Method: Defines dynamic epistemic friction using Dynamic Epistemic Logic, analyzes belief updates in dialogues, and refines the model for real-world complexity.

Result: The model effectively predicts belief updates in dialogues, showing the importance of epistemic friction in human-AI collaboration.

Conclusion: Epistemic friction is crucial for understanding and improving belief alignment in LLMs, with potential for further refinement in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Recent developments in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human
preferences have significantly enhanced their utility in human-AI collaborative
scenarios. However, such approaches often neglect the critical role of
"epistemic friction," or the inherent resistance encountered when updating
beliefs in response to new, conflicting, or ambiguous information. In this
paper, we define dynamic epistemic friction as the resistance to epistemic
integration, characterized by the misalignment between an agent's current
belief state and new propositions supported by external evidence. We position
this within the framework of Dynamic Epistemic Logic (Van Benthem and Pacuit,
2011), where friction emerges as nontrivial belief-revision during the
interaction. We then present analyses from a situated collaborative task that
demonstrate how this model of epistemic friction can effectively predict belief
updates in dialogues, and we subsequently discuss how the model of belief
alignment as a measure of epistemic resistance or friction can naturally be
made more sophisticated to accommodate the complexities of real-world dialogue
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Domain2Vec decomposes datasets into meta-domains, enabling optimal data mixture for LM pretraining without training, improving efficiency and downstream performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To capture key dataset features and align training-validation distributions for better LM performance.

Method: Decomposes datasets into meta-domains, uses a classifier for domain vectors, and integrates with existing methods.

Result: Achieves same validation loss with 51.5% computation and improves downstream performance by 2.83%.

Conclusion: Domain2Vec efficiently enhances LM pretraining and downstream task performance.

Abstract: We introduce~\textsc{Domain2Vec}, a novel approach that decomposes any
dataset into a linear combination of several \emph{meta-domains}, a new concept
designed to capture the key underlying features of datasets.
\textsc{Domain2Vec} maintains a vocabulary of meta-domains and uses a
classifier to decompose any given dataset into a domain vector that corresponds
to a distribution over this vocabulary. These domain vectors enable the
identification of the optimal data mixture for language model (LM) pretraining
in a training-free manner under the \emph{\textbf{D}istribution
\textbf{A}lignment \textbf{A}ssumption} (DA$^{2}$), which suggests that when
the data distributions of the training set and the validation set are better
aligned, a lower validation loss is achieved. Moreover, \textsc{Domain2vec} can
be seamlessly integrated into previous works to model the relationship between
domain vectors and LM performance, greatly enhancing the efficiency and
scalability of previous methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
\textsc{Domain2Vec} helps find the data mixture that enhances downstream task
performance with minimal computational overhead. Specifically,
\textsc{Domain2Vec} achieves the same validation loss on Pile-CC using only
$51.5\%$ of the computation required when training on the original mixture of
The Pile dataset. Under equivalent compute budget, \textsc{Domain2Vec} improves
downstream performance by an average of $2.83\%$.

*Kangwei Liu,Siyuan Cheng,Bozhong Tian,Xiaozhuan Liang,Yuyang Yin,Meng Han,Ningyu Zhang,Bryan Hooi,Xi Chen,Shumin Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A benchmark for Chinese harmful content detection is introduced, addressing the scarcity of Chinese datasets. It includes expert annotations and a knowledge rule base, and proposes a knowledge-augmented baseline for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing harmful content detection resources are mainly English-focused, leaving Chinese datasets scarce and limited. This work aims to fill this gap.

Method: A professionally annotated benchmark for Chinese content harm detection is created, covering six categories. A knowledge-augmented baseline integrates human-annotated rules and LLM knowledge.

Result: The proposed baseline enables smaller models to match state-of-the-art LLM performance in Chinese harmful content detection.

Conclusion: The benchmark and knowledge-augmented approach provide valuable resources and methods for improving Chinese harmful content detection.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to automated
harmful content detection tasks, assisting moderators in identifying policy
violations and improving the overall efficiency and accuracy of content review.
However, existing resources for harmful content detection are predominantly
focused on English, with Chinese datasets remaining scarce and often limited in
scope. We present a comprehensive, professionally annotated benchmark for
Chinese content harm detection, which covers six representative categories and
is constructed entirely from real-world data. Our annotation process further
yields a knowledge rule base that provides explicit expert knowledge to assist
LLMs in Chinese harmful content detection. In addition, we propose a
knowledge-augmented baseline that integrates both human-annotated knowledge
rules and implicit knowledge from large language models, enabling smaller
models to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs. Code and
data are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/ChineseHarm-bench.

*Yixin Ou,Yujie Luo,Jingsheng Zheng,Lanning Wei,Shuofei Qiao,Jintian Zhang,Da Zheng,Huajun Chen,Ningyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoMind is an adaptive LLM-agent framework for data science, improving on rigid workflows with expert knowledge, strategic search, and dynamic coding. It outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-driven data science agents are limited by inflexible workflows and lack of expert knowledge, hindering performance on complex tasks.

Method: AutoMind introduces a curated expert knowledge base, an agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm, and a self-adaptive coding strategy.

Result: AutoMind outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on automated data science benchmarks, showing effectiveness, efficiency, and high solution quality.

Conclusion: AutoMind represents a robust step toward fully automated data science, addressing limitations of current frameworks.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential in addressing
real-world data science problems. LLM-driven data science agents promise to
automate the entire machine learning pipeline, yet their real-world
effectiveness remains limited. Existing frameworks depend on rigid, pre-defined
workflows and inflexible coding strategies; consequently, they excel only on
relatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical
expertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this
work, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework
that overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated
expert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an
agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores
possible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically
tailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data
science benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance
versus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable
effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting
AutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science.

### [184] [How Well Can Reasoning Models Identify and Recover from Unhelpful Thoughts?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10979)
*Sohee Yang,Sang-Woo Lee,Nora Kassner,Daniela Gottesman,Sebastian Riedel,Mor Geva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Models can identify unhelpful thoughts but struggle to recover from them, especially larger models, impacting reasoning accuracy and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how reasoning models perform self-reevaluation and recover from unhelpful thoughts.

Method: Investigate models' ability to identify and recover from four types of unhelpful thoughts, including irrelevant or misleading ones.

Result: Models identify unhelpful thoughts well but fail to recover, with larger models performing worse. Small models are least distracted by harmful thoughts.

Conclusion: Improvements in self-reevaluation are needed for better reasoning and safer AI systems.

Abstract: Recent reasoning models show the ability to reflect, backtrack, and
self-validate their reasoning, which is crucial in spotting mistakes and
arriving at accurate solutions. A natural question that arises is how
effectively models can perform such self-reevaluation. We tackle this question
by investigating how well reasoning models identify and recover from four types
of unhelpful thoughts: uninformative rambling thoughts, thoughts irrelevant to
the question, thoughts misdirecting the question as a slightly different
question, and thoughts that lead to incorrect answers. We show that models are
effective at identifying most unhelpful thoughts but struggle to recover from
the same thoughts when these are injected into their thinking process, causing
significant performance drops. Models tend to naively continue the line of
reasoning of the injected irrelevant thoughts, which showcases that their
self-reevaluation abilities are far from a general "meta-cognitive" awareness.
Moreover, we observe non/inverse-scaling trends, where larger models struggle
more than smaller ones to recover from short irrelevant thoughts, even when
instructed to reevaluate their reasoning. We demonstrate the implications of
these findings with a jailbreak experiment using irrelevant thought injection,
showing that the smallest models are the least distracted by
harmful-response-triggering thoughts. Overall, our findings call for
improvement in self-reevaluation of reasoning models to develop better
reasoning and safer systems.

### [185] [Leveraging Pre-Trained Models for Multimodal Class-Incremental Learning under Adaptive Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09999)
*Yukun Chen,Zihuan Qiu,Fanman Meng,Hongliang Li,Linfeng Xu,Qingbo Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Multimodal Class-Incremental Learning (MCIL) method for vision, audio, and text, addressing integration and forgetting challenges. It introduces a Multimodal Incremental Feature Extractor (MIFE), an Adaptive Audio-Visual Fusion Module (AAVFM), and a contrastive training loss, validated on three datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MCIL methods focus only on vision and text, leaving gaps in integrating audio and mitigating catastrophic forgetting. This paper aims to bridge these gaps by exploring MCIL across vision, audio, and text modalities.

Method: The method includes: 1) MIFE for incremental fine-tuning of AudioCLIP, 2) AAVFM with masking and dynamic fusion mechanisms, 3) a strategy to enhance text diversity, and 4) a novel contrastive training loss for cross-modal alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments on three multimodal datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness in integrating complementary information and mitigating forgetting.

Conclusion: The proposed MCIL method successfully addresses challenges in multimodal integration and forgetting, validated by new metrics and experiments.

Abstract: Unlike traditional Multimodal Class-Incremental Learning (MCIL) methods that
focus only on vision and text, this paper explores MCIL across vision, audio
and text modalities, addressing challenges in integrating complementary
information and mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To tackle these issues, we
propose an MCIL method based on multimodal pre-trained models. Firstly, a
Multimodal Incremental Feature Extractor (MIFE) based on Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) structure is introduced to achieve effective incremental fine-tuning for
AudioCLIP. Secondly, to enhance feature discriminability and generalization, we
propose an Adaptive Audio-Visual Fusion Module (AAVFM) that includes a masking
threshold mechanism and a dynamic feature fusion mechanism, along with a
strategy to enhance text diversity. Thirdly, a novel multimodal
class-incremental contrastive training loss is proposed to optimize cross-modal
alignment in MCIL. Finally, two MCIL-specific evaluation metrics are introduced
for comprehensive assessment. Extensive experiments on three multimodal
datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.

*Wei Li,Mengcheng Lan,Jiaxing Xu,Yiping Ke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NOCL is a novel framework using node description and node concepts to adapt LLMs for graph tasks, improving generalization and reducing token lengths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MPNNs and self-supervised methods are limited by reliance on labels or fine-tuning, while LLMs struggle with graph-specific challenges like token length and reasoning.

Method: NOCL converts node attributes to structured natural language (node description) and encodes them into compact embeddings (node concept), unifying graph tasks via language-based queries.

Result: NOCL achieves competitive supervised performance and superior zero-shot generalization, reducing token lengths by up to 93.9%.

Conclusion: NOCL bridges the gap between LLMs and graph tasks, offering a scalable and generalizable solution for Graph Foundation Models.

Abstract: Graphs are essential for modeling complex interactions across domains such as
social networks, biology, and recommendation systems. Traditional Graph Neural
Networks, particularly Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), rely heavily on
supervised learning, limiting their generalization and applicability in
label-scarce scenarios. Recent self-supervised approaches still require labeled
fine-tuning, limiting their effectiveness in zero-shot scenarios. Meanwhile,
Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language tasks but face
significant challenges when applied to graphs, including preserving reasoning
abilities, managing extensive token lengths from rich node attributes, and
being limited to textual-attributed graphs (TAGs) and a single level task. To
overcome these limitations, we propose the Node-Oriented Conceptualization LLM
(NOCL), a novel framework that leverages two core techniques: 1) node
description, which converts heterogeneous node attributes into structured
natural language, extending LLM from TAGs to non-TAGs; 2) node concept, which
encodes node descriptions into compact semantic embeddings using pretrained
language models, significantly reducing token lengths by up to 93.9% compared
to directly using node descriptions. Additionally, our NOCL employs graph
representation descriptors to unify graph tasks at various levels into a
shared, language-based query format, paving a new direction for Graph
Foundation Models. Experimental results validate NOCL's competitive supervised
performance relative to traditional MPNNs and hybrid LLM-MPNN methods and
demonstrate superior generalization in zero-shot settings.

*Uijun Jung,Deokho Jang,Sungchul Kim,Jungho Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using deep learning, specifically tandem neural networks (TNNs), for inverse design of SiO2/TiO2 multilayer thin films, addressing the inefficiency of traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional inverse design methods for thin films are time-consuming due to extensive simulations and optimizations. Deep learning offers a faster alternative.

Method: A tandem neural network (TNN) is implemented, combining inverse and forward neural networks using MLP, CNN, or LSTM algorithms. Nine TNN configurations are tested.

Result: The LSTM-LSTM-based TNN achieves the highest accuracy but has the longest training time. The CNN-LSTM-based TNN balances accuracy and speed effectively.

Conclusion: The CNN-LSTM-based TNN is optimal for inverse design of thin films, combining the strengths of CNN and LSTM for efficient and accurate predictions.

Abstract: Optical properties of thin film are greatly influenced by the thickness of
each layer. Accurately predicting these thicknesses and their corresponding
optical properties is important in the optical inverse design of thin films.
However, traditional inverse design methods usually demand extensive numerical
simulations and optimization procedures, which are time-consuming. In this
paper, we utilize deep learning for the inverse design of the transmission
spectra of SiO2/TiO2 multilayer thin films. We implement a tandem neural
network (TNN), which can solve the one-to-many mapping problem that greatly
degrades the performance of deep-learning-based inverse designs. In general,
the TNN has been implemented by a back-to-back connection of an inverse neural
network and a pre-trained forward neural network, both of which have been
implemented based on multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithms. In this paper, we
propose to use not only MLP, but also convolutional neural network (CNN) or
long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms in the configuration of the TNN. We
show that an LSTM-LSTM-based TNN yields the highest accuracy but takes the
longest training time among nine configurations of TNNs. We also find that a
CNN-LSTM-based TNN will be an optimal solution in terms of accuracy and speed
because it could integrate the strengths of the CNN and LSTM algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Omni-DPO improves DPO by adaptively weighting preference pairs based on quality and learning dynamics, outperforming baselines in textual and mathematical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DPO methods treat all preference pairs uniformly, ignoring quality and learning utility, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Omni-DPO introduces a dual-perspective framework weighting samples by inherent quality and model performance during training.

Result: Omni-DPO outperforms baselines, e.g., beating Claude 3 Opus by 6.7 points on Arena-Hard and excelling in mathematical reasoning.

Conclusion: Omni-DPO enhances data utilization and performance, proving effective and robust across tasks.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a cornerstone of
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) due to its simplicity and
efficiency. However, existing DPO-based approaches typically treat all
preference pairs uniformly, ignoring critical variations in their inherent
quality and learning utility, leading to suboptimal data utilization and
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Omni-DPO, a dual-perspective
optimization framework that jointly accounts for (1) the inherent quality of
each preference pair and (2) the model's evolving performance on those pairs.
By adaptively weighting samples according to both data quality and the model's
learning dynamics during training, Omni-DPO enables more effective training
data utilization and achieves better performance. Experimental results on
various models and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and generalization
capabilities of Omni-DPO. On textual understanding tasks, Gemma-2-9b-it
finetuned with Omni-DPO beats the leading LLM, Claude 3 Opus, by a significant
margin of 6.7 points on the Arena-Hard benchmark. On mathematical reasoning
tasks, Omni-DPO consistently outperforms the baseline methods across all
benchmarks, providing strong empirical evidence for the effectiveness and
robustness of our approach. Code and models will be available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Bayesian approach to quantify uncertainty in LLM-based systems, using prompts as textual parameters and a novel MCMC algorithm (MHLP) for inference, improving accuracy and uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack reliable uncertainty quantification, limiting their use in high-stakes domains. Closed-source models and prompt sensitivity further complicate this issue.

Method: Proposes a Bayesian framework treating prompts as textual parameters, using MHLP (Metropolis-Hastings through LLM Proposals) for inference, combining prompt optimization with MCMC.

Result: Empirical results show improved predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification across benchmarks.

Conclusion: The work bridges Bayesian methods with LLMs, enhancing reliability and calibration in LLM-based systems.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly capable of
solving challenging real-world tasks, accurately quantifying their uncertainty
remains a critical open problem, which limits their applicability in
high-stakes domains. This challenge is further compounded by the closed-source,
black-box nature of many state-of-the-art LLMs. Moreover, LLM-based systems can
be highly sensitive to the prompts that bind them together, which often require
significant manual tuning (i.e., prompt engineering). In this work, we address
these challenges by viewing LLM-based systems through a Bayesian lens. We
interpret prompts as textual parameters in a statistical model, allowing us to
use a small training dataset to perform Bayesian inference over these prompts.
This novel perspective enables principled uncertainty quantification over both
the model's textual parameters and its downstream predictions, while also
incorporating prior beliefs about these parameters expressed in free-form text.
To perform Bayesian inference, a difficult problem even for well-studied data
modalities, we introduce Metropolis-Hastings through LLM Proposals (MHLP), a
novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that combines prompt
optimization techniques with standard MCMC methods. MHLP is a turnkey
modification to existing LLM pipelines, including those that rely exclusively
on closed-source models. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method yields
improvements in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on
a range of LLM benchmarks and UQ tasks. More broadly, our work demonstrates a
viable path for incorporating methods from the rich Bayesian literature into
the era of LLMs, paving the way for more reliable and calibrated LLM-based
systems.

### [190] [Optimizing Latent Dimension Allocation in Hierarchical VAEs: Balancing Attenuation and Information Retention for OOD Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10089)
*Dane Williamson,Yangfeng Ji,Matthew Dwyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for optimizing latent dimension allocation in hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs) to improve out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, proving an optimal allocation ratio and showing empirical performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OOD detection is crucial for safety-critical applications, but existing HVAE approaches suffer from arbitrary latent dimension allocation, leading to ineffective representations or posterior collapse.

Method: The authors propose a theoretically grounded framework using information theory to optimize latent dimension allocation in HVAEs, identifying an optimal ratio under a fixed latent budget.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate that tuning the optimal allocation ratio improves OOD detection performance across datasets and architectures, outperforming baseline HVAE configurations.

Conclusion: The framework provides principled guidance for latent structure design in HVAEs, enhancing robustness in OOD detection with deep generative models.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical task in machine learning,
particularly for safety-critical applications where unexpected inputs must be
reliably flagged. While hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs) offer
improved representational capacity over traditional VAEs, their performance is
highly sensitive to how latent dimensions are distributed across layers.
Existing approaches often allocate latent capacity arbitrarily, leading to
ineffective representations or posterior collapse. In this work, we introduce a
theoretically grounded framework for optimizing latent dimension allocation in
HVAEs, drawing on principles from information theory to formalize the trade-off
between information loss and representational attenuation. We prove the
existence of an optimal allocation ratio $r^{\ast}$ under a fixed latent
budget, and empirically show that tuning this ratio consistently improves OOD
detection performance across datasets and architectures. Our approach
outperforms baseline HVAE configurations and provides practical guidance for
principled latent structure design, leading to more robust OOD detection with
deep generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider a kernelized bandit problem with a compact arm set ${X} \subset
\mathbb{R}^d $ and a fixed but unknown reward function $f^*$ with a finite norm
in some Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). We propose a class of
computationally efficient kernelized bandit algorithms, which we call
GP-Generic, based on a novel concept: exploration distributions. This class of
algorithms includes Upper Confidence Bound-based approaches as a special case,
but also allows for a variety of randomized algorithms. With careful choice of
exploration distribution, our proposed generic algorithm realizes a wide range
of concrete algorithms that achieve $\tilde{O}(\gamma_T\sqrt{T})$ regret
bounds, where $\gamma_T$ characterizes the RKHS complexity. This matches known
results for UCB- and Thompson Sampling-based algorithms; we also show that in
practice, randomization can yield better practical results.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a two-phase deep autoencoder system for unsupervised clustering of MNIST digits, combining reconstruction error with KMeans clustering loss for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a scalable and interpretable unsupervised clustering method for image data, specifically MNIST handwritten digits, by leveraging deep learning and clustering techniques.

Method: Uses a two-phase deep autoencoder: phase one trains for minimal yet interpretable image representations, and phase two combines reconstruction error with KMeans clustering loss. Includes batch normalization, dropout, and weight decay for stability.

Result: Achieves superior clustering performance (measured by Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, NMI, ARI) and clear t-SNE visualizations of distinct digit clusters.

Conclusion: The method balances reconstruction accuracy and cluster purity, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for unsupervised image clustering.

Abstract: This research implements an advanced unsupervised clustering system for MNIST
handwritten digits through two-phase deep autoencoder architecture. A deep
neural autoencoder requires a training process during phase one to develop
minimal yet interpretive representations of images by minimizing reconstruction
errors. During the second phase we unify the reconstruction error with a KMeans
clustering loss for learned latent embeddings through a joint distance-based
objective. Our model contains three elements which include batch normalization
combined with dropout and weight decay for achieving generalized and stable
results. The framework achieves superior clustering performance during
extensive tests which used intrinsic measurements including Silhouette Score
and Davies-Bouldin Index coupled with extrinsic metrics NMI and ARI when
processing image features. The research uses t-SNE visualization to present
learned embeddings that show distinct clusters for digits. Our approach reaches
an optimal combination between data reconstruction accuracy and cluster
separation purity when adding the benefit of understandable results and
scalable implementations. The approach creates a dependable base that helps
deploy unsupervised representation learning in different large-scale image
clustering applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A federated multi-task learning method uses cross-client similarity for personalized learning, employing feature anchors and graph-based regularization for efficient communication and collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable personalized learning in federated settings while maintaining communication efficiency and preventing negative collaboration.

Method: Introduces feature anchors for compact representation, shares classification heads, and uses dynamic graph-based regularization with community detection for client collaboration.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in heterogeneous datasets, with superior computation, communication efficiency, and fairness.

Conclusion: The method effectively balances personalization and collaboration, ensuring efficient and fair federated learning.

Abstract: We present a novel federated multi-task learning method that leverages
cross-client similarity to enable personalized learning for each client. To
avoid transmitting the entire model to the parameter server, we propose a
communication-efficient scheme that introduces a feature anchor, a compact
vector representation that summarizes the features learned from the client's
local classes. This feature anchor is shared with the server to account for
local clients' distribution. In addition, the clients share the classification
heads, a lightweight linear layer, and perform a graph-based regularization to
enable collaboration among clients. By modeling collaboration between clients
as a dynamic graph and continuously updating and refining this graph, we can
account for any drift from the clients. To ensure beneficial knowledge transfer
and prevent negative collaboration, we leverage a community detection-based
approach that partitions this dynamic graph into homogeneous communities,
maximizing the sum of task similarities, represented as the graph edges'
weights, within each community. This mechanism restricts collaboration to
highly similar clients within their formed communities, ensuring positive
interaction and preserving personalization. Extensive experiments on two
heterogeneous datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we show that our method exhibits
superior computation and communication efficiency and promotes fairness across
clients.

TL;DR: Proposes Nonnegative Diffusion (NnD), a learned generative model using score-based diffusion to reduce computational costs for simulating complex, nonnegative objects like 3D clouds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simulating complex natural phenomena like clouds is computationally expensive, limiting scalability. NnD aims to reduce these costs while maintaining physical accuracy.

Method: Uses score-based diffusion with annealed Langevin dynamics to enforce non-negativity in iterative scene generation and inference. Trains on high-quality physical simulations.

Result: Generates 3D volumetric clouds consistent with cloud physics, indistinguishable from real clouds by experts.

Conclusion: NnD effectively reduces computational costs for simulating nonnegative objects while preserving physical realism.

Abstract: Most natural objects have inherent complexity and variability. While some
simple objects can be modeled from first principles, many real-world phenomena,
such as cloud formation, require computationally expensive simulations that
limit scalability. This work focuses on a class of physically meaningful,
nonnegative objects that are computationally tractable but costly to simulate.
To dramatically reduce computational costs, we propose nonnegative diffusion
(NnD). This is a learned generative model using score based diffusion. It
adapts annealed Langevin dynamics to enforce, by design, non-negativity
throughout iterative scene generation and analysis (inference). NnD trains on
high-quality physically simulated objects. Once trained, it can be used for
generation and inference. We demonstrate generation of 3D volumetric clouds,
comprising inherently nonnegative microphysical fields. Our generated clouds
are consistent with cloud physics trends. They are effectively not
distinguished as non-physical by expert perception.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph AL methods focus on static datasets and prediction accuracy, ignoring user-centric factors like diversity and fairness in dynamic settings.

Method: Introduces GRAIL, a framework with novel metrics to evaluate AL strategies on sustained effectiveness, diversity, and user burden.

Result: Experiments on dynamic datasets reveal trade-offs between performance and user burden, emphasizing the need for balanced AL strategies.

Conclusion: GRAIL provides a comprehensive evaluation mechanism for graph AL in dynamic environments, highlighting the importance of balancing node importance, diversity, and topology.

Abstract: Graph-based Active Learning (AL) leverages the structure of graphs to
efficiently prioritize label queries, reducing labeling costs and user burden
in applications like health monitoring, human behavior analysis, and sensor
networks. By identifying strategically positioned nodes, graph AL minimizes
data collection demands while maintaining model performance, making it a
valuable tool for dynamic environments. Despite its potential, existing graph
AL methods are often evaluated on static graph datasets and primarily focus on
prediction accuracy, neglecting user-centric considerations such as sampling
diversity, query fairness, and adaptability to dynamic settings. To bridge this
gap, we introduce GRAIL, a novel benchmarking framework designed to evaluate
graph AL strategies in dynamic, real-world environments. GRAIL introduces novel
metrics to assess sustained effectiveness, diversity, and user burden, enabling
a comprehensive evaluation of AL methods under varying conditions. Extensive
experiments on datasets featuring dynamic, real-life human sensor data reveal
trade-offs between prediction performance and user burden, highlighting
limitations in existing AL strategies. GRAIL demonstrates the importance of
balancing node importance, query diversity, and network topology, providing an
evaluation mechanism for graph AL solutions in dynamic environments.

TL;DR: A-CAPELLA, a decentralized algorithm, addresses the no-sensing MMAB problem with unknown arm capacities, achieving logarithmic regret through collaborative hypothesis testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenges of coordination and capacity discovery in decentralized MMAB under severe feedback limitations, where players lack collision information.

Method: Proposes A-CAPELLA, which uses a collaborative hypothesis testing protocol for synchronized successive elimination and capacity estimation via structured collision patterns.

Result: The algorithm achieves logarithmic regret, proving efficient learning in decentralized no-sensing MMAB with unknown arm capacities.

Conclusion: A-CAPELLA successfully generalizes the classical unit-capacity model and provides a provably efficient solution for the no-sensing MMAB problem.

Abstract: We study the decentralized multi-player multi-armed bandits (MMAB) problem
under a no-sensing setting, where each player receives only their own reward
and obtains no information about collisions. Each arm has an unknown capacity,
and if the number of players pulling an arm exceeds its capacity, all players
involved receive zero reward. This setting generalizes the classical
unit-capacity model and introduces new challenges in coordination and capacity
discovery under severe feedback limitations. We propose A-CAPELLA (Algorithm
for Capacity-Aware Parallel Elimination for Learning and Allocation), a
decentralized algorithm that achieves logarithmic regret in this generalized
regime. Our main contribution is a collaborative hypothesis testing protocol
that enables synchronized successive elimination and capacity estimation
through carefully structured collision patterns. This represents a provably
efficient learning result in decentralized no-sensing MMAB with unknown arm
capacities.

*Arnaud Fickinger,Abderrahim Bendahi,Stuart Russell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Offline Domain Randomization (ODR) to bridge the sim-to-real gap by leveraging offline data, formalizes ODR as maximum-likelihood estimation, proves its consistency, derives error bounds, and proposes E-DROPO for improved robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard domain randomization (DR) ignores offline real-world data, limiting its effectiveness in sim-to-real transfer. ODR addresses this gap by utilizing available offline data to fit simulator parameters.

Method: ODR is formalized as maximum-likelihood estimation over a parametric simulator family. The paper proves consistency under mild conditions and derives error bounds. E-DROPO is introduced to enhance robustness.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows ODR's sim-to-real error is tighter than uniform DR. E-DROPO improves randomization and zero-shot transfer performance.

Conclusion: ODR, supported by theoretical guarantees and enhanced by E-DROPO, offers a principled and effective approach for sim-to-real transfer by leveraging offline data.

Abstract: Reinforcement-learning agents often struggle when deployed from simulation to
the real-world. A dominant strategy for reducing the sim-to-real gap is domain
randomization (DR) which trains the policy across many simulators produced by
sampling dynamics parameters, but standard DR ignores offline data already
available from the real system. We study offline domain randomization (ODR),
which first fits a distribution over simulator parameters to an offline
dataset. While a growing body of empirical work reports substantial gains with
algorithms such as DROPO, the theoretical foundations of ODR remain largely
unexplored. In this work, we (i) formalize ODR as a maximum-likelihood
estimation over a parametric simulator family, (ii) prove consistency of this
estimator under mild regularity and identifiability conditions, showing it
converges to the true dynamics as the dataset grows, (iii) derive gap bounds
demonstrating ODRs sim-to-real error is up to an O(M) factor tighter than
uniform DR in the finite-simulator case (and analogous gains in the continuous
setting), and (iv) introduce E-DROPO, a new version of DROPO which adds an
entropy bonus to prevent variance collapse, yielding broader randomization and
more robust zero-shot transfer in practice.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Behavioral cloning (BC) methods trained with supervised learning (SL) are an
effective way to learn policies from human demonstrations in domains like
robotics. Goal-conditioning these policies enables a single generalist policy
to capture diverse behaviors contained within an offline dataset. While
goal-conditioned behavior cloning (GCBC) methods can perform well on
in-distribution training tasks, they do not necessarily generalize zero-shot to
tasks that require conditioning on novel state-goal pairs, i.e. combinatorial
generalization. In part, this limitation can be attributed to a lack of
temporal consistency in the state representation learned by BC; if temporally
related states are encoded to similar latent representations, then the
out-of-distribution gap for novel state-goal pairs would be reduced. Hence,
encouraging this temporal consistency in the representation space should
facilitate combinatorial generalization. Successor representations, which
encode the distribution of future states visited from the current state, nicely
encapsulate this property. However, previous methods for learning successor
representations have relied on contrastive samples, temporal-difference (TD)
learning, or both. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
representation learning objective, $\text{BYOL-}\gamma$ augmented GCBC, which
is not only able to theoretically approximate the successor representation in
the finite MDP case without contrastive samples or TD learning, but also,
results in competitive empirical performance across a suite of challenging
tasks requiring combinatorial generalization.

*Mohammad Taufeeque,Aaron David Tucker,Adam Gleave,Adrià Garriga-Alonso*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes a convolutional RNN trained for Sokoban, revealing mechanisms akin to bidirectional search, with directional activations acting as a value function and specialized kernels forming paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how a model-free reinforcement learning-trained RNN solves Sokoban levels more effectively with increased compute, drawing parallels to classical search methods.

Method: Reverse-engineering the RNN's activations and kernels to identify directional state-action representations and path-forming mechanisms.

Result: The RNN uses directional activations for planning and backtracking, with specialized kernels creating paths, resembling bidirectional search but with unique features like separate box consideration and layered planning.

Conclusion: The RNN's learned mechanisms, though distinct from classical search, are interpretable and leverage test-time compute effectively.

Abstract: We partially reverse-engineer a convolutional recurrent neural network (RNN)
trained to play the puzzle game Sokoban with model-free reinforcement learning.
Prior work found that this network solves more levels with more test-time
compute. Our analysis reveals several mechanisms analogous to components of
classic bidirectional search. For each square, the RNN represents its plan in
the activations of channels associated with specific directions. These
state-action activations are analogous to a value function - their magnitudes
determine when to backtrack and which plan branch survives pruning. Specialized
kernels extend these activations (containing plan and value) forward and
backward to create paths, forming a transition model. The algorithm is also
unlike classical search in some ways. State representation is not unified;
instead, the network considers each box separately. Each layer has its own plan
representation and value function, increasing search depth. Far from being
inscrutable, the mechanisms leveraging test-time compute learned in this
network by model-free training can be understood in familiar terms.

*Andrei V. Konstantinov,Vlada A. Efremenko,Lev V. Utkin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces three novel survival models (iSurvM, iSurvQ, iSurvJ) combining imprecise probability theory and attention mechanisms to handle censored data, outperforming traditional methods like the Beran estimator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional survival analysis methods struggle with complex data structures and heavy censoring, prompting the need for more robust, nonparametric solutions.

Method: The models use interval-valued probability distributions for censored data, kernel-based Nadaraya-Watson regression with attention weights, and three decision strategies for training.

Result: Experiments show the proposed models, especially iSurvJ, outperform the Beran estimator in accuracy and computational complexity.

Conclusion: The models offer a promising nonparametric approach for survival analysis, with publicly available code for implementation.

Abstract: Survival analysis is a fundamental tool for modeling time-to-event data in
healthcare, engineering, and finance, where censored observations pose
significant challenges. While traditional methods like the Beran estimator
offer nonparametric solutions, they often struggle with the complex data
structures and heavy censoring. This paper introduces three novel survival
models, iSurvM (the imprecise Survival model based on Mean likelihood
functions), iSurvQ (the imprecise Survival model based on the Quantiles of
likelihood functions), and iSurvJ (the imprecise Survival model based on the
Joint learning), that combine imprecise probability theory with attention
mechanisms to handle censored data without parametric assumptions. The first
idea behind the models is to represent censored observations by interval-valued
probability distributions for each instance over time intervals between events
moments. The second idea is to employ the kernel-based Nadaraya-Watson
regression with trainable attention weights for computing the imprecise
probability distribution over time intervals for the entire dataset. The third
idea is to consider three decision strategies for training, which correspond to
the proposed three models. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets
demonstrate that the proposed models, especially iSurvJ, consistently
outperform the Beran estimator from the accuracy and computational complexity
points of view. Codes implementing the proposed models are publicly available.

*Yaowen Zhang,Libera Fresiello,Peter H. Veltink,Dirk W. Donker,Ying Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel physiological-model-based neural network (PMB-NN) framework is introduced for heart rate (HR) estimation using oxygen uptake (VO2) data, achieving high accuracy and outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of heart failure (HF) is crucial, and individualized HR monitoring can serve as an early indicator. Current methods lack efficiency and interpretability.

Method: The PMB-NN framework integrates physiological constraints from a simplified human movement model into neural network training, using VO2 data from activities like resting, cycling, and running.

Result: The model achieved a median R² score of 0.8 and RMSE of 8.3 bpm, matching benchmark neural networks and outperforming traditional physiological models (p=0.002).

Conclusion: The PMB-NN enables personalized HR estimation, paving the way for real-time cardiac monitoring during daily activities.

Abstract: Heart failure (HF) poses a significant global health challenge, with early
detection offering opportunities for improved outcomes. Abnormalities in heart
rate (HR), particularly during daily activities, may serve as early indicators
of HF risk. However, existing HR monitoring tools for HF detection are limited
by their reliability on population-based averages. The estimation of
individualized HR serves as a dynamic digital twin, enabling precise tracking
of cardiac health biomarkers. Current HR estimation methods, categorized into
physiologically-driven and purely data-driven models, struggle with efficiency
and interpretability. This study introduces a novel physiological-model-based
neural network (PMB-NN) framework for HR estimation based on oxygen uptake
(VO2) data during daily physical activities. The framework was trained and
tested on individual datasets from 12 participants engaged in activities
including resting, cycling, and running. By embedding physiological
constraints, which were derived from our proposed simplified human movement
physiological model (PM), into the neural network training process, the PMB-NN
model adheres to human physiological principles while achieving high estimation
accuracy, with a median R$^2$ score of 0.8 and an RMSE of 8.3 bpm. Comparative
statistical analysis demonstrates that the PMB-NN achieves performance on par
with the benchmark neural network model while significantly outperforming
traditional physiological model (p=0.002). In addition, our PMB-NN is adept at
identifying personalized parameters of the PM, enabling the PM to generate
reasonable HR estimation. The proposed framework with a precise VO2 estimation
system derived from body movements enables the future possibilities of
personalized and real-time cardiac monitoring during daily life physical
activities.

TL;DR: Hierarchical hyperbolic embeddings improve out-of-distribution recognition, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance discrimination between in- and out-of-distribution samples in deep learning.

Method: Introduces Balanced Hyperbolic Learning, optimizing hierarchical distortion and balance, and generalizes out-of-distribution scoring functions for hyperbolic prototypes.

Result: Outperforms 13 datasets and scoring functions, beating state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Hierarchical hyperbolic embeddings are superior for out-of-distribution recognition and enable hierarchical generalization.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution recognition forms an important and well-studied problem
in deep learning, with the goal to filter out samples that do not belong to the
distribution on which a network has been trained. The conclusion of this paper
is simple: a good hierarchical hyperbolic embedding is preferred for
discriminating in- and out-of-distribution samples. We introduce Balanced
Hyperbolic Learning. We outline a hyperbolic class embedding algorithm that
jointly optimizes for hierarchical distortion and balancing between shallow and
wide subhierarchies. We then use the class embeddings as hyperbolic prototypes
for classification on in-distribution data. We outline how to generalize
existing out-of-distribution scoring functions to operate with hyperbolic
prototypes. Empirical evaluations across 13 datasets and 13 scoring functions
show that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform existing out-of-distribution
approaches when trained on the same data with the same backbones. We also show
that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform other hyperbolic approaches, beat
state-of-the-art contrastive methods, and natively enable hierarchical
out-of-distribution generalization.

*Minoh Jeong,Seonho Kim,Alfred Hero*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VCL introduces a probabilistic framework for contrastive learning, addressing uncertainty quantification while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing contrastive learning methods lack uncertainty quantification, limiting their reliability.

Method: VCL maximizes ELBO using InfoNCE loss as reconstruction and adds KL divergence to a uniform prior, modeling embeddings as projected normal distributions.

Result: VCL mitigates dimensional collapse, improves mutual information, matches deterministic baselines in accuracy, and provides uncertainty estimates.

Conclusion: VCL provides a probabilistic foundation for contrastive learning, enhancing its utility with uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Deterministic embeddings learned by contrastive learning (CL) methods such as
SimCLR and SupCon achieve state-of-the-art performance but lack a principled
mechanism for uncertainty quantification. We propose Variational Contrastive
Learning (VCL), a decoder-free framework that maximizes the evidence lower
bound (ELBO) by interpreting the InfoNCE loss as a surrogate reconstruction
term and adding a KL divergence regularizer to a uniform prior on the unit
hypersphere. We model the approximate posterior $q_\theta(z|x)$ as a projected
normal distribution, enabling the sampling of probabilistic embeddings. Our two
instantiations--VSimCLR and VSupCon--replace deterministic embeddings with
samples from $q_\theta(z|x)$ and incorporate a normalized KL term into the
loss. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VCL mitigates
dimensional collapse, enhances mutual information with class labels, and
matches or outperforms deterministic baselines in classification accuracy, all
the while providing meaningful uncertainty estimates through the posterior
model. VCL thus equips contrastive learning with a probabilistic foundation,
serving as a new basis for contrastive approaches.

and evaluation metrics, illustrative benchmark models, online tutorial code, a
community discussion board, and public leaderboard for submissions. To promote
accessibility and participation the competition features a Standard track that
emphasises algorithmic innovation, as well as an Extended track that is
expected to reward larger-scale computing, accelerating progress toward a
non-invasive brain-computer interface for speech.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address poor sample efficiency in deep off-policy actor-critic algorithms, especially in sparse-reward settings.

Method: Proposes WBSAC, using Wasserstein barycenter of pessimistic (for TD learning) and optimistic (for exploration) policies, adjusting exploration dynamically.

Result: WBSAC outperforms state-of-the-art off-policy actor-critic algorithms in MuJoCo tasks.

Conclusion: WBSAC offers a principled exploration strategy, enhancing sample efficiency in continuous control.

Abstract: Deep off-policy actor-critic algorithms have emerged as the leading framework
for reinforcement learning in continuous control domains. However, most of
these algorithms suffer from poor sample efficiency, especially in environments
with sparse rewards. In this paper, we take a step towards addressing this
issue by providing a principled directed exploration strategy. We propose
Wasserstein Barycenter Soft Actor-Critic (WBSAC) algorithm, which benefits from
a pessimistic actor for temporal difference learning and an optimistic actor to
promote exploration. This is achieved by using the Wasserstein barycenter of
the pessimistic and optimistic policies as the exploration policy and adjusting
the degree of exploration throughout the learning process. We compare WBSAC
with state-of-the-art off-policy actor-critic algorithms and show that WBSAC is
more sample-efficient on MuJoCo continuous control tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reveals a geometric regularity in diffusion-based generative models, showing sampling trajectories lie in low-dimensional subspaces and share a consistent shape. A dynamic programming-based scheme improves sampling efficiency with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the deterministic sampling dynamics in diffusion-based generative models and leverage their geometric properties for improved performance.

Method: Analyzes sampling trajectories, characterizes their properties under kernel-estimated data modeling, and proposes a dynamic programming-based time schedule alignment.

Result: Trajectories exhibit low-dimensional, consistent shapes. The proposed scheme enhances image generation, especially with few function evaluations.

Conclusion: The discovered trajectory regularity can be practically applied to improve sampling efficiency in diffusion models with minimal computational cost.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models employ stochastic differential equations
(SDEs) and their equivalent probability flow ordinary differential equations
(ODEs) to establish a smooth transformation between complex high-dimensional
data distributions and tractable prior distributions. In this paper, we reveal
a striking geometric regularity in the deterministic sampling dynamics: each
simulated sampling trajectory lies within an extremely low-dimensional
subspace, and all trajectories exhibit an almost identical ''boomerang'' shape,
regardless of the model architecture, applied conditions, or generated content.
We characterize several intriguing properties of these trajectories,
particularly under closed-form solutions based on kernel-estimated data
modeling. We also demonstrate a practical application of the discovered
trajectory regularity by proposing a dynamic programming-based scheme to better
align the sampling time schedule with the underlying trajectory structure. This
simple strategy requires minimal modification to existing ODE-based numerical
solvers, incurs negligible computational overhead, and achieves superior image
generation performance, especially in regions with only $5 \sim 10$ function
evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Specialized equivariant architectures limit the scalability and efficiency of diffusion models for 3D molecule generation.

Method: The approach learns a sample-dependent SO(3) transformation to align molecules in a latent space and trains a non-equivariant diffusion model on these aligned representations.

Result: The method outperforms non-equivariant models, matches state-of-the-art equivariant models in sample quality, and improves training/sampling efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed relaxed equivariance approach offers a scalable and efficient alternative to traditional equivariant diffusion models for 3D molecule generation.

Abstract: Equivariant diffusion models have achieved impressive performance in 3D
molecule generation. These models incorporate Euclidean symmetries of 3D
molecules by utilizing an SE(3)-equivariant denoising network. However,
specialized equivariant architectures limit the scalability and efficiency of
diffusion models. In this paper, we propose an approach that relaxes such
equivariance constraints. Specifically, our approach learns a sample-dependent
SO(3) transformation for each molecule to construct an aligned latent space. A
non-equivariant diffusion model is then trained over the aligned
representations. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs
significantly better than previously reported non-equivariant models. It yields
sample quality comparable to state-of-the-art equivariant diffusion models and
offers improved training and sampling efficiency. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DynaSubVAE is a framework for dynamic subgrouping and OOD detection, adapting to emerging data patterns for better accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the oversight of underrepresented subpopulations in models, which leads to harmful predictions, by dynamically adapting to new patterns.

Method: Uses a Dynamic Subgrouping Variational Autoencoder with non-parametric clustering to update latent structures and detect OOD samples.

Result: Achieves competitive performance in OOD detection, especially in class-OOD scenarios, and outperforms standalone clustering methods.

Conclusion: DynaSubVAE effectively captures evolving data trends, improving model adaptability and accuracy for underrepresented groups.

Abstract: Real-world observational data often contain existing or emerging
heterogeneous subpopulations that deviate from global patterns. The majority of
models tend to overlook these underrepresented groups, leading to inaccurate or
even harmful predictions. Existing solutions often rely on detecting these
samples as Out-of-domain (OOD) rather than adapting the model to new emerging
patterns. We introduce DynaSubVAE, a Dynamic Subgrouping Variational
Autoencoder framework that jointly performs representation learning and
adaptive OOD detection. Unlike conventional approaches, DynaSubVAE evolves with
the data by dynamically updating its latent structure to capture new trends. It
leverages a novel non-parametric clustering mechanism, inspired by Gaussian
Mixture Models, to discover and model latent subgroups based on embedding
similarity. Extensive experiments show that DynaSubVAE achieves competitive
performance in both near-OOD and far-OOD detection, and excels in class-OOD
scenarios where an entire class is missing during training. We further
illustrate that our dynamic subgrouping mechanism outperforms standalone
clustering methods such as GMM and KMeans++ in terms of both OOD accuracy and
regret precision.

Abstract: To address the enormous size of Large Language Models (LLMs), model

especially on edge devices. In this work, we focus on layer-wise post-training
quantization and pruning. Drawing connections between activation-aware weight
pruning and sparse approximation problems, and motivated by the success of
Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT), we propose a unified method for
Activation-aware Weight pruning and quantization via Projected gradient descent

TL;DR: The study explores the relationship between ECG and PCG signals, using machine learning to reconstruct one from the other, finding nonlinear models like LSTM perform best, especially for ECG from PCG. Challenges arise with exercise and cross-subject variability, but envelope-based modeling improves generalizability. Clinically relevant ECG biomarkers can be estimated from PCG.

Motivation: To understand the distinct and overlapping information in ECG and PCG signals and their potential for mutual reconstruction and biomarker extraction under varying conditions.

Method: Employed linear and nonlinear machine learning models, including non-causal LSTM, on the EPHNOGRAM dataset of simultaneous ECG-PCG recordings during rest and exercise. Analyzed causality, physiological state, and cross-subject variability.

Result: Nonlinear models, especially non-causal LSTM, excelled in reconstruction, with ECG from PCG being easier. Exercise and cross-subject scenarios posed challenges, but envelope-based modeling improved generalizability. ECG biomarkers were estimated from PCG.

Conclusion: The study enhances understanding of ECG-PCG relationships, with implications for multimodal cardiac monitoring technologies.

Abstract: Simultaneous electrocardiography (ECG) and phonocardiogram (PCG) provide a
comprehensive, multimodal perspective on cardiac function by capturing the
heart's electrical and mechanical activities, respectively. However, the
distinct and overlapping information content of these signals, as well as their
potential for mutual reconstruction and biomarker extraction, remains
incompletely understood, especially under varying physiological conditions and
across individuals.
  In this study, we systematically investigate the common and exclusive
characteristics of ECG and PCG using the EPHNOGRAM dataset of simultaneous
ECG-PCG recordings during rest and exercise. We employ a suite of linear and
nonlinear machine learning models, including non-causal LSTM networks, to
reconstruct each modality from the other and analyze the influence of
causality, physiological state, and cross-subject variability. Our results
demonstrate that nonlinear models, particularly non-causal LSTM, provide
superior reconstruction performance, with reconstructing ECG from PCG proving
more tractable than the reverse. Exercise and cross-subject scenarios present
significant challenges, but envelope-based modeling that utilizes instantaneous
amplitude features substantially improves cross-subject generalizability for
cross-modal learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that clinically relevant ECG
biomarkers, such as fiducial points and QT intervals, can be estimated from PCG
in cross-subject settings.
  These findings advance our understanding of the relationship between
electromechanical cardiac modalities, in terms of both waveform characteristics
and the timing of cardiac events, with potential applications in novel
multimodal cardiac monitoring technologies.

*Chen-Chia Chang,Wan-Hsuan Lin,Yikang Shen,Yiran Chen,Xin Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LaMAGIC2 introduces a succinct float-input canonical formulation (SFCI) for analog topology generation, improving efficiency and precision over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating analog topology design is critical due to manual efforts in modern applications, but existing methods suffer from inefficiency and low precision.

Method: LaMAGIC2 uses SFCI to reduce token length complexity to O(|V|) and enhance numeric precision sensitivity.

Result: LaMAGIC2 achieves 34% higher success rates under tight tolerances and 10X lower MSEs, with improved transferability.

Conclusion: LaMAGIC2 is a robust framework for analog topology generation, outperforming prior methods.

Abstract: Automation of analog topology design is crucial due to customized
requirements of modern applications with heavily manual engineering efforts.
The state-of-the-art work applies a sequence-to-sequence approach and
supervised finetuning on language models to generate topologies given user
specifications. However, its circuit formulation is inefficient due to O(|V |2)
token length and suffers from low precision sensitivity to numeric inputs. In
this work, we introduce LaMAGIC2, a succinct float-input canonical formulation
with identifier (SFCI) for language model-based analog topology generation.
SFCI addresses these challenges by improving component-type recognition through
identifier-based representations, reducing token length complexity to O(|V |),
and enhancing numeric precision sensitivity for better performance under tight
tolerances. Our experiments demonstrate that LaMAGIC2 achieves 34% higher
success rates under a tight tolerance of 0.01 and 10X lower MSEs compared to a
prior method. LaMAGIC2 also exhibits better transferability for circuits with
more vertices with up to 58.5% improvement. These advancements establish
LaMAGIC2 as a robust framework for analog topology generation.

*Yuji Kawamata,Kaoru Kamijo,Maki Kihira,Akihiro Toyoda,Tomoru Nakayama,Akira Imakura,Tetsuya Sakurai,Yukihiko Okada*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DC-Clustering, a federated clustering method for complex data partitioning, ensuring privacy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated clustering methods are limited to simple data splits, failing to address complex distributed structures.

Method: Proposes DC-Clustering, sharing intermediate representations for privacy, supporting k-means/spectral clustering with one communication round.

Result: Experiments show DC-Clustering matches centralized clustering performance.

Conclusion: DC-Clustering fills a gap in FL research, offering privacy, efficiency, and flexibility for sensitive domains.

Abstract: In recent years, the growing need to leverage sensitive data across
institutions has led to increased attention on federated learning (FL), a
decentralized machine learning paradigm that enables model training without
sharing raw data. However, existing FL-based clustering methods, known as
federated clustering, typically assume simple data partitioning scenarios such
as horizontal or vertical splits, and cannot handle more complex distributed
structures. This study proposes data collaboration clustering (DC-Clustering),
a novel federated clustering method that supports clustering over complex data
partitioning scenarios where horizontal and vertical splits coexist. In
DC-Clustering, each institution shares only intermediate representations
instead of raw data, ensuring privacy preservation while enabling collaborative
clustering. The method allows flexible selection between k-means and spectral
clustering, and achieves final results with a single round of communication
with the central server. We conducted extensive experiments using synthetic and
open benchmark datasets. The results show that our method achieves clustering
performance comparable to centralized clustering where all data are pooled.
DC-Clustering addresses an important gap in current FL research by enabling
effective knowledge discovery from distributed heterogeneous data. Its
practical properties -- privacy preservation, communication efficiency, and
flexibility -- make it a promising tool for privacy-sensitive domains such as
healthcare and finance.

### [216] [Meta-learning Representations for Learning from Multiple Annotators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10259)
*Atsutoshi Kumagai,Tomoharu Iwata,Taishi Nishiyama,Yasutoshi Ida,Yasuhiro Fujiwara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A meta-learning method for learning from noisy annotators by leveraging related tasks and embedding examples into a latent space, improving classifier accuracy with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Labels from multiple annotators (e.g., crowdsourcing) are noisy due to varying skills/biases. Existing methods need large datasets, which may be unavailable.

Method: Embeds examples into a latent space using a neural network, estimates annotators' abilities, and meta-learns the network for better test performance via EM algorithm.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on real-world datasets with synthetic noise and crowdsourcing data.

Conclusion: The method efficiently handles noisy labels and limited data by meta-learning and latent space modeling.

Abstract: We propose a meta-learning method for learning from multiple noisy
annotators. In many applications such as crowdsourcing services, labels for
supervised learning are given by multiple annotators. Since the annotators have
different skills or biases, given labels can be noisy. To learn accurate
classifiers, existing methods require many noisy annotated data. However,
sufficient data might be unavailable in practice. To overcome the lack of data,
the proposed method uses labeled data obtained in different but related tasks.
The proposed method embeds each example in tasks to a latent space by using a
neural network and constructs a probabilistic model for learning a
task-specific classifier while estimating annotators' abilities on the latent
space. This neural network is meta-learned to improve the expected test
classification performance when the classifier is adapted to a given small
amount of annotated data. This classifier adaptation is performed by maximizing
the posterior probability via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.
Since each step in the EM algorithm is easily computed as a closed-form and is
differentiable, the proposed method can efficiently backpropagate the loss
through the EM algorithm to meta-learn the neural network. We show the
effectiveness of our method with real-world datasets with synthetic noise and
real-world crowdsourcing datasets.

*Ryota Ueda,Takami Sato,Ken Kobayashi,Kazuhide Nakata*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SDP relaxation for DNN verification faces interior-point vanishing, losing strict feasibility in deep networks. Five solutions are proposed, solving 88% of previously unsolvable problems. Traditional ReLU constraints are found harmful.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the critical limitation of SDP relaxation in deep neural networks, where strict feasibility is lost as depth increases, hindering verification.

Method: Theoretical and empirical analysis of interior-point vanishing, followed by designing five solutions to enhance feasibility conditions.

Result: Proposed methods solve 88% of previously unsolvable problems (41% of total). Traditional ReLU constraints are identified as harmful.

Conclusion: Provides insights into SDP-based DNN verification challenges and practical solutions for deeper networks, advancing reliable and secure DNN systems.

Abstract: Semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation has emerged as a promising approach
for neural network verification, offering tighter bounds than other convex
relaxation methods for deep neural networks (DNNs) with ReLU activations.
However, we identify a critical limitation in the SDP relaxation when applied
to deep networks: interior-point vanishing, which leads to the loss of strict
feasibility -- a crucial condition for the numerical stability and optimality
of SDP. Through rigorous theoretical and empirical analysis, we demonstrate
that as the depth of DNNs increases, the strict feasibility is likely to be
lost, creating a fundamental barrier to scaling SDP-based verification. To
address the interior-point vanishing, we design and investigate five solutions
to enhance the feasibility conditions of the verification problem. Our methods
can successfully solve 88% of the problems that could not be solved by existing
methods, accounting for 41% of the total. Our analysis also reveals that the
valid constraints for the lower and upper bounds for each ReLU unit are
traditionally inherited from prior work without solid reasons, but are actually
not only unbeneficial but also even harmful to the problem's feasibility. This
work provides valuable insights into the fundamental challenges of SDP-based
DNN verification and offers practical solutions to improve its applicability to
deeper neural networks, contributing to the development of more reliable and
secure systems with DNNs.

*Jiajin Liu,Dongzhe Fan,Jiacheng Shen,Chuanhao Ji,Daochen Zha,Qiaoyu Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Graph-MLLM, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal graph learning paradigms, highlighting the benefits of integrating visual and textual attributes and fine-tuning MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal graph learning methods lack a unified benchmark, making it unclear which approaches perform best. The paper aims to address this gap.

Method: The authors evaluate three paradigms (MLLM-as-Encoder, Aligner, Predictor) across six datasets, focusing on multimodal feature fusion and fine-tuning.

Result: Jointly using visual and textual attributes improves performance, and fine-tuning MLLMs achieves state-of-the-art results without explicit graph structure.

Conclusion: Graph-MLLM provides a fair evaluation framework and encourages further research in multimodal graph learning.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in representing and understanding diverse modalities. However,
they typically focus on modality alignment in a pairwise manner while
overlooking structural relationships across data points. Integrating
multimodality with structured graph information (i.e., multimodal graphs, MMGs)
is essential for real-world applications such as social networks, healthcare,
and recommendation systems. Existing MMG learning methods fall into three
paradigms based on how they leverage MLLMs: Encoder, Aligner, and Predictor.
MLLM-as-Encoder focuses on enhancing graph neural networks (GNNs) via
multimodal feature fusion; MLLM-as-Aligner aligns multimodal attributes in
language or hidden space to enable LLM-based graph reasoning; MLLM-as-Predictor
treats MLLMs as standalone reasoners with in-context learning or fine-tuning.
Despite their advances, the MMG field lacks a unified benchmark to fairly
evaluate across these approaches, making it unclear what progress has been
made. To bridge this gap, we present Graph-MLLM, a comprehensive benchmark for
multimodal graph learning by systematically evaluating these three paradigms
across six datasets with different domains. Through extensive experiments, we
observe that jointly considering the visual and textual attributes of the nodes
benefits graph learning, even when using pre-trained text-to-image alignment
models (e.g., CLIP) as encoders. We also find that converting visual attributes
into textual descriptions further improves performance compared to directly
using visual inputs. Moreover, we observe that fine-tuning MLLMs on specific
MMGs can achieve state-of-the-art results in most scenarios, even without
explicit graph structure information. We hope that our open-sourced library
will facilitate rapid, equitable evaluation and inspire further innovative
research in this field.

*Moïse Blanchard,Vineet Goyal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Col-UCB, an algorithm for minimizing collaborative regret in grouped multi-armed bandits by dynamically coordinating exploration across groups with overlapping action sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the imbalance in exploration costs between groups in multi-armed bandit settings, ensuring fair and efficient collaboration.

Method: Proposes the Col-UCB algorithm, which dynamically coordinates exploration across groups sharing reward observations.

Result: Col-UCB achieves optimal minimax and instance-dependent collaborative regret bounds, adapting to shared action set structures.

Conclusion: Collaboration in grouped bandits can significantly reduce regret when action sets overlap, with Col-UCB providing a balanced solution.

Abstract: We study the impact of sharing exploration in multi-armed bandits in a
grouped setting where a set of groups have overlapping feasible action sets
[Baek and Farias '24]. In this grouped bandit setting, groups share reward
observations, and the objective is to minimize the collaborative regret,
defined as the maximum regret across groups. This naturally captures
applications in which one aims to balance the exploration burden between groups
or populations -- it is known that standard algorithms can lead to
significantly imbalanced exploration cost between groups. We address this
problem by introducing an algorithm Col-UCB that dynamically coordinates
exploration across groups. We show that Col-UCB achieves both optimal minimax
and instance-dependent collaborative regret up to logarithmic factors. These
bounds are adaptive to the structure of shared action sets between groups,
providing insights into when collaboration yields significant benefits over
each group learning their best action independently.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Meta-learning improves sockpuppet detection on Wikipedia by adapting to author-specific behaviors, outperforming pre-trained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting malicious sockpuppets is vital for reliable information and preventing disinformation, but existing methods lack adaptability to specific groups.

Method: Proposes meta-learning to train models across multiple tasks for rapid adaptation to new sockpuppet-group behaviors.

Result: Meta-learning significantly enhances prediction precision compared to pre-trained models.

Conclusion: The approach advances sockpuppetry detection and includes a new dataset for future research.

Abstract: Malicious sockpuppet detection on Wikipedia is critical to preserving access
to reliable information on the internet and preventing the spread of
disinformation. Prior machine learning approaches rely on stylistic and
meta-data features, but do not prioritise adaptability to author-specific
behaviours. As a result, they struggle to effectively model the behaviour of
specific sockpuppet-groups, especially when text data is limited. To address
this, we propose the application of meta-learning, a machine learning technique
designed to improve performance in data-scarce settings by training models
across multiple tasks. Meta-learning optimises a model for rapid adaptation to
the writing style of a new sockpuppet-group. Our results show that
meta-learning significantly enhances the precision of predictions compared to
pre-trained models, marking an advancement in combating sockpuppetry on open
editing platforms. We release a new dataset of sockpuppet investigations to
foster future research in both sockpuppetry and meta-learning fields.

*Paul Janson,Benjamin Therien,Quentin Anthony,Xiaolong Huang,Abhinav Moudgil,Eugene Belilovsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PyLO is a PyTorch-based library designed to make learned optimizers accessible, offering speedups and integration with existing tools like learning rate schedules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between advanced learned optimizers (like VeLO) and the broader community, addressing reliance on JAX and lack of user-friendly packages.

Method: Developed PyLO, a CUDA-accelerated library for applying learned optimizers, tested on real-world large-scale tasks like ViT B/16 training.

Result: Achieved significant speedups (39.36 to 205.59 samples/sec) and demonstrated benefits of combining learned optimizers with existing tools.

Conclusion: PyLO successfully democratizes learned optimizers, enhancing practicality and performance in real-world applications.

Abstract: Learned optimizers have been an active research topic over the past decade,
with increasing progress toward practical, general-purpose optimizers that can
serve as drop-in replacements for widely used methods like Adam. However,
recent advances -- such as VeLO, which was meta-trained for 4000 TPU-months --
remain largely inaccessible to the broader community, in part due to their
reliance on JAX and the absence of user-friendly packages for applying the
optimizers after meta-training. To address this gap, we introduce PyLO, a
PyTorch-based library that brings learned optimizers to the broader machine
learning community through familiar, widely adopted workflows. Unlike prior
work focused on synthetic or convex tasks, our emphasis is on applying learned
optimization to real-world large-scale pre-training tasks. Our release includes
a CUDA-accelerated version of the small_fc_lopt learned optimizer architecture
from (Metz et al., 2022a), delivering substantial speedups -- from 39.36 to
205.59 samples/sec throughput for training ViT B/16 with batch size 32. PyLO
also allows us to easily combine learned optimizers with existing optimization
tools such as learning rate schedules and weight decay. When doing so, we find
that learned optimizers can substantially benefit. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AQI data from sparse sensors fails to reflect local reality, especially in developing countries.

Method: Uses Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on the AirDelhi dataset to predict AQI at a fine-grained level.

Result: Achieves a 71.654 MSE reduction (79% improvement) over existing methods, even for unseen locations. Discovers repetitive short-term AQI patterns and changing spatial relations.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses the gap in local AQI representation and provides new insights, with code available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Air pollution has become a significant health risk in developing countries.
While governments routinely publish air-quality index (AQI) data to track
pollution, these values fail to capture the local reality, as sensors are often
very sparse. In this paper, we address this gap by predicting AQI in 1 km^2
neighborhoods, using the example of AirDelhi dataset. Using Spatio-temporal
GNNs we surpass existing works by 71.654 MSE a 79% reduction, even on unseen
coordinates. New insights about AQI such as the existence of strong repetitive
short-term patterns and changing spatial relations are also discovered. The
code is available on GitHub.

TL;DR: The paper formalizes Learning from Language Feedback (LLF), introduces transfer eluder dimension to measure problem complexity, and presents HELiX, a no-regret algorithm for LLF with empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a principled framework for learning from language feedback, addressing the lack of formalization in this emerging area driven by LLM agents.

Method: Introduces transfer eluder dimension to quantify LLF complexity and develops HELiX, a no-regret algorithm for interactive learning from language feedback.

Result: Demonstrates cases where language feedback accelerates learning exponentially compared to reward-based methods and validates HELiX empirically.

Conclusion: Marks a step toward principled interactive learning from language feedback, with HELiX showing promise even when LLM prompting fails.

Abstract: Interactively learning from observation and language feedback is an
increasingly studied area driven by the emergence of large language model (LLM)
agents. While impressive empirical demonstrations have been shown, so far a
principled framing of these decision problems remains lacking. In this paper,
we formalize the Learning from Language Feedback (LLF) problem, assert
sufficient assumptions to enable learning despite latent rewards, and introduce
$\textit{transfer eluder dimension}$ as a complexity measure to characterize
the hardness of LLF problems. We show that transfer eluder dimension captures
the intuition that information in the feedback changes the learning complexity
of the LLF problem. We demonstrate cases where learning from rich language
feedback can be exponentially faster than learning from reward. We develop a
no-regret algorithm, called $\texttt{HELiX}$, that provably solves LLF problems
through sequential interactions, with performance guarantees that scale with
the transfer eluder dimension of the problem. Across several empirical domains,
we show that $\texttt{HELiX}$ performs well even when repeatedly prompting LLMs
does not work reliably. Our contributions mark a first step towards designing
principled interactive learning algorithms from generic language feedback.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A wavelet-based approach for analyzing physiological signals addresses noise and non-stationarity, introducing pretrained models for EMG and ECG and a multi-modal framework integrating EEG, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physiological signals are often corrupted by noise and exhibit non-stationarity, making traditional methods ineffective.

Method: A wavelet-based technique captures multi-scale time-frequency features, with pretrained models for EMG and ECG and a multi-modal framework integrating EEG.

Result: Superior performance in downstream tasks and multi-modal applications, addressing noise, variability, and device mismatch.

Conclusion: The approach advances physiological signal processing, with potential impacts on health monitoring and diagnostics.

Abstract: Physiological signals are often corrupted by motion artifacts, baseline
drift, and other low-SNR disturbances, which pose significant challenges for
analysis. Additionally, these signals exhibit strong non-stationarity, with
sharp peaks and abrupt changes that evolve continuously, making them difficult
to represent using traditional time-domain or filtering methods. To address
these issues, a novel wavelet-based approach for physiological signal analysis
is presented, aiming to capture multi-scale time-frequency features in various
physiological signals. Leveraging this technique, two large-scale pretrained
models specific to EMG and ECG are introduced for the first time, achieving
superior performance and setting new baselines in downstream tasks.
Additionally, a unified multi-modal framework is constructed by integrating
pretrained EEG model, where each modality is guided through its dedicated
branch and fused via learnable weighted fusion. This design effectively
addresses challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio, high inter-subject
variability, and device mismatch, outperforming existing methods on multi-modal
tasks. The proposed wavelet-based architecture lays a solid foundation for
analysis of diverse physiological signals, while the multi-modal design points
to next-generation physiological signal processing with potential impact on
wearable health monitoring, clinical diagnostics, and broader biomedical
applications.

*Binyao Guo,Zihan Lin,QiZhi He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HANO, a neural operator framework, predicts path-dependent material responses without hidden states, outperforming baselines in accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model irreversible material responses from observable data, overcoming self-consistency and hidden state issues in RNNs.

Method: Develops HANO, an autoregressive Fourier-based neural operator with hierarchical self-attention for multiscale feature extraction.

Result: HANO excels in predictive accuracy, generalization, and robustness under complex conditions like noisy data and irregular sampling.

Conclusion: HANO is an effective data-driven surrogate for inelastic materials, suitable for integration with classical solvers.

Abstract: This study presents an end-to-end learning framework for data-driven modeling
of path-dependent inelastic materials using neural operators. The framework is
built on the premise that irreversible evolution of material responses,
governed by hidden dynamics, can be inferred from observable data.
  We develop the History-Aware Neural Operator (HANO), an autoregressive model
that predicts path-dependent material responses from short segments of recent
strain-stress history without relying on hidden state variables, thereby
overcoming self-consistency issues commonly encountered in recurrent neural
network (RNN)-based models. Built on a Fourier-based neural operator backbone,
HANO enables discretization-invariant learning. To enhance its ability to
capture both global loading patterns and critical local path dependencies, we
embed a hierarchical self-attention mechanism that facilitates multiscale
feature extraction.
  Beyond ensuring self-consistency, HANO mitigates sensitivity to initial
hidden states, a commonly overlooked issue that can lead to instability in
recurrent models when applied to generalized loading paths. By modeling
stress-strain evolution as a continuous operator rather than relying on fixed
input-output mappings, HANO naturally accommodates varying path discretizations
and exhibits robust performance under complex conditions, including irregular
sampling, multi-cycle loading, noisy data, and pre-stressed states. We evaluate
HANO on two benchmark problems: elastoplasticity with hardening and progressive
anisotropic damage in brittle solids. Results show that HANO consistently
outperforms baseline models in predictive accuracy, generalization, and
robustness. With its demonstrated capabilities, HANO provides an effective
data-driven surrogate for simulating inelastic materials and is well-suited for
integration with classical numerical solvers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TreeLoRA introduces hierarchical gradient similarity and bandit techniques for efficient continual learning in large pre-trained models, reducing computational burden and improving adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency of continual learning in large pre-trained models due to computational demands and parameter sizes.

Method: Constructs layer-wise adapters using hierarchical gradient similarity, employs bandit techniques for task similarity estimation, and uses sparse gradient updates.

Result: Effective and efficient performance demonstrated on vision transformers and large language models across vision and NLP tasks.

Conclusion: TreeLoRA provides a scalable and efficient solution for continual learning in large pre-trained models.

Abstract: Many real-world applications collect data in a streaming environment, where
learning tasks are encountered sequentially. This necessitates continual
learning (CL) to update models online, enabling adaptation to new tasks while
preserving past knowledge to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Nowadays, with
the flourish of large pre-trained models (LPMs), efficiency has become
increasingly critical for CL, due to their substantial computational demands
and growing parameter sizes. In this paper, we introduce TreeLoRA (K-D Tree of
Low-Rank Adapters), a novel approach that constructs layer-wise adapters by
leveraging hierarchical gradient similarity to enable efficient CL,
particularly for LPMs. To reduce the computational burden of task similarity
estimation, we employ bandit techniques to develop an algorithm based on lower
confidence bounds to efficiently explore the task structure. Furthermore, we
use sparse gradient updates to facilitate parameter optimization, making the
approach better suited for LPMs. Theoretical analysis is provided to justify
the rationale behind our approach, and experiments on both vision transformers
(ViTs) and large language models (LLMs) demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our approach across various domains, including vision and natural
language processing tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PropInfer, a benchmark for evaluating property inference attacks on LLMs, demonstrating vulnerabilities in fine-tuned models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if property inference attacks, previously studied in discriminative and generative models, apply to LLMs, given their increasing use with sensitive data.

Method: Proposes PropInfer benchmark with two fine-tuning paradigms (question-answering, chat-completion) and two tailored attacks (prompt-based generation, shadow-model attack).

Result: Empirical evaluations confirm the success of the attacks, revealing vulnerabilities in LLMs.

Conclusion: LLMs are susceptible to property inference attacks, highlighting a new security concern for fine-tuned models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on domain-specific
datasets to support applications in fields such as healthcare, finance, and
law. These fine-tuning datasets often have sensitive and confidential
dataset-level properties -- such as patient demographics or disease prevalence
-- that are not intended to be revealed. While prior work has studied property
inference attacks on discriminative models (e.g., image classification models)
and generative models (e.g., GANs for image data), it remains unclear if such
attacks transfer to LLMs. In this work, we introduce PropInfer, a benchmark
task for evaluating property inference in LLMs under two fine-tuning paradigms:
question-answering and chat-completion. Built on the ChatDoctor dataset, our
benchmark includes a range of property types and task configurations. We
further propose two tailored attacks: a prompt-based generation attack and a
shadow-model attack leveraging word frequency signals. Empirical evaluations
across multiple pretrained LLMs show the success of our attacks, revealing a
previously unrecognized vulnerability in LLMs.

*Jikai Jin,Vasilis Syrgkanis,Sham Kakade,Hanlin Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A causal representation learning framework is proposed to evaluate language model capabilities by modeling benchmark performance as linear transformations of latent factors, revealing a three-node causal structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address methodological challenges like confounding effects and high computational costs in causal evaluations of language models.

Method: A causal representation learning framework that models benchmark performance as linear transformations of latent capability factors, controlling for base model variations.

Result: Identified a three-node linear causal structure explaining performance variations, revealing a causal direction from problem-solving to instruction-following to mathematical reasoning.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of controlling base model variations to uncover causal relationships among latent model capabilities.

Abstract: Faithful evaluation of language model capabilities is crucial for deriving
actionable insights that can inform model development. However, rigorous causal
evaluations in this domain face significant methodological challenges,
including complex confounding effects and prohibitive computational costs
associated with extensive retraining. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
causal representation learning framework wherein observed benchmark performance
is modeled as a linear transformation of a few latent capability factors.
Crucially, these latent factors are identified as causally interrelated after
appropriately controlling for the base model as a common confounder. Applying
this approach to a comprehensive dataset encompassing over 1500 models
evaluated across six benchmarks from the Open LLM Leaderboard, we identify a
concise three-node linear causal structure that reliably explains the observed
performance variations. Further interpretation of this causal structure
provides substantial scientific insights beyond simple numerical rankings:
specifically, we reveal a clear causal direction starting from general
problem-solving capabilities, advancing through instruction-following
proficiency, and culminating in mathematical reasoning ability. Our results
underscore the essential role of carefully controlling base model variations
during evaluation, a step critical to accurately uncovering the underlying
causal relationships among latent model capabilities.

Method: Introduces EQA-RM, trained via Contrastive Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO), and EQARewardBench for standardized assessment.

Result: EQA-RM achieves 61.9% accuracy on EQA-RM-Bench with only 700 samples, surpassing proprietary and open-source models.

Conclusion: EQA-RM provides scalable, interpretable rewards for EQA, advancing the field with a new benchmark and efficient performance.

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs), vital for large model alignment, are underexplored for
complex embodied tasks like Embodied Question Answering (EQA) where nuanced
evaluation of agents' spatial, temporal, and logical understanding is critical
yet not considered by generic approaches. We introduce EQA-RM, a novel
generative multimodal reward model specifically architected for EQA, trained
via our innovative Contrastive Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)
strategy to learn fine-grained behavioral distinctions. The generative nature
of EQA-RM provides interpretable, structured reward feedback (beyond simple
scalars), uniquely enabling test-time scaling to dynamically adjust evaluation
granularity, from concise scores to detailed critiques of reasoning and
grounding, at inference without retraining. Concurrently, we introduce
EQARewardBench, a new benchmark built on OpenEQA for standardized EQA reward
model assessment. Demonstrating high sample efficiency, EQA-RM (fine-tuning
Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct) achieves 61.9\% accuracy on EQA-RM-Bench with only 700
samples, outperforming strong proprietary baselines, including
Gemini-2.5-Flash, GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Haiku, and open-sourced state-of-the-art
models such as RoVRM and VisualPRM. The code and dataset can be found here

*Tzu-Heng Huang,Harit Vishwakarma,Frederic Sala*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PAJAMA introduces program-based judging for LLM evaluations, reducing costs and biases while improving consistency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing high costs, reliability issues, inflexibility, and biases in using LLMs to evaluate LLM outputs.

Method: Uses LLMs to synthesize executable judging programs instead of direct scoring, enabling local execution and adaptability.

Result: Improves judgment consistency by 15.83%, reduces biased responses by 23.7%, and outperforms LLM-as-a-judge on benchmarks at lower cost.

Conclusion: PAJAMA offers a cost-effective, interpretable, and adaptable alternative to traditional LLM-based evaluations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used to evaluate the quality of LLM
generations and responses, but this leads to significant challenges: high API
costs, uncertain reliability, inflexible pipelines, and inherent biases. To
address these, we introduce PAJAMA (Program-As-a-Judge for Automated Model
Assessment), a new alternative that uses LLMs to synthesize executable judging
programs instead of directly scoring responses. These synthesized programs can
be stored and run locally, costing orders of magnitude less while providing
interpretable, and auditable judging logic that can be easily adapted.
Program-based judges mitigate biases, improving judgment consistency by 15.83%
and reducing biased responses by 23.7% on average compared to a
Qwen2.5-14B-based LLM-as-a-judge. When program judgments are distilled into a
model, PAJAMA outperforms LLM-as-a-judge on the challenging CHAT-HARD subset of
RewardBench, outperforming metrics by 2.19% on Prometheus and 8.67% on the
JudgeLM dataset, all at three orders of magnitude lower cost.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method using a conditional GAN to estimate wildfire progression from satellite data and terrain, validated with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving wildfire spread prediction by addressing divergence in models during multi-day simulations through data assimilation.

Method: Train a conditional GAN with WRF-SFIRE simulations to estimate fire arrival times from VIIRS, GOES, and terrain data.

Result: Validated on five wildfires, achieving an average Sorensen-Dice coefficient of 0.81. Terrain has minimal influence when conditioned on satellite data.

Conclusion: The approach effectively integrates satellite measurements and terrain data for accurate wildfire progression estimation.

Abstract: Increasing wildfire occurrence has spurred growing interest in wildfire
spread prediction. However, even the most complex wildfire models diverge from
observed progression during multi-day simulations, motivating need for data
assimilation. A useful approach to assimilating measurement data into complex
coupled atmosphere-wildfire models is to estimate wildfire progression from
measurements and use this progression to develop a matching atmospheric state.
In this study, an approach is developed for estimating fire progression from
VIIRS active fire measurements, GOES-derived ignition times, and terrain height
data. A conditional Generative Adversarial Network is trained with simulations
of historic wildfires from the atmosphere-wildfire model WRF-SFIRE, thus
allowing incorporation of WRF-SFIRE physics into estimates. Fire progression is
succinctly represented by fire arrival time, and measurements for training are
obtained by applying an approximate observation operator to WRF-SFIRE
solutions, eliminating need for satellite data during training. The model is
trained on tuples of fire arrival times, measurements, and terrain, and once
trained leverages measurements of real fires and corresponding terrain data to
generate samples of fire arrival times. The approach is validated on five
Pacific US wildfires, with results compared against high-resolution perimeters
measured via aircraft, finding an average Sorensen-Dice coefficient of 0.81.
The influence of terrain height on the arrival time inference is also evaluated
and it is observed that terrain has minimal influence when the inference is
conditioned on satellite measurements.

TL;DR: Time-IMM is a dataset capturing real-world irregularity in multimodal time series, paired with IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting, showing improved performance by modeling multimodality explicitly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world time series data are often irregular and messy, but existing benchmarks assume clean, regular data, creating a gap between research and practical deployment.

Method: Time-IMM introduces nine types of irregularity, and IMM-TSF provides fusion modules (timestamp-to-text and multimodality) with recency-aware and attention-based strategies.

Result: Explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular data significantly improves forecasting performance.

Conclusion: Time-IMM and IMM-TSF bridge the gap between research and real-world time series analysis, with publicly available resources.

Abstract: Time series data in real-world applications such as healthcare, climate
modeling, and finance are often irregular, multimodal, and messy, with varying
sampling rates, asynchronous modalities, and pervasive missingness. However,
existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data,
creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We
introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven
irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine
distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based,
constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we
introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal
time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation.
IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text
fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both
recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical
results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time
series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and
IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under
real-world conditions. The dataset is publicly available at

*Weiying Zhao,Aleksei Unagaev,Natalia Efremova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid method combining spectral clustering and cLHS improves SOC sampling representativeness by ensuring coverage of diverse environmental conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cLHS may overlook minor but important environmental clusters, limiting SOC sampling accuracy.

Method: Spectral clustering divides the area into homogeneous zones, followed by cLHS within each zone to capture environmental diversity.

Result: The hybrid method provides better covariate space coverage and spatial heterogeneity than standard cLHS.

Conclusion: Improved sampling design enhances SOC prediction accuracy by balancing training data for machine learning models.

Abstract: Soil organic carbon (SOC) monitoring often relies on selecting representative
field sampling locations based on environmental covariates. We propose a novel
hybrid methodology that integrates spectral clustering - an unsupervised
machine learning technique with conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) to
enhance the representativeness of SOC sampling. In our approach, spectral
clustering partitions the study area into $K$ homogeneous zones using
multivariate covariate data, and cLHS is then applied within each zone to
select sampling locations that collectively capture the full diversity of
environmental conditions. This hybrid spectral-cLHS method ensures that even
minor but important environmental clusters are sampled, addressing a key
limitation of vanilla cLHS which can overlook such areas. We demonstrate on a
real SOC mapping dataset that spectral-cLHS provides more uniform coverage of
covariate feature space and spatial heterogeneity than standard cLHS. This
improved sampling design has the potential to yield more accurate SOC
predictions by providing better-balanced training data for machine learning
models.

Compared to current state-of-the-art equivariant diffusion models, the key
innovation in END lies in its learnable forward process for enhanced generative
modelling. Rather than pre-specified, the forward process is parameterized
through a time- and data-dependent transformation that is equivariant to rigid
transformations. Through a series of experiments on standard molecule
generation benchmarks, we demonstrate the competitive performance of END
compared to several strong baselines for both unconditional and conditional
generation.

Motivation: To evaluate machine learning models' performance in forecasting electricity DAM prices using short historical training windows, focusing on seasonal trends and price spikes.

Method: Four models (LSTM with FFEC, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) were tested on three European energy markets with training windows of 7 to 90 days, using ENTSO-E forecast data.

Result: LightGBM achieved the highest accuracy and robustness, especially with 45-60 day training windows, and excelled in detecting seasonal effects and peak prices.

Conclusion: Short-window training with boosting methods like LightGBM is effective for DAM forecasting in volatile, data-scarce environments.

Abstract: This study investigates the performance of machine learning models in
forecasting electricity Day-Ahead Market (DAM) prices using short historical
training windows, with a focus on detecting seasonal trends and price spikes.
We evaluate four models, namely LSTM with Feed Forward Error Correction (FFEC),
XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, across three European energy markets (Greece,
Belgium, Ireland) using feature sets derived from ENTSO-E forecast data.
Training window lengths range from 7 to 90 days, allowing assessment of model
adaptability under constrained data availability. Results indicate that
LightGBM consistently achieves the highest forecasting accuracy and robustness,
particularly with 45 and 60 day training windows, which balance temporal
relevance and learning depth. Furthermore, LightGBM demonstrates superior
detection of seasonal effects and peak price events compared to LSTM and other
boosting models. These findings suggest that short-window training approaches,
combined with boosting methods, can effectively support DAM forecasting in
volatile, data-scarce environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a GNN-based method to automate PCB schematic optimization by adding components like pull-up resistors, addressing the shortage of skilled engineers and reducing costs and electronic waste.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual PCB optimization is time-consuming and often neglected due to a lack of skilled engineers, leading to higher troubleshooting costs and increased electronic waste.

Method: The approach represents PCB schematics as bipartite graphs and uses a GNN-based node pair prediction model to automate component addition.

Result: GNNs achieve high accuracy in optimizing PCB designs, as validated on real-world datasets labeled by experts.

Conclusion: The method efficiently automates PCB design optimization, saving time and costs while reducing electronic waste.

Abstract: The design and optimization of Printed Circuit Board (PCB) schematics is
crucial for the development of high-quality electronic devices. Thereby, an
important task is to optimize drafts by adding components that improve the
robustness and reliability of the circuit, e.g., pull-up resistors or
decoupling capacitors. Since there is a shortage of skilled engineers and
manual optimizations are very time-consuming, these best practices are often
neglected. However, this typically leads to higher costs for troubleshooting in
later development stages as well as shortened product life cycles, resulting in
an increased amount of electronic waste that is difficult to recycle. Here, we
present an approach for automating the addition of new components into PCB
schematics by representing them as bipartite graphs and utilizing a node pair
prediction model based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We apply our approach
to three highly relevant PCB design optimization tasks and compare the
performance of several popular GNN architectures on real-world datasets labeled
by human experts. We show that GNNs can solve these problems with high accuracy
and demonstrate that our approach offers the potential to automate PCB design
optimizations in a time- and cost-efficient manner.

*Antonio Ferrara,Francesco Cozzi,Alan Perotti,André Panisson,Francesco Bonchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a statistical framework for fairness assessment in algorithmic decision-making, addressing issues of sampling error and small subgroup sizes in intersectional analyses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fairness assessments rely on point estimates, ignoring sampling error and treating small subgroups the same as large ones, leading to unreliable conclusions.

Method: A unified, size-adaptive hypothesis-testing framework is proposed, combining Central-Limit-based Wald tests for large subgroups and Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial estimators for small ones.

Result: The framework provides statistically rigorous decisions with guaranteed type-I error control for large groups and calibrated credible intervals for small groups, validated on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The approach offers interpretable, evidence-based fairness assessments adaptable to varying data availability and intersectionality.

Abstract: Determining whether an algorithmic decision-making system discriminates
against a specific demographic typically involves comparing a single point
estimate of a fairness metric against a predefined threshold. This practice is
statistically brittle: it ignores sampling error and treats small demographic
subgroups the same as large ones. The problem intensifies in intersectional
analyses, where multiple sensitive attributes are considered jointly, giving
rise to a larger number of smaller groups. As these groups become more
granular, the data representing them becomes too sparse for reliable
estimation, and fairness metrics yield excessively wide confidence intervals,
precluding meaningful conclusions about potential unfair treatments.
  In this paper, we introduce a unified, size-adaptive, hypothesis-testing
framework that turns fairness assessment into an evidence-based statistical
decision. Our contribution is twofold. (i) For sufficiently large subgroups, we
prove a Central-Limit result for the statistical parity difference, leading to
analytic confidence intervals and a Wald test whose type-I (false positive)
error is guaranteed at level $\alpha$. (ii) For the long tail of small
intersectional groups, we derive a fully Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial
estimator; Monte-Carlo credible intervals are calibrated for any sample size
and naturally converge to Wald intervals as more data becomes available. We
validate our approach empirically on benchmark datasets, demonstrating how our
tests provide interpretable, statistically rigorous decisions under varying
degrees of data availability and intersectionality.

*Yu-Jie Zhang,Peng Zhao,Masashi Sugiyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Non-stationary online learning has drawn much attention in recent years.
Despite considerable progress, dynamic regret minimization has primarily
focused on convex functions, leaving the functions with stronger curvature
(e.g., squared or logistic loss) underexplored. In this work, we address this
gap by showing that the regret can be substantially improved by leveraging the
concept of mixability, a property that generalizes exp-concavity to effectively
capture loss curvature. Let $d$ denote the dimensionality and $P_T$ the path
length of comparators that reflects the environmental non-stationarity. We
demonstrate that an exponential-weight method with fixed-share updates achieves
an $\mathcal{O}(d T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$ dynamic regret for mixable losses,
improving upon the best-known $\mathcal{O}(d^{10/3} T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$
result (Baby and Wang, 2021) in $d$. More importantly, this improvement arises
from a simple yet powerful analytical framework that exploits the mixability,
which avoids the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based analysis required by existing work.

TL;DR: A two-stage pipeline for digitizing paper-based ECG recordings, addressing signal overlaps with a U-Net segmentation network and adaptive digitization, outperforming baselines in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve digitization of paper-based ECG recordings, especially for single leads with signal overlaps, a common but under-addressed issue.

Method: A U-Net segmentation network isolates the primary ECG trace, followed by adaptive digitization. Data augmentation and an adaptive grid detection module enhance performance.

Result: U-Net achieves 0.87 IoU. Digitization outperforms baselines: MSE 0.0010 (vs. 0.0015) and rho 0.9644 (vs. 0.9366) for non-overlapping signals; MSE 0.0029 (vs. 0.0178) and rho 0.9641 (vs. 0.8676) for overlapping signals.

Conclusion: The method significantly improves digitization accuracy, especially for overlapping signals, enabling reliable conversion of analog ECG records for research and clinical use.

Abstract: This paper addresses the persistent challenge of accurately digitizing
paper-based electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, with a particular focus on
robustly handling single leads compromised by signal overlaps-a common yet
under-addressed issue in existing methodologies. We propose a two-stage
pipeline designed to overcome this limitation. The first stage employs a U-Net
based segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping
signals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the
primary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into
a time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an
adaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG
formats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained
segmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior
performance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both
non-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping
signals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366,
respectively, for the baseline. On samples with signal overlap, our method
achieved an MSE of 0.0029 and a rho of 0.9641, significantly improving upon the
baseline's 0.0178 and 0.8676. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to
significantly enhance digitization accuracy, especially in the presence of
signal overlaps, thereby laying a strong foundation for the reliable conversion
of analog ECG records into analyzable digital data for contemporary research
and clinical applications. The implementation is publicly available at this
GitHub repository: https://github.com/masoudrahimi39/ECG-code.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a low-rank factorization framework for learning undirected graphs from node data, addressing scalability issues in large dimensions. It uses Riemannian optimization and demonstrates efficient performance trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning graph topology from node data is challenging due to scalability issues with large dimensions, as traditional methods scale poorly with the number of variables.

Method: The approach leverages low-rank factorization of the conditional correlation matrix and applies Riemannian optimization techniques, including a low-rank constrained GLasso algorithm.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real data show the method achieves an efficient dimension-versus-performance trade-off.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses scalability in graph learning, offering a practical solution for large-dimensional problems.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of learning an undirected graph from data
gathered at each nodes. Within the graph signal processing framework, the
topology of such graph can be linked to the support of the conditional
correlation matrix of the data. The corresponding graph learning problem then
scales to the squares of the number of variables (nodes), which is usually
problematic at large dimension. To tackle this issue, we propose a graph
learning framework that leverages a low-rank factorization of the conditional
correlation matrix. In order to solve for the resulting optimization problems,
we derive tools required to apply Riemannian optimization techniques for this
particular structure. The proposal is then particularized to a low-rank
constrained counterpart of the GLasso algorithm, i.e., the penalized maximum
likelihood estimation of a Gaussian graphical model. Experiments on synthetic
and real data evidence that a very efficient dimension-versus-performance
trade-off can be achieved with this approach.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Mutual Information Skill Learning (MISL) in unsupervised reinforcement learning, identifies its limitations in skill diversity and separability, proposes a new metric (LSEPIN), and introduces Wasserstein distance-based objectives (WSEP, PWSEP) for better downstream task adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of theoretical analysis in MISL regarding skill diversity and separability, and to improve downstream task adaptation.

Method: Proposes LSEPIN as a disentanglement metric, replaces KL divergence with Wasserstein distance for better geometric properties, and introduces WSEP and PWSEP algorithms.

Result: WSEP and PWSEP outperform MISL in discovering initial policies for downstream tasks, with PWSEP theoretically capable of finding all optimal policies.

Conclusion: The proposed Wasserstein distance-based methods (WSEP, PWSEP) enhance skill learning and downstream task adaptation compared to MISL.

Abstract: Unsupervised reinforcement learning (URL) aims to learn general skills for
unseen downstream tasks. Mutual Information Skill Learning (MISL) addresses URL
by maximizing the mutual information between states and skills but lacks
sufficient theoretical analysis, e.g., how well its learned skills can
initialize a downstream task's policy. Our new theoretical analysis in this
paper shows that the diversity and separability of learned skills are
fundamentally critical to downstream task adaptation but MISL does not
necessarily guarantee these properties. To complement MISL, we propose a novel
disentanglement metric LSEPIN. Moreover, we build an information-geometric
connection between LSEPIN and downstream task adaptation cost. For better
geometric properties, we investigate a new strategy that replaces the KL
divergence in information geometry with Wasserstein distance. We extend the
geometric analysis to it, which leads to a novel skill-learning objective WSEP.
It is theoretically justified to be helpful to downstream task adaptation and
it is capable of discovering more initial policies for downstream tasks than
MISL. We finally propose another Wasserstein distance-based algorithm PWSEP
that can theoretically discover all optimal initial policies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Time-R1 is a two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning framework for LLMs to enhance multi-step reasoning in time series forecasting, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series forecasting methods lack explicit intermediate reasoning, while LLMs show potential but face limitations like high computational cost and privacy risks.

Method: A two-stage framework: supervised fine-tuning for adaptation, followed by reinforcement learning with a multi-objective reward and GRIP for optimizing reasoning paths.

Result: Time-R1 significantly improves forecasting performance across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: Training LLMs with slow-thinking capabilities via Time-R1 addresses limitations of prompt engineering and enhances time series forecasting.

Abstract: To advance time series forecasting (TSF), various methods have been proposed
to improve prediction accuracy, evolving from statistical techniques to
data-driven deep learning architectures. Despite their effectiveness, most
existing methods still adhere to a fast thinking paradigm-relying on extracting
historical patterns and mapping them to future values as their core modeling
philosophy, lacking an explicit thinking process that incorporates intermediate
time series reasoning. Meanwhile, emerging slow-thinking LLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1)
have shown remarkable multi-step reasoning capabilities, offering an
alternative way to overcome these issues. However, prompt engineering alone
presents several limitations - including high computational cost, privacy
risks, and limited capacity for in-depth domain-specific time series reasoning.
To address these limitations, a more promising approach is to train LLMs to
develop slow thinking capabilities and acquire strong time series reasoning
skills. For this purpose, we propose Time-R1, a two-stage reinforcement
fine-tuning framework designed to enhance multi-step reasoning ability of LLMs
for time series forecasting. Specifically, the first stage conducts supervised
fine-tuning for warmup adaptation, while the second stage employs reinforcement
learning to improve the model's generalization ability. Particularly, we design
a fine-grained multi-objective reward specifically for time series forecasting,
and then introduce GRIP (group-based relative importance for policy
optimization), which leverages non-uniform sampling to further encourage and
optimize the model's exploration of effective reasoning paths. Experiments
demonstrate that Time-R1 significantly improves forecast performance across
diverse datasets.

*Alexander Lobashev,Dmitry Guskov,Maria Larchenko,Mikhail Tamm*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel method analyzes latent space geometry in generative models by reconstructing the Fisher information metric, validated on Ising and TASEP models, and revealing fractal phase transitions in diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the latent space geometry of generative models, particularly the Fisher information metric, and its implications for phenomena like phase transitions.

Method: Approximates the posterior distribution of latent variables to learn the log-partition function, defining the Fisher metric for exponential families, with theoretical convergence guarantees.

Result: Outperforms baselines in reconstructing thermodynamic quantities and reveals fractal phase transitions in diffusion models, with divergent Lipschitz constants at phase boundaries.

Conclusion: The method provides new insights into diffusion model latent spaces, linking them to complex phenomena like phase transitions, with practical implications for model analysis.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for analyzing the latent space geometry of
generative models, including statistical physics models and diffusion models,
by reconstructing the Fisher information metric. The method approximates the
posterior distribution of latent variables given generated samples and uses
this to learn the log-partition function, which defines the Fisher metric for
exponential families. Theoretical convergence guarantees are provided, and the
method is validated on the Ising and TASEP models, outperforming existing
baselines in reconstructing thermodynamic quantities. Applied to diffusion
models, the method reveals a fractal structure of phase transitions in the
latent space, characterized by abrupt changes in the Fisher metric. We
demonstrate that while geodesic interpolations are approximately linear within
individual phases, this linearity breaks down at phase boundaries, where the
diffusion model exhibits a divergent Lipschitz constant with respect to the
latent space. These findings provide new insights into the complex structure of
diffusion model latent spaces and their connection to phenomena like phase
transitions. Our source code is available at

### [246] [Data Shifts Hurt CoT: A Theoretical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10647)
*Lang Yin,Debangshu Banerjee,Gagandeep Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoT improves LLM outputs but faces limitations due to data shifts and poisoning, especially in the $k$-parity problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the impact of distribution shifts and data poisoning on CoT's effectiveness in solving computationally difficult problems like $k$-parity.

Method: Analyze the joint effects of distribution shifts and data poisoning on CoT-trained models for the $k$-parity problem.

Result: CoT can worsen performance compared to direct prediction, with mechanistic explanations provided.

Conclusion: CoT's effectiveness is compromised by real-world data shifts, highlighting the need for robust training methods.

Abstract: Chain of Thought (CoT) has been applied to various large language models
(LLMs) and proven to be effective in improving the quality of outputs. In
recent studies, transformers are proven to have absolute upper bounds in terms
of expressive power, and consequently, they cannot solve many computationally
difficult problems. However, empowered by CoT, transformers are proven to be
able to solve some difficult problems effectively, such as the $k$-parity
problem. Nevertheless, those works rely on two imperative assumptions: (1)
identical training and testing distribution, and (2) corruption-free training
data with correct reasoning steps. However, in the real world, these
assumptions do not always hold. Although the risks of data shifts have caught
attention, our work is the first to rigorously study the exact harm caused by
such shifts to the best of our knowledge. Focusing on the $k$-parity problem,
in this work we investigate the joint impact of two types of data shifts: the
distribution shifts and data poisoning, on the quality of trained models
obtained by a well-established CoT decomposition. In addition to revealing a
surprising phenomenon that CoT leads to worse performance on learning parity
than directly generating the prediction, our technical results also give a
rigorous and comprehensive explanation of the mechanistic reasons of such
impact.

TL;DR: SatSOM extends SOMs with a saturation mechanism to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in continual learning by freezing well-trained neurons and redirecting learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address catastrophic forgetting in Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) during continual learning.

Method: Introduces SatSOM, which uses a saturation mechanism to reduce learning rate and neighborhood radius for well-trained neurons, focusing learning on underutilized areas.

Result: Improved knowledge retention in continual learning scenarios.

Conclusion: SatSOM effectively reduces catastrophic forgetting in SOMs by dynamically managing neuron learning.

Abstract: Continual learning poses a fundamental challenge for neural systems, which
often suffer from catastrophic forgetting when exposed to sequential tasks.
Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), despite their interpretability and efficiency, are
not immune to this issue. In this paper, we introduce Saturation
Self-Organizing Maps (SatSOM)-an extension of SOMs designed to improve
knowledge retention in continual learning scenarios. SatSOM incorporates a
novel saturation mechanism that gradually reduces the learning rate and
neighborhood radius of neurons as they accumulate information. This effectively
freezes well-trained neurons and redirects learning to underutilized areas of
the map.

*Floris Holstege,Shauli Ravfogel,Bram Wouters*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPLICE removes unwanted concepts from neural networks while preserving task-relevant covariance, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks often encode unwanted concepts, raising fairness and interpretability issues. Existing methods degrade useful signals.

Method: SPLICE uses an oblique projection to remove sensitive concepts while preserving label covariance, minimizing embedding distortion.

Result: SPLICE outperforms baselines on Bias in Bios and Winobias, effectively removing protected attributes with minimal task damage.

Conclusion: SPLICE is a theoretically and empirically validated method for concept removal without compromising task performance.

Abstract: Modern neural networks often encode unwanted concepts alongside task-relevant
information, leading to fairness and interpretability concerns. Existing
post-hoc approaches can remove undesired concepts but often degrade useful
signals. We introduce SPLICE-Simultaneous Projection for LInear concept removal
and Covariance prEservation-which eliminates sensitive concepts from
representations while exactly preserving their covariance with a target label.
SPLICE achieves this via an oblique projection that "splices out" the unwanted
direction yet protects important label correlations. Theoretically, it is the
unique solution that removes linear concept predictability and maintains target
covariance with minimal embedding distortion. Empirically, SPLICE outperforms
baselines on benchmarks such as Bias in Bios and Winobias, removing protected
attributes while minimally damaging main-task information.

*Marco Spinaci,Marek Polewczyk,Maximilian Schambach,Sam Thelin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ConTextTab combines table-native ICL with semantic understanding, outperforming SOTA on benchmarks like CARTE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tabular ICL models either lack real-world data semantics (e.g., TabPFN) or handle limited context (e.g., TabuLa-8B). ConTextTab aims to merge these strengths.

Method: Integrates specialized embeddings for data modalities and trains on large-scale real-world tabular data.

Result: Competes with SOTA on benchmarks and excels on the semantically rich CARTE benchmark.

Conclusion: ConTextTab successfully merges table-native efficiency with semantic understanding, setting a new benchmark standard.

Abstract: Tabular in-context learning (ICL) has recently achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance on several tabular prediction tasks. Previously restricted
to classification problems on small tables, recent advances such as TabPFN and
TabICL have extended its use to larger datasets. While being architecturally
efficient and well-adapted to tabular data structures, current table-native ICL
architectures, being trained exclusively on synthetic data, do not fully
leverage the rich semantics and world knowledge contained in real-world tabular
data. On another end of this spectrum, tabular ICL models based on pretrained
large language models such as TabuLa-8B integrate deep semantic understanding
and world knowledge but are only able to make use of a small amount of context
due to inherent architectural limitations. With the aim to combine the best of
both these worlds, we introduce ConTextTab, integrating semantic understanding
and alignment into a table-native ICL framework. By employing specialized
embeddings for different data modalities and by training on large-scale
real-world tabular data, our model is competitive with SOTA across a broad set
of benchmarks while setting a new standard on the semantically rich CARTE
benchmark.

TL;DR: Neural, a runner-up in BioNLP 2025 ArchEHR-QA, decouples clinical QA into evidence identification and answer synthesis, using DSPy's MIPROv2 for prompt optimization, achieving a 51.5 score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging information gaps in EHRs for clinicians and patients with precise, supervised QA.

Method: Decouples task into evidence identification and answer synthesis, uses DSPy's MIPROv2 for prompt optimization, and employs self-consistency voting.

Result: Achieves 51.5 score, outperforming zero-shot and few-shot prompting by 20 and 10 points.

Conclusion: Data-driven prompt optimization is cost-effective for clinical QA, enhancing AI reliability in healthcare.

Abstract: Automated question answering (QA) over electronic health records (EHRs) can
bridge critical information gaps for clinicians and patients, yet it demands
both precise evidence retrieval and faithful answer generation under limited
supervision. In this work, we present Neural, the runner-up in the BioNLP 2025
ArchEHR-QA shared task on evidence-grounded clinical QA. Our proposed method
decouples the task into (1) sentence-level evidence identification and (2)
answer synthesis with explicit citations. For each stage, we automatically
explore the prompt space with DSPy's MIPROv2 optimizer, jointly tuning
instructions and few-shot demonstrations on the development set. A
self-consistency voting scheme further improves evidence recall without
sacrificing precision. On the hidden test set, our method attains an overall
score of 51.5, placing second stage while outperforming standard zero-shot and
few-shot prompting by over 20 and 10 points, respectively. These results
indicate that data-driven prompt optimization is a cost-effective alternative
to model fine-tuning for high-stakes clinical QA, advancing the reliability of
AI assistants in healthcare.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve accuracy and speed in weather forecasting, surpassing traditional numerical weather prediction and existing ML models.

Method: FGN uses learned model-perturbations to generate ensembles, trained to minimize CRPS for per-location forecasts.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in deterministic and probabilistic metrics, skillful tropical cyclone track predictions, and captures spatial structure.

Conclusion: FGN is a simple, scalable, and flexible approach that significantly advances ensemble weather forecasting.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML)-based weather models have rapidly risen to prominence
due to their greater accuracy and speed than traditional forecasts based on
numerical weather prediction (NWP), recently outperforming traditional
ensembles in global probabilistic weather forecasting. This paper presents FGN,
a simple, scalable and flexible modeling approach which significantly
outperforms the current state-of-the-art models. FGN generates ensembles via
learned model-perturbations with an ensemble of appropriately constrained
models. It is trained directly to minimize the continuous rank probability
score (CRPS) of per-location forecasts. It produces state-of-the-art ensemble
forecasts as measured by a range of deterministic and probabilistic metrics,
makes skillful ensemble tropical cyclone track predictions, and captures joint
spatial structure despite being trained only on marginals.

*Yufei Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies the minimal cost to find a monotone classifier with error at most (1+ε) times the optimal, presenting nearly tight bounds for all ε.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work only achieved error bounds with absolute factors, leaving a gap in understanding relative error guarantees in monotone classification.

Method: The study analyzes the cost (number of revealed labels) required to identify a monotone classifier with error (1+ε)k*, where k* is the optimal error.

Result: Nearly matching upper and lower bounds are provided for the full range of ε, improving upon previous absolute error results.

Conclusion: This work advances the understanding of relative error guarantees in monotone classification, offering tight bounds for the first time.

Abstract: In monotone classification, the input is a multi-set $P$ of points in
$\mathbb{R}^d$, each associated with a hidden label from $\{-1, 1\}$. The goal
is to identify a monotone function $h$, which acts as a classifier, mapping
from $\mathbb{R}^d$ to $\{-1, 1\}$ with a small {\em error}, measured as the
number of points $p \in P$ whose labels differ from the function values $h(p)$.
The cost of an algorithm is defined as the number of points having their labels
revealed. This article presents the first study on the lowest cost required to
find a monotone classifier whose error is at most $(1 + \epsilon) \cdot k^*$
where $\epsilon \ge 0$ and $k^*$ is the minimum error achieved by an optimal
monotone classifier -- in other words, the error is allowed to exceed the
optimal by at most a relative factor. Nearly matching upper and lower bounds
are presented for the full range of $\epsilon$. All previous work on the
problem can only achieve an error higher than the optimal by an absolute
factor.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new energy function, log-sum-ReLU (LSR), for DenseAM networks, offering exact memory retrieval with exponential capacity and emergent local minima, outperforming traditional LSE-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve memory retrieval and capacity in DenseAM networks by leveraging the Epanechnikov kernel, avoiding the need for exponential separation functions.

Method: Proposes the LSR energy function, inspired by optimal kernel density estimation, and evaluates its performance empirically.

Result: LSR enables exact memory retrieval with exponential capacity, introduces emergent local minima, and shows comparable log-likelihood to LSE models.

Conclusion: LSR demonstrates potential for large-scale memory storage and generative tasks, with unique emergent memory properties.

Abstract: We propose a novel energy function for Dense Associative Memory (DenseAM)
networks, the log-sum-ReLU (LSR), inspired by optimal kernel density
estimation. Unlike the common log-sum-exponential (LSE) function, LSR is based
on the Epanechnikov kernel and enables exact memory retrieval with exponential
capacity without requiring exponential separation functions. Moreover, it
introduces abundant additional \emph{emergent} local minima while preserving
perfect pattern recovery -- a characteristic previously unseen in DenseAM
literature. Empirical results show that LSR energy has significantly more local
minima (memories) that have comparable log-likelihood to LSE-based models.
Analysis of LSR's emergent memories on image datasets reveals a degree of
creativity and novelty, hinting at this method's potential for both large-scale
memory storage and generative tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores activation probes for monitoring high-stakes interactions in LLMs, showing robust generalization and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored area of monitoring high-stakes interactions in LLMs for safety.

Method: Evaluated probe architectures on synthetic data, tested generalization on real-world data, and compared performance to LLM monitors.

Result: Probes generalized well, matched medium-sized LLM monitors' performance, and saved significant computation.

Conclusion: Probes are efficient for initial monitoring, enabling hierarchical systems; synthetic dataset and code released for further research.

Abstract: Monitoring is an important aspect of safely deploying Large Language Models
(LLMs). This paper examines activation probes for detecting "high-stakes"
interactions -- where the text indicates that the interaction might lead to
significant harm -- as a critical, yet underexplored, target for such
monitoring. We evaluate several probe architectures trained on synthetic data,
and find them to exhibit robust generalization to diverse, out-of-distribution,
real-world data. Probes' performance is comparable to that of prompted or
finetuned medium-sized LLM monitors, while offering computational savings of
six orders-of-magnitude. Our experiments also highlight the potential of
building resource-aware hierarchical monitoring systems, where probes serve as
an efficient initial filter and flag cases for more expensive downstream
analysis. We release our novel synthetic dataset and codebase to encourage
further study.

*Ravishka Rathnasuriya,Tingxi Li,Zexin Xu,Zihe Song,Mirazul Haque,Simin Chen,Wei Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores efficiency robustness in Dynamic Deep Learning Systems (DDLSs), categorizing attacks on their adaptive behaviors and highlighting defense limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DDLSs improve efficiency by adapting computation but introduce new attack surfaces, particularly efficiency adversarial attacks.

Method: The study presents a taxonomy of efficiency attacks on DDLSs, categorizing them by dynamic behaviors, and evaluates adversarial strategies and defenses.

Result: The paper identifies key challenges in securing DDLSs and shows existing defenses' limitations against efficiency attacks.

Conclusion: Novel mitigation strategies are needed to secure adaptive DDLSs against efficiency attacks.

Abstract: Deep Learning Systems (DLSs) are increasingly deployed in real-time
applications, including those in resourceconstrained environments such as
mobile and IoT devices. To address efficiency challenges, Dynamic Deep Learning
Systems (DDLSs) adapt inference computation based on input complexity, reducing
overhead. While this dynamic behavior improves efficiency, such behavior
introduces new attack surfaces. In particular, efficiency adversarial attacks
exploit these dynamic mechanisms to degrade system performance. This paper
systematically explores efficiency robustness of DDLSs, presenting the first
comprehensive taxonomy of efficiency attacks. We categorize these attacks based
on three dynamic behaviors: (i) attacks on dynamic computations per inference,
(ii) attacks on dynamic inference iterations, and (iii) attacks on dynamic
output production for downstream tasks. Through an in-depth evaluation, we
analyze adversarial strategies that target DDLSs efficiency and identify key
challenges in securing these systems. In addition, we investigate existing
defense mechanisms, demonstrating their limitations against increasingly
popular efficiency attacks and the necessity for novel mitigation strategies to
secure future adaptive DDLSs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of digital payments necessitates scalable fraud detection systems.

Method: Merges transactional, cardholder, merchant, and category data; extracts behavioral and temporal features; trains unsupervised models (Isolation Forest, One Class SVM, autoencoder); uses clustering for anomaly detection.

Result: Models flag top 1% of reconstruction errors as outliers; PCA visualizations and clustering identify suspicious regions.

Conclusion: The framework effectively detects fraud by leveraging behavioral patterns and unsupervised learning.

Abstract: The rise of digital payments has accelerated the need for intelligent and
scalable systems to detect fraud. This research presents an end-to-end,
feature-rich machine learning framework for detecting credit card transaction
anomalies and fraud using real-world data. The study begins by merging
transactional, cardholder, merchant, and merchant category datasets from a
relational database to create a unified analytical view. Through the feature
engineering process, we extract behavioural signals such as average spending,
deviation from historical patterns, transaction timing irregularities, and
category frequency metrics. These features are enriched with temporal markers
such as hour, day of week, and weekend indicators to expose all latent patterns
that indicate fraudulent behaviours. Exploratory data analysis reveals
contextual transaction trends across all the dataset features. Using the
transactional data, we train and evaluate a range of unsupervised models:
Isolation Forest, One Class SVM, and a deep autoencoder trained to reconstruct
normal behavior. These models flag the top 1% of reconstruction errors as
outliers. PCA visualizations illustrate each models ability to separate
anomalies into a two-dimensional latent space. We further segment the
transaction landscape using K-Means clustering and DBSCAN to identify dense
clusters of normal activity and isolate sparse, suspicious regions.

*Pierre-François Massiani,Alexander von Rohr,Lukas Haverbeck,Sebastian Trimpe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how entropy regularization and constraints penalization in RL promote robust safety by maximizing viable future actions and approximating constrained problems as unconstrained ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of learning policies that robustly satisfy state constraints under unknown disturbances in RL.

Method: Analyzes entropy regularization and constraints penalization, showing how they bias learning toward robust safety and allow approximation of constrained problems as unconstrained ones.

Result: Empirical findings reveal that entropy regularization enhances constraints satisfaction under action noise, and relaxed constraints preserve safety and optimality while improving resilience.

Conclusion: The connection between entropy regularization and robustness offers a simple yet effective approach for ensuring robust safety in RL, warranting further research.

Abstract: Despite the many recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL), the question
of learning policies that robustly satisfy state constraints under unknown
disturbances remains open. In this paper, we offer a new perspective on
achieving robust safety by analyzing the interplay between two well-established
techniques in model-free RL: entropy regularization, and constraints
penalization. We reveal empirically that entropy regularization in constrained
RL inherently biases learning toward maximizing the number of future viable
actions, thereby promoting constraints satisfaction robust to action noise.
Furthermore, we show that by relaxing strict safety constraints through
penalties, the constrained RL problem can be approximated arbitrarily closely
by an unconstrained one and thus solved using standard model-free RL. This
reformulation preserves both safety and optimality while empirically improving
resilience to disturbances. Our results indicate that the connection between
entropy regularization and robustness is a promising avenue for further
empirical and theoretical investigation, as it enables robust safety in RL
through simple reward shaping.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attacks on finite mixtures of classifiers lack suitability, motivating a principled approach to evaluate robustness.

Method: The paper conducts a geometrical analysis to define attack properties and introduces the lattice climber attack, tested on synthetic and real datasets.

Result: Existing attacks fail to meet both effectiveness and maximality, while the lattice climber attack demonstrates superior performance.

Conclusion: The lattice climber attack provides a robust solution for attacking mixtures of classifiers, addressing gaps in existing methods.

Abstract: Finite mixtures of classifiers (a.k.a. randomized ensembles) have been
proposed as a way to improve robustness against adversarial attacks. However,
existing attacks have been shown to not suit this kind of classifier. In this
paper, we discuss the problem of attacking a mixture in a principled way and
introduce two desirable properties of attacks based on a geometrical analysis
of the problem (effectiveness and maximality). We then show that existing
attacks do not meet both of these properties. Finally, we introduce a new
attack called {\em lattice climber attack} with theoretical guarantees in the
binary linear setting, and demonstrate its performance by conducting
experiments on synthetic and real datasets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Duo, a method to improve uniform-state discrete diffusion models by leveraging insights from Gaussian diffusion, achieving faster training and sampling while outperforming autoregressive models in some benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uniform-state discrete diffusion models underperform compared to autoregressive and masked diffusion models despite their potential for fast text generation. The paper aims to bridge this gap by utilizing Gaussian diffusion techniques.

Method: Duo transfers Gaussian diffusion techniques to uniform-state models. It employs curriculum learning guided by Gaussian processes for faster training and introduces Discrete Consistency Distillation for efficient few-step generation.

Result: Curriculum learning doubles training speed and outperforms autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Discrete Consistency Distillation accelerates sampling by two orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: Duo successfully narrows the performance gap between uniform-state diffusion models and stronger baselines, enabling faster and more efficient text generation.

Abstract: Uniform-state discrete diffusion models hold the promise of fast text
generation due to their inherent ability to self-correct. However, they are
typically outperformed by autoregressive models and masked diffusion models. In
this work, we narrow this performance gap by leveraging a key insight:
Uniform-state diffusion processes naturally emerge from an underlying Gaussian
diffusion. Our method, Duo, transfers powerful techniques from Gaussian
diffusion to improve both training and sampling. First, we introduce a
curriculum learning strategy guided by the Gaussian process, doubling training
speed by reducing variance. Models trained with curriculum learning surpass
autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Second, we
present Discrete Consistency Distillation, which adapts consistency
distillation from the continuous to the discrete setting. This algorithm
unlocks few-step generation in diffusion language models by accelerating
sampling by two orders of magnitude. We provide the code and model checkpoints

*Jari Kolehmainen,Nikolay Blagoev,John Donaghy,Oğuzhan Ersoy,Christopher Nies*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NoLoCo is a novel optimization method for training large language models without explicit synchronization, reducing communication overhead and improving convergence rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training large models on clusters with high-bandwidth interconnects is costly and impractical. Existing low-communication methods still require costly synchronization steps.

Method: NoLoCo avoids collective communication by implicitly synchronizing weights via a Nesterov momentum variant, partially averaging with a randomly selected model.

Result: NoLoCo reduces communication overhead significantly, outperforms DiLoCo in speed and convergence, and eliminates global blocking communication.

Conclusion: NoLoCo offers a scalable, efficient alternative for training large models with minimal communication, demonstrating faster convergence and reduced overhead.

Abstract: Training large language models is generally done via optimization methods on
clusters containing tens of thousands of accelerators, communicating over a
high-bandwidth interconnect. Scaling up these clusters is expensive and can
become impractical, imposing limits on the size of models that can be trained.
Several recent studies have proposed training methods that are less
communication intensive, avoiding the need for a highly connected compute
cluster. These state-of-the-art low communication training methods still employ
a synchronization step for model parameters, which, when performed over all
model replicas, can become costly on a low-bandwidth network.
  In this work, we propose a novel optimization method, NoLoCo, that does not
explicitly synchronize all model parameters during training and, as a result,
does not require any collective communication. NoLoCo implicitly synchronizes
model weights via a novel variant of the Nesterov momentum optimizer by
partially averaging model weights with a randomly selected other one. We
provide both a theoretical convergence analysis for our proposed optimizer as
well as empirical results from language model training.
  We benchmark NoLoCo on a wide range of accelerator counts and model sizes,
between 125M to 6.8B parameters. Our method requires significantly less
communication overhead than fully sharded data parallel training or even widely
used low communication training method, DiLoCo. The synchronization step itself
is estimated to be one magnitude faster than the all-reduce used in DiLoCo for
few hundred accelerators training over the internet. We also do not have any
global blocking communication that reduces accelerator idling time. Compared to
DiLoCo, we also observe up to $4\%$ faster convergence rate with wide range of
model sizes and accelerator counts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CausalFM introduces a framework for training PFN-based foundation models for causal inference, formalizing Bayesian priors and demonstrating competitive CATE estimation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for a principled and versatile approach to causal inference using foundation models, leveraging Bayesian priors and structural causal models.

Method: Formalizes Bayesian priors for causal inference, proposes causality-inspired Bayesian neural networks, and instantiates CausalFM for CATE estimation via back-door adjustment.

Result: CausalFM performs competitively in CATE estimation across synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks.

Conclusion: CausalFM offers a transformative paradigm for causal inference, applicable across disciplines like medicine and economics.

Abstract: Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) have recently been proposed as a promising
way to train tabular foundation models. PFNs are transformers that are
pre-trained on synthetic data generated from a prespecified prior distribution
and that enable Bayesian inference through in-context learning. In this paper,
we introduce CausalFM, a comprehensive framework for training PFN-based
foundation models in various causal inference settings. First, we formalize the
construction of Bayesian priors for causal inference based on structural causal
models (SCMs) in a principled way and derive necessary criteria for the
validity of such priors. Building on this, we propose a novel family of prior
distributions using causality-inspired Bayesian neural networks that enable
CausalFM to perform Bayesian causal inference in various settings, including
back-door, front-door, and instrumental variable adjustment. Finally, we
instantiate CausalFM and explicitly train a foundation model for estimating
conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) using back-door adjustment. We
show that CausalFM performs competitively for CATE estimation using various
synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks. In sum, our framework can be used as a
general recipe to train foundation models for various causal inference
settings. In contrast to the current state-of-the-art in causal inference,
CausalFM offers a novel paradigm with the potential to fundamentally change how
practitioners perform causal inference in medicine, economics, and other
disciplines.

### [262] [Sequential-Parallel Duality in Prefix Scannable Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10918)
*Morris Yau,Sharut Gupta,Valerie Engelmayer,Kazuki Irie,Stefanie Jegelka,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores neural sequence models that balance parallel training and fast sequential inference, introducing Prefix-Scannable Models (PSMs) to unify and generalize existing architectures like state space models and linear transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To characterize and expand the class of models supporting efficient parallel evaluation and sequential inference, unifying diverse architectures like GLA and Mamba.

Method: Defines PSMs by relaxing state aggregation to include non-associative functions (e.g., softmax), enabling O(1) compute and log(N) memory. Evaluated on language modeling and synthetic tasks.

Result: PSMs retain transformer expressivity while matching state space model efficiency, sometimes outperforming both in length generalization.

Conclusion: PSMs generalize and unify efficient sequence models, offering a flexible framework for future research.

Abstract: Modern neural sequence models are designed to meet the dual mandate of
parallelizable training and fast sequential inference. Recent developments have
given rise to various models, such as Gated Linear Attention (GLA) and Mamba,
that achieve such ``sequential-parallel duality.'' This raises a natural
question: can we characterize the full class of neural sequence models that
support near-constant-time parallel evaluation and linear-time, constant-space
sequential inference? We begin by describing a broad class of such models --
state space models -- as those whose state updates can be computed using the
classic parallel prefix scan algorithm with a custom associative aggregation
operator. We then define a more general class, Prefix-Scannable Models (PSMs),
by relaxing the state aggregation operator to allow arbitrary (potentially
non-associative) functions such as softmax attention. This generalization
unifies many existing architectures, including element-wise RNNs (e.g., Mamba)
and linear transformers (e.g., GLA, Mamba2, mLSTM), while also introducing new
models with softmax-like operators that achieve O(1) amortized compute per
token and log(N) memory for sequence length N. We empirically evaluate such
models on illustrative small-scale language modeling and canonical synthetic
tasks, including state tracking and associative recall. Empirically, we find
that PSMs retain the expressivity of transformer-based architectures while
matching the inference efficiency of state space models -- in some cases
exhibiting better length generalization than either.

*Adam Karvonen,Samuel Marks*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reveals that simple anti-bias prompts fail in realistic hiring scenarios for LLMs, introduces internal bias mitigation to reduce biases effectively, and advocates for realistic evaluations and mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the failure of existing anti-bias prompts in realistic hiring contexts and ensure equitable outcomes in high-stakes LLM applications.

Method: Internal bias mitigation by identifying and neutralizing sensitive attribute directions in model activations, using affine concept editing at inference time.

Result: Significant biases (up to 12%) in hiring decisions were observed with realistic context; internal mitigation reduced biases to under 2.5% while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: Practitioners should adopt realistic evaluations and internal mitigation strategies to ensure equitable LLM deployment in hiring.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes hiring
applications, making decisions that directly impact people's careers and
livelihoods. While prior studies suggest simple anti-bias prompts can eliminate
demographic biases in controlled evaluations, we find these mitigations fail
when realistic contextual details are introduced. We address these failures
through internal bias mitigation: by identifying and neutralizing sensitive
attribute directions within model activations, we achieve robust bias reduction
across all tested scenarios. Across leading commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 4
Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash) and open-source models (Gemma-2 27B, Gemma-3,
Mistral-24B), we find that adding realistic context such as company names,
culture descriptions from public careers pages, and selective hiring
constraints (e.g.,``only accept candidates in the top 10\%") induces
significant racial and gender biases (up to 12\% differences in interview
rates). When these biases emerge, they consistently favor Black over White
candidates and female over male candidates across all tested models and
scenarios. Moreover, models can infer demographics and become biased from
subtle cues like college affiliations, with these biases remaining invisible
even when inspecting the model's chain-of-thought reasoning. To address these
limitations, our internal bias mitigation identifies race and gender-correlated
directions and applies affine concept editing at inference time. Despite using
directions from a simple synthetic dataset, the intervention generalizes
robustly, consistently reducing bias to very low levels (typically under 1\%,
always below 2.5\%) while largely maintaining model performance. Our findings
suggest that practitioners deploying LLMs for hiring should adopt more
realistic evaluation methodologies and consider internal mitigation strategies
for equitable outcomes.

TL;DR: SEAL introduces a framework for LLMs to self-adapt by generating their own finetuning data and update directives, enabling lasting adaptation through supervised finetuning and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are powerful but static, lacking mechanisms to adapt their weights for new tasks or knowledge. SEAL aims to enable self-directed adaptation.

Method: SEAL generates self-edits (data and directives) for finetuning, uses supervised finetuning for weight updates, and employs reinforcement learning to train effective self-edits.

Result: Experiments show SEAL improves knowledge incorporation and few-shot generalization, demonstrating self-directed adaptation.

Conclusion: SEAL is a promising step toward LLMs capable of self-directed adaptation, with potential for further development.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful but static; they lack mechanisms to
adapt their weights in response to new tasks, knowledge, or examples. We
introduce Self-Adapting LLMs (SEAL), a framework that enables LLMs to
self-adapt by generating their own finetuning data and update directives. Given
a new input, the model produces a self-edit-a generation that may restructure
the information in different ways, specify optimization hyperparameters, or
invoke tools for data augmentation and gradient-based updates. Through
supervised finetuning (SFT), these self-edits result in persistent weight
updates, enabling lasting adaptation. To train the model to produce effective
self-edits, we use a reinforcement learning loop with the downstream
performance of the updated model as the reward signal. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on separate adaptation modules or auxiliary networks, SEAL directly
uses the model's own generation to control its adaptation process. Experiments
on knowledge incorporation and few-shot generalization show that SEAL is a
promising step toward language models capable of self-directed adaptation. Our
website and code is available at https://jyopari.github.io/posts/seal.

*Evelyn Ma,Duo Zhou,Peizhi Niu,Huiting Zhou,Huan Zhang,Olgica Milenkovic,S. Rasoul Etesami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GUARD is a novel framework for LLM unlearning that uses data attribution to mitigate unintended forgetting while preserving model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of unintended forgetting in LLM unlearning, where removing specific data harms model utility and retention of desired information.

Method: Introduces a lightweight proxy data attribution metric and an adaptive unlearning objective with nonuniform weights based on attribution scores.

Result: GUARD significantly improves retention (up to 194.92% in Truth Ratio) while maintaining effective unlearning, as shown in experiments on the TOFU benchmark.

Conclusion: GUARD offers a computationally efficient and theoretically sound solution to enhance retention in LLM unlearning without compromising forgetting performance.

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly important
due to regulatory compliance, copyright protection, and privacy concerns.
However, a key challenge in LLM unlearning is unintended forgetting, where the
removal of specific data inadvertently impairs the utility of the model and its
retention of valuable, desired information. While prior work has primarily
focused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on
unlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods
often suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To
address this, we propose GUARD-a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And
Retention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight
proxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the
"alignment" between the forget and retain sets while remaining computationally
efficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that
assigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely
proportional to their proxy attribution scores. Through such a reallocation of
unlearning power, GUARD mitigates unintended losses in retention. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees that GUARD significantly enhances retention
while maintaining forgetting metrics comparable to prior methods. Extensive
experiments on the TOFU benchmark across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate
that GUARD substantially improves utility preservation while ensuring effective
unlearning. Notably, GUARD reduces utility sacrifice on the Retain Set by up to
194.92% in terms of Truth Ratio when forgetting 10% of the training data.

*Boaz Lavon,Shahar Katz,Lior Wolf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EG-CFG improves neural code generation by incorporating real-time execution feedback, outperforming standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs lack execution feedback during code generation, a key tool for human programmers.

Method: EG-CFG uses beam search, execution signals from test cases, and dynamic prompt updates to guide generation.

Result: EG-CFG achieves state-of-the-art performance across coding tasks, from basic to competitive programming.

Conclusion: EG-CFG effectively integrates execution feedback, enhancing code generation quality and versatility.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to neural code generation that incorporates
real-time execution signals into the language model generation process. While
large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive code generation
capabilities, they typically do not utilize execution feedback during
inference, a critical signal that human programmers regularly leverage. Our
method, Execution-Guided Classifier-Free Guidance (EG-CFG), dynamically
incorporates execution signals as the model generates code, providing
line-by-line feedback that guides the generation process toward executable
solutions. EG-CFG employs a multi-stage process: first, we conduct beam search
to sample candidate program completions for each line; second, we extract
execution signals by executing these candidates against test cases; and
finally, we incorporate these signals into the prompt during generation. By
maintaining consistent signals across tokens within the same line and
refreshing signals at line boundaries, our approach provides coherent guidance
while preserving syntactic structure. Moreover, the method naturally supports
native parallelism at the task level in which multiple agents operate in
parallel, exploring diverse reasoning paths and collectively generating a broad
set of candidate solutions. Our experiments across diverse coding tasks
demonstrate that EG-CFG significantly improves code generation performance
compared to standard approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results across
various levels of complexity, from foundational problems to challenging
competitive programming tasks. Our code is available at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a shift from adapting web agents to human interfaces to designing Agentic Web Interfaces (AWI) optimized for agents, with six guiding principles for safety, efficiency, and standardization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current web agents struggle with human-designed interfaces, prompting the need for interfaces specifically tailored to agent capabilities.

Method: Introduces the concept of AWI and establishes six design principles to address the mismatch between LLMs and web interfaces.

Result: The proposed AWI framework aims to improve efficiency, reliability, and transparency in web agent interactions.

Conclusion: AWI represents a collaborative paradigm shift for better web agent design, involving the ML community.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal
counterparts have spurred significant interest in developing web agents -- AI
systems capable of autonomously navigating and completing tasks within web
environments. While holding tremendous promise for automating complex web
interactions, current approaches face substantial challenges due to the
fundamental mismatch between human-designed interfaces and LLM capabilities.
Current methods struggle with the inherent complexity of web inputs, whether
processing massive DOM trees, relying on screenshots augmented with additional
information, or bypassing the user interface entirely through API interactions.
This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in web agent research:
rather than forcing web agents to adapt to interfaces designed for humans, we
should develop a new interaction paradigm specifically optimized for agentic
capabilities. To this end, we introduce the concept of an Agentic Web Interface
(AWI), an interface specifically designed for agents to navigate a website. We
establish six guiding principles for AWI design, emphasizing safety,
efficiency, and standardization, to account for the interests of all primary
stakeholders. This reframing aims to overcome fundamental limitations of
existing interfaces, paving the way for more efficient, reliable, and
transparent web agent design, which will be a collaborative effort involving
the broader ML community.

*Aayush Karan,Kulin Shah,Sitan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReGuidance is a wrapper method to improve sample realism and reward in diffusion-based inverse problem solving, addressing failures of existing techniques like DPS in low signal-to-noise scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training-free methods (e.g., DPS) fail in hard inverse problems with low signal-to-noise ratios, producing unrealistic outputs. ReGuidance aims to enhance realism and reward.

Method: ReGuidance inverts a candidate solution using the unconditional probability flow ODE, then reinitializes DPS with the resulting latent. Evaluated on tasks like in-painting and super-resolution.

Result: ReGuidance significantly improves sample quality and measurement consistency over state-of-the-art baselines, with theoretical guarantees for multimodal data.

Conclusion: ReGuidance effectively boosts reward and realism in diffusion-based inverse problem solving, offering the first rigorous algorithmic guarantee for DPS.

Abstract: There has been a flurry of activity around using pretrained diffusion models
as informed data priors for solving inverse problems, and more generally around
steering these models using reward models. Training-free methods like diffusion
posterior sampling (DPS) and its many variants have offered flexible heuristic
algorithms for these tasks, but when the reward is not informative enough,
e.g., in hard inverse problems with low signal-to-noise ratio, these techniques
veer off the data manifold, failing to produce realistic outputs. In this work,
we devise a simple wrapper, ReGuidance, for boosting both the sample realism
and reward achieved by these methods. Given a candidate solution $\hat{x}$
produced by an algorithm of the user's choice, we propose inverting the
solution by running the unconditional probability flow ODE in reverse starting
from $\hat{x}$, and then using the resulting latent as an initialization for
DPS. We evaluate our wrapper on hard inverse problems like large box
in-painting and super-resolution with high upscaling. Whereas state-of-the-art
baselines visibly fail, we find that applying our wrapper on top of these
baselines significantly boosts sample quality and measurement consistency. We
complement these findings with theory proving that on certain multimodal data
distributions, ReGuidance simultaneously boosts the reward and brings the
candidate solution closer to the data manifold. To our knowledge, this
constitutes the first rigorous algorithmic guarantee for DPS.

TL;DR: The paper theoretically analyzes in-context learning (ICL) for regression of Hölder functions on manifolds, linking attention mechanisms to kernel methods and deriving generalization bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Theoretical understanding of ICL, especially for structured geometric data, is lacking. This work fills the gap by studying ICL for regression on manifolds.

Method: Establishes a connection between attention mechanisms and kernel methods, deriving generalization error bounds based on prompt length and training tasks.

Result: Transformers achieve minimax regression rates for Hölder functions on manifolds, scaling with intrinsic dimension. Generalization error scales with task count.

Conclusion: Provides foundational insights into geometry's role in ICL and tools for studying nonlinear ICL models.

Abstract: While in-context learning (ICL) has achieved remarkable success in natural
language and vision domains, its theoretical understanding--particularly in the
context of structured geometric data--remains unexplored. In this work, we
initiate a theoretical study of ICL for regression of H\"older functions on
manifolds. By establishing a novel connection between the attention mechanism
and classical kernel methods, we derive generalization error bounds in terms of
the prompt length and the number of training tasks. When a sufficient number of
training tasks are observed, transformers give rise to the minimax regression
rate of H\"older functions on manifolds, which scales exponentially with the
intrinsic dimension of the manifold, rather than the ambient space dimension.
Our result also characterizes how the generalization error scales with the
number of training tasks, shedding light on the complexity of transformers as
in-context algorithm learners. Our findings provide foundational insights into
the role of geometry in ICL and novels tools to study ICL of nonlinear models.

TL;DR: Farseer introduces a refined scaling law for LLMs, improving predictive accuracy and reducing extrapolation error by 433% compared to Chinchilla's law.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high cost and inefficiency of scaling insights from small to large LLMs.

Method: Systematically constructs a model loss surface L(N,D) for better empirical fit and extrapolation.

Result: Achieves superior accuracy and generalizability, validated by training 1,000 LLMs across diverse scales.

Conclusion: Farseer enables reliable large-scale performance predictions and optimal compute allocation, with open-sourced resources for further research.

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is prohibitively expensive, creating a
critical scaling gap where insights from small-scale experiments often fail to
transfer to resource-intensive production systems, thereby hindering efficient
innovation. To bridge this, we introduce Farseer, a novel and refined scaling
law offering enhanced predictive accuracy across scales. By systematically
constructing a model loss surface $L(N,D)$, Farseer achieves a significantly
better fit to empirical data than prior laws (e.g., Chinchilla's law). Our
methodology yields accurate, robust, and highly generalizable predictions,
demonstrating excellent extrapolation capabilities, improving upon Chinchilla's
law by reducing extrapolation error by 433\%. This allows for the reliable
evaluation of competing training strategies across all $(N,D)$ settings,
enabling conclusions from small-scale ablation studies to be confidently
extrapolated to predict large-scale performance. Furthermore, Farseer provides
new insights into optimal compute allocation, better reflecting the nuanced
demands of modern LLM training. To validate our approach, we trained an
extensive suite of approximately 1,000 LLMs across diverse scales and
configurations, consuming roughly 3 million NVIDIA H100 GPU hours. We are
comprehensively open-sourcing all models, data, results, and logs at

TL;DR: The paper introduces neural operators as a way to extend neural networks to function spaces, enabling their application to scientific problems like PDEs, and provides a method to convert existing neural architectures into neural operators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The disparity between finite-dimensional deep learning applications and infinite-dimensional scientific problems limits neural networks' success in scientific fields. Neural operators aim to bridge this gap.

Method: The paper identifies key principles for constructing mappings between function spaces and proposes a recipe to convert popular neural architectures into neural operators with minimal modifications.

Result: The approach enables neural operators to learn solution operators for classes of PDEs, leveraging existing neural architecture optimizations.

Conclusion: The paper provides practical guidance for implementing neural operators, facilitating their use in scientific applications.

Abstract: A wide range of scientific problems, such as those described by
continuous-time dynamical systems and partial differential equations (PDEs),
are naturally formulated on function spaces. While function spaces are
typically infinite-dimensional, deep learning has predominantly advanced
through applications in computer vision and natural language processing that
focus on mappings between finite-dimensional spaces. Such fundamental
disparities in the nature of the data have limited neural networks from
achieving a comparable level of success in scientific applications as seen in
other fields. Neural operators are a principled way to generalize neural
networks to mappings between function spaces, offering a pathway to replicate
deep learning's transformative impact on scientific problems. For instance,
neural operators can learn solution operators for entire classes of PDEs, e.g.,
physical systems with different boundary conditions, coefficient functions, and
geometries. A key factor in deep learning's success has been the careful
engineering of neural architectures through extensive empirical testing.
Translating these neural architectures into neural operators allows operator
learning to enjoy these same empirical optimizations. However, prior neural
operator architectures have often been introduced as standalone models, not
directly derived as extensions of existing neural network architectures. In
this paper, we identify and distill the key principles for constructing
practical implementations of mappings between infinite-dimensional function
spaces. Using these principles, we propose a recipe for converting several
popular neural architectures into neural operators with minimal modifications.
This paper aims to guide practitioners through this process and details the
steps to make neural operators work in practice. Our code can be found at

TL;DR: The paper compares Log Variance (LV) and reverse Kullback-Leibler (rKL) losses in diffusion bridges, showing rKL with log-derivative trick (rKL-LD) outperforms LV in performance, stability, and hyperparameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of LV loss in diffusion bridges and demonstrate the superiority of rKL-LD loss.

Method: Analyzes LV and rKL losses, focusing on their gradients and equivalence, and evaluates them in diffusion bridges with learned coefficients.

Result: rKL-LD loss consistently outperforms LV loss in performance, requires less hyperparameter tuning, and offers more stable training.

Conclusion: For diffusion bridges, rKL-LD is a better choice than LV due to its conceptual soundness, performance, and practical advantages.

Abstract: Diffusion bridges are a promising class of deep-learning methods for sampling
from unnormalized distributions. Recent works show that the Log Variance (LV)
loss consistently outperforms the reverse Kullback-Leibler (rKL) loss when
using the reparametrization trick to compute rKL-gradients. While the on-policy
LV loss yields identical gradients to the rKL loss when combined with the
log-derivative trick for diffusion samplers with non-learnable forward
processes, this equivalence does not hold for diffusion bridges or when
diffusion coefficients are learned. Based on this insight we argue that for
diffusion bridges the LV loss does not represent an optimization objective that
can be motivated like the rKL loss via the data processing inequality. Our
analysis shows that employing the rKL loss with the log-derivative trick
(rKL-LD) does not only avoid these conceptual problems but also consistently
outperforms the LV loss. Experimental results with different types of diffusion
bridges on challenging benchmarks show that samplers trained with the rKL-LD
loss achieve better performance. From a practical perspective we find that
rKL-LD requires significantly less hyperparameter optimization and yields more
stable training behavior.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: A novel framework leveraging AI and automatic optimization to improve CUDA transpilation, addressing compatibility challenges in parallel computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The dominance of CUDA in parallel software creates compatibility issues for other hardware platforms, and existing methods for CUDA transpilation are limited in coverage and costly.

Method: Proposes a framework for generating high-performance CUDA and platform code pairs using AI compiler and optimization tech, enhanced with graph-based data augmentation and a new benchmark (HPCTransEval).

Result: Experiments show the framework significantly improves CUDA transpilation, demonstrating LLMs' potential to solve CUDA ecosystem compatibility issues.

Conclusion: The framework advances CUDA transpilation, showcasing LLMs' capability to tackle parallel computing challenges.

Abstract: The rapid growth of deep learning has driven exponential increases in model
parameters and computational demands. NVIDIA GPUs and their CUDA-based software
ecosystem provide robust support for parallel computing, significantly
alleviating computational bottlenecks. Meanwhile, due to the cultivation of
user programming habits and the high performance of GPUs, the CUDA ecosystem
has established a dominant position in the field of parallel software. This
dominance requires other hardware platforms to support CUDA-based software with
performance portability. However, translating CUDA code to other platforms
poses significant challenges due to differences in parallel programming
paradigms and hardware architectures. Existing approaches rely on language
extensions, domain-specific languages (DSLs), or compilers but face limitations
in workload coverage and generalizability. Moreover, these methods often incur
substantial development costs. Recently, LLMs have demonstrated extraordinary
potential in various vertical domains, especially in code-related tasks.
However, the performance of existing LLMs in CUDA transpilation, particularly
for high-performance code, remains suboptimal. The main reason for this
limitation lies in the lack of high-quality training datasets. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel framework for generating high-performance CUDA
and corresponding platform code pairs, leveraging AI compiler and automatic
optimization technology. We further enhance the framework with a graph-based
data augmentation method and introduce HPCTransEval, a benchmark for evaluating
LLM performance on CUDA transpilation. We conduct experiments using CUDA-to-CPU
transpilation as a case study on leading LLMs. The result demonstrates that our
framework significantly improves CUDA transpilation, highlighting the potential
of LLMs to address compatibility challenges within the CUDA ecosystem.

*Fuhan Cai,Yong Guo,Jie Li,Wenbo Li,Xiangzhong Fang,Jian Chen*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: FastFLUX is a pruning framework for FLUX models, improving inference efficiency without significant performance loss by using BRLL and ST methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inefficiencies (slow inference, high memory usage) of large text-to-image models like FLUX, while avoiding performance degradation from existing acceleration methods.

Method: Uses Block-wise Replacement with Linear Layers (BRLL) to simplify ResBlocks and Sandwich Training (ST) for localized fine-tuning with LoRA.

Result: Maintains high image quality while significantly improving inference speed, even with 20% pruning.

Conclusion: FastFLUX offers an effective solution for deploying efficient text-to-image models without compromising performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generation have led to the
emergence of highly expressive models such as diffusion transformers (DiTs),
exemplified by FLUX. However, their massive parameter sizes lead to slow
inference, high memory usage, and poor deployability. Existing acceleration
methods (e.g., single-step distillation and attention pruning) often suffer
from significant performance degradation and incur substantial training costs.
To address these limitations, we propose FastFLUX, an architecture-level
pruning framework designed to enhance the inference efficiency of FLUX. At its
core is the Block-wise Replacement with Linear Layers (BRLL) method, which
replaces structurally complex residual branches in ResBlocks with lightweight
linear layers while preserving the original shortcut connections for stability.
Furthermore, we introduce Sandwich Training (ST), a localized fine-tuning
strategy that leverages LoRA to supervise neighboring blocks, mitigating
performance drops caused by structural replacement. Experiments show that our
FastFLUX maintains high image quality under both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations, while significantly improving inference speed, even with 20\% of
the hierarchy pruned. Our code will be available soon.

Method: The framework exploits spectral power law decay and locality in natural images. It trains models on synthetically corrupted images (Gaussian blur, JPEG compression, motion blur) and validates the approach.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art ImageNet FID and improves image quality and diversity in text-to-image generation. Noise helps balance biased and unbiased data learning.

Conclusion: Low-quality images are valuable for training diffusion models. The proposed framework effectively leverages all data, demonstrating significant performance gains.

Abstract: We show how to use low-quality, synthetic, and out-of-distribution images to
improve the quality of a diffusion model. Typically, diffusion models are
trained on curated datasets that emerge from highly filtered data pools from
the Web and other sources. We show that there is immense value in the
lower-quality images that are often discarded. We present Ambient Diffusion
Omni, a simple, principled framework to train diffusion models that can extract
signal from all available images during training. Our framework exploits two
properties of natural images -- spectral power law decay and locality. We first
validate our framework by successfully training diffusion models with images
synthetically corrupted by Gaussian blur, JPEG compression, and motion blur. We
then use our framework to achieve state-of-the-art ImageNet FID, and we show
significant improvements in both image quality and diversity for text-to-image
generative modeling. The core insight is that noise dampens the initial skew
between the desired high-quality distribution and the mixed distribution we
actually observe. We provide rigorous theoretical justification for our
approach by analyzing the trade-off between learning from biased data versus
limited unbiased data across diffusion times.

### [277] [Learning-based density-equalizing map](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10027)
*Yanwen Huang,Lok Ming Lui,Gary P. T. Choi*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A novel learning-based density-equalizing mapping framework (LDEM) using deep neural networks is proposed, outperforming traditional methods in accuracy, bijectivity, and scalability from 2D to 3D.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional DEM methods face challenges like limited accuracy, overlapping artifacts, and difficulty in extending from 2D to 3D due to derivative-dependent energy formulations.

Method: LDEM employs deep neural networks with a loss function enforcing density uniformity and geometric regularity, using a hierarchical approach for coarse and dense level predictions.

Result: LDEM shows superior density-equalizing and bijectivity properties, generalizes seamlessly to 3D, and is effective for surface remeshing.

Conclusion: The work enables scalable and robust computation of density-equalizing maps, opening new possibilities for practical applications.

Abstract: Density-equalizing map (DEM) serves as a powerful technique for creating
shape deformations with the area changes reflecting an underlying density
function. In recent decades, DEM has found widespread applications in fields
such as data visualization, geometry processing, and medical imaging.
Traditional approaches to DEM primarily rely on iterative numerical solvers for
diffusion equations or optimization-based methods that minimize handcrafted
energy functionals. However, these conventional techniques often face several
challenges: they may suffer from limited accuracy, produce overlapping
artifacts in extreme cases, and require substantial algorithmic redesign when
extended from 2D to 3D, due to the derivative-dependent nature of their energy
formulations. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based
density-equalizing mapping framework (LDEM) using deep neural networks.
Specifically, we introduce a loss function that enforces density uniformity and
geometric regularity, and utilize a hierarchical approach to predict the
transformations at both the coarse and dense levels. Our method demonstrates
superior density-equalizing and bijectivity properties compared to prior
methods for a wide range of simple and complex density distributions, and can
be easily applied to surface remeshing with different effects. Also, it
generalizes seamlessly from 2D to 3D domains without structural changes to the
model architecture or loss formulation. Altogether, our work opens up new
possibilities for scalable and robust computation of density-equalizing maps
for practical applications.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Proposes a low-cost method for virtual try-on using real human bodies and a hybrid person representation for better garment alignment and interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods are limited to front views, lack real-time performance, and rely on expensive robotic mannequins with inaccurate body deformation.

Method: Uses real human bodies for dataset collection and introduces a hybrid person representation with a simplified DensePose map.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in image quality and temporal consistency, with user studies confirming practical utility.

Conclusion: The approach is cost-effective, improves garment alignment, and aids in purchasing decisions.

Abstract: Existing image-based virtual try-on methods are often limited to the front
view and lack real-time performance. While per-garment virtual try-on methods
have tackled these issues by capturing per-garment datasets and training
per-garment neural networks, they still encounter practical limitations: (1)
the robotic mannequin used to capture per-garment datasets is prohibitively
expensive for widespread adoption and fails to accurately replicate natural
human body deformation; (2) the synthesized garments often misalign with the
human body. To address these challenges, we propose a low-barrier approach for
collecting per-garment datasets using real human bodies, eliminating the
necessity for a customized robotic mannequin. We also introduce a hybrid person
representation that enhances the existing intermediate representation with a
simplified DensePose map. This ensures accurate alignment of synthesized
garment images with the human body and enables human-garment interaction
without the need for customized wearable devices. We performed qualitative and
quantitative evaluations against other state-of-the-art image-based virtual
try-on methods and conducted ablation studies to demonstrate the superiority of
our method regarding image quality and temporal consistency. Finally, our user
study results indicated that most participants found our virtual try-on system
helpful for making garment purchasing decisions.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Edit360 is a tuning-free framework for multi-view consistent 3D editing, leveraging video diffusion models to propagate 2D edits across 360-degree views.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending diffusion models to 3D editing is challenging, especially for fine-grained, multi-view consistent edits. Existing methods are limited by fixed viewing angles.

Method: Edit360 uses video diffusion models, selecting anchor views for 2D edits and propagating them via an Anchor-View Editing Propagation mechanism in latent and attention spaces.

Result: The framework enables high-quality 3D asset reconstruction with customizable edits from arbitrary viewpoints.

Conclusion: Edit360 advances 3D content creation by ensuring multi-view consistency and flexibility in editing.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved image
generation and editing, but extending these capabilities to 3D assets remains
challenging, especially for fine-grained edits that require multi-view
consistency. Existing methods typically restrict editing to predetermined
viewing angles, severely limiting their flexibility and practical applications.
We introduce Edit360, a tuning-free framework that extends 2D modifications to
multi-view consistent 3D editing. Built upon video diffusion models, Edit360
enables user-specific editing from arbitrary viewpoints while ensuring
structural coherence across all views. The framework selects anchor views for
2D modifications and propagates edits across the entire 360-degree range. To
achieve this, Edit360 introduces a novel Anchor-View Editing Propagation
mechanism, which effectively aligns and merges multi-view information within
the latent and attention spaces of diffusion models. The resulting edited
multi-view sequences facilitate the reconstruction of high-quality 3D assets,
enabling customizable 3D content creation.

### [280] [Transformer IMU Calibrator: Dynamic On-body IMU Calibration for Inertial Motion Capture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10580)
*Chengxu Zuo,Jiawei Huang,Xiao Jiang,Yuan Yao,Xiangren Shi,Rui Cao,Xinyu Yi,Feng Xu,Shihui Guo,Yipeng Qin*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A novel dynamic calibration method for sparse inertial motion capture systems relaxes static assumptions, enabling real-time estimation of coordinate drift and measurement offset using Transformer-based learning and synthetic datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the restrictive absolute static assumption in IMU calibration, which limits application scenarios, by dynamically estimating coordinate drift and measurement offset.

Method: Uses relaxed assumptions (slow matrix change and diverse movements) to reduce solution space, employs a Transformer-based model trained on synthetic datasets, and includes a calibration trigger for diverse IMU readings.

Result: Achieves implicit IMU calibration and enables long-term, accurate motion capture with sparse IMUs, a first in the field.

Conclusion: The method expands IMU application scenarios by eliminating explicit calibration needs and improving motion capture accuracy.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic calibration method for sparse
inertial motion capture systems, which is the first to break the restrictive
absolute static assumption in IMU calibration, i.e., the coordinate drift RG'G
and measurement offset RBS remain constant during the entire motion, thereby
significantly expanding their application scenarios. Specifically, we achieve
real-time estimation of RG'G and RBS under two relaxed assumptions: i) the
matrices change negligibly in a short time window; ii) the human movements/IMU
readings are diverse in such a time window. Intuitively, the first assumption
reduces the number of candidate matrices, and the second assumption provides
diverse constraints, which greatly reduces the solution space and allows for
accurate estimation of RG'G and RBS from a short history of IMU readings in
real time. To achieve this, we created synthetic datasets of paired RG'G, RBS
matrices and IMU readings, and learned their mappings using a Transformer-based
model. We also designed a calibration trigger based on the diversity of IMU
readings to ensure that assumption ii) is met before applying our method. To
our knowledge, we are the first to achieve implicit IMU calibration (i.e.,
seamlessly putting IMUs into use without the need for an explicit calibration
process), as well as the first to enable long-term and accurate motion capture
using sparse IMUs. The code and dataset are available at

*Florian Boudin,Akiko Aizawa*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper reviews over 50 research papers on keyphrase generation, analyzing progress, limitations, and challenges, while also releasing a new PLM-based model to aid future research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a comprehensive review and analysis of keyphrase generation research motivated this study to bridge the gap and provide insights into the field's current state.

Method: The authors analyzed over 50 research papers, examining model architectures, datasets, and evaluation practices, and developed a PLM-based model for keyphrase generation.

Result: Findings reveal issues like dataset similarity and inconsistent metrics, leading to overestimated performance, and introduce a new model to address resource limitations.

Conclusion: The paper underscores the need for better evaluation practices and resources in keyphrase generation, offering a new model to support future research.

Abstract: Keyphrase generation refers to the task of producing a set of words or
phrases that summarises the content of a document. Continuous efforts have been
dedicated to this task over the past few years, spreading across multiple lines
of research, such as model architectures, data resources, and use-case
scenarios. Yet, the current state of keyphrase generation remains unknown as
there has been no attempt to review and analyse previous work. In this paper,
we bridge this gap by presenting an analysis of over 50 research papers on
keyphrase generation, offering a comprehensive overview of recent progress,
limitations, and open challenges. Our findings highlight several critical
issues in current evaluation practices, such as the concerning similarity among
commonly-used benchmark datasets and inconsistencies in metric calculations
leading to overestimated performances. Additionally, we address the limited
availability of pre-trained models by releasing a strong PLM-based model for
keyphrase generation as an effort to facilitate future research.

### [283] [Towards Understanding Bias in Synthetic Data for Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10301)
*Hossein A. Rahmani,Varsha Ramineni,Nick Craswell,Bhaskar Mitra,Emine Yilmaz*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper investigates the reliability of synthetic test collections created using LLMs for IR system evaluation, focusing on potential biases and their impact on evaluation results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating diverse test collections for IR systems is resource-intensive. LLMs offer a cost-effective alternative, but their reliability and potential biases need thorough validation.

Method: The study uses LLMs to generate synthetic queries, labels, or both, and empirically analyzes biases in evaluation results. A linear mixed-effects model further validates these biases.

Result: Synthetic test collections exhibit significant biases in absolute system performance evaluation but less so in relative comparisons.

Conclusion: While synthetic test collections are promising, their biases must be carefully considered, especially for absolute performance metrics.

Abstract: Test collections are crucial for evaluating Information Retrieval (IR)
systems. Creating a diverse set of user queries for these collections can be
challenging, and obtaining relevance judgments, which indicate how well
retrieved documents match a query, is often costly and resource-intensive.
Recently, generating synthetic datasets using Large Language Models (LLMs) has
gained attention in various applications. While previous work has used LLMs to
generate synthetic queries or documents to improve ranking models, using LLMs
to create synthetic test collections is still relatively unexplored. Previous
work~\cite{rahmani2024synthetic} showed that synthetic test collections have
the potential to be used for system evaluation, however, more analysis is
needed to validate this claim. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the
reliability of synthetic test collections constructed using LLMs, where LLMs
are used to generate synthetic queries, labels, or both. In particular, we
examine the potential biases that might occur when such test collections are
used for evaluation. We first empirically show the presence of such bias in
evaluation results and analyse the effects it might have on system evaluation.
We further validate the presence of such bias using a linear mixed-effects
model. Our analysis shows that while the effect of bias present in evaluation
results obtained using synthetic test collections could be significant, for
e.g.~computing absolute system performance, its effect may not be as
significant in comparing relative system performance. Codes and data are
available at: https://github.com/rahmanidashti/BiasSyntheticData.

*Narges Nemati,Mostafa Haghir Chehreghani*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: MCCL improves matrix completion in recommender systems by using contrastive learning to denoise and align graph representations, enhancing accuracy and ranking performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GNN-based methods for matrix completion are sensitive to noise and prone to overfitting, limiting generalizability.

Method: MCCL extracts local subgraphs, generates two representations (denoised via attention and aligned via variational autoencoder), and harmonizes them with a mutual learning loss.

Result: Achieves up to 0.8% RMSE improvement and 36% better ranking metrics on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: MCCL effectively addresses noise and overfitting, improving both accuracy and ranking in recommender systems.

Abstract: Matrix completion is a widely adopted framework in recommender systems, as
predicting the missing entries in the user-item rating matrix enables a
comprehensive understanding of user preferences. However, current graph neural
network (GNN)-based approaches are highly sensitive to noisy or irrelevant
edges--due to their inherent message-passing mechanisms--and are prone to
overfitting, which limits their generalizability. To overcome these challenges,
we propose a novel method called Matrix Completion using Contrastive Learning
(MCCL). Our approach begins by extracting local neighborhood subgraphs for each
interaction and subsequently generates two distinct graph representations. The
first representation emphasizes denoising by integrating GNN layers with an
attention mechanism, while the second is obtained via a graph variational
autoencoder that aligns the feature distribution with a standard prior. A
mutual learning loss function is employed during training to gradually
harmonize these representations, enabling the model to capture common patterns
and significantly enhance its generalizability. Extensive experiments on
several real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach not only improves the
numerical accuracy of the predicted scores--achieving up to a 0.8% improvement
in RMSE--but also produces superior rankings with improvements of up to 36% in
ranking metrics.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: LightKG, a simplified GNN-based KGRS, outperforms existing methods in sparse and dense scenarios while reducing training time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN-based KGRSs struggle with sparse interactions and complex models, leading to inefficiency and poor performance.

Method: LightKG uses a simplified GNN layer with scalar pairs for relations and a linear aggregation framework, plus an efficient contrastive SSL layer.

Result: LightKG improves recommendation accuracy by 5.8% and reduces training time by 84.3% compared to baselines.

Conclusion: LightKG is a simple yet effective solution for sparsity issues in KGRSs, balancing performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the dominant approach for
Knowledge Graph-aware Recommender Systems (KGRSs) due to their proven
effectiveness. Building upon GNN-based KGRSs, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)
has been incorporated to address the sparity issue, leading to longer training
time. However, through extensive experiments, we reveal that: (1)compared to
other KGRSs, the existing GNN-based KGRSs fail to keep their superior
performance under sparse interactions even with SSL. (2) More complex models
tend to perform worse in sparse interaction scenarios and complex mechanisms,
like attention mechanism, can be detrimental as they often increase learning
difficulty. Inspired by these findings, we propose LightKG, a simple yet
powerful GNN-based KGRS to address sparsity issues. LightKG includes a
simplified GNN layer that encodes directed relations as scalar pairs rather
than dense embeddings and employs a linear aggregation framework, greatly
reducing the complexity of GNNs. Additionally, LightKG incorporates an
efficient contrastive layer to implement SSL. It directly minimizes the node
similarity in original graph, avoiding the time-consuming subgraph generation
and comparison required in previous SSL methods. Experiments on four benchmark
datasets show that LightKG outperforms 12 competitive KGRSs in both sparse and
dense scenarios while significantly reducing training time. Specifically, it
surpasses the best baselines by an average of 5.8\% in recommendation accuracy
and saves 84.3\% of training time compared to KGRSs with SSL. Our code is

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: SHORE is a new LTV prediction framework for digital gaming that uses short-horizon predictions and a hybrid loss function to improve accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LTV prediction models struggle with delayed payments, sparse early data, and outliers, leading to underestimation or poor robustness.

Method: SHORE integrates short-cycle predictions as auxiliary tasks and uses a hybrid loss function combining order-preserving classification and dynamic Huber loss.

Result: SHORE reduces prediction error by 47.91% in online tests, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: SHORE is effective and robust for industrial-scale LTV prediction in digital games.

Abstract: In digital gaming, long-term user lifetime value (LTV) prediction is
essential for monetization strategy, yet presents major challenges due to
delayed payment behavior, sparse early user data, and the presence of
high-value outliers. While existing models typically rely on either short-cycle
observations or strong distributional assumptions, such approaches often
underestimate long-term value or suffer from poor robustness. To address these
issues, we propose SHort-cycle auxiliary with Order-preserving REgression
(SHORE), a novel LTV prediction framework that integrates short-horizon
predictions (e.g., LTV-15 and LTV-30) as auxiliary tasks to enhance long-cycle
targets (e.g., LTV-60). SHORE also introduces a hybrid loss function combining
order-preserving multi-class classification and a dynamic Huber loss to
mitigate the influence of zero-inflation and outlier payment behavior.
Extensive offline and online experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate
that SHORE significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving a 47.91\%
relative reduction in prediction error in online deployment. These results
highlight SHORE's practical effectiveness and robustness in industrial-scale
LTV prediction for digital games.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Macro Graph of Expert (MGOE) framework, the first method to leverage macro graph embeddings for billion-scale multi-task learning, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-task learning methods ignore graph structures, missing performance improvements. MGOE addresses this gap by incorporating graph information.

Method: MGOE introduces the Macro Graph Bottom and Macro Prediction Tower to capture task-specific macro features and integrate macro knowledge dynamically.

Result: Offline experiments on three datasets and online A/B tests show MGOE's superiority over existing methods.

Conclusion: MGOE is a breakthrough for graph-based multi-task learning, validated in billion-scale recommender systems.

Abstract: Graph-based multi-task learning at billion-scale presents a significant
challenge, as different tasks correspond to distinct billion-scale graphs.
Traditional multi-task learning methods often neglect these graph structures,
relying solely on individual user and item embeddings. However, disregarding
graph structures overlooks substantial potential for improving performance. In
this paper, we introduce the Macro Graph of Expert (MGOE) framework, the first
approach capable of leveraging macro graph embeddings to capture task-specific
macro features while modeling the correlations between task-specific experts.
Specifically, we propose the concept of a Macro Graph Bottom, which, for the
first time, enables multi-task learning models to incorporate graph information
effectively. We design the Macro Prediction Tower to dynamically integrate
macro knowledge across tasks. MGOE has been deployed at scale, powering
multi-task learning for the homepage of a leading billion-scale recommender
system. Extensive offline experiments conducted on three public benchmark
datasets demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art multi-task learning
methods, establishing MGOE as a breakthrough in multi-task graph-based
recommendation. Furthermore, online A/B tests confirm the superiority of MGOE
in billion-scale recommender systems.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces GCCP and PAGC to enhance pointwise document ranking by incorporating global comparisons while maintaining efficiency, outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pointwise ranking methods are efficient but lack comparative insights, leading to inconsistent scoring and suboptimal performance. The goal is to improve effectiveness without sacrificing efficiency.

Method: Proposes GCCP for global reference comparisons and PAGC for post-aggregation of contrastive scores, using a query-focused anchor document for context.

Result: Outperforms previous pointwise methods on TREC DL and BEIR benchmarks, maintaining efficiency and competing with resource-intensive comparative methods.

Conclusion: The GCCP and PAGC innovations effectively balance efficiency and performance, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: Recent advancements have successfully harnessed the power of Large Language
Models (LLMs) for zero-shot document ranking, exploring a variety of prompting
strategies. Comparative approaches like pairwise and listwise achieve high
effectiveness but are computationally intensive and thus less practical for
larger-scale applications. Scoring-based pointwise approaches exhibit superior
efficiency by independently and simultaneously generating the relevance scores
for each candidate document. However, this independence ignores critical
comparative insights between documents, resulting in inconsistent scoring and
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we aim to improve the effectiveness of
pointwise methods while preserving their efficiency through two key
innovations: (1) We propose a novel Global-Consistent Comparative Pointwise
Ranking (GCCP) strategy that incorporates global reference comparisons between
each candidate and an anchor document to generate contrastive relevance scores.
We strategically design the anchor document as a query-focused summary of
pseudo-relevant candidates, which serves as an effective reference point by
capturing the global context for document comparison. (2) These contrastive
relevance scores can be efficiently Post-Aggregated with existing pointwise
methods, seamlessly integrating essential Global Context information in a
training-free manner (PAGC). Extensive experiments on the TREC DL and BEIR
benchmark demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous
pointwise methods while maintaining comparable efficiency. Our method also
achieves competitive performance against comparative methods that require
substantially more computational resources. More analyses further validate the
efficacy of our anchor construction strategy.

TL;DR: RAAI is a training-free, model-agnostic framework that uses LLM attack techniques to generate synthetic data for safety alignment, improving harmful response rates and model robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning LLMs with human preferences is costly and time-consuming; synthetic data offers a scalable alternative.

Method: RAAI detects refusal signals and injects predefined phrases to elicit harmful completions, repurposing attack techniques.

Result: RAAI increases harmful response rates from 2.15% to 61.04% and improves model robustness without compromising general capabilities.

Conclusion: LLM attack methods can be repurposed for scalable and controllable safety alignment.

Abstract: Safely aligning large language models (LLMs) often demands extensive
human-labeled preference data, a process that's both costly and time-consuming.
While synthetic data offers a promising alternative, current methods frequently
rely on complex iterative prompting or auxiliary models. To address this, we
introduce Refusal-Aware Adaptive Injection (RAAI), a straightforward,
training-free, and model-agnostic framework that repurposes LLM attack
techniques. RAAI works by detecting internal refusal signals and adaptively
injecting predefined phrases to elicit harmful, yet fluent, completions. Our
experiments show RAAI effectively jailbreaks LLMs, increasing the harmful
response rate from a baseline of 2.15% to up to 61.04% on average across four
benchmarks. Crucially, fine-tuning LLMs with the synthetic data generated by
RAAI improves model robustness against harmful prompts while preserving general
capabilities on standard tasks like MMLU and ARC. This work highlights how LLM
attack methodologies can be reframed as practical tools for scalable and
controllable safety alignment.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MalwareBench, a benchmark dataset to evaluate LLMs' vulnerability to jailbreak attacks in code generation, revealing their limited ability to reject malicious prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the unexplored susceptibility of LLMs to jailbreak attacks in code generation, given their widespread use and security concerns.

Method: Proposes MalwareBench, a dataset with 3,520 jailbreaking prompts based on 320 malicious code requirements, covering 11 jailbreak methods and 29 code categories.

Result: Mainstream LLMs struggle to reject malicious prompts (60.93% rejection rate), which drops to 39.92% when combined with jailbreak methods.

Conclusion: LLMs' code security capabilities remain a significant challenge, necessitating further research and improvements.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has heightened
concerns about their security, particularly their vulnerability to jailbreak
attacks that leverage crafted prompts to generate malicious outputs. While
prior research has been conducted on general security capabilities of LLMs,
their specific susceptibility to jailbreak attacks in code generation remains
largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we propose MalwareBench, a benchmark
dataset containing 3,520 jailbreaking prompts for malicious code-generation,
designed to evaluate LLM robustness against such threats. MalwareBench is based
on 320 manually crafted malicious code generation requirements, covering 11
jailbreak methods and 29 code functionality categories. Experiments show that
mainstream LLMs exhibit limited ability to reject malicious code-generation
requirements, and the combination of multiple jailbreak methods further reduces
the model's security capabilities: specifically, the average rejection rate for
malicious content is 60.93%, dropping to 39.92% when combined with jailbreak
attack algorithms. Our work highlights that the code security capabilities of
LLMs still pose significant challenges.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PME transforms LLMs' memorization into a privacy defense, reducing PII leakage by editing model knowledge without affecting performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prevent PII leakage in LLMs by leveraging their memorization ability as a defense mechanism.

Method: Detect memorized PII and edit the model's knowledge to mitigate memorization, ensuring robustness against privacy attacks.

Result: PME effectively reduces PII leakage, sometimes nullifying privacy attack accuracy.

Conclusion: PME offers a robust privacy defense for LLMs without compromising their language capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) memorize, and thus, among huge amounts of
uncontrolled data, may memorize Personally Identifiable Information (PII),
which should not be stored and, consequently, not leaked. In this paper, we
introduce Private Memorization Editing (PME), an approach for preventing
private data leakage that turns an apparent limitation, that is, the LLMs'
memorization ability, into a powerful privacy defense strategy. While attacks
against LLMs have been performed exploiting previous knowledge regarding their
training data, our approach aims to exploit the same kind of knowledge in order
to make a model more robust. We detect a memorized PII and then mitigate the
memorization of PII by editing a model knowledge of its training data. We
verify that our procedure does not affect the underlying language model while
making it more robust against privacy Training Data Extraction attacks. We
demonstrate that PME can effectively reduce the number of leaked PII in a
number of configurations, in some cases even reducing the accuracy of the
privacy attacks to zero.

TL;DR: The paper compares ChatGPT and Gemini's security and alignment, analyzing jailbreak techniques and cybersecurity risks like prompt injection and misinformation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address cybersecurity challenges posed by LLMs like ChatGPT and Gemini, including prompt injection, jailbreaking, and misinformation.

Method: Comparative analysis of security and alignment levels, plus a taxonomy of jailbreak techniques with experiments.

Result: Findings likely highlight vulnerabilities and differences in security between ChatGPT and Gemini.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for improved security measures in LLMs to mitigate emerging threats.

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) are transforming digital usage, particularly in
text generation, image creation, information retrieval and code development.
ChatGPT, launched by OpenAI in November 2022, quickly became a reference,
prompting the emergence of competitors such as Google's Gemini. However, these
technological advances raise new cybersecurity challenges, including prompt
injection attacks, the circumvention of regulatory measures (jailbreaking), the
spread of misinformation (hallucinations) and risks associated with deep fakes.
This paper presents a comparative analysis of the security and alignment levels
of ChatGPT and Gemini, as well as a taxonomy of jailbreak techniques associated
with experiments.

*Tianyu Chen,Jian Lou,Wenjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: AQUA is the first watermark framework for protecting image knowledge in Multimodal RAG systems, using acronym-based triggers and spatial cues for robust, stealthy copyright tracing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing watermarking in RAG only protects textual knowledge, leaving image knowledge vulnerable. AQUA addresses this gap.

Method: AQUA embeds semantic signals into synthetic images via acronym-based triggers and spatial relationship cues.

Result: Experiments show AQUA is efficient, effective, imperceptible, and enables reliable copyright tracing.

Conclusion: AQUA fills a key gap in multimodal RAG protection by safeguarding image knowledge.

Abstract: As Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) evolves into service-oriented
platforms (Rag-as-a-Service) with shared knowledge bases, protecting the
copyright of contributed data becomes essential. Existing watermarking methods
in RAG focus solely on textual knowledge, leaving image knowledge unprotected.
In this work, we propose AQUA, the first watermark framework for image
knowledge protection in Multimodal RAG systems. AQUA embeds semantic signals
into synthetic images using two complementary methods: acronym-based triggers
and spatial relationship cues. These techniques ensure watermark signals
survive indirect watermark propagation from image retriever to textual
generator, being efficient, effective and imperceptible. Experiments across
diverse models and datasets show that AQUA enables robust, stealthy, and
reliable copyright tracing, filling a key gap in multimodal RAG protection.

*Saswat Das,Jameson Sandler,Ferdinando Fioretto*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces CMPL, a framework to audit privacy risks in conversational AI agents by simulating multi-turn interactions, revealing vulnerabilities missed by single-turn defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Model agents handle sensitive data, increasing risks of unauthorized disclosures, necessitating a robust auditing framework.

Method: Proposes the CMPL framework, an iterative probing strategy to stress-test agents and uncover latent privacy vulnerabilities through multi-turn interactions.

Result: Demonstrates CMPL's effectiveness in revealing privacy risks across diverse domains and safety configurations, outperforming single-turn defenses.

Conclusion: CMPL serves as a diagnostic tool, providing quantifiable risk metrics and an open benchmark for evaluating conversational privacy in AI agents.

Abstract: Large Language Model agents have begun to appear as personal assistants,
customer service bots, and clinical aides. While these applications deliver
substantial operational benefits, they also require continuous access to
sensitive data, which increases the likelihood of unauthorized disclosures.
This study proposes an auditing framework for conversational privacy that
quantifies and audits these risks. The proposed Conversational Manipulation for
Privacy Leakage (CMPL) framework, is an iterative probing strategy designed to
stress-test agents that enforce strict privacy directives. Rather than focusing
solely on a single disclosure event, CMPL simulates realistic multi-turn
interactions to systematically uncover latent vulnerabilities. Our evaluation
on diverse domains, data modalities, and safety configurations demonstrate the
auditing framework's ability to reveal privacy risks that are not deterred by
existing single-turn defenses. In addition to introducing CMPL as a diagnostic
tool, the paper delivers (1) an auditing procedure grounded in quantifiable
risk metrics and (2) an open benchmark for evaluation of conversational privacy
across agent implementations.

### [296] [GenBreak: Red Teaming Text-to-Image Generators Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10047)
*Zilong Wang,Xiang Zheng,Xiaosen Wang,Bo Wang,Xingjun Ma,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: GenBreak is a framework to systematically test vulnerabilities in text-to-image (T2I) models by fine-tuning a red-team LLM to craft adversarial prompts that evade safety filters while producing harmful content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for evaluating T2I model safety are limited—either easily detected or ineffective. GenBreak aims to address this gap by creating reliable tools for assessing model vulnerabilities.

Method: The framework fine-tunes an LLM using supervised learning on curated datasets and reinforcement learning via interaction with a surrogate T2I model, integrating multiple rewards to craft effective adversarial prompts.

Result: GenBreak successfully generates adversarial prompts that evade safety filters and produce harmful images, revealing weaknesses in commercial T2I models.

Conclusion: GenBreak provides a robust method for evaluating T2I model safety, highlighting significant vulnerabilities in current systems.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models such as Stable Diffusion have advanced rapidly and
are now widely used in content creation. However, these models can be misused
to generate harmful content, including nudity or violence, posing significant
safety risks. While most platforms employ content moderation systems,
underlying vulnerabilities can still be exploited by determined adversaries.
Recent research on red-teaming and adversarial attacks against T2I models has
notable limitations: some studies successfully generate highly toxic images but
use adversarial prompts that are easily detected and blocked by safety filters,
while others focus on bypassing safety mechanisms but fail to produce genuinely
harmful outputs, neglecting the discovery of truly high-risk prompts.
Consequently, there remains a lack of reliable tools for evaluating the safety
of defended T2I models. To address this gap, we propose GenBreak, a framework
that fine-tunes a red-team large language model (LLM) to systematically explore
underlying vulnerabilities in T2I generators. Our approach combines supervised
fine-tuning on curated datasets with reinforcement learning via interaction
with a surrogate T2I model. By integrating multiple reward signals, we guide
the LLM to craft adversarial prompts that enhance both evasion capability and
image toxicity, while maintaining semantic coherence and diversity. These
prompts demonstrate strong effectiveness in black-box attacks against
commercial T2I generators, revealing practical and concerning safety
weaknesses.

*Yeonwoo Jang,Shariqah Hossain,Ashwin Sreevatsa,Diogo Cruz*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Some machine unlearning methods fail under prompt attacks, with ELM notably vulnerable. Robust methods like RMU and TAR exist, but evaluation frameworks need improvement to distinguish true knowledge removal from output suppression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the reliability of machine unlearning methods against prompt attacks and determine if unlearned knowledge can still be retrieved.

Method: Systematic evaluation of eight unlearning techniques across three model families using output-based, logit-based, and probe analysis.

Result: ELM is vulnerable to prompt attacks (e.g., 57.3% accuracy recovery with Hindi filler text), while RMU and TAR show robustness. Logit analysis confirms unlearned models don't hide knowledge via output formatting.

Conclusion: Current unlearning methods may not fully remove knowledge, highlighting the need for better evaluation frameworks. A public framework is released for assessing unlearning effectiveness.

Abstract: In this work, we show that some machine unlearning methods may fail when
subjected to straightforward prompt attacks. We systematically evaluate eight
unlearning techniques across three model families, and employ output-based,
logit-based, and probe analysis to determine to what extent supposedly
unlearned knowledge can be retrieved. While methods like RMU and TAR
demonstrate robust unlearning, ELM remains vulnerable to specific prompt
attacks (e.g., Hindi filler text in original prompt recovering 57.3% accuracy).
Our logit analysis also confirms that unlearned models are generally not hiding
knowledge by modifying the way the answer is formatted, as the correlation
between output and logit accuracy is strong. These results challenge prevailing
assumptions about unlearning effectiveness and highlight the need for
evaluation frameworks that can reliably distinguish between true knowledge
removal and superficial output suppression. We also publicly make available our
evaluation framework to easily evaluate prompting techniques to retrieve
unlearning knowledge.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the vulnerability of fine-tuned LLMs to membership inference attacks (MIAs) and proposes SOFT, a defense technique to mitigate privacy risks while preserving model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy concerns arise from fine-tuning LLMs with sensitive data, prompting a study on their vulnerability to MIAs.

Method: The study empirically analyzes MIAs and introduces SOFT, which uses selective data obfuscation during fine-tuning.

Result: SOFT effectively reduces privacy risks without significantly compromising model performance across diverse domains and LLM architectures.

Conclusion: SOFT provides a scalable and practical solution to protect sensitive information in fine-tuned LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and are widely
adopted for diverse applications. However, fine-tuning these models often
involves private or sensitive information, raising critical privacy concerns.
In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive study evaluating the
vulnerability of fine-tuned LLMs to membership inference attacks (MIAs). Our
empirical analysis demonstrates that MIAs exploit the loss reduction during
fine-tuning, making them highly effective in revealing membership information.
These findings motivate the development of our defense. We propose SOFT
(\textbf{S}elective data \textbf{O}bfuscation in LLM
\textbf{F}ine-\textbf{T}uning), a novel defense technique that mitigates
privacy leakage by leveraging influential data selection with an adjustable
parameter to balance utility preservation and privacy protection. Our extensive
experiments span six diverse domains and multiple LLM architectures and scales.
Results show that SOFT effectively reduces privacy risks while maintaining
competitive model performance, offering a practical and scalable solution to
safeguard sensitive information in fine-tuned LLMs.

*S. Vasavi Venkata Lakshmi,Ziaul Haque Choudhury*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes using quantum cryptography (QKD, BB84, and QOTP) to secure cloud data against future quantum threats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional data security methods may fail against quantum computers, necessitating stronger solutions.

Method: Uses Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) with the BB84 protocol and Quantum One Time Pad (QOTP) for encryption.

Result: Demonstrates a secure framework for cloud data protection, resistant to quantum attacks.

Conclusion: Quantum cryptography ensures robust, future-proof security for cloud computing.

Abstract: Cloud computing has made storing and accessing data easier but keeping it
secure is a big challenge nowadays. Traditional methods of ensuring data may
not be strong enough in the future when powerful quantum computers become
available. To solve this problem, this study uses quantum cryptography to
protect data in the cloud environment. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) creates
secure keys by sending information using quantum particles like photons.
Specifically, we use the BB84 protocol, a simple and reliable way to make
secure keys that cannot be stolen without detection. To protect the data, we
use the Quantum One Time pad (QOTP) for encryption and decryption, ensuring the
data stays completely private. This study shows how these Quantum methods can
be applied in cloud systems to provide a strong defense against hackers, even
if they have access to quantum computers. The combination of QKD, BB84, and
QOTP creates a safe and reliable way to keep data secure when it is stored or
shared in the cloud. Using quantum cryptography, this paper provides a way to
ensure data security now and in the future, making cloud computing safer for
everyone to store their data securely and safely.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores multi-agent LLM systems for complex tasks, introducing a specification and evaluating their feasibility in cybersecurity applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of joint exploration of LLMs, reasoning techniques, and applications in multi-agent systems, and to define specifications for systematic evaluation.

Method: Extended system architecture and prototype from prior research, introduced multi-agent system specifications, and tested with cybersecurity tasks.

Result: Agents with OpenAI and DeepSeek LLMs successfully completed question answering, server security, and network security tasks.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of multi-agent LLM systems for specific applications, highlighting the need for defined specifications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in LLMs indicate potential for novel applications, e.g.,
through reasoning capabilities in the latest OpenAI and DeepSeek models. For
applying these models in specific domains beyond text generation, LLM-based
multi-agent approaches can be utilized that solve complex tasks by combining
reasoning techniques, code generation, and software execution. Applications
might utilize these capabilities and the knowledge of specialized LLM agents.
However, while many evaluations are performed on LLMs, reasoning techniques,
and applications individually, their joint specification and combined
application is not explored well. Defined specifications for multi-agent LLM
systems are required to explore their potential and their suitability for
specific applications, allowing for systematic evaluations of LLMs, reasoning
techniques, and related aspects. This paper reports the results of exploratory
research to specify and evaluate these aspects through a multi-agent system.
The system architecture and prototype are extended from previous research and a
specification is introduced for multi-agent systems. Test cases involving
cybersecurity tasks indicate feasibility of the architecture and evaluation
approach. In particular, the results show the evaluation of question answering,
server security, and network security tasks that were completed correctly by
agents with LLMs from OpenAI and DeepSeek.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper provides a systematic analysis of jailbreak guardrails for LLMs, proposing a taxonomy and evaluation framework to assess their effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The deployment of LLMs has exposed vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks, highlighting the need for robust external defense mechanisms (guardrails).

Method: The authors propose a multi-dimensional taxonomy for guardrails and introduce a Security-Efficiency-Utility framework for evaluation.

Result: The study identifies strengths and limitations of existing guardrails, explores their universality, and suggests optimization strategies.

Conclusion: The work aims to guide future research and deployment of effective LLM guardrails, providing a structured foundation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, but their
deployment has exposed critical vulnerabilities, particularly to jailbreak
attacks that circumvent safety mechanisms. Guardrails--external defense
mechanisms that monitor and control LLM interaction--have emerged as a
promising solution. However, the current landscape of LLM guardrails is
fragmented, lacking a unified taxonomy and comprehensive evaluation framework.
In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) paper, we present the first holistic
analysis of jailbreak guardrails for LLMs. We propose a novel,
multi-dimensional taxonomy that categorizes guardrails along six key
dimensions, and introduce a Security-Efficiency-Utility evaluation framework to
assess their practical effectiveness. Through extensive analysis and
experiments, we identify the strengths and limitations of existing guardrail
approaches, explore their universality across attack types, and provide
insights into optimizing defense combinations. Our work offers a structured
foundation for future research and development, aiming to guide the principled
advancement and deployment of robust LLM guardrails. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: TED-LaST enhances Topological Evolution Dynamics (TED) to detect adaptive backdoor attacks in DNNs by introducing label-supervised dynamics tracking and adaptive layer emphasis, proving robust against sophisticated threats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNNs are vulnerable to adaptive backdoor attacks that evade traditional TED defenses, necessitating a more robust detection method.

Method: TED-LaST introduces label-supervised dynamics tracking and adaptive layer emphasis to identify stealthy threats, even with topological inseparability or perturbations.

Result: Experiments on datasets like CIFAR-10 and models like ResNet show TED-LaST effectively counters advanced backdoor attacks.

Conclusion: TED-LaST sets a new standard for robust backdoor detection, significantly improving DNN security against adaptive threats.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where
attackers implant hidden triggers during training to maliciously control model
behavior. Topological Evolution Dynamics (TED) has recently emerged as a
powerful tool for detecting backdoor attacks in DNNs. However, TED can be
vulnerable to backdoor attacks that adaptively distort topological
representation distributions across network layers. To address this limitation,
we propose TED-LaST (Topological Evolution Dynamics against Laundry, Slow
release, and Target mapping attack strategies), a novel defense strategy that
enhances TED's robustness against adaptive attacks. TED-LaST introduces two key
innovations: label-supervised dynamics tracking and adaptive layer emphasis.
These enhancements enable the identification of stealthy threats that evade
traditional TED-based defenses, even in cases of inseparability in topological
space and subtle topological perturbations. We review and classify data
poisoning tricks in state-of-the-art adaptive attacks and propose enhanced
adaptive attack with target mapping, which can dynamically shift malicious
tasks and fully leverage the stealthiness that adaptive attacks possess. Our
comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and
ImageNet100) and model architectures (ResNet20, ResNet101) show that TED-LaST
effectively counteracts sophisticated backdoors like Adap-Blend, Adapt-Patch,
and the proposed enhanced adaptive attack. TED-LaST sets a new benchmark for
robust backdoor detection, substantially enhancing DNN security against
evolving threats.

*Feiyu Yang,Siyuan Liang,Aishan Liu,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multi-Element (ME) attack method and new datasets to improve SilentBadDiffusion (SBD) for attacking generative diffusion models like Stable Diffusion, achieving better performance in copyright infringement attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like SBD face limitations due to scarce or restricted datasets and suboptimal performance with few poisoning samples.

Method: Proposed ME attack method enhances SBD by increasing poisonous elements per sample and uses Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) for stealthiness.

Result: Achieved higher Copyright Infringement Rate (CIR) and lower First Attack Epoch (FAE) on new datasets, outperforming benchmarks like Pokemon and Mijourney.

Conclusion: The ME method with DCT significantly improves attack effectiveness, especially with limited poisoning samples, surpassing SBD.

Abstract: The capability of generative diffusion models (DMs) like Stable Diffusion
(SD) in replicating training data could be taken advantage of by attackers to
launch the Copyright Infringement Attack, with duplicated poisoned image-text
pairs. SilentBadDiffusion (SBD) is a method proposed recently, which shew
outstanding performance in attacking SD in text-to-image tasks. However, the
feasible data resources in this area are still limited, some of them are even
constrained or prohibited due to the issues like copyright ownership or
inappropriate contents; And not all of the images in current datasets are
suitable for the proposed attacking methods; Besides, the state-of-the-art
(SoTA) performance of SBD is far from ideal when few generated poisoning
samples could be adopted for attacks. In this paper, we raised new datasets
accessible for researching in attacks like SBD, and proposed Multi-Element (ME)
attack method based on SBD by increasing the number of poisonous visual-text
elements per poisoned sample to enhance the ability of attacking, while
importing Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) for the poisoned samples to maintain
the stealthiness. The Copyright Infringement Rate (CIR) / First Attack Epoch
(FAE) we got on the two new datasets were 16.78% / 39.50 and 51.20% / 23.60,
respectively close to or even outperformed benchmark Pokemon and Mijourney
datasets. In condition of low subsampling ratio (5%, 6 poisoned samples), MESI
and DCT earned CIR / FAE of 0.23% / 84.00 and 12.73% / 65.50, both better than
original SBD, which failed to attack at all.

*Junhua Lin,Marc Juarez*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A novel attack targets Tree-Ring watermarking in diffusion models, using publicly available variational autoencoders to significantly reduce detection performance while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose vulnerabilities in Tree-Ring watermarking by exploiting publicly accessible autoencoders, challenging current industry practices.

Method: Leverages the variational autoencoder used to train the diffusion model to approximate its latent space, enabling surrogate-based attacks.

Result: Dramatically reduces AUC of ROC and PR curves (0.993 to 0.153 and 0.994 to 0.385, respectively), outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: Highlights risks of reusing public autoencoders and underscores Tree-Ring's precision shortcomings for real-world use.

Abstract: We present a novel attack specifically designed against Tree-Ring, a
watermarking technique for diffusion models known for its high imperceptibility
and robustness against removal attacks. Unlike previous removal attacks, which
rely on strong assumptions about attacker capabilities, our attack only
requires access to the variational autoencoder that was used to train the
target diffusion model, a component that is often publicly available. By
leveraging this variational autoencoder, the attacker can approximate the
model's intermediate latent space, enabling more effective surrogate-based
attacks. Our evaluation shows that this approach leads to a dramatic reduction
in the AUC of Tree-Ring detector's ROC and PR curves, decreasing from 0.993 to
0.153 and from 0.994 to 0.385, respectively, while maintaining high image
quality. Notably, our attacks outperform existing methods that assume full
access to the diffusion model. These findings highlight the risk of reusing
public autoencoders to train diffusion models -- a threat not considered by
current industry practices. Furthermore, the results suggest that the Tree-Ring
detector's precision, a metric that has been overlooked by previous
evaluations, falls short of the requirements for real-world deployment.

*Stefano Longari,Paolo Cerracchio,Michele Carminati,Stefano Zanero*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper investigates gradient-based adversarial attacks on automotive IDSs under varying attacker knowledge levels (white-box, grey-box, black-box) and evaluates their effectiveness on real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern vehicles' CAN bus lacks robust security, making them vulnerable to cyberattacks. Existing IDSs can be bypassed by adversarial evasion attacks, prompting this study.

Method: The study tests adversarial attacks in three knowledge scenarios (white, grey, black-box) on state-of-the-art IDSs using public datasets, analyzing perturbation impact and real-time feasibility.

Result: Attack effectiveness depends on dataset quality, target IDS, and attacker knowledge. Real-time evasion is feasible with precomputed payloads.

Conclusion: Automotive IDSs remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, with effectiveness varying by context, highlighting the need for improved defenses.

Abstract: The security of modern vehicles has become increasingly important, with the
controller area network (CAN) bus serving as a critical communication backbone
for various Electronic Control Units (ECUs). The absence of robust security
measures in CAN, coupled with the increasing connectivity of vehicles, makes
them susceptible to cyberattacks. While intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have
been developed to counter such threats, they are not foolproof. Adversarial
attacks, particularly evasion attacks, can manipulate inputs to bypass
detection by IDSs. This paper extends our previous work by investigating the
feasibility and impact of gradient-based adversarial attacks performed with
different degrees of knowledge against automotive IDSs. We consider three
scenarios: white-box (attacker with full system knowledge), grey-box (partial
system knowledge), and the more realistic black-box (no knowledge of the IDS'
internal workings or data). We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed
attacks against state-of-the-art IDSs on two publicly available datasets.
Additionally, we study effect of the adversarial perturbation on the attack
impact and evaluate real-time feasibility by precomputing evasive payloads for
timed injection based on bus traffic. Our results demonstrate that, besides
attacks being challenging due to the automotive domain constraints, their
effectiveness is strongly dependent on the dataset quality, the target IDS, and
the attacker's degree of knowledge.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Current LLM safety defenses are vulnerable to decomposition attacks, where malicious goals are split into benign subtasks. A lightweight sequential monitor is proposed, achieving 93% defense success and reducing costs and latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety alignment techniques fail to detect long-range malicious intent in decomposed subtasks, necessitating a more robust monitoring solution.

Method: Proposes an external monitor for higher-granularity conversation observation, tested on a diverse dataset including question-answering, text-to-image, and agentic tasks.

Result: Decomposition attacks have an 87% success rate on GPT-4o. The proposed monitor achieves 93% defense success, reduces cost by 90%, and latency by 50%.

Conclusion: Lightweight sequential monitors are highly effective against decomposition attacks and practical for deployment.

Abstract: Current LLM safety defenses fail under decomposition attacks, where a
malicious goal is decomposed into benign subtasks that circumvent refusals. The
challenge lies in the existing shallow safety alignment techniques: they only
detect harm in the immediate prompt and do not reason about long-range intent,
leaving them blind to malicious intent that emerges over a sequence of
seemingly benign instructions. We therefore propose adding an external monitor
that observes the conversation at a higher granularity. To facilitate our study
of monitoring decomposition attacks, we curate the largest and most diverse
dataset to date, including question-answering, text-to-image, and agentic
tasks. We verify our datasets by testing them on frontier LLMs and show an 87%
attack success rate on average on GPT-4o. This confirms that decomposition
attack is broadly effective. Additionally, we find that random tasks can be
injected into the decomposed subtasks to further obfuscate malicious intents.
To defend in real time, we propose a lightweight sequential monitoring
framework that cumulatively evaluates each subtask. We show that a carefully
prompt engineered lightweight monitor achieves a 93% defense success rate,
beating reasoning models like o3 mini as a monitor. Moreover, it remains robust
against random task injection and cuts cost by 90% and latency by 50%. Our
findings suggest that lightweight sequential monitors are highly effective in
mitigating decomposition attacks and are viable in deployment.

Result: Demonstrates exponential improvements in representation capacity and robust performance in tasks like quantum-dot classification and genomic prediction, even under noise.

Conclusion: VQC-MLPNet provides a scalable, robust framework for quantum-enhanced learning, advancing practical applications in the NISQ era.

such as constrained linear expressivity, optimization challenges, and acute
sensitivity to quantum hardware noise. This work introduces VQC-MLPNet, a
scalable and robust hybrid quantum-classical architecture designed to overcome
these obstacles. By innovatively employing quantum circuits to dynamically
generate parameters for classical Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) via amplitude
encoding and parameterized quantum operations, VQC-MLPNet substantially expands
representation capabilities and augments training stability. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees via statistical learning techniques and Neural
Tangent Kernel analysis, explicitly deriving upper bounds on approximation,
uniform deviation, and optimization errors. These theoretical insights
demonstrate exponential improvements in representation capacity relative to
quantum circuit depth and the number of qubits, providing clear computational
advantages over standalone quantum circuits and existing hybrid quantum
architectures. Our theoretical claims are empirically corroborated through
extensive experiments, including classifying semiconductor quantum-dot charge
states and predicting genomic transcription factor binding sites, demonstrating
resilient performance even under realistic IBM quantum noise simulations. This
research establishes a theoretically sound and practically robust framework,
advancing the frontiers of quantum-enhanced learning for unconventional
computing paradigms in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum era and beyond.

### [308] [Semantic Communication-Enabled Cloud-Edge-End-collaborative Metaverse Services Architecure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10001)
*Yuxuan Li,Sheng Jinag,Bizhu Wang*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: Proposes SC-CEE-Meta, a semantic communication-based architecture to reduce latency and improve quality in metaverse VR services by leveraging cloud-edge-end collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges like bandwidth limitations and poor channel quality in transmitting high-resolution VR data, which degrade user experience.

Method: Introduces three modules: VR video semantic transmission, video synthesis, and 3D virtual scene reconstruction, deployed across cloud, edge, and end devices.

Result: Achieves 96.05% reduction in wireless transmission delay and 43.99% improvement in image quality under poor channel conditions.

Conclusion: SC-CEE-Meta effectively resolves resource-bandwidth conflicts and enhances immersive metaverse services.

Abstract: With technology advancing and the pursuit of new audiovisual experiences
strengthening, the metaverse has gained surging enthusiasm. However, it faces
practical hurdles as substantial data like high-resolution virtual scenes must
be transmitted between cloud platforms and VR devices. Specifically, the VR
device's wireless transmission hampered by insufficient bandwidth, causes speed
and delay problems. Meanwhile, poor channel quality leads to data errors and
worsens user experience. To solve this, we've proposed the Semantic
Communication-Enabled Cloud-Edge-End Collaborative Immersive Metaverse Service
(SC-CEE-Meta) Architecture, which includes three modules: VR video semantic
transmission, video synthesis, and 3D virtual scene reconstruction. By
deploying semantic modules on VR devices and edge servers and sending key
semantic info instead of focusing on bit-level reconstruction, it can cut
latency, resolve the resource-bandwidth conflict, and better withstand channel
interference. Also, the cloud deploys video synthesis and 3D scene
reconstruction preprocessing, while edge devices host 3D reconstruction
rendering modules, all for immersive services. Verified on Meta Quest Pro, the
SC-CEE-Meta can reduce wireless transmission delay by 96.05\% and boost image
quality by 43.99\% under poor channel condition.

*Jianwu Fang,Lei-Lei Li,Zhedong Zheng,Hongkai Yu,Jianru Xue,Zhengguo Li,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Attentive Video Diffusion (AVD) model to synthesize accident video clips for Traffic Accident Anticipation (TAA), addressing data bias and annotation challenges. It introduces EQ-TAA with a novel loss function, achieving competitive results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TAA methods suffer from data bias and annotation challenges due to the uncertain and fast-evolving nature of traffic scenes. The paper aims to overcome these issues by generating synthetic accident clips.

Method: The AVD model synthesizes accident video clips using text prompts while preserving frame style and content. EQ-TAA employs an equivariant triple loss for training with pseudo-normal and pseudo-accident clips.

Result: Extensive experiments show competitive performance of AVD and EQ-TAA compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: AVD and EQ-TAA effectively address TAA challenges by leveraging synthetic data and novel training techniques, achieving strong results.

Abstract: Traffic Accident Anticipation (TAA) in traffic scenes is a challenging
problem for achieving zero fatalities in the future. Current approaches
typically treat TAA as a supervised learning task needing the laborious
annotation of accident occurrence duration. However, the inherent long-tailed,
uncertain, and fast-evolving nature of traffic scenes has the problem that real
causal parts of accidents are difficult to identify and are easily dominated by
data bias, resulting in a background confounding issue. Thus, we propose an
Attentive Video Diffusion (AVD) model that synthesizes additional accident
video clips by generating the causal part in dashcam videos, i.e., from normal
clips to accident clips. AVD aims to generate causal video frames based on
accident or accident-free text prompts while preserving the style and content
of frames for TAA after video generation. This approach can be trained using
datasets collected from various driving scenes without any extra annotations.
Additionally, AVD facilitates an Equivariant TAA (EQ-TAA) with an equivariant
triple loss for an anchor accident-free video clip, along with the generated
pair of contrastive pseudo-normal and pseudo-accident clips. Extensive
experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of AVD and EQ-TAA,
and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods has been
obtained.

*Jie Qin,Wei Yang,Yan Su,Yiran Zhu,Weizhen Li,Yunyue Pan,Chengchang Pan,Honggang Qi*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptive bimodal framework for HER2 prediction in breast cancer, improving accuracy for both single- and dual-modality inputs without requiring synchronized acquisition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HER2 assessment models analyze H&E or IHC images separately, missing the clinical synergy of combined interpretation. Workflow and cost constraints hinder concurrent acquisition of both modalities.

Method: The framework includes a dynamic branch selector, a bidirectional cross-modal GAN for feature-space reconstruction, and a hybrid training protocol. It supports flexible single-/dual-modality prediction.

Result: The model elevates single-modality H&E accuracy to 94.25%, achieves 95.09% dual-modality accuracy, and maintains 90.28% reliability with IHC-only inputs. Cross-modal reconstruction improves F1-scores.

Conclusion: The framework democratizes precise HER2 assessment, especially in resource-limited settings, by reducing IHC costs and maintaining high performance without synchronized acquisition.

Abstract: Current HER2 assessment models for breast cancer predominantly analyze H&E or
IHC images in isolation,despite clinical reliance on their synergistic
interpretation. However, concurrent acquisition of both modalities is often
hindered by workflow complexity and cost constraints. We propose an adaptive
bimodal framework enabling flexible single-/dual-modality HER2 prediction
through three innovations: 1) A dynamic branch selector that activates either
single-modality reconstruction or dual-modality joint inference based on input
completeness; 2) A bidirectional cross-modal GAN performing context-aware
feature-space reconstruction of missing modalities; 3) A hybrid training
protocol integrating adversarial learning and multi-task optimization. This
architecture elevates single-modality H&E prediction accuracy from 71.44% to
94.25% while achieving 95.09% dual-modality accuracy, maintaining 90.28%
reliability with sole IHC inputs. The framework's "dual-preferred,
single-compatible" design delivers near-bimodal performance without requiring
synchronized acquisition, particularly benefiting resource-limited settings
through IHC infrastructure cost reduction. Experimental validation confirms
22.81%/12.90% accuracy improvements over H&E/IHC baselines respectively, with
cross-modal reconstruction enhancing F1-scores to 0.9609 (HE to IHC) and 0.9251
(IHC to HE). By dynamically routing inputs through reconstruction-enhanced or
native fusion pathways, the system mitigates performance degradation from
missing data while preserving computational efficiency (78.55% parameter
reduction in lightweight variant). This elastic architecture demonstrates
significant potential for democratizing precise HER2 assessment across diverse
healthcare settings.

*Kangwei Liu,Junwu Liu,Xiaowei Yi,Jinlin Guo,Yun Cao*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: A diffusion-based framework for expressive 3D facial animation addresses challenges of single-modal control and deterministic mapping by leveraging multimodal emotion binding and an attention-based latent diffusion model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of single-modal control signals and deterministic regression-based mapping in emotional 3D facial animation.

Method: Uses a FLAME-centered multimodal emotion binding strategy and an attention-based latent diffusion model with content-aware attention and emotion-guided layers.

Result: Outperforms existing methods with a 21.6% improvement in emotion similarity while maintaining natural facial dynamics.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances expressiveness and flexibility in 3D facial animation by integrating multimodal signals and stochastic modeling.

Abstract: Audio-driven emotional 3D facial animation encounters two significant
challenges: (1) reliance on single-modal control signals (videos, text, or
emotion labels) without leveraging their complementary strengths for
comprehensive emotion manipulation, and (2) deterministic regression-based
mapping that constrains the stochastic nature of emotional expressions and
non-verbal behaviors, limiting the expressiveness of synthesized animations. To
address these challenges, we present a diffusion-based framework for
controllable expressive 3D facial animation. Our approach introduces two key
innovations: (1) a FLAME-centered multimodal emotion binding strategy that
aligns diverse modalities (text, audio, and emotion labels) through contrastive
learning, enabling flexible emotion control from multiple signal sources, and
(2) an attention-based latent diffusion model with content-aware attention and
emotion-guided layers, which enriches motion diversity while maintaining
temporal coherence and natural facial dynamics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches across most
metrics, achieving a 21.6\% improvement in emotion similarity while preserving
physiologically plausible facial dynamics. Project Page:

*Yi-Chun Chen*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: A hierarchical knowledge graph framework for visual narratives, like comics, decomposes content into levels (story arcs to events) and links them via semantic, spatial, and temporal relationships. Applied to Manga109, it excels in tasks like action retrieval and dialogue tracing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable structured understanding of multimodal visual narratives by capturing relationships across narrative levels.

Method: Decomposes narratives into hierarchical levels, constructs multimodal graphs (visual and textual elements), and integrates them for reasoning.

Result: High precision and recall in tasks like action retrieval and dialogue tracing, validated on Manga109.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable foundation for narrative analysis, interactive storytelling, and multimodal reasoning in visual media.

Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical knowledge graph framework for the
structured understanding of visual narratives, focusing on multimodal media
such as comics. The proposed method decomposes narrative content into multiple
levels, from macro-level story arcs to fine-grained event segments. It
represents them through integrated knowledge graphs that capture semantic,
spatial, and temporal relationships. At the panel level, we construct
multimodal graphs that link visual elements such as characters, objects, and
actions with corresponding textual components, including dialogue and captions.
These graphs are integrated across narrative levels to support reasoning over
story structure, character continuity, and event progression.
  We apply our approach to a manually annotated subset of the Manga109 dataset
and demonstrate its ability to support symbolic reasoning across diverse
narrative tasks, including action retrieval, dialogue tracing, character
appearance mapping, and panel timeline reconstruction. Evaluation results show
high precision and recall across tasks, validating the coherence and
interpretability of the framework. This work contributes a scalable foundation
for narrative-based content analysis, interactive storytelling, and multimodal
reasoning in visual media.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper introduces WDMIR, a wavelet-driven framework for multimodal intent recognition, improving accuracy by 1.13% through frequency-domain analysis and cross-modal interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on text, neglecting non-verbal cues. This work aims to better integrate verbal and non-verbal information for intent recognition.

Method: Proposes wavelet-driven fusion for video-audio feature decomposition and cross-modal interaction for bimodal to trimodal integration.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance (1.13% higher accuracy) on MIntRec, with wavelet fusion boosting non-verbal semantic extraction by 0.41%.

Conclusion: WDMIR effectively bridges verbal and non-verbal semantic gaps, enhancing intent recognition through frequency-domain analysis.

Abstract: Multimodal intent recognition (MIR) seeks to accurately interpret user
intentions by integrating verbal and non-verbal information across video, audio
and text modalities. While existing approaches prioritize text analysis, they
often overlook the rich semantic content embedded in non-verbal cues. This
paper presents a novel Wavelet-Driven Multimodal Intent Recognition(WDMIR)
framework that enhances intent understanding through frequency-domain analysis
of non-verbal information. To be more specific, we propose: (1) a
wavelet-driven fusion module that performs synchronized decomposition and
integration of video-audio features in the frequency domain, enabling
fine-grained analysis of temporal dynamics; (2) a cross-modal interaction
mechanism that facilitates progressive feature enhancement from bimodal to
trimodal integration, effectively bridging the semantic gap between verbal and
non-verbal information. Extensive experiments on MIntRec demonstrate that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous methods by
1.13% on accuracy. Ablation studies further verify that the wavelet-driven
fusion module significantly improves the extraction of semantic information
from non-verbal sources, with a 0.41% increase in recognition accuracy when
analyzing subtle emotional cues.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have rapidly evolved beyond text
generation, now spanning diverse output modalities including images, music,
video, human motion, and 3D objects, by integrating language with other sensory
modalities under unified architectures. This survey categorises six primary
generative modalities and examines how foundational techniques, namely
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), Mixture of Experts (MoE), Reinforcement
Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting,
enable cross-modal capabilities. We analyze key models, architectural trends,
and emergent cross-modal synergies, while highlighting transferable techniques
and unresolved challenges. Architectural innovations like transformers and
diffusion models underpin this convergence, enabling cross-modal transfer and
modular specialization. We highlight emerging patterns of synergy, and identify
open challenges in evaluation, modularity, and structured reasoning. This
survey offers a unified perspective on MLLM development and identifies critical
paths toward more general-purpose, adaptive, and interpretable multimodal
systems.

*Von Ralph Dane Marquez Herbuela,Yukie Nagai*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The study explores how emotional speech aligns with facial and hand movements, revealing that nonoverlapping speech increases expressivity, while overlapping speech disrupts synchrony, impacting emotional clarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the dynamics of emotional expression through coordinated vocal, facial, and gestural signals, enhancing real-time emotion detection in human interactions and AI systems.

Method: Analyzed multimodal emotion coupling using motion capture from dyadic interactions in the IEMOCAP corpus, aligning speech features (prosody, MFCCs, arousal, valence, categorical emotions) with 3D facial and hand marker displacements.

Result: Nonoverlapping speech increased expressivity, especially in the lower face and mouth. Sadness showed higher expressivity during nonoverlap, while anger suppressed gestures during overlaps. Prosody and MFCCs had the highest predictive accuracy for articulatory regions.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of speech timing and synchrony in emotional expression, with implications for improving emotion detection systems.

Abstract: Human emotional expression emerges through coordinated vocal, facial, and
gestural signals. While speech face alignment is well established, the broader
dynamics linking emotionally expressive speech to regional facial and hand
motion remains critical for gaining a deeper insight into how emotional and
behavior cues are communicated in real interactions. Further modulating the
coordination is the structure of conversational exchange like sequential turn
taking, which creates stable temporal windows for multimodal synchrony, and
simultaneous speech, often indicative of high arousal moments, disrupts this
alignment and impacts emotional clarity. Understanding these dynamics enhances
realtime emotion detection by improving the accuracy of timing and synchrony
across modalities in both human interactions and AI systems. This study
examines multimodal emotion coupling using region specific motion capture from
dyadic interactions in the IEMOCAP corpus. Speech features included low level
prosody, MFCCs, and model derived arousal, valence, and categorical emotions
(Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral), aligned with 3D facial and hand marker
displacements. Expressive activeness was quantified through framewise
displacement magnitudes, and speech to gesture prediction mapped speech
features to facial and hand movements. Nonoverlapping speech consistently
elicited greater activeness particularly in the lower face and mouth. Sadness
showed increased expressivity during nonoverlap, while anger suppressed
gestures during overlaps. Predictive mapping revealed highest accuracy for
prosody and MFCCs in articulatory regions while arousal and valence had lower
and more context sensitive correlations. Notably, hand speech synchrony was
enhanced under low arousal and overlapping speech, but not for valence.

*Sarker Miraz Mahfuz,Thomas Slawig*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: A CVAE with mass correction maps biogeochemical parameters to steady-state marine ecosystem data, reducing spin-up iterations by 50-95% compared to uniform initial values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accelerate the computationally expensive spin-up process for global marine ecosystem models by leveraging precomputed steady states and machine learning.

Method: Used a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with mass correction to predict steady states from biogeochemical parameters, then refined predictions with a spin-up.

Result: CVAE predictions reduced spin-up iterations by 50-95%, outperforming the use of mean training data as initial values.

Conclusion: The CVAE approach significantly speeds up spin-up convergence, offering a practical solution for marine ecosystem modeling.

Abstract: We used precomputed steady states obtained by a spin-up for a global marine
ecosystem model as training data to build a mapping from the small number of
biogeochemical model parameters onto the three-dimensional converged steady
annual cycle. The mapping was performed by a conditional variational
autoencoder (CVAE) with mass correction. Applied for test data, we show that
the prediction obtained by the CVAE already gives a reasonable good
approximation of the steady states obtained by a regular spin-up. However, the
predictions do not reach the same level of annual periodicity as those obtained
in the original spin-up data. Thus, we took the predictions as initial values
for a spin-up. We could show that the number of necessary iterations,
corresponding to model years, to reach a prescribed stopping criterion in the
spin-up could be significantly reduced compared to the use of the originally
uniform, constant initial value. The amount of reduction depends on the applied
stopping criterion, measuring the periodicity of the solution. The savings in
needed iterations and, thus, computing time for the spin-up ranges from 50 to
95\%, depending on the stopping criterion for the spin-up. We compared these
results with the use of the mean of the training data as an initial value. We
found that this also accelerates the spin-up, but only by a much lower factor.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the upper bounds of extreme weather events is crucial for risk assessment in a warming climate, but existing methods are computationally expensive or lack fidelity for rare extremes.

Method: The study employs NeuralGCM, a differentiable hybrid climate model, to optimize initial conditions and simulate physically consistent worst-case heatwave scenarios.

Result: Applied to the 2021 Pacific Northwest heatwave, the method produced temperature anomalies up to 3.7°C above the most extreme ensemble member, revealing intensified atmospheric blocking and amplified Rossby wave patterns.

Conclusion: Differentiable climate models efficiently explore extreme event likelihoods, offering a new approach for targeted storylines of extreme weather under climate change.

Abstract: Understanding the plausible upper bounds of extreme weather events is
essential for risk assessment in a warming climate. Existing methods, based on
large ensembles of physics-based models, are often computationally expensive or
lack the fidelity needed to simulate rare, high-impact extremes. Here, we
present a novel framework that leverages a differentiable hybrid climate model,
NeuralGCM, to optimize initial conditions and generate physically consistent
worst-case heatwave trajectories. Applied to the 2021 Pacific Northwest
heatwave, our method produces temperature anomalies up to 3.7 $^\circ$C above
the most extreme member of a 75-member ensemble. These trajectories feature
intensified atmospheric blocking and amplified Rossby wave patterns--hallmarks
of severe heat events. Our results demonstrate that differentiable climate
models can efficiently explore the upper tails of event likelihoods, providing
a powerful new approach for constructing targeted storylines of extreme weather
under climate change.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance probabilistic machine-learned weather forecasting by better constraining small-scale variability.

Method: Training AIFS-CRPS with a multi-scale loss, optimizing the almost fair continuous ranked probability score (afCRPS).

Result: The multi-scale loss improves small-scale variability without degrading forecast skill.

Conclusion: This approach shows promise for scale-aware training in future weather forecasting models.

Abstract: We assess the impact of a multi-scale loss formulation for training
probabilistic machine-learned weather forecasting models. The multi-scale loss
is tested in AIFS-CRPS, a machine-learned weather forecasting model developed
at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). AIFS-CRPS is
trained by directly optimising the almost fair continuous ranked probability
score (afCRPS). The multi-scale loss better constrains small scale variability
without negatively impacting forecast skill. This opens up promising directions
for future work in scale-aware model training.

TL;DR: The paper explores generalized SSH models under complex conditions like disorder, non-Hermiticity, and time-dependent driving, revealing phase transitions, localization effects, and engineered topological states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the behavior of the SSH model under realistic, complex conditions, including disorder, non-Hermiticity, and driving, to uncover new topological phenomena.

Method: Uses exact diagonalization, numerical solvers, and unsupervised machine learning (PCA) to analyze spectral properties, localization (via IPR), and classify phases.

Result: Strong AAH modulation destroys topological edge states; non-Hermiticity introduces skin effect; Floquet driving creates anomalous edge states.

Conclusion: Generalized SSH models host rich phenomena, with localization and non-Hermiticity altering topological properties, while Floquet driving can engineer new topological states.

Abstract: The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model serves as a canonical example of a
one-dimensional topological insulator, yet its behavior under more complex,
realistic conditions remains a fertile ground for research. This paper presents
a comprehensive computational investigation into generalized SSH models,
exploring the interplay between topology, quasi-periodic disorder,
non-Hermiticity, and time-dependent driving. Using exact diagonalization and
specialized numerical solvers, we map the system's phase space through its
spectral properties and localization characteristics, quantified by the Inverse
Participation Ratio (IPR). We demonstrate that while the standard SSH model
exhibits topologically protected edge states, these are destroyed by a
localization transition induced by strong Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH)
modulation. Further, we employ unsupervised machine learning (PCA) to
autonomously classify the system's phases, revealing that strong localization
can obscure underlying topological signatures. Extending the model beyond
Hermiticity, we uncover the non-Hermitian skin effect, a dramatic localization
of all bulk states at a boundary. Finally, we apply a periodic Floquet drive to
a topologically trivial chain, successfully engineering a Floquet topological
insulator characterized by the emergence of anomalous edge states at the
boundaries of the quasi-energy zone. These findings collectively provide a
multi-faceted view of the rich phenomena hosted in generalized 1D topological
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in characterizing SEI formation due to experimental limitations and simulation constraints, aiming to improve understanding for next-generation solid-state batteries.

Method: Large-scale reactive simulations with quantum accuracy, enabled by active learning and deep equivariant neural network interatomic potentials, combined with unsupervised classification techniques for interface analysis.

Result: Discovery of a previously unreported crystalline disordered phase (Li$_2$S$_{0.72}$P$_{0.14}$Cl$_{0.14}$) in the SEI and explanation of Li creep mechanisms critical to dendrite initiation.

Conclusion: The approach provides a parameter-free, first-principles digital twin for studying atomistic dynamics in solid-state synthesis and electrochemistry, offering insights into complex heterogeneous processes.

Abstract: Understanding and controlling the atomistic-level reactions governing the
formation of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) is crucial for the
viability of next-generation solid state batteries. However, challenges persist
due to difficulties in experimentally characterizing buried interfaces and
limits in simulation speed and accuracy. We conduct large-scale explicit
reactive simulations with quantum accuracy for a symmetric battery cell,
{\symcell}, enabled by active learning and deep equivariant neural network
interatomic potentials. To automatically characterize the coupled reactions and
interdiffusion at the interface, we formulate and use unsupervised
classification techniques based on clustering in the space of local atomic
environments. Our analysis reveals the formation of a previously unreported
crystalline disordered phase, Li$_2$S$_{0.72}$P$_{0.14}$Cl$_{0.14}$, in the
SEI, that evaded previous predictions based purely on thermodynamics,
underscoring the importance of explicit modeling of full reaction and transport
kinetics. Our simulations agree with and explain experimental observations of
the SEI formations and elucidate the Li creep mechanisms, critical to dendrite
initiation, characterized by significant Li motion along the interface. Our
approach is to crease a digital twin from first principles, without adjustable
parameters fitted to experiment. As such, it offers capabilities to gain
insights into atomistic dynamics governing complex heterogeneous processes in
solid-state synthesis and electrochemistry.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional feature selection methods in RF are unstable or misleading under double imbalance conditions, necessitating a more robust approach.

Method: The paper introduces a thresholding scheme based on minimal depth, leveraging tree topology to evaluate variable relevance.

tasks, particularly under challenging conditions of double imbalance, namely
settings characterized by both class imbalance in the response variable and
dimensional asymmetry in the data $(n \gg p)$. In such scenarios, traditional
feature selection methods applied to Random Forests (RF) often yield unstable
or misleading importance rankings. This paper proposes a novel thresholding
scheme for feature selection based on minimal depth, which exploits the tree
topology to assess variable relevance. Extensive experiments on simulated and
real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach produces more
parsimonious and accurate subsets of variables compared to conventional minimal
depth-based selection. The method provides a practical and interpretable
solution for variable selection in RF under double imbalance conditions.

### [323] [AC/DC: LLM-based Audio Comprehension via Dialogue Continuation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10312)
*Yusuke Fujita,Tomoya Mizumoto,Atsushi Kojima,Lianbo Liu,Yui Sudo*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: An audio comprehension model uses dialogue continuation with LLMs to improve caption understanding and enable zero-shot instruction-following without multitask tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address caption variation by capturing deeper meaning through dialogue-like responses, enhancing audio comprehension.

Method: Trains the model to generate dialogue-like responses to captions, leveraging LLMs, instead of direct caption generation.

Result: Achieves zero-shot instruction-following on audio datasets (AudioCaps, WavCaps, Clotho) without multitask tuning.

Conclusion: Dialogue continuation training effectively improves audio comprehension and instruction-following capabilities.

Abstract: We propose an instruction-following audio comprehension model that leverages
the dialogue continuation ability of large language models (LLMs). Instead of
directly generating target captions in training data, the proposed method
trains a model to produce responses as if the input caption triggered a
dialogue. This dialogue continuation training mitigates the caption variation
problem. Learning to continue a dialogue effectively captures the caption's
meaning beyond its surface-level words. As a result, our model enables
zero-shot instruction-following capability without multitask instruction
tuning, even trained solely on audio captioning datasets. Experiments on
AudioCaps, WavCaps, and Clotho datasets with AudioBench audio-scene
question-answering tests demonstrate our model's ability to follow various
unseen instructions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Voice conversion is crucial for applications like assistive communication and entertainment, requiring real-time, high-quality performance.

Method: Leverages articulatory features to disentangle content and speaker traits, integrating DDSP for efficient vocoding.

Result: Achieves 61.4 ms CPU latency (13.3% reduction) while matching SOTA synthesis quality.

Conclusion: RT-VC offers robust, interpretable, and low-latency voice conversion, advancing real-time applications.

Abstract: Voice conversion has emerged as a pivotal technology in numerous applications
ranging from assistive communication to entertainment. In this paper, we
present RT-VC, a zero-shot real-time voice conversion system that delivers
ultra-low latency and high-quality performance. Our approach leverages an
articulatory feature space to naturally disentangle content and speaker
characteristics, facilitating more robust and interpretable voice
transformations. Additionally, the integration of differentiable digital signal
processing (DDSP) enables efficient vocoding directly from articulatory
features, significantly reducing conversion latency. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that, while maintaining synthesis quality comparable to the current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, RT-VC achieves a CPU latency of 61.4 ms,
representing a 13.3\% reduction in latency.

*Rogier C. van Dalen,Shucong Zhang,Titouan Parcollet,Sourav Bhattacharya*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: A method combining conditional entropy over hypotheses and speaker codes improves speech recognizer adaptation with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech recognizers often underperform in new environments or with new speakers due to limited labeled data. Robust adaptation is needed.

Method: Proposes a loss function using conditional entropy over multiple hypotheses and a compact speaker code for efficient adaptation.

Result: Achieves 20% relative WER improvement with one minute of data, increasing to 29% with 10 minutes.

Conclusion: The approach enables robust adaptation to new speakers with minimal unlabeled data.

Abstract: Speech recognisers usually perform optimally only in a specific environment
and need to be adapted to work well in another. For adaptation to a new
speaker, there is often too little data for fine-tuning to be robust, and that
data is usually unlabelled. This paper proposes a combination of approaches to
make adaptation to a single minute of data robust. First, instead of estimating
the adaptation parameters with cross-entropy on a single error-prone hypothesis
or "pseudo-label", this paper proposes a novel loss function, the conditional
entropy over complete hypotheses. Using multiple hypotheses makes adaptation
more robust to errors in the initial recognition. Second, a "speaker code"
characterises a speaker in a vector short enough that it requires little data
to estimate. On a far-field noise-augmented version of Common Voice, the
proposed scheme yields a 20% relative improvement in word error rate on one
minute of adaptation data, increasing on 10 minutes to 29%.

### [327] [Attention on flow control: transformer-based reinforcement learning for lift regulation in highly disturbed flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10153)
*Zhecheng Liu,Jeff D. Eldredge*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: A transformer-based RL framework is proposed for aerodynamic lift control in gust sequences, outperforming linear control and generalizing well with acceleration techniques like pretraining and transfer learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear flow control strategies fail under strong disturbances, necessitating a more robust approach for aerodynamic lift regulation.

Method: A transformer-based RL framework is used, leveraging pretraining with expert policies and task-level transfer learning to address partial observability and accelerate training.

Result: The learned strategy outperforms proportional control, especially with more gusts, and generalizes to longer sequences. Quarter-chord pitching is more efficient than mid-chord.

Conclusion: The transformer-based RL framework is effective and generalizable, offering a promising solution for complex flow control problems when combined with acceleration techniques.

Abstract: A linear flow control strategy designed for weak disturbances may not remain
effective in sequences of strong disturbances due to nonlinear interactions,
but it is sensible to leverage it for developing a better strategy. In the
present study, we propose a transformer-based reinforcement learning (RL)
framework to learn an effective control strategy for regulating aerodynamic
lift in gust sequences via pitch control. The transformer addresses the
challenge of partial observability from limited surface pressure sensors. We
demonstrate that the training can be accelerated with two techniques --
pretraining with an expert policy (here, linear control) and task-level
transfer learning (here, extending a policy trained on isolated gusts to
multiple gusts). We show that the learned strategy outperforms the best
proportional control, with the performance gap widening as the number of gusts
increases. The control strategy learned in an environment with a small number
of successive gusts is shown to effectively generalize to an environment with
an arbitrarily long sequence of gusts. We investigate the pivot configuration
and show that quarter-chord pitching control can achieve superior lift
regulation with substantially less control effort compared to mid-chord
pitching control. Through a decomposition of the lift, we attribute this
advantage to the dominant added-mass contribution accessible via quarter-chord
pitching. The success on multiple configurations shows the generalizability of
the proposed transformer-based RL framework, which offers a promising approach
to solve more computationally demanding flow control problems when combined
with the proposed acceleration techniques.

*Rui Zhang,Qi Meng,Han Wan,Yang Liu,Zhi-Ming Ma,Hao Sun*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: OmniFluids introduces a unified physics pre-trained operator learning framework for efficient and accurate fluid dynamics simulation, outperforming existing methods with significant speedups and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fluid dynamics methods are computationally expensive, while existing AI-driven approaches like PINNs and neural operators require extensive training or large datasets. OmniFluids aims to address these limitations.

Method: OmniFluids integrates physics-only pre-training, coarse-grid operator distillation, and few-shot fine-tuning. It uses a mixture of operators, a multi-frame decoder, and factorized Fourier layers for scalable modeling.

Result: OmniFluids achieves 10-100x speedups over classical solvers, outperforms state-of-the-art AI methods in accuracy, and recovers unknown parameters from sparse, noisy data.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a new paradigm for efficient and generalizable surrogate modeling in fluid systems with limited data.

Abstract: High-fidelity and efficient simulation of fluid dynamics drive progress in
various scientific and engineering applications. Traditional computational
fluid dynamics methods offer strong interpretability and guaranteed
convergence, but rely on fine spatial and temporal meshes, incurring
prohibitive computational costs. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and
neural operators aim to accelerate PDE solvers using deep learning techniques.
However, PINNs require extensive retraining and careful tuning, and purely
data-driven operators demand large labeled datasets. Hybrid physics-aware
methods embed numerical discretizations into network architectures or loss
functions, but achieve marginal speed gains and become unstable when balancing
coarse priors against high-fidelity measurements. To this end, we introduce
OmniFluids, a unified physics pre-trained operator learning framework that
integrates physics-only pre-training, coarse-grid operator distillation, and
few-shot fine-tuning, which enables fast inference and accurate prediction
under limited or zero data supervision. For architectural design, the key
components of OmniFluids include a mixture of operators, a multi-frame decoder,
and factorized Fourier layers, which enable efficient and scalable modeling of
diverse physical tasks while maintaining seamless integration with
physics-based supervision. Across a broad range of two- and three-dimensional
benchmarks, OmniFluids significantly outperforms state-of-the-art AI-driven
methods in flow field reconstruction and turbulence statistics accuracy,
delivering 10-100x speedups compared to classical solvers, and accurately
recovers unknown physical parameters from sparse, noisy data. This work
establishes a new paradigm for efficient and generalizable surrogate modeling
in complex fluid systems under limited data availability.

TL;DR: AI enhances human creativity through three modes: Support, Synergy, and Symbiosis, defined by AI autonomy and perceived agency, impacting creativity levels and raising theoretical, ethical, and design questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify how AI can effectively enhance human creativity by exploring distributed creativity perspectives.

Method: Identifies three modes (Support, Synergy, Symbiosis) based on AI autonomy and perceived agency, analyzing their impact on creativity levels.

Result: Different AI-human interaction modes influence creativity from problem-solving to innovation, with implications for theory, ethics, and design.

Conclusion: Understanding AI's role in creativity through these modes can guide future research and applications, addressing ethical and design challenges.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence holds significant potential to enhance human
creativity. However, achieving this vision requires a clearer understanding of
how such enhancement can be effectively realized. Adopting the perspective of
distributed creativity, we identify three primary modes through which AI can
contribute to creative processes: Support, where AI acts as a tool; Synergy,
where AI and humans collaborate in complementary ways; and Symbiosis, where
human and AI cognition become so integrated that they form a unified creative
system. These modes are defined along two key dimensions: the level of
technical autonomy exhibited by the AI system and the degree of perceived
agency attributed to it. We examine how each configuration influences different
levels of creativity - from everyday problem-solving to paradigm-shifting
innovation - and discuss the theoretical, ethical, and design implications.

TL;DR: This scoping review explores how generative AI (GAI) applications enhance social interaction, identifying trends in design, engagement forms, and methodologies, while addressing socio-ethical concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of reduced social connectedness threatens mental health and well-being, prompting investigation into GAI's role in improving social interactions.

Method: Analysis of 30 studies (2020 onwards) to identify trends in GAI application domains, design approaches, and evaluation methodologies.

Result: Key trends include storytelling, socio-emotional training, and collaborative learning, with participatory design fostering engagement. Socio-ethical concerns like bias and accessibility are noted.

Conclusion: GAI shows promise for personalized interactions but requires equitable design and inclusive evaluation to address ethical challenges.

Abstract: Reduced social connectedness increasingly poses a threat to mental health,
life expectancy, and general well-being. Generative AI (GAI) technologies, such
as large language models (LLMs) and image generation tools, are increasingly
integrated into applications aimed at enhancing human social experiences.
Despite their growing presence, little is known about how these technologies
influence social interactions. This scoping review investigates how GAI-based
applications are currently designed to facilitate social interaction, what
forms of social engagement they target, and which design and evaluation
methodologies designers use to create and evaluate them. Through an analysis of
30 studies published since 2020, we identify key trends in application domains
including storytelling, socio-emotional skills training, reminiscence,
collaborative learning, music making, and general conversation. We highlight
the role of participatory and co-design approaches in fostering both effective
technology use and social engagement, while also examining socio-ethical
concerns such as cultural bias and accessibility. This review underscores the
potential of GAI to support dynamic and personalized interactions, but calls
for greater attention to equitable design practices and inclusive evaluation
strategies.

*Rongfei Li,Francis Assadian*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper proposes an algorithm for optimizing camera location in eye-to-hand visual servoing to minimize image noise, ensuring efficient exploration and suboptimal placement with limited energy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research neglects the impact of camera location on image noise in eye-to-hand configurations, which affects observation quality in manufacturing.

Method: An adaptive algorithm explores the camera workspace to find optimal or suboptimal locations, using image averaging to enhance accuracy without filtering high-frequency data.

Result: Simulations demonstrate improved observation precision with limited energy, validating the algorithm's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The algorithm successfully addresses camera placement optimization, enhancing visual servoing performance in automated manufacturing.

Abstract: Visual servoing technology has been well developed and applied in many
automated manufacturing tasks, especially in tools' pose alignment. To access a
full global view of tools, most applications adopt eye-to-hand configuration or
eye-to-hand/eye-in-hand cooperation configuration in an automated manufacturing
environment. Most research papers mainly put efforts into developing control
and observation architectures in various scenarios, but few of them have
discussed the importance of the camera's location in eye-to-hand configuration.
In a manufacturing environment, the quality of camera estimations may vary
significantly from one observation location to another, as the combined effects
of environmental conditions result in different noise levels of a single image
shot at different locations. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for the
camera's moving policy so that it explores the camera workspace and searches
for the optimal location where the images' noise level is minimized. Also, this
algorithm ensures the camera ends up at a suboptimal (if the optimal one is
unreachable) location among the locations already searched, with limited energy
available for moving the camera. Unlike a simple brute force approach, the
algorithm enables the camera to explore space more efficiently by adapting the
search policy from learning the environment. With the aid of an image averaging
technique, this algorithm, in use of a solo camera, achieves the observation
accuracy in eye-to-hand configurations to a desirable extent without filtering
out high-frequency information in the original image. An automated
manufacturing application has been simulated and the results show the success
of this algorithm's improvement of observation precision with limited energy.

TL;DR: A method for fine-grained control in music generation using inference-time interventions on MusicGen, enabling timbre/style transfer and genre fusion via residual stream or attention layer steering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance control over music generation by allowing both global (text prompts) and local (steering activations) adjustments.

Method: Uses linear probes trained on the residual stream or attention layer activations, framed as a regression task for better performance.

Result: Improved directional information preservation in activation space, enabling precise control over music attributes.

Conclusion: The method successfully combines global and local control for nuanced music generation, with audio samples demonstrating its effectiveness.

Abstract: We present a method for fine-grained control over music generation through
inference-time interventions on an autoregressive generative music transformer
called MusicGen. Our approach enables timbre transfer, style transfer, and
genre fusion by steering the residual stream using weights of linear probes
trained on it, or by steering the attention layer activations in a similar
manner. We observe that modelling this as a regression task provides improved
performance, hypothesizing that the mean-squared-error better preserve
meaningful directional information in the activation space. Combined with the
global conditioning offered by text prompts in MusicGen, our method provides
both global and local control over music generation. Audio samples illustrating
our method are available at our demo page.

Result: Highlights key limitations, practical considerations, and open challenges in discrete audio tokenization.

Conclusion: Offers insights and guidance for future research in token-based audio processing.

Abstract: Discrete audio tokens are compact representations that aim to preserve
perceptual quality, phonetic content, and speaker characteristics while
enabling efficient storage and inference, as well as competitive performance
across diverse downstream tasks.They provide a practical alternative to
continuous features, enabling the integration of speech and audio into modern
large language models (LLMs). As interest in token-based audio processing
grows, various tokenization methods have emerged, and several surveys have
reviewed the latest progress in the field. However, existing studies often
focus on specific domains or tasks and lack a unified comparison across various
benchmarks. This paper presents a systematic review and benchmark of discrete
audio tokenizers, covering three domains: speech, music, and general audio. We
propose a taxonomy of tokenization approaches based on encoder-decoder,
quantization techniques, training paradigm, streamability, and application
domains. We evaluate tokenizers on multiple benchmarks for reconstruction,
downstream performance, and acoustic language modeling, and analyze trade-offs
through controlled ablation studies. Our findings highlight key limitations,
practical considerations, and open challenges, providing insight and guidance

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and optimize the mechanisms for transferring rich semantic audio representations to LLMs, which remain under-explored despite rapid application-focused progress.

Method: Proposes and evaluates architectural modifications (delayed audio integration, attention-only probing, diverse encoder ensembles) using a three-stage training curriculum on 5.6M audio-text pairs.

Result: Demonstrates 10-60% relative improvements over baseline, validating the effectiveness of the proposed modifications.

Conclusion: The study successfully optimizes cross-modal information transfer in audio-LLMs, highlighting the importance of architectural design choices.

Abstract: The integration of audio perception capabilities into Large Language Models
(LLMs) has enabled significant advances in Audio-LLMs. Although
application-focused developments, particularly in curating training data for
specific capabilities e.g., audio reasoning, have progressed rapidly, the
underlying mechanisms that govern efficient transfer of rich semantic
representations from audio encoders to LLMs remain under-explored. We
conceptualize effective audio-LLM interaction as the LLM's ability to
proficiently probe the audio encoder representations to satisfy textual
queries. This paper presents a systematic investigation on how architectural
design choices can affect that. Beginning with a standard Pengi/LLaVA-style
audio-LLM architecture, we propose and evaluate several modifications guided by
hypotheses derived from mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM
operational principles. Our experiments demonstrate that: (1) delaying audio
integration until the LLM's initial layers establish textual context that
enhances its ability to probe the audio representations for relevant
information; (2) the LLM can proficiently probe audio representations
exclusively through LLM layer's attention submodule, without requiring
propagation to its Feed-Forward Network (FFN) submodule; (3) an efficiently
integrated ensemble of diverse audio encoders provides richer, complementary
representations, thereby broadening the LLM's capacity to probe a wider
spectrum of audio information. All hypotheses are evaluated using an identical
three-stage training curriculum on a dataset of 5.6 million audio-text pairs,
ensuring controlled comparisons. Our final architecture, which incorporates all
proposed modifications, achieves relative improvements from 10\% to 60\% over
the baseline, validating our approach to optimizing cross-modal information
transfer in audio-LLMs. Project page: https://ta012.github.io/PAL/

*Chi Zuo,Martin B. Møller,Pablo Martínez-Nuevo,Huayang Huang,Yu Wu,Ye Zhu*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces BNMusic, a framework blending environmental noise into personalized music using text prompts, reducing noise noticeability without excessive volume.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional acoustic masking requires high volume due to misalignment between noise and masking sounds. Cross-modal generation offers an alternative.

Method: BNMusic synthesizes music from noise using mel-spectrograms, then adaptively amplifies it to blend noise effectively while preserving quality.

Result: Experiments on MusicBench, EPIC-SOUNDS, and ESC-50 show BNMusic successfully blends noise with rhythmically aligned, enjoyable music.

Conclusion: BNMusic improves acoustic experiences by minimizing noise noticeability through personalized, adaptively amplified music.

Abstract: While being disturbed by environmental noises, the acoustic masking technique
is a conventional way to reduce the annoyance in audio engineering that seeks
to cover up the noises with other dominant yet less intrusive sounds. However,
misalignment between the dominant sound and the noise-such as mismatched
downbeats-often requires an excessive volume increase to achieve effective
masking. Motivated by recent advances in cross-modal generation, in this work,
we introduce an alternative method to acoustic masking, aiming to reduce the
noticeability of environmental noises by blending them into personalized music
generated based on user-provided text prompts. Following the paradigm of music
generation using mel-spectrogram representations, we propose a Blending Noises
into Personalized Music (BNMusic) framework with two key stages. The first
stage synthesizes a complete piece of music in a mel-spectrogram representation
that encapsulates the musical essence of the noise. In the second stage, we
adaptively amplify the generated music segment to further reduce noise
perception and enhance the blending effectiveness, while preserving auditory
quality. Our experiments with comprehensive evaluations on MusicBench,
EPIC-SOUNDS, and ESC-50 demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework,
highlighting the ability to blend environmental noise with rhythmically
aligned, adaptively amplified, and enjoyable music segments, minimizing the
noticeability of the noise, thereby improving overall acoustic experiences.

*Toby Walsh*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper explores strategy-proof mechanisms for equitable facility location, using the Gini index. It proves an impossibility result for bounding approximation ratios of the optimal Gini index and suggests using the complemented Gini index instead. It also examines Nash welfare as an equitable compromise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of designing strategy-proof mechanisms that ensure equitability in facility location, measured by the Gini index, and to explore alternative measures like the complemented Gini index and Nash welfare.

Method: The study proves an impossibility result for strategy-proof mechanisms bounding the Gini index approximation ratio. It then evaluates deterministic and randomized mechanisms using the complemented Gini index and Nash welfare.

Result: No strategy-proof mechanism can bound the approximation ratio of the optimal Gini index. The complemented Gini index and Nash welfare are proposed as viable alternatives for approximation.

Conclusion: The complemented Gini index and Nash welfare offer practical solutions for achieving equitability in strategy-proof facility location mechanisms, overcoming the limitations of the Gini index.

Abstract: We consider strategy proof mechanisms for facility location which maximize
equitability between agents. As is common in the literature, we measure
equitability with the Gini index. We first prove a simple but fundamental
impossibility result that no strategy proof mechanism can bound the
approximation ratio of the optimal Gini index of utilities for one or more
facilities. We propose instead computing approximation ratios of the
complemented Gini index of utilities, and consider how well both deterministic
and randomized mechanisms approximate this. In addition, as Nash welfare is
often put forwards as an equitable compromise between egalitarian and
utilitarian outcomes, we consider how well mechanisms approximate the Nash
welfare.

Motivation: To bridge Levy's call-by-push-value lambda-calculus (CBPV) with the pi-calculus, addressing challenges like de Bruijn indices and bisimulation congruence.

Method: Encodes CBPV in the pi-i-calculus, asynchronous polyadic pi-calculus, and local pi-calculus, with informal proofs and partial Coq formalization.

completeness, and all required lemmas. The encoding is specialized to the
internal pi-calculus (pi-i-calculus) to circumvent certain challenges
associated with using de Bruijn index in a formalization, and it also helps
with bisimulation as early-, late- and open-bisimulation coincide in this
setting, furthermore bisimulation is a congruence. Additionally, we argue that
our encoding also satisfies the five criteria for good encodings proposed by
Gorla, as well as show similarities between Milners and our encoding. This
paper includes encodings from CBPV in the pi-i-calculus, asynchronous polyadic
pi-calculus and the local pi-calculus. We begin a formalization of the proof in
Coq for the soundness and completeness of the encoding in the pi-i-calculus.
Not all lemmas used in the formalization are themselves formally proven.
However, we argue that the non-proven lemmas are reasonable, as they are proven
by hand, or amount to Coq formalities that are straightforward given informal
arguments.

*Xiaolin Hu,Qinghua Zhou,Bogdan Grechuk,Ivan Y. Tyukin*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: StepProof introduces a novel autoformalization method for granular, sentence-level verification of proofs, improving success rates and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interactive theorem provers lack natural language interfaces, and existing autoformalization methods only verify complete proofs, not finer details.

Method: StepProof breaks proofs into verifiable subproofs for step-by-step verification and incorporates minor manual adjustments for optimization.

Result: StepProof significantly improves proof success rates and efficiency compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: StepProof addresses the limitations of existing autoformalization by enabling granular verification, with potential for further enhancements.

Abstract: Interactive theorem provers (ITPs) are powerful tools for the formal
verification of mathematical proofs down to the axiom level. However, their
lack of a natural language interface remains a significant limitation. Recent
advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enhanced the understanding of
natural language inputs, paving the way for autoformalization - the process of
translating natural language proofs into formal proofs that can be verified.
Despite these advancements, existing autoformalization approaches are limited
to verifying complete proofs and lack the capability for finer, sentence-level
verification. To address this gap, we propose StepProof, a novel
autoformalization method designed for granular, step-by-step verification.
StepProof breaks down complete proofs into multiple verifiable subproofs,
enabling sentence-level verification. Experimental results demonstrate that
StepProof significantly improves proof success rates and efficiency compared to
traditional methods. Additionally, we found that minor manual adjustments to
the natural language proofs, tailoring them for step-level verification,
further enhanced StepProof's performance in autoformalization.

*Yuliang Zhu,Jing Cheng,Qi Xie,Zhuo-Xu Cui,Qingyong Zhu,Yuanyuan Liu,Xin Liu,Jianfeng Ren,Chengbo Wang,Dong Liang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes DUN-SRE, a deep unrolling network with spatiotemporal rotation equivariance, to improve dynamic MRI reconstruction by modeling both spatial and temporal symmetries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ECNNs fail to model temporal symmetry, a key prior in dynamic MRI, limiting reconstruction quality under aggressive undersampling.

Method: DUN-SRE uses a (2+1)D equivariant convolutional architecture within a deep unrolling framework, integrating data consistency and proximal mapping while enforcing spatiotemporal symmetry constraints.

Result: DUN-SRE achieves state-of-the-art performance on Cardiac CINE MRI datasets, preserving rotation-symmetric structures and generalizing well.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively models spatiotemporal symmetries, improving dynamic MRI reconstruction accuracy and generalization.

Abstract: Dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) exhibits transformation symmetries,
including spatial rotation symmetry within individual frames and temporal
symmetry along the time dimension. Explicit incorporation of these symmetry
priors in the reconstruction model can significantly improve image quality,
especially under aggressive undersampling scenarios. Recently, Equivariant
convolutional neural network (ECNN) has shown great promise in exploiting
spatial symmetry priors. However, existing ECNNs critically fail to model
temporal symmetry, arguably the most universal and informative structural prior
in dynamic MRI reconstruction. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Deep
Unrolling Network with Spatiotemporal Rotation Equivariance (DUN-SRE) for
Dynamic MRI Reconstruction. The DUN-SRE establishes spatiotemporal equivariance
through a (2+1)D equivariant convolutional architecture. In particular, it
integrates both the data consistency and proximal mapping module into a unified
deep unrolling framework. This architecture ensures rigorous propagation of
spatiotemporal rotation symmetry constraints throughout the reconstruction
process, enabling more physically accurate modeling of cardiac motion dynamics
in cine MRI. In addition, a high-fidelity group filter parameterization
mechanism is developed to maintain representation precision while enforcing
symmetry constraints. Comprehensive experiments on Cardiac CINE MRI datasets
demonstrate that DUN-SRE achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in
preserving rotation-symmetric structures, offering strong generalization
capability to a broad range of dynamic MRI reconstruction tasks.

*Minye Shao,Zeyu Wang,Haoran Duan,Yawen Huang,Bing Zhai,Shizheng Wang,Yang Long,Yefeng Zheng*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HFF-Net, a frequency-domain approach for precise segmentation of contrast-enhancing brain tumors in MRI, addressing current limitations by decomposing images into low and high-frequency components and using adaptive convolution and cross-attention for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with segmenting contrast-enhancing brain tumor regions due to insufficient consideration of MRI-specific features like textures and directional variations.

Method: Proposes HFF-Net with Frequency Domain Decomposition (FDD), Adaptive Laplacian Convolution (ALC), and Frequency Domain Cross-Attention (FDCA) modules to enhance segmentation by leveraging frequency-domain features.

Result: Achieves average improvements of 4.48% in mean Dice scores and 7.33% in contrast-enhancing tumor segmentation across datasets.

Conclusion: HFF-Net outperforms existing methods in accuracy and efficiency, demonstrating clinical applicability.

Abstract: Precise segmentation of brain tumors, particularly contrast-enhancing regions
visible in post-contrast MRI (areas highlighted by contrast agent injection),
is crucial for accurate clinical diagnosis and treatment planning but remains
challenging. However, current methods exhibit notable performance degradation
in segmenting these enhancing brain tumor areas, largely due to insufficient
consideration of MRI-specific tumor features such as complex textures and
directional variations. To address this, we propose the Harmonized Frequency
Fusion Network (HFF-Net), which rethinks brain tumor segmentation from a
frequency-domain perspective. To comprehensively characterize tumor regions, we
develop a Frequency Domain Decomposition (FDD) module that separates MRI images
into low-frequency components, capturing smooth tumor contours and
high-frequency components, highlighting detailed textures and directional
edges. To further enhance sensitivity to tumor boundaries, we introduce an
Adaptive Laplacian Convolution (ALC) module that adaptively emphasizes critical
high-frequency details using dynamically updated convolution kernels. To
effectively fuse tumor features across multiple scales, we design a Frequency
Domain Cross-Attention (FDCA) integrating semantic, positional, and
slice-specific information. We further validate and interpret frequency-domain
improvements through visualization, theoretical reasoning, and experimental
analyses. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that
HFF-Net achieves an average relative improvement of 4.48\% (ranging from 2.39\%
to 7.72\%) in the mean Dice scores across the three major subregions, and an
average relative improvement of 7.33% (ranging from 5.96% to 8.64%) in the
segmentation of contrast-enhancing tumor regions, while maintaining favorable
computational efficiency and clinical applicability. Code:

*Emerson P. Grabke,Masoom A. Haider,Babak Taati*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CCELLA, a dual-head conditioning approach for latent diffusion models (LDMs) in medical imaging, addressing data scarcity and improving performance with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in medical LDM training, such as reliance on short-prompt text encoders, non-medical LDMs, or large data volumes, which hinder performance and accessibility.

Method: Proposes CCELLA, combining non-medical large language model-encoded text features and pathology classification via a joint loss function and data-efficient training framework.

Result: Achieves a 3D FID score of 0.025, outperforming a foundation model (FID 0.071), and boosts classifier accuracy from 69% to 74% with synthetic images.

Conclusion: CCELLA enables high-quality medical image synthesis with limited data, enhancing LDM performance and scientific accessibility.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDM) could alleviate data scarcity challenges
affecting machine learning development for medical imaging. However, medical
LDM training typically relies on performance- or scientific
accessibility-limiting strategies including a reliance on short-prompt text
encoders, the reuse of non-medical LDMs, or a requirement for fine-tuning with
large data volumes. We propose a Class-Conditioned Efficient Large Language
model Adapter (CCELLA) to address these limitations. CCELLA is a novel
dual-head conditioning approach that simultaneously conditions the LDM U-Net
with non-medical large language model-encoded text features through
cross-attention and with pathology classification through the timestep
embedding. We also propose a joint loss function and a data-efficient LDM
training framework. In combination, these strategies enable
pathology-conditioned LDM training for high-quality medical image synthesis
given limited data volume and human data annotation, improving LDM performance
and scientific accessibility. Our method achieves a 3D FID score of 0.025 on a
size-limited prostate MRI dataset, significantly outperforming a recent
foundation model with FID 0.071. When training a classifier for prostate cancer
prediction, adding synthetic images generated by our method to the training
dataset improves classifier accuracy from 69% to 74%. Training a classifier
solely on our method's synthetic images achieved comparable performance to
training on real images alone.

*Ana Lawry Aguila,Peirong Liu,Oula Puonti,Juan Eugenio Iglesias*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel conditional diffusion model framework for unsupervised anomaly detection in brain MRI outperforms existing methods by integrating synthetic pseudo-pathologies for better reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised learning for pathology detection requires diseased data, which is scarce for rare diseases. Unsupervised methods often fail to accurately reconstruct anomalies or healthy tissue.

Method: Introduces a weakly supervised approach using synthetic pseudo-pathology images generated via fluid-driven anomaly randomization to guide healthy image reconstruction.

Result: Outperforms variational autoencoders, conditional/unconditional latent diffusion, and even supervised inpainting methods on synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively detects anomalies and reconstructs healthy images without needing paired diseased/healthy data, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Supervised machine learning has enabled accurate pathology detection in brain
MRI, but requires training data from diseased subjects that may not be readily
available in some scenarios, for example, in the case of rare diseases.
Reconstruction-based unsupervised anomaly detection, in particular using
diffusion models, has gained popularity in the medical field as it allows for
training on healthy images alone, eliminating the need for large
disease-specific cohorts. These methods assume that a model trained on normal
data cannot accurately represent or reconstruct anomalies. However, this
assumption often fails with models failing to reconstruct healthy tissue or
accurately reconstruct abnormal regions i.e., failing to remove anomalies. In
this work, we introduce a novel conditional diffusion model framework for
anomaly detection and healthy image reconstruction in brain MRI. Our weakly
supervised approach integrates synthetically generated pseudo-pathology images
into the modeling process to better guide the reconstruction of healthy images.
To generate these pseudo-pathologies, we apply fluid-driven anomaly
randomization to augment real pathology segmentation maps from an auxiliary
dataset, ensuring that the synthetic anomalies are both realistic and
anatomically coherent. We evaluate our model's ability to detect pathology,
using both synthetic anomaly datasets and real pathology from the ATLAS
dataset. In our extensive experiments, our model: (i) consistently outperforms
variational autoencoders, and conditional and unconditional latent diffusion;
and (ii) surpasses on most datasets, the performance of supervised inpainting
methods with access to paired diseased/healthy images.

*Cheng Wang,Siqi Chen,Donghua Mi,Yang Chen,Yudong Zhang,Yinsheng Li*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: SWDL-Net is a semi-supervised learning framework for intracranial hemorrhage segmentation, combining Laplacian pyramid and deep convolutional upsampling to improve detail and boundary accuracy with minimal labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation for intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is costly and tedious, creating a need for efficient semi-supervised learning methods to reduce reliance on labeled data.

Method: Proposes SWDL-Net, integrating Laplacian pyramid for edge sharpening and deep convolutions for detail precision, leveraging a difference learning mechanism.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods with only 2% labeled data on ICH datasets and shows superiority on the BHSD dataset with 5% labeled data.

Conclusion: SWDL-Net effectively addresses the challenge of limited labeled data in medical image segmentation, offering a robust solution for ICH detection.

Abstract: Recent advances in medical imaging have established deep learning-based
segmentation as the predominant approach, though it typically requires large
amounts of manually annotated data. However, obtaining annotations for
intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) remains particularly challenging due to the
tedious and costly labeling process. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged
as a promising solution to address the scarcity of labeled data, especially in
volumetric medical image segmentation. Unlike conventional SSL methods that
primarily focus on high-confidence pseudo-labels or consistency regularization,
we propose SWDL-Net, a novel SSL framework that exploits the complementary
advantages of Laplacian pyramid and deep convolutional upsampling. The
Laplacian pyramid excels at edge sharpening, while deep convolutions enhance
detail precision through flexible feature mapping. Our framework achieves
superior segmentation of lesion details and boundaries through a difference
learning mechanism that effectively integrates these complementary approaches.
Extensive experiments on a 271-case ICH dataset and public benchmarks
demonstrate that SWDL-Net outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in
scenarios with only 2% labeled data. Additional evaluations on the publicly
available Brain Hemorrhage Segmentation Dataset (BHSD) with 5% labeled data
further confirm the superiority of our approach. Code and data have been
released at https://github.com/SIAT-CT-LAB/SWDL.

*Xi Chen,Zhiqiang Shen,Peng Cao,Jinzhu Yang,Osmar R. Zaiane*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: ConStyX improves medical image segmentation by augmenting content and style, addressing domain shifts and over-augmentation issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shifts in medical images impair segmentation models; existing DG methods rely solely on style perturbation and ignore over-augmentation effects.

Method: Proposes ConStyX, which augments both content and style of training data and mitigates negative effects of over-augmented features.

Result: ConStyX achieves superior generalization performance across multiple domains.

Conclusion: ConStyX effectively addresses domain generalization challenges in medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Medical images are usually collected from multiple domains, leading to domain
shifts that impair the performance of medical image segmentation models. Domain
Generalization (DG) aims to address this issue by training a robust model with
strong generalizability. Recently, numerous domain randomization-based DG
methods have been proposed. However, these methods suffer from the following
limitations: 1) constrained efficiency of domain randomization due to their
exclusive dependence on image style perturbation, and 2) neglect of the adverse
effects of over-augmented images on model training. To address these issues, we
propose a novel domain randomization-based DG method, called content style
augmentation (ConStyX), for generalizable medical image segmentation.
Specifically, ConStyX 1) augments the content and style of training data,
allowing the augmented training data to better cover a wider range of data
domains, and 2) leverages well-augmented features while mitigating the negative
effects of over-augmented features during model training. Extensive experiments
across multiple domains demonstrate that our ConStyX achieves superior
generalization performance. The code is available at

Motivation: To investigate the application and adaptation of generalist models, like SAM, in medical image segmentation, addressing gaps in the field.

Method: Comprehensive review of SAM variants (zero-shot, few-shot, fine-tuning, etc.), performance analysis, and comparison with task-specific models.

Result: Highlights the potential of generalist models but notes challenges in regulatory compliance, privacy, and AI trustworthiness.

Conclusion: Future directions include synthetic data, early fusion, NLP-inspired methods, agentic AI, and clinical translation.

Abstract: Following the successful paradigm shift of large language models, leveraging

The introduction of Segment Anything Model (SAM) set a milestone on
segmentation of natural images, inspiring the design of a multitude of
architectures for medical image segmentation. In this survey we offer a
comprehensive and in-depth investigation on generalist models for medical image
segmentation. We start with an introduction on the fundamentals concepts
underpinning their development. Then, we provide a taxonomy on the different
declinations of SAM in terms of zero-shot, few-shot, fine-tuning, adapters, on
the recent SAM 2, on other innovative models trained on images alone, and
others trained on both text and images. We thoroughly analyze their
performances at the level of both primary research and best-in-literature,
followed by a rigorous comparison with the state-of-the-art task-specific
models. We emphasize the need to address challenges in terms of compliance with
regulatory frameworks, privacy and security laws, budget, and trustworthy
artificial intelligence (AI). Finally, we share our perspective on future
directions concerning synthetic data, early fusion, lessons learnt from
generalist models in natural language processing, agentic AI and physical AI,
and clinical translation.

*Zhenhuan Zhou*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Med-URWKV is a pure RWKV-based medical image segmentation model leveraging pre-trained VRWKV encoders, outperforming scratch-trained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods (CNN, Transformer, hybrid) have limitations like restricted receptive fields or high computational costs. RWKV offers linear complexity and strong long-range modeling, but its potential with pre-trained models in medical segmentation is unexplored.

Method: Proposes Med-URWKV, a U-Net-based pure RWKV architecture using ImageNet-pretrained VRWKV encoders.

Result: Outperforms scratch-trained RWKV models on seven datasets, validating the effectiveness of pre-trained encoders.

Conclusion: Med-URWKV demonstrates the advantage of pre-trained RWKV models in medical segmentation, achieving competitive or superior performance.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a fundamental and key technology in
computer-aided diagnosis and treatment. Previous methods can be broadly
classified into three categories: convolutional neural network (CNN) based,
Transformer based, and hybrid architectures that combine both. However, each of
them has its own limitations, such as restricted receptive fields in CNNs or
the computational overhead caused by the quadratic complexity of Transformers.
Recently, the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) model has emerged as a
promising alternative for various vision tasks, offering strong long-range
modeling capabilities with linear computational complexity. Some studies have
also adapted RWKV to medical image segmentation tasks, achieving competitive
performance. However, most of these studies focus on modifications to the
Vision-RWKV (VRWKV) mechanism and train models from scratch, without exploring
the potential advantages of leveraging pre-trained VRWKV models for medical
image segmentation tasks. In this paper, we propose Med-URWKV, a pure
RWKV-based architecture built upon the U-Net framework, which incorporates
ImageNet-based pretraining to further explore the potential of RWKV in medical
image segmentation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, Med-URWKV is the first
pure RWKV segmentation model in the medical field that can directly reuse a
large-scale pre-trained VRWKV encoder. Experimental results on seven datasets
demonstrate that Med-URWKV achieves comparable or even superior segmentation
performance compared to other carefully optimized RWKV models trained from
scratch. This validates the effectiveness of using a pretrained VRWKV encoder
in enhancing model performance. The codes will be released.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: An AI algorithm is proposed to detect and categorize artifacts in digital pathology slides, improving quality assurance by reducing manual review time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quality assurance in digital pathology is underexplored, and current methods lack deep learning, which could enhance accuracy and scalability.

Method: The algorithm analyzes tiles, categorizing them into 10 artifact types or background, and creates an artifact map. Models were trained on annotated slides, with InceptionResNet selected after ablation studies.

Result: A hybrid design combining single-artifact binary models and multiple instance models is suggested for optimal artifact detection.

Conclusion: The proposed AI solution addresses gaps in digital pathology quality assurance, offering scalable and accurate artifact detection.

Abstract: Quality assurance is a critical but underexplored area in digital pathology,
where even minor artifacts can have significant effects. Artifacts have been
shown to negatively impact the performance of AI diagnostic models. In current
practice, trained staff manually review digitized images prior to release of
these slides to pathologists which are then used to render a diagnosis.
Conventional image processing approaches, provide a foundation for detecting
artifacts on digital pathology slides. However, current tools do not leverage
deep learning, which has the potential to improve detection accuracy and
scalability. Despite these advancements, methods for quality assurance in
digital pathology remain limited, presenting a gap for innovation.
  We propose an AI algorithm designed to screen digital pathology slides by
analyzing tiles and categorizing them into one of 10 predefined artifact types
or as background. This algorithm identifies and localizes artifacts, creating a
map that highlights regions of interest. By directing human operators to
specific tiles affected by artifacts, the algorithm minimizes the time and
effort required to manually review entire slides for quality issues.
  From internal archives and The Cancer Genome Atlas, 133 whole slide images
were selected and 10 artifacts were annotated using an internally developed
software ZAPP (Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL). Ablation study of multiple
models at different tile sizes and magnification was performed. InceptionResNet
was selected. Single artifact models were trained and tested, followed by a
limited multiple instance model with artifacts that performed well together
(chatter, fold, and pen). From the results of this study we suggest a hybrid
design for artifact screening composed of both single artifact binary models as
well as multiple instance models to optimize detection of each artifact.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of fixed-split DNNs in IoT, which lack adaptability to varying computational budgets and channel conditions.

Method: Proposes a learning-assisted genetic algorithm (LAIGA) to explore CNN hyperparameters, discarding infeasible configurations and using Random Forests for efficiency.

Result: Achieves 10% higher classification accuracy than existing methods, especially under low SNR (-10dB) and limited computational budgets (1M-70M FLOPs).

Conclusion: The LAIGA-based framework effectively adapts to dynamic IoT conditions, improving performance over static and SNR-adaptive methods.

Abstract: Sensor-based local inference at IoT devices faces severe computational
limitations, often requiring data transmission over noisy wireless channels for
server-side processing. To address this, split-network Deep Neural Network
(DNN) based Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) schemes are used to extract and
transmit relevant features instead of raw data. However, most existing methods
rely on fixed network splits and static configurations, lacking adaptability to
varying computational budgets and channel conditions. In this paper, we propose
a novel SNR- and computation-adaptive distributed CNN framework for wireless
image classification across IoT devices and edge servers. We introduce a
learning-assisted intelligent Genetic Algorithm (LAIGA) that efficiently
explores the CNN hyperparameter space to optimize network configuration under
given FLOPs constraints and given SNR. LAIGA intelligently discards the
infeasible network configurations that exceed computational budget at IoT
device. It also benefits from the Random Forests based learning assistance to
avoid a thorough exploration of hyperparameter space and to induce application
specific bias in candidate optimal configurations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms fixed-split architectures
and existing SNR-adaptive methods, especially under low SNR and limited
computational resources. We achieve a 10\% increase in classification accuracy
as compared to existing JSCC based SNR-adaptive multilayer framework at an SNR
as low as -10dB across a range of available computational budget (1M to 70M
FLOPs) at IoT device.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multiscale control variates strategy and surrogate models (SAPNNs) to improve Monte Carlo sampling efficiency for high-dimensional kinetic equations with stochastic parameters, achieving better accuracy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Monte Carlo methods for uncertainty quantification in high-dimensional kinetic equations suffer from slow convergence and high variance.

Method: The method combines multiscale control variates (using low-fidelity models) with structure and asymptotic preserving neural networks (SAPNNs) trained on low-fidelity data and enriched with high-fidelity samples.

Result: The approach significantly reduces variance while preserving physical consistency and asymptotic accuracy, outperforming standard Monte Carlo techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology enables efficient large-scale prediction in kinetic uncertainty quantification, validated in various regimes.

Abstract: The high dimensionality of kinetic equations with stochastic parameters poses
major computational challenges for uncertainty quantification (UQ). Traditional
Monte Carlo (MC) sampling methods, while widely used, suffer from slow
convergence and high variance, which become increasingly severe as the
dimensionality of the parameter space grows. To accelerate MC sampling, we
adopt a multiscale control variates strategy that leverages low-fidelity
solutions from simplified kinetic models to reduce variance. To further improve
sampling efficiency and preserve the underlying physics, we introduce surrogate
models based on structure and asymptotic preserving neural networks (SAPNNs).
These deep neural networks are specifically designed to satisfy key physical
properties, including positivity, conservation laws, entropy dissipation, and
asymptotic limits. By training the SAPNNs on low-fidelity models and enriching
them with selected high-fidelity samples from the full Boltzmann equation, our
method achieves significant variance reduction while maintaining physical
consistency and asymptotic accuracy. The proposed methodology enables efficient
large-scale prediction in kinetic UQ and is validated across both homogeneous
and nonhomogeneous multiscale regimes. Numerical results demonstrate improved
accuracy and computational efficiency compared to standard MC techniques.

Motivation: Lack of standardized benchmarks for evaluating machine learning methods in enzyme function prediction.

Result: CARE offers a framework for evaluating generalization in enzyme function prediction, with proposed baselines for retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: CARE fills a gap in standardized evaluation for enzyme function prediction, aiding future research and method development.

Abstract: Enzymes are important proteins that catalyze chemical reactions. In recent
years, machine learning methods have emerged to predict enzyme function from
sequence; however, there are no standardized benchmarks to evaluate these
methods. We introduce CARE, a benchmark and dataset suite for the
Classification And Retrieval of Enzymes (CARE). CARE centers on two tasks: (1)
classification of a protein sequence by its enzyme commission (EC) number and
(2) retrieval of an EC number given a chemical reaction. For each task, we
design train-test splits to evaluate different kinds of out-of-distribution
generalization that are relevant to real use cases. For the classification
task, we provide baselines for state-of-the-art methods. Because the retrieval
task has not been previously formalized, we propose a method called Contrastive
Reaction-EnzymE Pretraining (CREEP) as one of the first baselines for this task
and compare it to the recent method, CLIPZyme. CARE is available at

*Chuqiao Zhang,Sarath Chandra Dantu,Debarghya Mitra,Dalia Chakrabarty*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: The paper presents three methods to identify critical residues in a protein using Random Geometric Graphs (RGGs), comparing their effectiveness against experimentally confirmed critical residues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Critical residues are essential for protein function, and identifying them is crucial for understanding protein behavior.

Method: Three approaches are used: 1) learning an RGG with organic thresholding and measuring nodal degree, 2) ranking residues by posterior probability differences, and 3) tracking dynamical variation of nodal degrees during protein evolution.

Result: The methods are compared against experimentally confirmed critical residues to evaluate their accuracy.

Conclusion: The study provides novel ways to identify critical residues, contributing to protein function analysis.

Abstract: Identification of critical residues of a protein is actively pursued, since
such residues are essential for protein function. We present three ways of
recognising critical residues of an example protein, the evolution of which is
tracked via molecular dynamical simulations. Our methods are based on learning
a Random Geometric Graph (RGG) variable, where the state variable of each of
156 residues, is attached to a node of this graph, with the RGG learnt using
the matrix of correlations between state variables of each residue-pair. Given
the categorical nature of the state variable, correlation between a residue
pair is computed using Cramer's V. We advance an organic thresholding to learn
an RGG, and compare results against extant thresholding techniques, when
parametrising criticality as the nodal degree in the learnt RGG. Secondly, we
develop a criticality measure by ranking the computed differences between the
posterior probability of the full graph variable defined on all 156 residues,
and that of the graph with all but one residue omitted. A third parametrisation
of criticality informs on the dynamical variation of nodal degrees as the
protein evolves during the simulation. Finally, we compare results obtained
with the three distinct criticality parameters, against
experimentally-ascertained critical residues.

TL;DR: An end-to-end system using ChatGPT enables non-technical users to assign complex data collection tasks to robots via natural language, leveraging IEEE task standards and ROS2 for execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify the deployment of robotic systems in precision agriculture for non-technical users by enabling natural language task assignment.

Method: Uses large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to interpret natural language instructions, encodes tasks with IEEE standards, and executes them via ROS2 nodes.

Result: Demonstrates the system's capability to handle complex tasks, though highlights LLM limitations in spatial reasoning and routing.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively bridges the gap between non-technical users and robotic task execution, addressing LLM limitations with practical implementations.

Abstract: Robotics and artificial intelligence hold significant potential for advancing
precision agriculture. While robotic systems have been successfully deployed
for various tasks, adapting them to perform diverse missions remains
challenging, particularly because end users often lack technical expertise. In
this paper, we present an end-to-end system that leverages large language
models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT, to enable users to assign complex data
collection tasks to autonomous robots using natural language instructions. To
enhance reusability, mission plans are encoded using an existing IEEE task
specification standard, and are executed on robots via ROS2 nodes that bridge
high-level mission descriptions with existing ROS libraries. Through extensive
experiments, we highlight the strengths and limitations of LLMs in this
context, particularly regarding spatial reasoning and solving complex routing
challenges, and show how our proposed implementation overcomes them.

TL;DR: A natural language robotic mission planner for precision agriculture simplifies robot control for non-technical users using LLMs and predefined primitives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce complexity and learning curves for non-technical farmers adopting AI-driven agricultural tools.

Method: Leverages large language models (LLMs) and predefined primitives to translate human language into executable robotic commands.

Result: The system supports diverse robots and executes complex missions without coding, validated through manipulation and vision tasks.

Conclusion: Advances accessibility of robotic automation in precision agriculture for non-specialists.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is transforming precision agriculture, offering
farmers new tools to streamline their daily operations. While these
technological advances promise increased efficiency, they often introduce
additional complexity and steep learning curves that are particularly
challenging for non-technical users who must balance tech adoption with
existing workloads. In this paper, we present a natural language (NL) robotic
mission planner that enables non-specialists to control heterogeneous robots
through a common interface. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) and
predefined primitives, our architecture seamlessly translates human language
into intermediate descriptions that can be executed by different robotic
platforms. With this system, users can formulate complex agricultural missions
without writing any code. In the work presented in this paper, we extend our
previous system tailored for wheeled robot mission planning through a new class
of experiments involving robotic manipulation and computer vision tasks. Our
results demonstrate that the architecture is both general enough to support a
diverse set of robots and powerful enough to execute complex mission requests.
This work represents a significant step toward making robotic automation in
precision agriculture more accessible to non-technical users.

TL;DR: A modular VLN framework decouples vision-language understanding from action planning, using a frozen LVLM and lightweight logic for flexible, fast navigation. Initial results show challenges in generalization but highlight scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational cost and real-time deployment challenges in VLN by leveraging LVLMs without extensive fine-tuning.

Method: Integrates Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct with lightweight planning, prompt engineering, structured history, and two-frame visual input for decision-making.

Result: Tested on Room-to-Room (VLN-CE), showing generalization challenges but proving modularity's potential for efficiency.

Conclusion: The modular approach is scalable and efficient, with future improvements possible via better environmental priors and multimodal inputs.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) presents a complex challenge in embodied
AI, requiring agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate
through visually rich, unfamiliar environments. Recent advances in large
vision-language models (LVLMs), such as CLIP and Flamingo, have significantly
improved multimodal understanding but introduced new challenges related to
computational cost and real-time deployment. In this project, we propose a
modular, plug-and-play navigation framework that decouples vision-language
understanding from action planning. By integrating a frozen vision-language
model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, with lightweight planning logic, we aim to
achieve flexible, fast, and adaptable navigation without extensive model
fine-tuning. Our framework leverages prompt engineering, structured history
management, and a two-frame visual input strategy to enhance decision-making
continuity across navigation steps. We evaluate our system on the Room-to-Room
benchmark within the VLN-CE setting using the Matterport3D dataset and
Habitat-Lab simulation environment. Although our initial results reveal
challenges in generalizing to unseen environments under strict evaluation
settings, our modular approach lays a foundation for scalable and efficient
navigation systems, highlighting promising directions for future improvement
through enhanced environmental priors and expanded multimodal input
integration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate lane-topology prediction is essential for autonomous navigation, and leveraging natural language conventions (e.g., road design codes and names) can enhance understanding of road environments.

Method: The authors augment the SMERF model with structured road metadata from OSM maps and lane-width priors from design manuals, combining these with road centerline encodings.

Result: Evaluated on geo-diverse complex intersections, the method improves lane and traffic element detection and their association, demonstrated by four topology-aware metrics.

Conclusion: The approach generalizes and scales effectively across diverse topologies and conditions, enhancing autonomous navigation reliability.

Abstract: Lane-topology prediction is a critical component of safe and reliable
autonomous navigation. An accurate understanding of the road environment aids
this task. We observe that this information often follows conventions encoded
in natural language, through design codes that reflect the road structure and
road names that capture the road functionality. We augment this information in
a lightweight manner to SMERF, a map-prior-based online lane-topology
prediction model, by combining structured road metadata from OSM maps and
lane-width priors from Road design manuals with the road centerline encodings.
We evaluate our method on two geo-diverse complex intersection scenarios. Our
method shows improvement in both lane and traffic element detection and their
association. We report results using four topology-aware metrics to
comprehensively assess the model performance. These results demonstrate the
ability of our approach to generalize and scale to diverse topologies and

TL;DR: Gaussian Mixture Copula Models (GMCM) are introduced for modeling driving scenarios in automated driving safety validation, outperforming Gaussian Mixture Models and Gaussian Copula Models in fitting real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate joint probability distribution of scenario parameters is crucial for scenario-based safety assessment in automated driving systems.

Method: GMCM combines Gaussian Mixture Models' multimodal expressivity with copulas' flexibility to model marginal distributions and dependencies separately. Benchmarking against Gaussian Mixture Models and Gaussian Copula Models using real-world driving data.

Result: GMCM provides a better fit to data (18 million scenario instances) in terms of likelihood and Sinkhorn distance.

Conclusion: GMCM is a promising foundation for future scenario-based validation frameworks in automated driving safety.

Abstract: This paper presents the first application of Gaussian Mixture Copula Models
to the statistical modeling of driving scenarios for the safety validation of
automated driving systems. Knowledge of the joint probability distribution of
scenario parameters is essential for scenario-based safety assessment, where
risk quantification depends on the likelihood of concrete parameter
combinations. Gaussian Mixture Copula Models bring together the multimodal
expressivity of Gaussian Mixture Models and the flexibility of copulas,
enabling separate modeling of marginal distributions and dependencies. We
benchmark Gaussian Mixture Copula Models against previously proposed approaches
- Gaussian Mixture Models and Gaussian Copula Models - using real-world driving
data drawn from scenarios defined in United Nations Regulation No. 157. Our
evaluation across 18 million scenario instances demonstrates that Gaussian
Mixture Copula Models provide a better fit to the data in terms of both
likelihood and Sinkhorn distance. These results suggest that Gaussian Mixture
Copula Models are a compelling foundation for future scenario-based validation
frameworks.

TL;DR: Autonomous learning from sparsely-labeled industrial data improves robotic picking performance using multi-modal visual encoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of picking diverse items from unstructured piles in real-world settings like warehouses, requiring open-set functionality and low latency.

Method: Utilizes RGB, depth, and semantic segmentation to predict multi-suction pick success, trained via multimodal pretrain and finetune on real-world data.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation shows improved performance across diverse item configurations, pick scenes, and object types, with insights from ablations on modality importance.

Conclusion: Multi-modal training is crucial, and models can learn inter-modal relationships during pretraining, enabling effective inference with fewer modalities.

Abstract: This work demonstrates how autonomously learning aspects of robotic operation
from sparsely-labeled, real-world data of deployed, engineered solutions at
industrial scale can provide with solutions that achieve improved performance.
Specifically, it focuses on multi-suction robot picking and performs a
comprehensive study on the application of multi-modal visual encoders for
predicting the success of candidate robotic picks. Picking diverse items from
unstructured piles is an important and challenging task for robot manipulation
in real-world settings, such as warehouses. Methods for picking from clutter
must work for an open set of items while simultaneously meeting latency
constraints to achieve high throughput. The demonstrated approach utilizes
multiple input modalities, such as RGB, depth and semantic segmentation, to
estimate the quality of candidate multi-suction picks. The strategy is trained
from real-world item picking data, with a combination of multimodal pretrain
and finetune. The manuscript provides comprehensive experimental evaluation
performed over a large item-picking dataset, an item-picking dataset targeted
to include partial occlusions, and a package-picking dataset, which focuses on
containers, such as boxes and envelopes, instead of unpackaged items. The
evaluation measures performance for different item configurations, pick scenes,
and object types. Ablations help to understand the effects of in-domain
pretraining, the impact of different modalities and the importance of
finetuning. These ablations reveal both the importance of training over
multiple modalities but also the ability of models to learn during pretraining
the relationship between modalities so that during finetuning and inference,
only a subset of them can be used as input.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: EyeRobot is a robotic system with gaze behavior trained using reinforcement learning to achieve hand-eye coordination for manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans actively look to act, inspiring the development of EyeRobot to mimic this behavior for robotic task completion.

Method: A mechanical eyeball is trained with a gaze policy using reinforcement learning, supported by teleoperated demonstrations and a BC-RL loop for joint hand-eye training.

Result: EyeRobot shows effective hand-eye coordination, stable fixation, and improved tracking, enabling manipulation in large workspaces with a single camera.

Conclusion: EyeRobot successfully demonstrates task-driven gaze behavior and hand-eye coordination, validated on panoramic workspace manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Humans do not passively observe the visual world -- we actively look in order
to act. Motivated by this principle, we introduce EyeRobot, a robotic system
with gaze behavior that emerges from the need to complete real-world tasks. We
develop a mechanical eyeball that can freely rotate to observe its surroundings
and train a gaze policy to control it using reinforcement learning. We
accomplish this by first collecting teleoperated demonstrations paired with a
360 camera. This data is imported into a simulation environment that supports
rendering arbitrary eyeball viewpoints, allowing episode rollouts of eye gaze
on top of robot demonstrations. We then introduce a BC-RL loop to train the
hand and eye jointly: the hand (BC) agent is trained from rendered eye
observations, and the eye (RL) agent is rewarded when the hand produces correct
action predictions. In this way, hand-eye coordination emerges as the eye looks
towards regions which allow the hand to complete the task. EyeRobot implements
a foveal-inspired policy architecture allowing high resolution with a small
compute budget, which we find also leads to the emergence of more stable
fixation as well as improved ability to track objects and ignore distractors.
We evaluate EyeRobot on five panoramic workspace manipulation tasks requiring
manipulation in an arc surrounding the robot arm. Our experiments suggest
EyeRobot exhibits hand-eye coordination behaviors which effectively facilitate
manipulation over large workspaces with a single camera. See project site for

TL;DR: VLFly is a framework for UAVs to perform language-guided navigation using continuous velocity commands from monocular camera inputs, addressing generalization and action space limitations in VLN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of generalization to out-of-distribution environments and reliance on fixed discrete action spaces in vision-and-language navigation (VLN).

Method: VLFly integrates an instruction encoder (LLM), goal retriever (VLM), and waypoint planner to generate trajectories from egocentric observations.

Result: VLFly outperforms baselines in simulations and achieves robust open-vocabulary goal understanding in real-world VLN tasks.

Conclusion: VLFly demonstrates generalized navigation capabilities and handles abstract language input effectively, even without localization sensors.

Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is a long-standing challenge in
autonomous robotics, aiming to empower agents with the ability to follow human
instructions while navigating complex environments. Two key bottlenecks remain
in this field: generalization to out-of-distribution environments and reliance
on fixed discrete action spaces. To address these challenges, we propose
Vision-Language Fly (VLFly), a framework tailored for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs) to execute language-guided flight. Without the requirement for
localization or active ranging sensors, VLFly outputs continuous velocity
commands purely from egocentric observations captured by an onboard monocular
camera. The VLFly integrates three modules: an instruction encoder based on a
large language model (LLM) that reformulates high-level language into
structured prompts, a goal retriever powered by a vision-language model (VLM)
that matches these prompts to goal images via vision-language similarity, and a
waypoint planner that generates executable trajectories for real-time UAV
control. VLFly is evaluated across diverse simulation environments without
additional fine-tuning and consistently outperforms all baselines. Moreover,
real-world VLN tasks in indoor and outdoor environments under direct and
indirect instructions demonstrate that VLFly achieves robust open-vocabulary
goal understanding and generalized navigation capabilities, even in the
presence of abstract language input.

TL;DR: A data-driven modeling approach combining dimension reduction, surrogate modeling, and data assimilation significantly reduces computational time while maintaining accuracy for robot motion interaction with granular terrain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To gain insights into robot motion interaction with granular terrain efficiently, avoiding the high computational cost of physics-based simulations.

Method: Integrates Sequentially Truncated Higher-Order Singular Value Decomposition, Gaussian Process surrogate modeling, and Reduced Order Particle Filter for data assimilation. Uses offline high-fidelity simulation data and sparse experimental data.

Result: Achieves orders of magnitude reduction in computational time with comparable accuracy to simulations. With experimental data, it outperforms simulations for long-horizon predictions and reproduces scaling relationships.

Conclusion: The approach aids robot navigation in complex terrains, offering efficient and accurate predictions for both online and offline phases.

Abstract: An alternative data-driven modeling approach has been proposed and employed
to gain fundamental insights into robot motion interaction with granular
terrain at certain length scales. The approach is based on an integration of
dimension reduction (Sequentially Truncated Higher-Order Singular Value
Decomposition), surrogate modeling (Gaussian Process), and data assimilation
techniques (Reduced Order Particle Filter). This approach can be used online
and is based on offline data, obtained from the offline collection of
high-fidelity simulation data and a set of sparse experimental data. The
results have shown that orders of magnitude reduction in computational time can
be obtained from the proposed data-driven modeling approach compared with
physics-based high-fidelity simulations. With only simulation data as input,
the data-driven prediction technique can generate predictions that have
comparable accuracy as simulations. With both simulation data and sparse
physical experimental measurement as input, the data-driven approach with its
embedded data assimilation techniques has the potential in outperforming only
high-fidelity simulations for the long-horizon predictions. In addition, it is
demonstrated that the data-driven modeling approach can also reproduce the
scaling relationship recovered by physics-based simulations for maximum
resistive forces, which may indicate its general predictability beyond a
case-by-case basis. The results are expected to help robot navigation and
exploration in unknown and complex terrains during both online and offline
phases.

Method: Comprehensive evaluation of 19 SSL methods on nine datasets, focusing on batch correction, cell type annotation, and missing modality prediction, plus systematic assessment of data augmentations.

Result: Specialized frameworks (scVI, CLAIRE, scGPT) excel in uni-modal batch correction, while generic SSL methods (VICReg, SimCLR) perform better in cell typing and multi-modal integration. Random masking is the most effective augmentation.

Conclusion: scSSL-Bench provides a standardized platform and recommendations for SSL in single-cell analysis, highlighting the need for specialized multi-modal frameworks.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has proven to be a powerful approach for

present scSSL-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates nineteen SSL
methods. Our evaluation spans nine datasets and focuses on three common
downstream tasks: batch correction, cell type annotation, and missing modality
prediction. Furthermore, we systematically assess various data augmentation
strategies. Our analysis reveals task-specific trade-offs: the specialized
single-cell frameworks, scVI, CLAIRE, and the finetuned scGPT excel at
uni-modal batch correction, while generic SSL methods, such as VICReg and
SimCLR, demonstrate superior performance in cell typing and multi-modal data
integration. Random masking emerges as the most effective augmentation
technique across all tasks, surpassing domain-specific augmentations. Notably,
our results indicate the need for a specialized single-cell multi-modal data

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate gLMs for generating functional DNA sequences by assessing their ability to predict mutation effects.

Method: Introduces Nullsettes tasks to test mutation effect prediction across 12 state-of-the-art models, analyzing performance correlation with nonmutant likelihood and sequence length.

Result: Mutation effect prediction performance correlates with nonmutant likelihood and varies with sequence length.

Conclusion: Sequence likelihood and length are critical factors for using gLMs in mutation effect prediction.

Abstract: Genomic language models (gLMs) show potential for generating novel,
functional DNA sequences for synthetic biology, but doing so requires them to
learn not just evolutionary plausibility, but also sequence-to-function
relationships. We introduce a set of prediction tasks called Nullsettes, which
assesses a model's ability to predict loss-of-function mutations created by
translocating key control elements in synthetic expression cassettes. Across 12
state-of-the-art models, we find that mutation effect prediction performance
strongly correlates with the predicted likelihood of the nonmutant.
Furthermore, the range of likelihood values predictive of strong model
performance is highly dependent on sequence length. Our work highlights the
importance of considering both sequence likelihood and sequence length when
using gLMs for mutation effect prediction.

Motivation: To identify homogeneous subcohorts in inhomogeneous datasets, aiding in disease pathway and therapeutic discovery.

Result: The algorithm identifies subcohorts with significant changes in methylation and gene expression, useful for targeted research.

Conclusion: The method effectively identifies homogeneous subcohorts, enhancing precision in disease research and treatment development.

Abstract: We design an efficient algorithm that outputs a linear classifier for
identifying homogeneous subsets (equivalently subcohorts) from large
inhomogeneous datasets. Our theoretical contribution is a rounding technique,
similar to that of Goemans and Williamson (1994), that approximates the optimal
solution of the underlying optimization problem within a factor of $0.82$. As
an application, we use our algorithm to design a simple test that can identify
homogeneous subcohorts of patients, that are mainly comprised of metastatic
cases, from the RNA microarray dataset for breast cancer by Curtis et al.
(2012). Furthermore, we also use the test output by the algorithm to
systematically identify subcohorts of patients in which statistically
significant changes in methylation levels of tumor suppressor genes co-occur
with statistically significant changes in nuclear receptor expression.
Identifying such homogeneous subcohorts of patients can be useful for the
discovery of disease pathways and therapeutics, specific to the subcohort.

TL;DR: A patient-specific deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework automates IMPT replanning for head-and-neck cancer, improving plan quality over manual methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anatomical changes during IMPT can degrade treatment quality, and manual replanning is resource-intensive.

Method: A DRL framework trains personalized agents for each patient using planning CT and simulated anatomical changes, optimizing plan quality via priority adjustments.

Result: DRL agents (DQN and PPO) outperformed manual replans, improving plan scores and clinical outcomes.

Conclusion: The DRL framework effectively addresses adaptive proton therapy challenges, offering efficient and improved replanning solutions.

Abstract: Anatomical changes during intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) for
head-and-neck cancer (HNC) can shift Bragg peaks, risking tumor underdosing and
organ-at-risk overdosing. As a result, treatment replanning is often required
to maintain clinically acceptable treatment quality. However, current manual
replanning processes are resource-intensive and time-consuming. We propose a
patient-specific deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for automated IMPT
replanning, with a reward-shaping mechanism based on a $150$-point plan quality
score addressing competing clinical objectives. We formulate the planning
process as an RL problem where agents learn control policies to adjust
optimization priorities, maximizing plan quality. Unlike population-based
approaches, our framework trains personalized agents for each patient using
their planning CT (Computed Tomography) and augmented anatomies simulating
anatomical changes (tumor progression and regression). This patient-specific
approach leverages anatomical similarities throughout treatment, enabling
effective plan adaptation. We implemented two DRL algorithms, Deep Q-Network
and Proximal Policy Optimization, using dose-volume histograms (DVHs) as state
representations and a $22$-dimensional action space of priority adjustments.
Evaluation on five HNC patients using actual replanning CT data showed both DRL
agents improved initial plan scores from $120.63 \pm 21.40$ to $139.78 \pm
6.84$ (DQN) and $142.74 \pm 5.16$ (PPO), surpassing manual replans generated by
a human planner ($137.20 \pm 5.58$). Clinical validation confirms that
improvements translate to better tumor coverage and OAR sparing across diverse
anatomical changes. This work demonstrates DRL's potential in addressing
geometric and dosimetric complexities of adaptive proton therapy, offering
efficient offline adaptation solutions and advancing online adaptive proton
therapy.

substructures (heart, chambers, great vessels (GVs), valves, coronary arteries
(CAs), and conduction nodes) from simulation CT (Sim-CT), low-field MR-Linac,
and cardiac CT angiography (CCTA) modalities were manually delineated and used
to train (n=76), validate (n=15), and test (n=30) MAGIC. Twelve comparison
models (four segmentation subgroups across three modalities) were equivalently
trained. All methods were compared for training efficiency and against
reference contours using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and two-tailed
Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test (threshold, p<0.05). Average DSC scores were
0.75(0.16) for Sim-CT, 0.68(0.21) for MR-Linac, and 0.80(0.16) for CCTA. MAGIC
outperforms the comparison in 57% of cases, with limited statistical
differences. MAGIC offers an effective and accurate segmentation solution that
is lightweight and capable of segmenting multiple modalities and overlapping
structures in a single model. MAGIC further enables clinical implementation by
simplifying the computational requirements and offering unparalleled
flexibility for clinical settings.

### [368] [AniMaker: Automated Multi-Agent Animated Storytelling with MCTS-Driven Clip Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10540)
*Haoyuan Shi,Yunxin Li,Xinyu Chen,Longyue Wang,Baotian Hu,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: AniMaker is a multi-agent framework for generating coherent storytelling videos from text, using specialized agents and novel techniques like MCTS-Gen and AniEval to ensure quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation methods struggle with multi-scene coherence and pacing, often producing disjointed narratives due to rigid clip generation and instability.

Method: AniMaker employs a multi-agent system (Director, Photography, Reviewer, Post-Production Agents) with MCTS-Gen for clip generation and AniEval for multi-shot evaluation.

Result: AniMaker outperforms in quality (VBench, AniEval) and efficiency, enhancing storytelling coherence and production readiness.

Conclusion: AniMaker advances AI-generated storytelling by addressing coherence and efficiency, moving closer to production standards.

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in video generation models, generating coherent
storytelling videos that span multiple scenes and characters remains
challenging. Current methods often rigidly convert pre-generated keyframes into
fixed-length clips, resulting in disjointed narratives and pacing issues.
Furthermore, the inherent instability of video generation models means that
even a single low-quality clip can significantly degrade the entire output
animation's logical coherence and visual continuity. To overcome these
obstacles, we introduce AniMaker, a multi-agent framework enabling efficient
multi-candidate clip generation and storytelling-aware clip selection, thus
creating globally consistent and story-coherent animation solely from text
input. The framework is structured around specialized agents, including the
Director Agent for storyboard generation, the Photography Agent for video clip
generation, the Reviewer Agent for evaluation, and the Post-Production Agent
for editing and voiceover. Central to AniMaker's approach are two key technical
components: MCTS-Gen in Photography Agent, an efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS)-inspired strategy that intelligently navigates the candidate space to
generate high-potential clips while optimizing resource usage; and AniEval in
Reviewer Agent, the first framework specifically designed for multi-shot
animation evaluation, which assesses critical aspects such as story-level
consistency, action completion, and animation-specific features by considering
each clip in the context of its preceding and succeeding clips. Experiments
demonstrate that AniMaker achieves superior quality as measured by popular
metrics including VBench and our proposed AniEval framework, while
significantly improving the efficiency of multi-candidate generation, pushing
AI-generated storytelling animation closer to production standards.

### [369] [Fundamental Limits of Learning High-dimensional Simplices in Noisy Regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10101)
*Seyed Amir Hossein Saberi,Amir Najafi,Abolfazl Motahari,Babak H. khalaj*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper establishes sample complexity bounds for learning high-dimensional simplices from noisy data, providing upper and lower bounds and resolving an open question about noisy-case complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the sample complexity of learning simplices in high dimensions under noise, extending prior work and addressing gaps in theoretical understanding.

Method: Uses sample compression techniques and introduces a Fourier-based method for distribution recovery from noisy observations.

Result: Proves an algorithm can estimate a simplex within ε distance with high probability, given sufficient samples, and derives matching lower bounds.

Conclusion: The work resolves an open question and provides tight bounds, with potential applications beyond simplex learning.

Abstract: In this paper, we establish sample complexity bounds for learning
high-dimensional simplices in $\mathbb{R}^K$ from noisy data. Specifically, we
consider $n$ i.i.d. samples uniformly drawn from an unknown simplex in
$\mathbb{R}^K$, each corrupted by additive Gaussian noise of unknown variance.
We prove an algorithm exists that, with high probability, outputs a simplex
within $\ell_2$ or total variation (TV) distance at most $\varepsilon$ from the
true simplex, provided $n \ge (K^2/\varepsilon^2)
e^{\mathcal{O}(K/\mathrm{SNR}^2)}$, where $\mathrm{SNR}$ is the signal-to-noise
ratio. Extending our prior work~\citep{saberi2023sample}, we derive new
information-theoretic lower bounds, showing that simplex estimation within TV
distance $\varepsilon$ requires at least $n \ge \Omega(K^3
\sigma^2/\varepsilon^2 + K/\varepsilon)$ samples, where $\sigma^2$ denotes the
noise variance. In the noiseless scenario, our lower bound $n \ge
\Omega(K/\varepsilon)$ matches known upper bounds up to constant factors. We
resolve an open question by demonstrating that when $\mathrm{SNR} \ge
\Omega(K^{1/2})$, noisy-case complexity aligns with the noiseless case. Our
analysis leverages sample compression techniques (Ashtiani et al., 2018) and
introduces a novel Fourier-based method for recovering distributions from noisy
observations, potentially applicable beyond simplex learning.

*Panagiotis Theodoropoulos,Augustinos D. Saravanos,Evangelos A. Theodorou,Guan-Horng Liu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces 3MSBM, a novel framework for inferring trajectories from sparse snapshots by learning smooth measure-valued splines conditioned on multiple points, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for inferring trajectories rely on pairwise interpolation, limiting their ability to capture long-range temporal dependencies and coherence.

Method: 3MSBM lifts dynamics to phase space, generalizes stochastic bridges to multi-marginal conditions, and learns transport maps by minimizing a variational objective.

Result: 3MSBM shows superior performance in capturing complex dynamics with temporal dependencies, improving convergence and scalability.

Conclusion: 3MSBM opens new avenues for training matching frameworks in multi-marginal settings, validated by real-world applications.

Abstract: Understanding complex systems by inferring trajectories from sparse sample
snapshots is a fundamental challenge in a wide range of domains, e.g.,
single-cell biology, meteorology, and economics. Despite advancements in Bridge
and Flow matching frameworks, current methodologies rely on pairwise
interpolation between adjacent snapshots. This hinders their ability to capture
long-range temporal dependencies and potentially affects the coherence of the
inferred trajectories. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{Momentum
Multi-Marginal Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching (3MSBM)}, a novel matching
framework that learns smooth measure-valued splines for stochastic systems that
satisfy multiple positional constraints. This is achieved by lifting the
dynamics to phase space and generalizing stochastic bridges to be conditioned
on several points, forming a multi-marginal conditional stochastic optimal
control problem. The underlying dynamics are then learned by minimizing a
variational objective, having fixed the path induced by the multi-marginal
conditional bridge. As a matching approach, 3MSBM learns transport maps that
preserve intermediate marginals throughout training, significantly improving
convergence and scalability. Extensive experimentation in a series of
real-world applications validates the superior performance of 3MSBM compared to
existing methods in capturing complex dynamics with temporal dependencies,
opening new avenues for training matching frameworks in multi-marginal
settings.

### [371] [Distributionally-Constrained Adversaries in Online Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10293)
*Moïse Blanchard,Samory Kpotufe*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores learnability in online learning with distributionally constrained adversaries, bridging stochastic and adversarial settings. It characterizes learnable distribution classes and generalizes results for smoothed settings, showing learners can compete without prior knowledge of the distribution class.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between adversarial and stochastic online learning by studying distributionally constrained adversaries, enabling a fine-grained understanding of learnable settings.

Method: Analyzes learnability against oblivious and adaptive adversaries using general distributional classes, recovering and generalizing smoothed settings.

Result: Characterizes learnable distribution classes, showing learners can compete without prior knowledge of the distribution class, even for linear classifiers.

Conclusion: The framework provides insights into learnability conditions, generalizing existing results and enabling robust learning against constrained adversaries.

Abstract: There has been much recent interest in understanding the continuum from
adversarial to stochastic settings in online learning, with various frameworks
including smoothed settings proposed to bridge this gap. We consider the more
general and flexible framework of distributionally constrained adversaries in
which instances are drawn from distributions chosen by an adversary within some
constrained distribution class [RST11]. Compared to smoothed analysis, we
consider general distributional classes which allows for a fine-grained
understanding of learning settings between fully stochastic and fully
adversarial for which a learner can achieve non-trivial regret. We give a
characterization for which distribution classes are learnable in this context
against both oblivious and adaptive adversaries, providing insights into the
types of interplay between the function class and distributional constraints on
adversaries that enable learnability. In particular, our results recover and
generalize learnability for known smoothed settings. Further, we show that for
several natural function classes including linear classifiers, learning can be
achieved without any prior knowledge of the distribution class -- in other
words, a learner can simultaneously compete against any constrained adversary
within learnable distribution classes.

### [372] [Measuring Semantic Information Production in Generative Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10433)
*Florian Handke,Félix Koulischer,Gabriel Raya,Luca Ambrogioni*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces an information-theoretic method to measure when semantic decisions occur during the reverse diffusion process, finding differences in timing for different classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when and how semantic features emerge during the reverse dynamics of diffusion models, drawing parallels to physical phase transitions.

Method: An online Bayesian classifier estimates conditional entropy of class labels given noisy states, with information transfer measured via time derivative of entropy.

Result: Semantic information transfer peaks in intermediate diffusion stages, with class-specific timing differences observed.

Conclusion: Different semantic decisions occur at distinct intermediate times, highlighting class-specific dynamics in diffusion models.

Abstract: It is well known that semantic and structural features of the generated
images emerge at different times during the reverse dynamics of diffusion, a
phenomenon that has been connected to physical phase transitions in magnets and
other materials. In this paper, we introduce a general information-theoretic
approach to measure when these class-semantic "decisions" are made during the
generative process. By using an online formula for the optimal Bayesian
classifier, we estimate the conditional entropy of the class label given the
noisy state. We then determine the time intervals corresponding to the highest
information transfer between noisy states and class labels using the time
derivative of the conditional entropy. We demonstrate our method on
one-dimensional Gaussian mixture models and on DDPM models trained on the
CIFAR10 dataset. As expected, we find that the semantic information transfer is
highest in the intermediate stages of diffusion while vanishing during the
final stages. However, we found sizable differences between the entropy rate
profiles of different classes, suggesting that different "semantic decisions"
are located at different intermediate times.

*Kyohei Atarashi,Satoshi Oyama,Hiromi Arai,Hisashi Kashima*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces BCSoftmax, a box-constrained generalization of Softmax, enabling hard constraints on output probabilities for improved model reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Softmax lacks hard constraints on probabilities, limiting reliability in critical applications.

Method: Proposes BCSoftmax, a box-constrained optimization solution, with an efficient computation algorithm and post-hoc calibration methods.

Result: Experimental results on TinyImageNet, CIFAR-100, and 20NewsGroups show improved calibration metrics.

Conclusion: BCSoftmax enhances model reliability by enforcing probability bounds, useful for trustworthy decision-making.

Abstract: Controlling the output probabilities of softmax-based models is a common
problem in modern machine learning. Although the $\mathrm{Softmax}$ function
provides soft control via its temperature parameter, it lacks the ability to
enforce hard constraints, such as box constraints, on output probabilities,
which can be critical in certain applications requiring reliable and
trustworthy models. In this work, we propose the box-constrained softmax
($\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$) function, a novel generalization of the
$\mathrm{Softmax}$ function that explicitly enforces lower and upper bounds on
output probabilities. While $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$ is formulated as the solution
to a box-constrained optimization problem, we develop an exact and efficient
computation algorithm for $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$. As a key application, we
introduce two post-hoc calibration methods based on $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$. The
proposed methods mitigate underconfidence and overconfidence in predictive
models by learning the lower and upper bounds of the output probabilities or
logits after model training, thereby enhancing reliability in downstream
decision-making tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods
experimentally using the TinyImageNet, CIFAR-100, and 20NewsGroups datasets,
achieving improvements in calibration metrics.

*Maxime Haddouche,Otmane Sakhi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper extends PAC-Bayesian learning with Logarithmic Smoothing (LS) to adaptive off-policy learning, showing improved convergence rates and outperforming static methods when intermediate policy deployments are allowed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of static off-policy learning by enabling iterative policy refinement and adaptive data collection for higher-quality learning.

Method: Extends PAC-Bayesian LS to adaptive settings using online PAC-Bayesian theory, with a principled adjustment to the LS estimator for multiple deployment rounds.

Result: The method matches static approaches in offline settings and outperforms them with adaptive deployments, achieving faster convergence under mild conditions.

Conclusion: Adaptive off-policy learning with PAC-Bayesian LS is effective, offering advantages in data quality and convergence, as demonstrated empirically.

Abstract: Off-policy learning serves as the primary framework for learning optimal
policies from logged interactions collected under a static behavior policy. In
this work, we investigate the more practical and flexible setting of adaptive
off-policy learning, where policies are iteratively refined and re-deployed to
collect higher-quality data. Building on the success of PAC-Bayesian learning
with Logarithmic Smoothing (LS) in static settings, we extend this framework to
the adaptive scenario using tools from online PAC-Bayesian theory. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that a principled adjustment to the LS estimator naturally
accommodates multiple rounds of deployment and yields faster convergence rates
under mild conditions. Our method matches the performance of leading offline
approaches in static settings, and significantly outperforms them when
intermediate policy deployments are allowed. Empirical evaluations across
diverse scenarios highlight both the advantages of adaptive data collection and
the strength of the PAC-Bayesian formulation.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a family of unbiased off-policy estimators for A/B testing that reduce variance compared to the standard difference-in-means estimator, especially when tested systems are similar.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the commonly used difference-in-means estimator in A/B testing, which is unbiased but can have high variance.

Method: Introduces a family of unbiased off-policy estimators and identifies the one with the lowest variance.

Result: The proposed estimator achieves substantial variance reduction, particularly when the tested systems are similar.

Conclusion: The method is theoretically and experimentally validated as effective and practical for A/B testing.

Abstract: We address the problem of A/B testing, a widely used protocol for evaluating
the potential improvement achieved by a new decision system compared to a
baseline. This protocol segments the population into two subgroups, each
exposed to a version of the system and estimates the improvement as the
difference between the measured effects. In this work, we demonstrate that the
commonly used difference-in-means estimator, while unbiased, can be improved.
We introduce a family of unbiased off-policy estimators that achieves lower
variance than the standard approach. Among this family, we identify the
estimator with the lowest variance. The resulting estimator is simple, and
offers substantial variance reduction when the two tested systems exhibit
similarities. Our theoretical analysis and experimental results validate the
effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper analyzes causal effect estimation with hidden confounders using nonparametric IV regression, focusing on spectral features and their impact on performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve causal effect estimation in the presence of hidden confounders by leveraging spectral features in IV regression.

Method: Uses a two-stage least squares estimator with spectral features, analyzing performance based on spectral alignment and eigenvalue decay.

Result: Identifies three scenarios: optimal performance with strong spectral alignment and slow eigenvalue decay, degraded performance with rapid eigenvalue decay, and failure with weak spectral alignment.

Conclusion: The taxonomy of outcomes is validated empirically, highlighting conditions for success or failure of the method.

Abstract: We address the problem of causal effect estimation in the presence of hidden
confounders, using nonparametric instrumental variable (IV) regression. A
leading strategy employs spectral features - that is, learned features spanning
the top eigensubspaces of the operator linking treatments to instruments. We
derive a generalization error bound for a two-stage least squares estimator
based on spectral features, and gain insights into the method's performance and
failure modes. We show that performance depends on two key factors, leading to
a clear taxonomy of outcomes. In a good scenario, the approach is optimal. This
occurs with strong spectral alignment, meaning the structural function is
well-represented by the top eigenfunctions of the conditional operator, coupled
with this operator's slow eigenvalue decay, indicating a strong instrument.
Performance degrades in a bad scenario: spectral alignment remains strong, but
rapid eigenvalue decay (indicating a weaker instrument) demands significantly
more samples for effective feature learning. Finally, in the ugly scenario,
weak spectral alignment causes the method to fail, regardless of the
eigenvalues' characteristics. Our synthetic experiments empirically validate
this taxonomy.

TL;DR: A method to supplement expert labels with AI predictions for cost-effective dataset curation, ensuring high-quality labels with minimal error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality labeled datasets are costly to obtain, requiring extensive human effort or expensive experiments.

Method: Uses AI predictions from pre-trained models (e.g., large language models, vision models, AlphaFold) to supplement expert labels, ensuring probably approximately correct labels.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness in text annotation, image labeling, and protein folding analysis.

Conclusion: The approach enables rigorous and efficient dataset curation using modern AI models.

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality labeled datasets is often costly, requiring either
extensive human annotation or expensive experiments. We propose a method that
supplements such "expert" labels with AI predictions from pre-trained models to
construct labeled datasets more cost-effectively. Our approach results in
probably approximately correct labels: with high probability, the overall
labeling error is small. This solution enables rigorous yet efficient dataset
curation using modern AI models. We demonstrate the benefits of the methodology
through text annotation with large language models, image labeling with
pre-trained vision models, and protein folding analysis with AlphaFold.

### [378] [What Exactly Does Guidance Do in Masked Discrete Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10971)
*He Ye,Rojas Kevin,Tao Molei*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper analyzes masked discrete diffusion models with classifier-free guidance (CFG), deriving an explicit solution to guided reverse dynamics and characterizing how guidance influences sampling behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how classifier-free guidance (CFG) affects sampling behavior in masked discrete diffusion models, particularly in amplifying class-specific regions and suppressing shared regions.

Method: Theoretical derivation of guided reverse dynamics under assumptions of no score or discretization errors, supported by experiments.

Result: Guidance amplifies class-specific regions and suppresses shared ones, with distinct covariance structures in 1D and 2D. For large guidance strength, total variation decay is double-exponential.

Conclusion: Guidance not only shapes the output distribution but also controls sampling dynamics, with theoretical insights validated by experiments.

Abstract: We study masked discrete diffusion models with classifier-free guidance
(CFG). Assuming no score error nor discretization error, we derive an explicit
solution to the guided reverse dynamics, so that how guidance influences the
sampling behavior can be precisely characterized. When the full data
distribution is a mixture over classes and the goal is to sample from a
specific class, guidance amplifies class-specific regions while suppresses
regions shared with other classes. This effect depends on the guidance strength
$w$ and induces distinct covariance structures in the sampled distribution.
Notably, we observe quantitatively different behaviors in $1$D and $2$D. We
also show that for large $w$, the decay rate of the total variation
($\mathrm{TV}$) along the reverse dynamics is double-exponential in $w$ for
both $1$D and $2$D. These findings highlight the role of guidance, not just in
shaping the output distribution, but also in controlling the dynamics of the
sampling trajectory. Our theoretical analysis is supported by experiments that
illustrate the geometric effects of guidance and its impact on convergence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate and improve code issue detection and revision in software development using LLMs, reducing manual effort and enhancing code quality.

Method: Combines static code analysis, LLMs, RAG, and iterative prompt engineering, with a custom Code Comparison App to correct hallucinations.

Result: Significant reduction in code issues, demonstrating improved code quality and streamlined development.

Conclusion: Integrating LLMs with static analysis and RAG effectively enhances code quality and efficiency in software development.

Abstract: This study examined code issue detection and revision automation by
integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo and
GPT-4o into software development workflows. A static code analysis framework
detects issues such as bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells within a
large-scale software project. Detailed information on each issue was extracted
and organized to facilitate automated code revision using LLMs. An iterative
prompt engineering process is applied to ensure that prompts are structured to
produce accurate and organized outputs aligned with the project requirements.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is implemented to enhance the relevance
and precision of the revisions, enabling LLM to access and integrate real-time
external knowledge. The issue of LLM hallucinations - where the model generates
plausible but incorrect outputs - is addressed by a custom-built "Code
Comparison App," which identifies and corrects erroneous changes before
applying them to the codebase. Subsequent scans using the static code analysis
framework revealed a significant reduction in code issues, demonstrating the
effectiveness of combining LLMs, static analysis, and RAG to improve code
quality, streamline the software development process, and reduce time and
resource expenditure.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a synthetic evaluation pipeline and persona-based approach to assess LLM code generation sensitivity to input variations, independent of specific tasks or models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lower barriers to coding but code quality depends on prompt quality, which varies with user background. Quantifying this sensitivity is crucial.

Method: A synthetic evaluation pipeline and systematic persona-based evaluation approach are introduced to analyze LLM responses based on user background.

Result: The methods are task- and model-agnostic, with experimental evidence supporting their utility.

Conclusion: The proposed methods are widely applicable, and the authors share their code for community benefit.

Abstract: Code generation is one of the most active areas of application of Large
Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs lower barriers to writing code and
accelerate development process, the overall quality of generated programs
depends on the quality of given prompts. Specifically, functionality and
quality of generated code can be sensitive to user's background and familiarity
with software development. It is therefore important to quantify LLM's
sensitivity to variations in the input. To this end we propose a synthetic
evaluation pipeline for code generation with LLMs, as well as a systematic
persona-based evaluation approach to expose qualitative differences of LLM
responses dependent on prospective user background. Both proposed methods are
completely independent from specific programming tasks and LLMs, and thus are
widely applicable. We provide experimental evidence illustrating utility of our
methods and share our code for the benefit of the community.

TL;DR: BugGen is an autonomous multi-agent pipeline using LLMs to generate, insert, and validate realistic RTL bugs, outperforming manual methods in speed, accuracy, and utility for ML-assisted debugging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hardware complexity strains verification, requiring scalable bug datasets, which current methods fail to provide.

Method: BugGen uses LLMs in a closed-loop architecture to partition modules, select targets, and refine bugs for correctness and detectability.

Result: Generated 500 unique bugs with 94% accuracy, 17.7 bugs/hour, and exposed 104 undetected bugs in OpenTitan. ML models trained on BugGen data achieved 88.1%-93.2% accuracy.

Conclusion: BugGen offers a scalable, high-quality bug generation solution, improving verification efficiency and ML-assisted debugging.

Abstract: Hardware complexity continues to strain verification resources, motivating
the adoption of machine learning (ML) methods to improve debug efficiency.
However, ML-assisted debugging critically depends on diverse and scalable bug
datasets, which existing manual or automated bug insertion methods fail to
reliably produce. We introduce BugGen, a first of its kind, fully autonomous,
multi-agent pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically
generate, insert, and validate realistic functional bugs in RTL. BugGen
partitions modules, selects mutation targets via a closed-loop agentic
architecture, and employs iterative refinement and rollback mechanisms to
ensure syntactic correctness and functional detectability. Evaluated across
five OpenTitan IP blocks, BugGen produced 500 unique bugs with 94% functional
accuracy and achieved a throughput of 17.7 validated bugs per hour-over five
times faster than typical manual expert insertion. Additionally, BugGen
identified 104 previously undetected bugs in OpenTitan regressions,
highlighting its utility in exposing verification coverage gaps. Compared
against Certitude, BugGen demonstrated over twice the syntactic accuracy,
deeper exposure of testbench blind spots, and more functionally meaningful and
complex bug scenarios. Furthermore, when these BugGen-generated datasets were
employed to train ML-based failure triage models, we achieved high
classification accuracy (88.1%-93.2%) across different IP blocks, confirming
the practical utility and realism of generated bugs. BugGen thus provides a
scalable solution for generating high-quality bug datasets, significantly
enhancing verification efficiency and ML-assisted debugging.

TL;DR: A large-scale study analyzes user feedback on AI-powered mobile apps, revealing key themes in positive and negative reviews through a validated multi-stage analysis pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how users perceive and critique AI features in mobile apps, given the lack of exploration due to the volume of feedback.

Method: Develops a multi-stage pipeline using a curated dataset of 292 AI-driven apps and 894K reviews, validated with human-labeled benchmarks and LLMs.

Result: Extracts over one million aspect-sentiment pairs, identifying 18 positive and 15 negative themes, such as productivity (positive) and technical failures (negative).

Conclusion: The pipeline provides a detailed, scalable analysis of user feedback, capturing nuanced sentiments often missed by traditional methods.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered features have rapidly proliferated
across mobile apps in various domains, including productivity, education,
entertainment, and creativity. However, how users perceive, evaluate, and
critique these AI features remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the
overwhelming volume of user feedback. In this work, we present the first
comprehensive, large-scale study of user feedback on AI-powered mobile apps,
leveraging a curated dataset of 292 AI-driven apps across 14 categories with
894K AI-specific reviews from Google Play. We develop and validate a
multi-stage analysis pipeline that begins with a human-labeled benchmark and
systematically evaluates large language models (LLMs) and prompting strategies.
Each stage, including review classification, aspect-sentiment extraction, and
clustering, is validated for accuracy and consistency. Our pipeline enables
scalable, high-precision analysis of user feedback, extracting over one million
aspect-sentiment pairs clustered into 18 positive and 15 negative user topics.
Our analysis reveals that users consistently focus on a narrow set of themes:
positive comments emphasize productivity, reliability, and personalized
assistance, while negative feedback highlights technical failures (e.g.,
scanning and recognition), pricing concerns, and limitations in language
support. Our pipeline surfaces both satisfaction with one feature and
frustration with another within the same review. These fine-grained,
co-occurring sentiments are often missed by traditional approaches that treat
positive and negative feedback in isolation or rely on coarse-grained analysis.
To this end, our approach provides a more faithful reflection of the real-world
user experiences with AI-powered apps. Category-aware analysis further uncovers
both universal drivers of satisfaction and domain-specific frustrations.

### [384] [SWE-Factory: Your Automated Factory for Issue Resolution Training Data and Evaluation Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10954)
*Lianghong Guo,Yanlin Wang,Caihua Li,Pengyu Yang,Jiachi Chen,Wei Tao,Yingtian Zou,Duyu Tang,Zibin Zheng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SWE-Factory is an automated pipeline for creating GitHub issue resolution datasets, addressing labor-intensive tasks like environment setup, grading, and validation. It uses multi-agent systems, standardized grading, and automated validation, achieving high accuracy and cost efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for creating GitHub issue resolution datasets are labor-intensive and challenging, particularly in evaluation setup, grading, and validation.

Method: SWE-Factory integrates three automated components: SWE-Builder (multi-agent system for environment setup), exit-code-based grading, and automated fail2pass validation.

Result: Experiments show SWE-Builder constructs valid instances efficiently (e.g., $0.045/instance with GPT-4.1-mini). Grading achieves 100% accuracy, and validation reaches 0.92 precision and 1.00 recall.

Conclusion: SWE-Factory accelerates the creation of large-scale, high-quality datasets for GitHub issue resolution, benefiting LLM training and evaluation.

Abstract: Constructing large-scale datasets for the GitHub issue resolution task is
crucial for both training and evaluating the software engineering capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the traditional process for creating
such benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in
the stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and
validating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated
pipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our
pipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce
SWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment
construction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a
collaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to
enhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based
grading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers.
Finally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit
code signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show
that our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example,
with GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per
instance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at
the lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our
exit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection,
and our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall
of 1.00. We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of
large-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training
and evaluation. Our code and datasets are released at

*Eun Som Jeon,Sinjini Mitra,Jisoo Lee,Omik M. Save,Ankita Shukla,Hyunglae Lee,Pavan Turaga*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A Time-aware Knowledge Distillation framework improves GRF estimation from wearable insole sensors by leveraging temporal and similarity features, outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the limitations of costly, non-portable treadmills and noisy, less accurate wearable insole sensors for GRF measurement.

Method: Proposes a Time-aware Knowledge Distillation framework to enhance GRF estimation by capturing feature relationships and sequential data properties.

Result: The framework outperforms baselines, providing more accurate GRF estimates from insole sensor data compared to treadmill measurements.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a viable, accurate alternative to treadmills for GRF analysis in wearable sensor applications.

Abstract: Human gait analysis with wearable sensors has been widely used in various
applications, such as daily life healthcare, rehabilitation, physical therapy,
and clinical diagnostics and monitoring. In particular, ground reaction force
(GRF) provides critical information about how the body interacts with the
ground during locomotion. Although instrumented treadmills have been widely
used as the gold standard for measuring GRF during walking, their lack of
portability and high cost make them impractical for many applications. As an
alternative, low-cost, portable, wearable insole sensors have been utilized to
measure GRF; however, these sensors are susceptible to noise and disturbance
and are less accurate than treadmill measurements. To address these challenges,
we propose a Time-aware Knowledge Distillation framework for GRF estimation
from insole sensor data. This framework leverages similarity and temporal
features within a mini-batch during the knowledge distillation process,
effectively capturing the complementary relationships between features and the
sequential properties of the target and input data. The performance of the
lightweight models distilled through this framework was evaluated by comparing
GRF estimations from insole sensor data against measurements from an
instrumented treadmill. Empirical results demonstrated that Time-aware
Knowledge Distillation outperforms current baselines in GRF estimation from
wearable sensor data.

*Yuke Xie,Hervé Chauris,Nicolas Desassis*

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: A framework integrates a pretrained DDPM as a generative prior into FWI via score rematching, avoiding reverse diffusion and noisy states, improving stability and inversion quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address instability in non-linear solvers like FWI caused by noisy intermediate states in diffusion models, enhancing seismic imaging.

Method: Directly integrates DDPM as a score-based prior into FWI through score rematching, operating in clean image space without reverse diffusion.

Result: Improved fidelity, robustness, and convergence in seismic imaging compared to conventional and GAN-based FWI methods.

Conclusion: The method is practical, computationally efficient, and enhances inversion quality for seismic imaging and other inverse problems.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promise as powerful generative priors
for inverse problems. However, conventional applications require solving the
full reverse diffusion process and operating on noisy intermediate states,
which poses challenges for physics-constrained computational seismic imaging.
In particular, such instability is pronounced in non-linear solvers like those
used in Full Waveform Inversion (FWI), where wave propagation through noisy
velocity fields can lead to numerical artifacts and poor inversion quality. In
this work, we propose a simple yet effective framework that directly integrates
a pretrained Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as a score-based
generative diffusion prior into FWI through a score rematching strategy. Unlike
traditional diffusion approaches, our method avoids the reverse diffusion
sampling and needs fewer iterations. We operate the image inversion entirely in
the clean image space, eliminating the need to operate through noisy velocity
models. The generative diffusion prior can be introduced as a simple
regularization term in the standard FWI update rule, requiring minimal
modification to existing FWI pipelines. This promotes stable wave propagation
and can improve convergence behavior and inversion quality. Numerical
experiments suggest that the proposed method offers enhanced fidelity and
robustness compared to conventional and GAN-based FWI approaches, while
remaining practical and computationally efficient for seismic imaging and other
inverse problem tasks.

*Oleg Berngardt,Ivan Lavygin*

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated classifier for radar data using ionospheric modeling and quality criteria, trained on 12 radars' data over two years, identifying 37 optimal classes with key parameters for classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate the classification of processed data from decameter coherent scatter radars by leveraging radar data, ionospheric modeling, and mathematical quality criteria.

Method: Uses radar data, ionospheric radio wave propagation modeling, and quality criteria to train a classifier with 2669 coefficients, calibrated via meteor trail signals.

Result: Identified 37 optimal classes (25 frequently observed), with 14 confidently separable. Key classification parameters include signal trajectory shape, scattering height, and Doppler velocity.

Conclusion: The classifier's results align with known physical mechanisms, demonstrating its effectiveness for radar data analysis.

Abstract: The paper presents a method for automatic constructing a classifier for
processed data obtained by decameter coherent scatter radars. Method is based
only on the radar data obtained, the results of automatic modeling of radio
wave propagation in the ionosphere, and mathematical criteria for estimating
the quality of the models. The final classifier is the model trained at data
obtained by 12 radars of the SuperDARN and SECIRA networks over two years for
each radar. The number of the model coefficients is 2669. For the
classification, the model uses both the calculated parameters of radio wave
propagation in the model ionosphere and the parameters directly measured by the
radar. Calibration of radiowave elevation measurements at each radar was made
using meteor trail scattered signals. The analysis showed that the optimal
number of classes in the data is 37, of which 25 are frequently observed. The
analysis made it possible to choose 14 classes from them, which are confidently
separated in other variants of model training. A preliminary interpretation of
10 of them was carried out. The dynamics of observation of various classes and
their dependence on the geographical latitude of radars at different levels of
solar and geomagnetic activity were presented, it was shown that it does not
contradict with known physical mechanisms. The analysis showed that the most
important parameters to identify the classes are the shape of the signal
ray-tracing trajectory in its second half, the ray-traced scattering height and
the Doppler velocity measured by the radar.

*Abiodun Ganiyu,Pranshav Gajjar,Vijay K Shah*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: AI5GTest is an AI-powered framework automating O-RAN component validation using LLMs, reducing test time and improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The disaggregated O-RAN architecture introduces testing challenges, with existing manual methods being error-prone and inconsistent.

Method: AI5GTest uses Gen-LLM, Val-LLM, and Debug-LLM to generate, validate, and debug test cases, incorporating human-in-the-loop for transparency.

Result: AI5GTest reduces test execution time significantly while maintaining high accuracy, validated against O-RAN and 3GPP specifications.

Conclusion: AI5GTest addresses O-RAN testing limitations with automation and AI, enhancing efficiency and reliability.

Abstract: The advent of Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) has transformed the
telecommunications industry by promoting interoperability, vendor diversity,
and rapid innovation. However, its disaggregated architecture introduces
complex testing challenges, particularly in validating multi-vendor components
against O-RAN ALLIANCE and 3GPP specifications. Existing frameworks, such as
those provided by Open Testing and Integration Centres (OTICs), rely heavily on
manual processes, are fragmented and prone to human error, leading to
inconsistency and scalability issues. To address these limitations, we present
AI5GTest -- an AI-powered, specification-aware testing framework designed to
automate the validation of O-RAN components. AI5GTest leverages a cooperative
Large Language Models (LLM) framework consisting of Gen-LLM, Val-LLM, and
Debug-LLM. Gen-LLM automatically generates expected procedural flows for test
cases based on 3GPP and O-RAN specifications, while Val-LLM cross-references
signaling messages against these flows to validate compliance and detect
deviations. If anomalies arise, Debug-LLM performs root cause analysis,
providing insight to the failure cause. To enhance transparency and
trustworthiness, AI5GTest incorporates a human-in-the-loop mechanism, where the
Gen-LLM presents top-k relevant official specifications to the tester for
approval before proceeding with validation. Evaluated using a range of test
cases obtained from O-RAN TIFG and WG5-IOT test specifications, AI5GTest
demonstrates a significant reduction in overall test execution time compared to
traditional manual methods, while maintaining high validation accuracy.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: A semantic agentic layer is added to Space-O-RAN for context-aware wireless communication on the lunar surface, enhancing adaptability and coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lunar operations demand robust, adaptive wireless communication, but current systems like Space-O-RAN lack dynamic, context-aware decision-making.

Method: Extends Space-O-RAN with a semantic layer using Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocols for real-time, adaptive coordination.

Result: Enables context-aware decisions, delay-adaptive reasoning, and bandwidth-aware semantic compression for lunar surface operations.

Conclusion: The proposed extension improves wireless communication adaptability and coordination for lunar missions.

Abstract: Lunar surface operations impose stringent requirements on wireless
communication systems, including autonomy, robustness to disruption, and the
ability to adapt to environmental and mission-driven context. While Space-O-RAN
provides a distributed orchestration model aligned with 3GPP standards, its
decision logic is limited to static policies and lacks semantic integration. We
propose a novel extension incorporating a semantic agentic layer enabled by the
Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocols,
allowing context-aware decision making across real-time, near-real-time, and
non-real-time control layers. Distributed cognitive agents deployed in rovers,
landers, and lunar base stations implement wireless-aware coordination
strategies, including delay-adaptive reasoning and bandwidth-aware semantic
compression, while interacting with multiple MCP servers to reason over
telemetry, locomotion planning, and mission constraints.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To balance accuracy, computational efficiency, and deployability for IoT-based smart systems and communication networks.

Method: Develop a lightweight 1D-CNN using hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS), quantized to INT8 for deployment.

Result: Achieves 96.59% accuracy with 88.26K parameters, 10.08M FLOPs, and minimal accuracy drop (1-2%) when quantized. Deployed on microcontrollers with low latency (31.43ms-115.40ms) and energy consumption (7.86mJ-29.10mJ).

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of on-device encrypted traffic analysis, enabling scalable, low-power IoT security solutions.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a practical deep learning (DL) approach for
energy-efficient traffic classification (TC) on resource-limited
microcontrollers, which are widely used in IoT-based smart systems and
communication networks. Our objective is to balance accuracy, computational
efficiency, and real-world deployability. To that end, we develop a lightweight
1D-CNN, optimized via hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS), which
achieves 96.59% accuracy on the ISCX VPN-NonVPN dataset with only 88.26K
parameters, a 20.12K maximum tensor size, and 10.08M floating-point operations
(FLOPs). Moreover, it generalizes across various TC tasks, with accuracies
ranging from 94% to 99%. To enable deployment, the model is quantized to INT8,
suffering only a marginal 1-2% accuracy drop relative to its Float32
counterpart. We evaluate real-world inference performance on two
microcontrollers: the high-performance STM32F746G-DISCO and the cost-sensitive
Nucleo-F401RE. The deployed model achieves inference latencies of 31.43ms and
115.40ms, with energy consumption of 7.86 mJ and 29.10 mJ per inference,
respectively. These results demonstrate the feasibility of on-device encrypted
traffic analysis, paving the way for scalable, low-power IoT security
solutions.

TL;DR: The study explores learning dynamical systems using a neuromorphic network with memristive elements, optimizing input voltages for chaotic time series prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how neuromorphic networks, as dynamical systems, can model and learn complex dynamical behaviors using their inherent physics.

Method: Simulated a neuromorphic network with memristive components in a reservoir computing framework to predict chaotic time series by manipulating input voltages and electrodes.

Result: Optimal responses occurred when input voltages maximized memristive dynamics; increasing electrode coverage suppressed less useful nonlinearities.

Conclusion: The findings offer insights into optimizing neuromorphic devices for learning dynamical systems using external controls.

Abstract: This study investigates how dynamical systems may be learned and modelled
with a neuromorphic network which is itself a dynamical system. The
neuromorphic network used in this study is based on a complex electrical
circuit comprised of memristive elements that produce neuro-synaptic nonlinear
responses to input electrical signals. To determine how computation may be
performed using the physics of the underlying system, the neuromorphic network
was simulated and evaluated on autonomous prediction of a multivariate chaotic
time series, implemented with a reservoir computing framework. Through
manipulating only input electrodes and voltages, optimal nonlinear dynamical
responses were found when input voltages maximise the number of memristive
components whose internal dynamics explore the entire dynamical range of the
memristor model. Increasing the network coverage with the input electrodes was
found to suppress other nonlinear responses that are less conducive to
learning. These results provide valuable insights into how a practical
neuromorphic network device can be optimised for learning complex dynamical
systems using only external control parameters.

TL;DR: The paper explores how hidden unit priors in RBMs affect phase diagrams and memory retrieval, revealing limitations in binary RBMs and proposing improvements like richer priors and local biases to enhance performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how architectural choices and activation functions in RBMs influence their thermodynamic properties and memory retrieval capabilities, addressing limitations in standard binary RBMs.

Method: Analytical tools from statistical physics and finite-size Monte Carlo simulations are used to study RBMs with various hidden unit priors (binary, multi-state, ReLU-like). Modifications like local biases and richer priors are examined.

Result: Standard binary RBMs have reduced critical capacity, but modifications restore ordered retrieval phases and improve recall performance, even at finite temperatures.

Conclusion: Hidden unit design is crucial for enhancing RBM performance, with richer priors and local biases significantly improving memory retrieval capabilities.

Abstract: We investigate the phase diagram and memory retrieval capabilities of
bipartite energy-based neural networks, namely Restricted Boltzmann Machines
(RBMs), as a function of the prior distribution imposed on their hidden units -
including binary, multi-state, and ReLU-like activations. Drawing connections
to the Hopfield model and employing analytical tools from statistical physics
of disordered systems, we explore how the architectural choices and activation
functions shape the thermodynamic properties of these models. Our analysis
reveals that standard RBMs with binary hidden nodes and extensive connectivity
suffer from reduced critical capacity, limiting their effectiveness as
associative memories. To address this, we examine several modifications, such
as introducing local biases and adopting richer hidden unit priors. These
adjustments restore ordered retrieval phases and markedly improve recall
performance, even at finite temperatures. Our theoretical findings, supported
by finite-size Monte Carlo simulations, highlight the importance of hidden unit
design in enhancing the expressive power of RBMs.

*Ziv Scully,Alexander Terenin*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper argues that the Gittins index, often seen as theoretical, can be practically applied to solve decision-making problems, with examples in Bayesian optimization and queue latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate the practical applicability of the Gittins index, countering its perception as merely a theoretical tool.

Method: An example-driven introduction to the Gittins index, followed by case studies of its application, including Bayesian optimization and queue latency minimization.

Result: The Gittins index is shown to solve some problems optimally and others suboptimally but with excellent performance.

Conclusion: The Gittins index is a practical tool for decision-making problems, not just a theoretical concept.

Abstract: The Gittins index is a tool that optimally solves a variety of
decision-making problems involving uncertainty, including multi-armed bandit
problems, minimizing mean latency in queues, and search problems like the
Pandora's box model. However, despite the above examples and later extensions
thereof, the space of problems that the Gittins index can solve perfectly
optimally is limited, and its definition is rather subtle compared to those of
other multi-armed bandit algorithms. As a result, the Gittins index is often
regarded as being primarily a concept of theoretical importance, rather than a
practical tool for solving decision-making problems.
  The aim of this tutorial is to demonstrate that the Gittins index can be
fruitfully applied to practical problems. We start by giving an example-driven
introduction to the Gittins index, then walk through several examples of
problems it solves - some optimally, some suboptimally but still with excellent
performance. Two practical highlights in the latter category are applying the
Gittins index to Bayesian optimization, and applying the Gittins index to
minimizing tail latency in queues.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neo-fascist coding scheme for digital discourse in the USA, combining NLP and political science to classify neo-fascist content in online forums.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of neo-fascism poses a threat to democracy and minorities, necessitating tools to detect and counteract its spread in digital spaces.

Method: Develops a coding scheme, collects data from neo-fascist forums (Iron March, Stormfront.org), annotates posts via crowdsourcing, and fine-tunes SLMs and LLMs for classification.

Result: Successful creation of the first classification models for neo-fascist discourse, revealing its prevalence in targeted forums.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for ongoing research and action against neo-fascist rhetoric to protect democratic societies, emphasizing societal context in NLP work.

Abstract: Neo-fascism is a political and societal ideology that has been having
remarkable growth in the last decade in the United States of America (USA), as
well as in other Western societies. It poses a grave danger to democracy and
the minorities it targets, and it requires active actions against it to avoid
escalation. This work presents the first-of-its-kind neo-fascist coding scheme
for digital discourse in the USA societal context, overseen by political
science researchers. Our work bridges the gap between Natural Language
Processing (NLP) and political science against this phenomena. Furthermore, to
test the coding scheme, we collect a tremendous amount of activity on the
internet from notable neo-fascist groups (the forums of Iron March and
Stormfront.org), and the guidelines are applied to a subset of the collected
posts. Through crowdsourcing, we annotate a total of a thousand posts that are
labeled as neo-fascist or non-neo-fascist. With this labeled data set, we
fine-tune and test both Small Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models
(LLMs), obtaining the very first classification models for neo-fascist
discourse. We find that the prevalence of neo-fascist rhetoric in this kind of
forum is ever-present, making them a good target for future research. The
societal context is a key consideration for neo-fascist speech when conducting
NLP research. Finally, the work against this kind of political movement must be
pressed upon and continued for the well-being of a democratic society.
Disclaimer: This study focuses on detecting neo-fascist content in text,
similar to other hate speech analyses, without labeling individuals or
organizations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing online learning personalization by leveraging LLMs to provide tailored answers, improving engagement and easing educator burden.

Method: Conducted a study using StackExchange data in language learning and programming. Developed a framework for validating personalized answers, testing 0-shot, 1-shot, and few-shot scenarios. Evaluated answers using BERTScore, LLM, and human assessments.

Result: Examples of desired answers significantly improved LLMs' ability to personalize responses.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively personalize learning answers, especially when provided with examples, benefiting both learners and educators.

Abstract: Online learning has experienced rapid growth due to its flexibility and
accessibility. Personalization, adapted to the needs of individual learners, is
crucial for enhancing the learning experience, particularly in online settings.
A key aspect of personalization is providing learners with answers customized
to their specific questions. This paper therefore explores the potential of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate personalized answers to learners'
questions, thereby enhancing engagement and reducing the workload on educators.
To evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in this context, we conducted a
comprehensive study using the StackExchange platform in two distinct areas:
language learning and programming. We developed a framework and a dataset for
validating automatically generated personalized answers. Subsequently, we
generated personalized answers using different strategies, including 0-shot,
1-shot, and few-shot scenarios. The generated answers were evaluated using
three methods: 1. BERTScore, 2. LLM evaluation, and 3. human evaluation. Our
findings indicated that providing LLMs with examples of desired answers (from
the learner or similar learners) can significantly enhance the LLMs' ability to
tailor responses to individual learners' needs.

Neural data compression,\non the other hand, holds the promise of learning compression algorithms\nend-to-end from data and outperforming classical techniques by leveraging the\nunique spatial, temporal, and wavelength structures of astronomical images.\nThis paper introduces AstroCompress: a neural compression challenge for\nastrophysics data, featuring four new datasets (and one legacy dataset) with\n16-bit unsigned integer imaging data in various modes: space-based,\nground-based, multi-wavelength, and time-series imaging. We provide code to\neasily access the data and benchmark seven lossless compression methods (three\nneural and four non-neural, including all practical state-of-the-art\nalgorithms). Our results on lossless compression indicate that lossless neural\ncompression techniques can enhance data collection at observatories, and\nprovide guidance on the adoption of neural compression in scientific\napplications. Though the scope of this paper is restricted to lossless\ncompression, we also comment on the potential exploration of lossy compression\nmethods in future studies.", "AI": {"tldr": "AstroCompress introduces neural lossless compression for astrophysics data, outperforming traditional methods and enhancing observatory data collection.", "motivation": "Remote observatories face data transmission bottlenecks; improved compression can unlock additional scientific value from costly instruments.", "method": "AstroCompress benchmarks seven lossless compression methods (three neural, four classical) on diverse astrophysics datasets.", "result": "Neural compression techniques show promise for improving data collection efficiency at observatories.", "conclusion": "Neural compression can enhance scientific data handling, with potential for future exploration of lossy methods."}}

While the majority of geospatial databases (GDBs)\nprovide high-quality information, their data is (i) limited to specific regions\nand/or (ii) missing some entities, even in their covered areas. Map conflation\nis the process of augmentation of a GDB using another GDB to conflate missing\nspatial features. Existing map conflation methods suffer from two main\nlimitations: (1) They are designed for the conflation of linear objects (e.g.,\nroad networks) and cannot simply be extended to non-linear objects, thus\nmissing information about most entities in the map. (2) They are heuristic\nalgorithmic approaches that are based on pre-defined rules, unable to learn\nentities matching in a data-driven manner. To address these limitations, we\ndesign KRAFT, a learning based approach consisting of three parts: (1)\nKnowledge Graph Construction - where each GDB is represented by a knowledge\ngraph, (2) Map Matching - where we use a knowledge graph alignment method as\nwell as a geospatial feature encoder to match entities in obtained knowledge\ngraphs, and (3) Map Merging - where we merge matched entities in the previous\nmodules in a consistent manner, using a mixed integer linear programming\nformulation that fully merges the GDBs without adding any inconsistencies.

### [1] [A Real-Time Diminished Reality Approach to Privacy in MR Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10466)
*Christian Fane*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Real-time diminished reality system for MR meetings that removes sensitive objects from secondary observers' view using semantic segmentation and inpainting, achieving 20+ fps at 720p.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable privacy control in shared-space mixed reality meetings by allowing users to selectively remove personal or sensitive items from their environment to prevent visibility by other participants.

Method: Uses semantic segmentation and precise object selection followed by real-time inpainting from secondary observer's viewpoint. Implements YOLOv11 for object detection and modified Decoupled Spatial-Temporal Transformer (DSTT) model for video inpainting. Uses mobile ZED 2i depth camera without requiring fixed viewpoint or prior 3D scanning.

Result: The system achieves frame rates exceeding 20 fps at 720p resolution, demonstrating real-time performance for practical privacy-preserving MR applications.

Conclusion: The developed system proves the feasibility of real-time diminished reality for privacy control in mixed reality environments, offering a portable and robust solution that doesn't require fixed viewpoints or pre-scanned environments.

Abstract: Diminished reality (DR) refers to the digital removal of real-world objects
by compositing background content in their place. This thesis presents a
real-time, inpainting-based DR system designed to enable privacy control in
shared-space mixed reality (MR) meetings. The system allows a primary headset
user to selectively remove personal or sensitive items from their environment,
ensuring that those objects are no longer visible to other participants.
Removal is achieved through semantic segmentation and precise object selection,
followed by real-time inpainting from the viewpoint of a secondary observer,
implemented using a mobile ZED 2i depth camera. The solution is designed to be
portable and robust, requiring neither a fixed secondary viewpoint nor prior 3D
scanning of the environment. The system utilises YOLOv11 for object detection
and a modified Decoupled Spatial-Temporal Transformer (DSTT) model for
high-quality video inpainting. At 720p resolution, the pipeline sustains frame
rates exceeding 20 fps, demonstrating the feasibility of real-time diminished
reality for practical privacy-preserving MR applications.

### [2] [SurgLaVi: Large-Scale Hierarchical Dataset for Surgical Vision-Language Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10555)
*Alejandra Perez,Chinedu Nwoye,Ramtin Raji Kermani,Omid Mohareri,Muhammad Abdullah Jamal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SurgLaVi is the largest surgical vision-language dataset with 240k clip-caption pairs from 200+ procedures, featuring automated pipeline for high-quality hierarchical annotations. SurgCLIP model built on this dataset achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple surgical recognition tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Progress in surgical vision-language pre-training is constrained by limited scale, procedural diversity, semantic quality, and hierarchical structure of existing datasets. There's a need for large-scale, high-quality surgical video-text datasets to enable better surgical AI foundation models.

Method: Created SurgLaVi dataset using fully automated pipeline that generates fine-grained transcriptions, segments videos into procedural units, and applies dual-modality filtering to remove noisy samples. Introduced SurgCLIP, a CLIP-style video-text contrastive framework with dual encoders for surgical VLP.

Result: SurgCLIP achieves consistent improvements across phase, step, action, and tool recognition tasks, surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods by large margins. The open-source SurgLaVi-beta contains 113k clip-caption pairs, over 4x larger than existing surgical VLP datasets.

Conclusion: Large-scale, semantically rich, and hierarchically structured datasets directly translate into stronger and more generalizable representations. SurgLaVi establishes itself as a key resource for developing surgical foundation models, demonstrating the value of high-quality surgical vision-language data.

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training (VLP) offers unique advantages for surgery by
aligning language with surgical videos, enabling workflow understanding and
transfer across tasks without relying on expert-labeled datasets. However,
progress in surgical VLP remains constrained by the limited scale, procedural
diversity, semantic quality, and hierarchical structure of existing datasets.
In this work, we present SurgLaVi, the largest and most diverse surgical
vision-language dataset to date, comprising nearly 240k clip-caption pairs from
more than 200 procedures, and comprising hierarchical levels at phase-, step-,
and task-level. At the core of SurgLaVi lies a fully automated pipeline that
systematically generates fine-grained transcriptions of surgical videos and
segments them into coherent procedural units. To ensure high-quality
annotations, it applies dual-modality filtering to remove irrelevant and noisy
samples. Within this framework, the resulting captions are enriched with
contextual detail, producing annotations that are both semantically rich and
easy to interpret. To ensure accessibility, we release SurgLaVi-\b{eta}, an
open-source derivative of 113k clip-caption pairs constructed entirely from
public data, which is over four times larger than existing surgical VLP
datasets. To demonstrate the value of SurgLaVi datasets, we introduce SurgCLIP,
a CLIP-style video-text contrastive framework with dual encoders, as a
representative base model. SurgCLIP achieves consistent improvements across
phase, step, action, and tool recognition, surpassing prior state-of-the-art
methods, often by large margins. These results validate that large-scale,
semantically rich, and hierarchically structured datasets directly translate
into stronger and more generalizable representations, establishing SurgLaVi as
a key resource for developing surgical foundation models.

### [3] [Building a General SimCLR Self-Supervised Foundation Model Across Neurological Diseases to Advance 3D Brain MRI Diagnoses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10620)
*Emily Kaczmarek,Justin Szeto,Brennan Nichyporuk,Tal Arbel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A high-resolution SimCLR-based self-supervised learning foundation model for 3D brain MRI that outperforms other methods across diverse neurological disease prediction tasks, even with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning models for 3D MRI are task-specific and lack generalization. Few foundation models exist for 3D brain MRI, and they are limited in resolution, scope, or accessibility.

Method: Developed a general SimCLR-based SSL foundation model pre-trained on 18,759 patients (44,958 scans) from 11 public datasets spanning diverse neurological diseases. Compared against MAE and supervised baselines on four downstream tasks.

Result: The fine-tuned SimCLR model outperformed all other models across all tasks. Achieved superior performance even when fine-tuned with only 20% of labeled training samples for Alzheimer's disease prediction.

Conclusion: The model provides a broadly applicable and accessible foundation for clinical brain MRI analysis, demonstrating strong generalization across tasks and populations with limited labeled data requirements.

Abstract: 3D structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) brain scans are commonly
acquired in clinical settings to monitor a wide range of neurological
conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders and stroke. While deep
learning models have shown promising results analyzing 3D MRI across a number
of brain imaging tasks, most are highly tailored for specific tasks with
limited labeled data, and are not able to generalize across tasks and/or
populations. The development of self-supervised learning (SSL) has enabled the
creation of large medical foundation models that leverage diverse, unlabeled
datasets ranging from healthy to diseased data, showing significant success in
2D medical imaging applications. However, even the very few foundation models
for 3D brain MRI that have been developed remain limited in resolution, scope,
or accessibility. In this work, we present a general, high-resolution
SimCLR-based SSL foundation model for 3D brain structural MRI, pre-trained on
18,759 patients (44,958 scans) from 11 publicly available datasets spanning
diverse neurological diseases. We compare our model to Masked Autoencoders
(MAE), as well as two supervised baselines, on four diverse downstream
prediction tasks in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. Our
fine-tuned SimCLR model outperforms all other models across all tasks. Notably,
our model still achieves superior performance when fine-tuned using only 20% of
labeled training samples for predicting Alzheimer's disease. We use publicly
available code and data, and release our trained model at
https://github.com/emilykaczmarek/3D-Neuro-SimCLR, contributing a broadly
applicable and accessible foundation model for clinical brain MRI analysis.

### [4] [USCTNet: A deep unfolding nuclear-norm optimization solver for physically consistent HSI reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10651)
*Xiaoyang Ma,Yiyang Chai,Xinran Qu,Hong Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: USCTNet reconstructs hyperspectral images from RGB using physics-grounded inverse problem with nuclear norm regularization, explicit CSS/illumination estimation, and efficient low-rank SVD approximation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB-to-HSI reconstruction is ill-posed and can be physically inconsistent when camera spectral sensitivity (CSS) and scene illumination are misspecified, requiring a physics-aware approach.

Method: Formulate as physics-grounded inverse problem with nuclear norm regularization in learnable transform domain. Explicitly estimate CSS and illumination for forward operator. Introduce data-adaptive low-rank subspace SVT operator to avoid full SVD costs. Develop USCTNet deep unfolding solver with parameter estimation module and learnable proximal updates.

Result: Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art RGB-based methods in reconstruction accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed physics-grounded approach with explicit CSS/illumination estimation and efficient low-rank approximation enables accurate and consistent hyperspectral image reconstruction from single RGB images.

Abstract: Reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSIs) from a single RGB image is
ill-posed and can become physically inconsistent when the camera spectral
sensitivity (CSS) and scene illumination are misspecified. We formulate
RGB-to-HSI reconstruction as a physics-grounded inverse problem regularized by
a nuclear norm in a learnable transform domain, and we explicitly estimate CSS
and illumination to define the forward operator embedded in each iteration,
ensuring colorimetric consistency. To avoid the cost and instability of full
singular-value decompositions (SVDs) required by singular-value thresholding
(SVT), we introduce a data-adaptive low-rank subspace SVT operator. Building on
these components, we develop USCTNet, a deep unfolding solver tailored to HSI
that couples a parameter estimation module with learnable proximal updates.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art RGB-based methods in reconstruction accuracy. Code:

### [5] [A Comparison and Evaluation of Fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Networks to Large Language Models for Image Classification and Segmentation of Brain Tumors on MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10683)
*Felicia Liu,Jay J. Yoo,Farzad Khalvati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLMs underperform CNNs in medical imaging tasks (glioma classification and segmentation), showing limited spatial understanding and minimal improvement from fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the effectiveness of LLMs for medical imaging tasks compared to traditional CNNs, as LLMs have shown strong performance in text-based healthcare but remain unexplored in image-based applications.

Method: Evaluated a general-purpose vision-language LLM (LLaMA 3.2 Instruct) on BraTS 2020 dataset for glioma classification and segmentation, comparing performance before/after fine-tuning against custom 3D CNNs.

Result: CNNs achieved 80% accuracy in classification with balanced metrics, while LLMs reached 76% accuracy but suffered from poor specificity (18%). Fine-tuning improved specificity to 55% but reduced overall performance. For segmentation, LLMs consistently clustered predictions near image center without distinguishing tumor characteristics.

Conclusion: CNNs outperform LLMs in both tasks. LLMs show limited spatial understanding and minimal improvement from fine-tuning, indicating they are not currently well-suited for image-based medical tasks without more rigorous training strategies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in text-based
healthcare tasks. However, their utility in image-based applications remains
unexplored. We investigate the effectiveness of LLMs for medical imaging tasks,
specifically glioma classification and segmentation, and compare their
performance to that of traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Using
the BraTS 2020 dataset of multi-modal brain MRIs, we evaluated a
general-purpose vision-language LLM (LLaMA 3.2 Instruct) both before and after
fine-tuning, and benchmarked its performance against custom 3D CNNs. For glioma
classification (Low-Grade vs. High-Grade), the CNN achieved 80% accuracy and
balanced precision and recall. The general LLM reached 76% accuracy but
suffered from a specificity of only 18%, often misclassifying Low-Grade tumors.
Fine-tuning improved specificity to 55%, but overall performance declined
(e.g., accuracy dropped to 72%). For segmentation, three methods - center
point, bounding box, and polygon extraction, were implemented. CNNs accurately
localized gliomas, though small tumors were sometimes missed. In contrast, LLMs
consistently clustered predictions near the image center, with no distinction
of glioma size, location, or placement. Fine-tuning improved output formatting
but failed to meaningfully enhance spatial accuracy. The bounding polygon
method yielded random, unstructured outputs. Overall, CNNs outperformed LLMs in
both tasks. LLMs showed limited spatial understanding and minimal improvement
from fine-tuning, indicating that, in their current form, they are not
well-suited for image-based tasks. More rigorous fine-tuning or alternative
training strategies may be needed for LLMs to achieve better performance,
robustness, and utility in the medical space.

### [6] [Stable Part Diffusion 4D: Multi-View RGB and Kinematic Parts Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10687)
*Hao Zhang,Chun-Han Yao,Simon Donné,Narendra Ahuja,Varun Jampani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SP4D is a dual-branch diffusion framework that generates paired RGB and kinematic part videos from monocular inputs, using spatial color encoding and cross-branch consistency mechanisms to produce view-consistent structural parts aligned with object articulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional part segmentation methods rely on appearance-based semantic cues, which don't capture kinematic structure. There's a need for methods that produce structural components aligned with object articulation and consistent across views and time for animation and motion tasks.

Method: Dual-branch diffusion model that jointly synthesizes RGB frames and part segmentation maps using spatial color encoding to map part masks to RGB-like images. Includes Bidirectional Diffusion Fusion module and contrastive part consistency loss for cross-branch consistency and spatiotemporal alignment.

Result: SP4D generalizes to diverse scenarios including real-world videos, novel generated objects, and rare articulated poses. Generated 2D part maps can be lifted to 3D to derive skeletal structures and skinning weights with minimal manual adjustments.

Conclusion: The framework produces kinematic-aware outputs suitable for downstream animation and motion-related tasks, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities across various scenarios and object types.

Abstract: We present Stable Part Diffusion 4D (SP4D), a framework for generating paired
RGB and kinematic part videos from monocular inputs. Unlike conventional part
segmentation methods that rely on appearance-based semantic cues, SP4D learns
to produce kinematic parts - structural components aligned with object
articulation and consistent across views and time. SP4D adopts a dual-branch
diffusion model that jointly synthesizes RGB frames and corresponding part
segmentation maps. To simplify the architecture and flexibly enable different
part counts, we introduce a spatial color encoding scheme that maps part masks
to continuous RGB-like images. This encoding allows the segmentation branch to
share the latent VAE from the RGB branch, while enabling part segmentation to
be recovered via straightforward post-processing. A Bidirectional Diffusion
Fusion (BiDiFuse) module enhances cross-branch consistency, supported by a
contrastive part consistency loss to promote spatial and temporal alignment of
part predictions. We demonstrate that the generated 2D part maps can be lifted
to 3D to derive skeletal structures and harmonic skinning weights with few
manual adjustments. To train and evaluate SP4D, we construct KinematicParts20K,
a curated dataset of over 20K rigged objects selected and processed from
Objaverse XL (Deitke et al., 2023), each paired with multi-view RGB and part
video sequences. Experiments show that SP4D generalizes strongly to diverse
scenarios, including real-world videos, novel generated objects, and rare
articulated poses, producing kinematic-aware outputs suitable for downstream
animation and motion-related tasks.

### [7] [SegSLR: Promptable Video Segmentation for Isolated Sign Language Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10710)
*Sven Schreiber,Noha Sarhan,Simone Frintrop,Christian Wilms*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SegSLR is a novel ISLR system that combines RGB and pose data using promptable zero-shot video segmentation to preserve hand shape details and focus processing on relevant body parts, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ISLR approaches lose crucial hand shape and orientation details when combining RGB and pose modalities due to imprecise representations like bounding boxes.

Method: Uses pose information for rough localization, then segments hands and body parts through zero-shot video segmentation to maintain shape details, focusing RGB processing on relevant areas.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ChaLearn249 IsoGD dataset, with ablation studies showing strong benefits from focusing on signer's body and hands.

Conclusion: SegSLR effectively combines RGB and pose information through segmentation, preserving crucial details and improving ISLR performance, validating the design approach.

Abstract: Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) approaches primarily rely on RGB
data or signer pose information. However, combining these modalities often
results in the loss of crucial details, such as hand shape and orientation, due
to imprecise representations like bounding boxes. Therefore, we propose the
ISLR system SegSLR, which combines RGB and pose information through promptable
zero-shot video segmentation. Given the rough localization of the hands and the
signer's body from pose information, we segment the respective parts through
the video to maintain all relevant shape information. Subsequently, the
segmentations focus the processing of the RGB data on the most relevant body
parts for ISLR. This effectively combines RGB and pose information. Our
evaluation on the complex ChaLearn249 IsoGD dataset shows that SegSLR
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, ablation studies indicate
that SegSLR strongly benefits from focusing on the signer's body and hands,
justifying our design choices.

### [8] [SCOPE: Speech-guided COllaborative PErception Framework for Surgical Scene Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10748)
*Jecia Z. Y. Mao,Francis X Creighton,Russell H Taylor,Manish Sahu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCOPE framework integrates speech guidance with vision foundation models for real-time surgical scene segmentation and tracking without manual cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current surgical segmentation solutions require domain-specific labeled data and manual inputs, limiting adaptability in dynamic operating environments.

Method: Combines LLM reasoning with open-set VFMs, uses speech feedback to guide segmentation, and employs instruments as pointers for labeling surgical elements.

Result: Successfully demonstrated on Cataract1k and skull-base datasets, enabling on-the-fly segmentation and tracking in live mock experiments.

Conclusion: Shows potential for developing adaptable, hands-free surgical tools through human-AI collaboration in dynamic OR environments.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation and tracking of relevant elements of the surgical scene
is crucial to enable context-aware intraoperative assistance and decision
making. Current solutions remain tethered to domain-specific, supervised models
that rely on labeled data and required domain-specific data to adapt to new
surgical scenarios and beyond predefined label categories. Recent advances in
prompt-driven vision foundation models (VFM) have enabled open-set, zero-shot
segmentation across heterogeneous medical images. However, dependence of these
models on manual visual or textual cues restricts their deployment in
introperative surgical settings. We introduce a speech-guided collaborative
perception (SCOPE) framework that integrates reasoning capabilities of large
language model (LLM) with perception capabilities of open-set VFMs to support
on-the-fly segmentation, labeling and tracking of surgical instruments and
anatomy in intraoperative video streams. A key component of this framework is a
collaborative perception agent, which generates top candidates of VFM-generated
segmentation and incorporates intuitive speech feedback from clinicians to
guide the segmentation of surgical instruments in a natural human-machine
collaboration paradigm. Afterwards, instruments themselves serve as interactive
pointers to label additional elements of the surgical scene. We evaluated our
proposed framework on a subset of publicly available Cataract1k dataset and an
in-house ex-vivo skull-base dataset to demonstrate its potential to generate
on-the-fly segmentation and tracking of surgical scene. Furthermore, we
demonstrate its dynamic capabilities through a live mock ex-vivo experiment.
This human-AI collaboration paradigm showcase the potential of developing
adaptable, hands-free, surgeon-centric tools for dynamic operating-room
environments.

### [9] [Every Camera Effect, Every Time, All at Once: 4D Gaussian Ray Tracing for Physics-based Camera Effect Data Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10759)
*Yi-Ruei Liu,You-Zhe Xie,Yu-Hsiang Hsu,I-Sheng Fang,Yu-Lun Liu,Jun-Cheng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 4D-GRT is a novel pipeline combining 4D Gaussian Splatting with ray tracing to generate realistic camera effect simulations from multi-view videos, enabling better training data for computer vision systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional computer vision systems fail with real-world camera effects like fisheye distortion and rolling shutter due to lack of training data with these effects. Existing data generation methods are costly, have sim-to-real gaps, or fail to accurately model camera effects.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) Reconstructs dynamic scenes from multi-view videos using 4D Gaussian Splatting, 2) Applies physically-based ray tracing to generate videos with controllable, physically accurate camera effects.

Result: Achieves fastest rendering speed while performing better or comparable rendering quality compared to existing baselines. Also creates a benchmark with eight synthetic dynamic scenes across four camera effects for evaluation.

Conclusion: 4D-GRT provides an effective solution for generating realistic camera effect simulations, addressing the bottleneck in training data for computer vision systems dealing with real-world camera distortions.

Abstract: Common computer vision systems typically assume ideal pinhole cameras but
fail when facing real-world camera effects such as fisheye distortion and
rolling shutter, mainly due to the lack of learning from training data with
camera effects. Existing data generation approaches suffer from either high
costs, sim-to-real gaps or fail to accurately model camera effects. To address
this bottleneck, we propose 4D Gaussian Ray Tracing (4D-GRT), a novel two-stage
pipeline that combines 4D Gaussian Splatting with physically-based ray tracing
for camera effect simulation. Given multi-view videos, 4D-GRT first
reconstructs dynamic scenes, then applies ray tracing to generate videos with
controllable, physically accurate camera effects. 4D-GRT achieves the fastest
rendering speed while performing better or comparable rendering quality
compared to existing baselines. Additionally, we construct eight synthetic
dynamic scenes in indoor environments across four camera effects as a benchmark
to evaluate generated videos with camera effects.

*Marcelo Sandoval-Castaneda,Bryan Russell,Josef Sivic,Gregory Shakhnarovich,Fabian Caba Heilbron*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multi-agent system for automated video editing using Editor and Critic agents with natural language instructions and feedback, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automate core video editing tasks for applications in filmmaking, advertising, and social media content creation, moving beyond just retrieval and UI-focused approaches.

Method: Multi-agent approach with Editor agent that uses video editing tools based on natural language instructions, and Critic agent that provides feedback or renders final output. Learning-based approach for agent communication.

Result: System vastly outperforms existing approaches in coverage, time constraint satisfaction, and human preference based on user study evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-agent framework effectively automates video editing through sequential decision making and specialized agent collaboration, demonstrating superior performance over current methods.

Abstract: Automated tools for video editing and assembly have applications ranging from
filmmaking and advertisement to content creation for social media. Previous
video editing work has mainly focused on either retrieval or user interfaces,
leaving actual editing to the user. In contrast, we propose to automate the
core task of video editing, formulating it as sequential decision making
process. Ours is a multi-agent approach. We design an Editor agent and a Critic
agent. The Editor takes as input a collection of video clips together with
natural language instructions and uses tools commonly found in video editing
software to produce an edited sequence. On the other hand, the Critic gives
natural language feedback to the editor based on the produced sequence or
renders it if it is satisfactory. We introduce a learning-based approach for
enabling effective communication across specialized agents to address the
language-driven video editing task. Finally, we explore an LLM-as-a-judge
metric for evaluating the quality of video editing system and compare it with
general human preference. We evaluate our system's output video sequences
qualitatively and quantitatively through a user study and find that our system
vastly outperforms existing approaches in terms of coverage, time constraint
satisfaction, and human preference.

*Sajad Amiri,Shahram Taeb,Sara Gharibi,Setareh Dehghanfard,Somayeh Sadat Mehrnia,Mehrdad Oveisi,Ilker Hacihaliloglu,Arman Rahmim,Mohammad R. Salmanpour*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A stability-aware ML framework predicts glioma MRI contrast enhancement from non-contrast scans, achieving high accuracy (avg 0.93) across multiple datasets while reducing need for gadolinium contrast agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) present safety, cost, and accessibility concerns in glioma imaging. Predicting enhancement from non-contrast MRI offers a safer alternative for assessing tumor aggressiveness and treatment planning.

Method: Analyzed 1,446 glioma cases from 4 TCIA datasets. Extracted 108 radiomic features from non-contrast T1WI, combined with 48 dimensionality reduction methods and 25 classifiers (1,200 total pipelines). Used rotational validation trained on 3 datasets, tested on the fourth.

Result: Cross-validation accuracy: 0.91-0.96; External testing: 0.87-0.98 (avg 0.93). F1, precision, and recall were stable (0.87-0.96). ROC-AUC varied more (0.50-0.82) due to cohort heterogeneity. MI with ETr pipeline consistently performed best.

Conclusion: Stability-aware model selection enables reliable prediction of contrast enhancement from non-contrast MRI, reducing GBCA reliance and improving cross-center generalizability. Provides scalable template for reproducible ML in neuro-oncology.

Abstract: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are central to glioma imaging but
raise safety, cost, and accessibility concerns. Predicting contrast enhancement
from non-contrast MRI using machine learning (ML) offers a safer alternative,
as enhancement reflects tumor aggressiveness and informs treatment planning.
Yet scanner and cohort variability hinder robust model selection. We propose a
stability-aware framework to identify reproducible ML pipelines for multicenter
prediction of glioma MRI contrast enhancement. We analyzed 1,446 glioma cases
from four TCIA datasets (UCSF-PDGM, UPENN-GB, BRATS-Africa, BRATS-TCGA-LGG).
Non-contrast T1WI served as input, with enhancement derived from paired
post-contrast T1WI. Using PyRadiomics under IBSI standards, 108 features were
extracted and combined with 48 dimensionality reduction methods and 25
classifiers, yielding 1,200 pipelines. Rotational validation was trained on
three datasets and tested on the fourth. Cross-validation prediction accuracies
ranged from 0.91 to 0.96, with external testing achieving 0.87 (UCSF-PDGM),
0.98 (UPENN-GB), and 0.95 (BRATS-Africa), with an average of 0.93. F1,
precision, and recall were stable (0.87 to 0.96), while ROC-AUC varied more
widely (0.50 to 0.82), reflecting cohort heterogeneity. The MI linked with ETr
pipeline consistently ranked highest, balancing accuracy and stability. This
framework demonstrates that stability-aware model selection enables reliable
prediction of contrast enhancement from non-contrast glioma MRI, reducing
reliance on GBCAs and improving generalizability across centers. It provides a
scalable template for reproducible ML in neuro-oncology and beyond.

### [12] [Group Evidence Matters: Tiling-based Semantic Gating for Dense Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10779)
*Yilun Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A detector-agnostic post-processing framework that improves recall for dense small objects in UAV imagery by converting overlap-induced redundancy into group evidence through spatial and semantic clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense small objects in UAV imagery are often missed due to long-range viewpoints, occlusion, and clutter, requiring improved detection recall.

Method: Overlapping tiling recovers low-confidence candidates, followed by Spatial Gate (DBSCAN on box centroids) and Semantic Gate (DBSCAN on ResNet-18 embeddings) to validate group evidence. Validated groups receive confidence reweighting before class-aware NMS fusion.

Result: On VisDrone dataset: recall increased from 0.685 to 0.778 (+0.093), precision adjusted from 0.801 to 0.595, yielding F1=0.669. Post-processing latency averages 0.095s per image.

Conclusion: The framework provides recall-first, precision-trade-off behavior beneficial for recall-sensitive applications like far-field counting and monitoring, requires no retraining, and integrates with modern detectors.

Abstract: Dense small objects in UAV imagery are often missed due to long-range
viewpoints, occlusion, and clutter[cite: 5]. This paper presents a
detector-agnostic post-processing framework that converts overlap-induced
redundancy into group evidence[cite: 6]. Overlapping tiling first recovers
low-confidence candidates[cite: 7]. A Spatial Gate (DBSCAN on box centroids)
and a Semantic Gate (DBSCAN on ResNet-18 embeddings) then validates group
evidence[cite: 7]. Validated groups receive controlled confidence reweighting
before class-aware NMS fusion[cite: 8]. Experiments on VisDrone show a recall
increase from 0.685 to 0.778 (+0.093) and a precision adjustment from 0.801 to
0.595, yielding F1=0.669[cite: 9]. Post-processing latency averages 0.095 s per
image[cite: 10]. These results indicate recall-first, precision-trade-off
behavior that benefits recall-sensitive applications such as far-field counting
and monitoring[cite: 10]. Ablation confirms that tiling exposes missed objects,
spatial clustering stabilizes geometry, semantic clustering enforces appearance
coherence, and reweighting provides calibrated integration with the
baseline[cite: 11]. The framework requires no retraining and integrates with
modern detectors[cite: 12]. Future work will reduce semantic gating cost and
extend the approach with temporal cues[cite: 13].

*Weipeng Zhong,Peizhou Cao,Yichen Jin,Li Luo,Wenzhe Cai,Jingli Lin,Hanqing Wang,Zhaoyang Lyu,Tai Wang,Bo Dai,Xudong Xu,Jiangmiao Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InternScenes is a large-scale simulatable indoor scene dataset with ~40K diverse scenes, 1.96M objects, addressing limitations of existing datasets through realistic layouts with small items and collision resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D scene datasets suffer from limitations in scale, diversity, sanitized layouts lacking small items, and object collisions, hindering Embodied AI advancement.

Method: Created by integrating three scene sources (real-world scans, procedurally generated scenes, designer-created scenes) with comprehensive processing including real-to-sim replicas, interactive object incorporation, and physical simulation for collision resolution.

Result: Dataset covers 15 scene types and 288 object classes with average 41.5 objects per region, enabling benchmark applications in scene layout generation and point-goal navigation with complex realistic layouts.

Conclusion: InternScenes provides valuable resources for scaling model training and enables generation and navigation in complex scenes, with commitment to open-source for community benefit.

Abstract: The advancement of Embodied AI heavily relies on large-scale, simulatable 3D
scene datasets characterized by scene diversity and realistic layouts. However,
existing datasets typically suffer from limitations in data scale or diversity,
sanitized layouts lacking small items, and severe object collisions. To address
these shortcomings, we introduce \textbf{InternScenes}, a novel large-scale
simulatable indoor scene dataset comprising approximately 40,000 diverse scenes
by integrating three disparate scene sources, real-world scans, procedurally
generated scenes, and designer-created scenes, including 1.96M 3D objects and
covering 15 common scene types and 288 object classes. We particularly preserve
massive small items in the scenes, resulting in realistic and complex layouts
with an average of 41.5 objects per region. Our comprehensive data processing
pipeline ensures simulatability by creating real-to-sim replicas for real-world
scans, enhances interactivity by incorporating interactive objects into these
scenes, and resolves object collisions by physical simulations. We demonstrate
the value of InternScenes with two benchmark applications: scene layout
generation and point-goal navigation. Both show the new challenges posed by the
complex and realistic layouts. More importantly, InternScenes paves the way for
scaling up the model training for both tasks, making the generation and
navigation in such complex scenes possible. We commit to open-sourcing the
data, models, and benchmarks to benefit the whole community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize mathematical handwriting representation by finding the best trade-off between basis choice and polynomial degree for accurate modeling with low computational cost.

Method: Analyzed condition numbers for polynomial evaluation in Legendre, Chebyshev, and their Sobolev variants, and bounded how different inner products provide norms for symbol variations.

Result: The study provides insights into computational efficiency and accuracy trade-offs between different polynomial bases for mathematical handwriting representation.

Conclusion: Different polynomial bases (Legendre, Chebyshev, Sobolev variants) offer varying trade-offs between computational cost and modeling accuracy, with condition numbers and norm bounds serving as key metrics for optimization.

Abstract: Previous work has made use of a parameterized plane curve polynomial
representation for mathematical handwriting, with the polynomials represented
in a Legendre or Legendre-Sobolev graded basis. This provides a compact
geometric representation for the digital ink. Preliminary results have also
been shown for Chebyshev and Chebyshev-Sobolev bases. This article explores the
trade-offs between basis choice and polynomial degree to achieve accurate
modeling with a low computational cost. To do this, we consider the condition
number for polynomial evaluation in these bases and bound how the various inner
products give norms for the variations between symbols.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multitask diffusion framework for time-agnostic pixel-wise prediction of glioma progression from sparse longitudinal MRI data, incorporating deformation modeling, targeted augmentation, and radiotherapy-weighted loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Glioma progression prediction is challenging due to sparse, irregular longitudinal MRI data with incomplete follow-up sequences, creating data imbalances and making reliable modeling difficult in clinical practice.

Method: Multitask diffusion framework that simultaneously generates future FLAIR sequences at any time point and estimates spatial probabilistic tumor evolution maps using signed distance fields (SDFs). Integrates pretrained deformation module for temporal dynamics, targeted augmentation pipeline for data scarcity, and radiotherapy-weighted focal loss leveraging radiation dose maps.

Result: The framework produces flexible time-dependent probability maps from just two early follow-up scans, enabling interrogation of tumor progression risks at any future temporal milestone. Achieved promising results on both public and private datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method addresses clinical limitations of sparse longitudinal data through innovative multitask diffusion modeling, deformation integration, and targeted augmentation, providing clinicians with flexible tools for glioma progression prediction and uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Glioma, an aggressive brain malignancy characterized by rapid progression and
its poor prognosis, poses significant challenges for accurate evolution
prediction. These challenges are exacerbated by sparse, irregularly acquired
longitudinal MRI data in clinical practice, where incomplete follow-up
sequences create data imbalances and make reliable modeling difficult. In this
paper, we present a multitask diffusion framework for time-agnostic, pixel-wise
prediction of glioma progression. The model simultaneously generates future
FLAIR sequences at any chosen time point and estimates spatial probabilistic
tumor evolution maps derived using signed distance fields (SDFs), allowing
uncertainty quantification. To capture temporal dynamics of tumor evolution
across arbitrary intervals, we integrate a pretrained deformation module that
models inter-scan changes using deformation fields. Regarding the common
clinical limitation of data scarcity, we implement a targeted augmentation
pipeline that synthesizes complete sequences of three follow-up scans and
imputes missing MRI modalities from available patient studies, improving the
stability and accuracy of predictive models. Based on merely two follow-up
scans at earlier timepoints, our framework produces flexible time-depending
probability maps, enabling clinicians to interrogate tumor progression risks at
any future temporal milestone. We further introduce a radiotherapy-weighted
focal loss term that leverages radiation dose maps, as these highlight regions
of greater clinical importance during model training. The proposed method was
trained on a public dataset and evaluated on an internal private dataset,
achieving promising results in both cases

*Simone Mosco,Daniel Fusaro,Wanmeng Li,Emanuele Menegatti,Alberto Pretto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation method that uses point-plane projections to extract complementary 2D features from LiDAR data alone, with geometry-aware data augmentation for improved performance in limited-data scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LiDAR segmentation methods often require multi-sensor data or large datasets, suffering from high computational complexity and poor generalization in data-scarce scenarios. The paper aims to improve point-based methods using only LiDAR data.

Method: Uses point-plane projections to extract features from multiple 2D representations of point clouds. Introduces geometry-aware data augmentation technique aligned with LiDAR sensor properties to address class imbalance.

Result: Significant improvements in limited-data scenarios while achieving competitive results on standard datasets (SemanticKITTI and PandaSet).

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively learns complementary features from 2D representations through point-plane projections, enabling strong performance with only LiDAR data and better generalization in data-scarce environments.

Abstract: LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation is essential for interpreting 3D
environments in applications such as autonomous driving and robotics. Recent
methods achieve strong performance by exploiting different point cloud
representations or incorporating data from other sensors, such as cameras or
external datasets. However, these approaches often suffer from high
computational complexity and require large amounts of training data, limiting
their generalization in data-scarce scenarios. In this paper, we improve the
performance of point-based methods by effectively learning features from 2D
representations through point-plane projections, enabling the extraction of
complementary information while relying solely on LiDAR data. Additionally, we
introduce a geometry-aware technique for data augmentation that aligns with
LiDAR sensor properties and mitigates class imbalance. We implemented and
evaluated our method that applies point-plane projections onto multiple
informative 2D representations of the point cloud. Experiments demonstrate that
this approach leads to significant improvements in limited-data scenarios,
while also achieving competitive results on two publicly available standard
datasets, as SemanticKITTI and PandaSet. The code of our method is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenUrban3D is the first 3D open-vocabulary semantic segmentation framework for large-scale urban scenes that works without aligned multi-view images, pre-trained networks, or manual annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation is crucial for urban point clouds in applications like digital twins and smart cities, but remains unexplored due to lack of aligned multi-view imagery and poor generalization of existing 3D segmentation methods across diverse urban environments.

Method: Generates semantic features directly from raw point clouds through multi-view, multi-granularity rendering, mask-level vision-language feature extraction, and sample-balanced fusion, followed by distillation into a 3D backbone model.

Result: Achieves significant improvements in segmentation accuracy and cross-scene generalization on large-scale urban benchmarks (SensatUrban and SUM) compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: OpenUrban3D demonstrates potential as a flexible and scalable solution for 3D urban scene understanding, enabling zero-shot segmentation for arbitrary text queries while capturing both semantic richness and geometric priors.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation enables models to recognize and segment
objects from arbitrary natural language descriptions, offering the flexibility
to handle novel, fine-grained, or functionally defined categories beyond fixed
label sets. While this capability is crucial for large-scale urban point clouds
that support applications such as digital twins, smart city management, and
urban analytics, it remains largely unexplored in this domain. The main
obstacles are the frequent absence of high-quality, well-aligned multi-view
imagery in large-scale urban point cloud datasets and the poor generalization
of existing three-dimensional (3D) segmentation pipelines across diverse urban
environments with substantial variation in geometry, scale, and appearance. To
address these challenges, we present OpenUrban3D, the first 3D open-vocabulary
semantic segmentation framework for large-scale urban scenes that operates
without aligned multi-view images, pre-trained point cloud segmentation
networks, or manual annotations. Our approach generates robust semantic
features directly from raw point clouds through multi-view, multi-granularity
rendering, mask-level vision-language feature extraction, and sample-balanced
fusion, followed by distillation into a 3D backbone model. This design enables
zero-shot segmentation for arbitrary text queries while capturing both semantic
richness and geometric priors. Extensive experiments on large-scale urban
benchmarks, including SensatUrban and SUM, show that OpenUrban3D achieves
significant improvements in both segmentation accuracy and cross-scene
generalization over existing methods, demonstrating its potential as a flexible
and scalable solution for 3D urban scene understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoOEP is an automated online exam proctoring system using dual cameras and multi-modal AI to detect cheating behaviors with 90.7% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online education growth requires scalable academic integrity solutions, as traditional human proctoring is not feasible at scale and existing automated solutions are often intrusive or ineffective.

Method: Uses dual-camera setup for frontal and workspace views. Integrates Face Module (ArcFace for identity verification, head pose, gaze tracking, mouth movement) and Hand Module (YOLOv11 for prohibited item detection). Features aggregated into LSTM network for temporal pattern analysis and real-time cheating probability scoring.

Result: Achieves 90.7% accuracy in suspicious activity classification, mAP@.5 of 0.57 for prohibited item detection, and processes video at 2.4 FPS without GPU.

Conclusion: AutoOEP provides an effective, resource-efficient automated proctoring solution that reduces human intervention needs and enhances online assessment integrity.

Abstract: The burgeoning of online education has created an urgent need for robust and
scalable systems to ensure academic integrity during remote examinations.
Traditional human proctoring is often not feasible at scale, while existing
automated solutions can be intrusive or fail to detect a wide range of cheating
behaviors. This paper introduces AutoOEP (Automated Online Exam Proctoring), a
comprehensive, multi-modal framework that leverages computer vision and machine
learning to provide effective, automated proctoring. The system utilizes a
dual-camera setup to capture both a frontal view of the examinee and a side
view of the workspace, minimizing blind spots. Our approach integrates several
parallel analyses: the Face Module performs continuous identity verification
using ArcFace, along with head pose estimation, gaze tracking, and mouth
movement analysis to detect suspicious cues. Concurrently, the Hand Module
employs a fine-tuned YOLOv11 model for detecting prohibited items (e.g., mobile
phones, notes) and tracks hand proximity to these objects. Features from these
modules are aggregated and fed into a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network
that analyzes temporal patterns to calculate a real-time cheating probability
score. We evaluate AutoOEP on a custom-collected dataset simulating diverse
exam conditions. Our system achieves an accuracy of 90.7% in classifying
suspicious activities. The object detection component obtains a mean Average
Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.57 for prohibited items, and the entire framework
processes video streams at approximately 2.4 frames per second without a GPU.
The results demonstrate that AutoOEP is an effective and resource-efficient
solution for automated proctoring, significantly reducing the need for human
intervention and enhancing the integrity of online assessments.

*Weiqiang Zhao,Tianzhu Liu,Yuzhe Gui,Yanfeng Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-camera CASSI framework using TV subgradient theory to improve spectral image reconstruction with better interpretability and performance than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in compressive spectral imaging where high compression ratios create ill-posed reconstruction problems, and existing methods lack interpretability or rely on handcrafted priors.

Method: Proposes dual-camera CASSI with total variation subgradient theory, dynamic regularization using RGB/panchromatic reference images, and adaptive reference generation from auxiliary cameras.

Result: Effectively preserves spatial-spectral structural consistency and demonstrates robust performance across diverse reconstruction scenarios with mathematical interpretability.

Conclusion: Establishes an interpretable mathematical foundation for computational spectral imaging that balances performance with physical interpretability, overcoming limitations of both traditional and deep learning approaches.

Abstract: Spectral imaging technology has long-faced fundamental challenges in
balancing spectral, spatial, and temporal resolutions. While compressive
sensing-based Coded Aperture Snapshot Spectral Imaging (CASSI) mitigates this
trade-off through optical encoding, high compression ratios result in ill-posed
reconstruction problems. Traditional model-based methods exhibit limited
performance due to reliance on handcrafted inherent image priors, while deep
learning approaches are constrained by their black-box nature, which
compromises physical interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose
a dual-camera CASSI reconstruction framework that integrates total variation
(TV) subgradient theory. By establishing an end-to-end SD-CASSI mathematical
model, we reduce the computational complexity of solving the inverse problem
and provide a mathematically well-founded framework for analyzing multi-camera
systems. A dynamic regularization strategy is introduced, incorporating
normalized gradient constraints from RGB/panchromatic-derived reference images,
which constructs a TV subgradient similarity function with strict convex
optimization guarantees. Leveraging spatial priors from auxiliary cameras, an
adaptive reference generation and updating mechanism is designed to provide
subgradient guidance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
effectively preserves spatial-spectral structural consistency. The theoretical
framework establishes an interpretable mathematical foundation for
computational spectral imaging, demonstrating robust performance across diverse
reconstruction scenarios. The source code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A compact 2.5M-parameter Metadata-aware Mixture-of-Experts Masked Autoencoder (MoE-MAE) that combines sparse expert routing with geo-temporal conditioning achieves competitive performance with much larger models in Earth Observation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale foundation models in Earth Observation are computationally expensive, limiting accessibility and reuse for downstream tasks. The authors investigate compact architectures as a practical pathway toward smaller general-purpose EO models.

Method: Proposed MoE-MAE combines sparse expert routing with geo-temporal conditioning, incorporating imagery alongside latitude/longitude and seasonal/daily cyclic encodings. Pretrained on BigEarthNet-Landsat dataset and evaluated using linear probes on frozen encoder embeddings.

Result: Despite its small size (2.5M parameters), the model competes with much larger architectures. Metadata-aware pretraining improves transfer and label efficiency. Even on EuroSAT-Landsat dataset without explicit metadata, it shows competitive performance compared to models with hundreds of millions of parameters.

Conclusion: Compact, metadata-aware MoE-MAEs are an efficient and scalable step toward future EO foundation models, demonstrating that small models can achieve competitive performance through intelligent architecture design and metadata integration.

Abstract: Recent advances in Earth Observation have focused on large-scale foundation
models. However, these models are computationally expensive, limiting their
accessibility and reuse for downstream tasks. In this work, we investigate
compact architectures as a practical pathway toward smaller general-purpose EO
models. We propose a Metadata-aware Mixture-of-Experts Masked Autoencoder
(MoE-MAE) with only 2.5M parameters. The model combines sparse expert routing
with geo-temporal conditioning, incorporating imagery alongside
latitude/longitude and seasonal/daily cyclic encodings. We pretrain the MoE-MAE
on the BigEarthNet-Landsat dataset and evaluate embeddings from its frozen
encoder using linear probes. Despite its small size, the model competes with
much larger architectures, demonstrating that metadata-aware pretraining
improves transfer and label efficiency. To further assess generalization, we
evaluate on the EuroSAT-Landsat dataset, which lacks explicit metadata, and
still observe competitive performance compared to models with hundreds of
millions of parameters. These results suggest that compact, metadata-aware
MoE-MAEs are an efficient and scalable step toward future EO foundation models.

*Farhan Sadik,Christopher L. Newman,Stuart J. Warden,Rachel K. Surowiec*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed ESWGAN-GP model with edge enhancement and self-attention for motion artifact correction in HR-pQCT bone imaging, achieving improved SNR, SSIM and VIF metrics on both simulated and real datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rigid-motion artifacts hinder in vivo assessment of bone microstructures in HR-pQCT, and no motion correction methods exist due to lack of standardized degradation models.

Method: Optimized sinogram-based method to simulate motion artifacts, creating paired datasets. Proposed Edge-enhanced Self-attention WGAN-GP with edge-enhancing skip connections, self-attention mechanisms, and VGG-based perceptual loss.

Result: Achieved SNR 26.78, SSIM 0.81, VIF 0.76 on source dataset; SNR 29.31, SSIM 0.87, VIF 0.81 on target dataset with improved performance.

Conclusion: Methods address simplified motion representation but represent important initial step toward implementing deep learning-based motion correction in HR-pQCT to overcome a major adoption challenge.

Abstract: Rigid-motion artifacts, such as cortical bone streaking and trabecular
smearing, hinder in vivo assessment of bone microstructures in high-resolution
peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT). Despite various motion
grading techniques, no motion correction methods exist due to the lack of
standardized degradation models. We optimize a conventional sinogram-based
method to simulate motion artifacts in HR-pQCT images, creating paired datasets
of motion-corrupted images and their corresponding ground truth, which enables
seamless integration into supervised learning frameworks for motion correction.
As such, we propose an Edge-enhanced Self-attention Wasserstein Generative
Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (ESWGAN-GP) to address motion
artifacts in both simulated (source) and real-world (target) datasets. The
model incorporates edge-enhancing skip connections to preserve trabecular edges
and self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies, facilitating
motion correction. A visual geometry group (VGG)-based perceptual loss is used
to reconstruct fine micro-structural features. The ESWGAN-GP achieves a mean
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 26.78, structural similarity index measure
(SSIM) of 0.81, and visual information fidelity (VIF) of 0.76 for the source
dataset, while showing improved performance on the target dataset with an SNR
of 29.31, SSIM of 0.87, and VIF of 0.81. The proposed methods address a
simplified representation of real-world motion that may not fully capture the
complexity of in vivo motion artifacts. Nevertheless, because motion artifacts
present one of the foremost challenges to more widespread adoption of this
modality, these methods represent an important initial step toward implementing
deep learning-based motion correction in HR-pQCT.

TL;DR: Analysis of factors affecting gaze-based authentication performance using Meta Quest Pro hardware and neural networks, examining signal quality, calibration methods, and filtering effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify key factors that influence the performance of state-of-the-art gaze-based authentication systems, which is crucial for developing more reliable and secure authentication methods.

Method: Conducted experiments on a large-scale dataset of 8,849 subjects using Meta Quest Pro equivalent hardware with 72Hz video oculography. Employed state-of-the-art neural network architecture to study effects of eye tracking signal quality, calibration aspects, and gaze filtering.

Result: Found that using same calibration target depth, fusing calibrated and non-calibrated gaze, and improving signal quality all enhance authentication performance. A simple three-sample moving average filter generally reduces performance, with some exceptions noted.

Conclusion: Specific calibration practices and signal quality improvements significantly boost gaze authentication performance, while simple filtering tends to be detrimental, providing guidance for optimizing gaze-based authentication systems.

Abstract: This paper examines the key factors that influence the performance of
state-of-the-art gaze-based authentication. Experiments were conducted on a
large-scale, in-house dataset comprising 8,849 subjects collected with Meta
Quest Pro equivalent hardware running a video oculography-driven gaze
estimation pipeline at 72Hz. The state-of-the-art neural network architecture
was employed to study the influence of the following factors on authentication
performance: eye tracking signal quality, various aspects of eye tracking
calibration, and simple filtering on estimated raw gaze. We found that using
the same calibration target depth for eye tracking calibration, fusing
calibrated and non-calibrated gaze, and improving eye tracking signal quality
all enhance authentication performance. We also found that a simple
three-sample moving average filter slightly reduces authentication performance
in general. While these findings hold true for the most part, some exceptions
were noted.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Skin tone recognition and generation are crucial for model fairness, healthcare, and generative AI but remain challenging due to lack of comprehensive datasets and robust methodologies.

Method: Introduce TrueSkin dataset with 7299 images systematically categorized into 6 classes under diverse conditions. Benchmark existing recognition and generation approaches, then train recognition models and fine-tune generation models using TrueSkin.

Result: LMMs misclassify intermediate skin tones as lighter ones; generative models struggle with specified skin tones due to biases from unrelated attributes. Training on TrueSkin improves classification accuracy by >20% and significantly enhances skin tone fidelity in generation models.

Conclusion: Comprehensive datasets like TrueSkin are essential for benchmarking and improving fairness and accuracy in skin tone recognition and generation tasks.

Abstract: Skin tone recognition and generation play important roles in model fairness,
healthcare, and generative AI, yet they remain challenging due to the lack of
comprehensive datasets and robust methodologies. Compared to other human image
analysis tasks, state-of-the-art large multimodal models (LMMs) and image
generation models struggle to recognize and synthesize skin tones accurately.
To address this, we introduce TrueSkin, a dataset with 7299 images
systematically categorized into 6 classes, collected under diverse lighting
conditions, camera angles, and capture settings. Using TrueSkin, we benchmark
existing recognition and generation approaches, revealing substantial biases:
LMMs tend to misclassify intermediate skin tones as lighter ones, whereas
generative models struggle to accurately produce specified skin tones when
influenced by inherent biases from unrelated attributes in the prompts, such as
hairstyle or environmental context. We further demonstrate that training a
recognition model on TrueSkin improves classification accuracy by more than
20\% compared to LMMs and conventional approaches, and fine-tuning with
TrueSkin significantly improves skin tone fidelity in image generation models.
Our findings highlight the need for comprehensive datasets like TrueSkin, which
not only serves as a benchmark for evaluating existing models but also provides
a valuable training resource to enhance fairness and accuracy in skin tone
recognition and generation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited labeled training data for animal monitoring and the challenge of selecting optimal pre-trained models among numerous neural network architectures, especially for researchers new to the field.

Method: Reinforcement learning framework with upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithm to systematically evaluate and rank pre-trained models for animal detection tasks.

Result: Achieves higher detection rate while requiring significantly less computational time compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: Proposed framework effectively automates model selection process for animal detection, overcoming data limitations and architectural complexity challenges.

Abstract: Animal health monitoring and population management are critical aspects of
wildlife conservation and livestock management that increasingly rely on
automated detection and tracking systems. While Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
based systems combined with computer vision offer promising solutions for
non-invasive animal monitoring across challenging terrains, limited
availability of labeled training data remains an obstacle in developing
effective deep learning (DL) models for these applications. Transfer learning
has emerged as a potential solution, allowing models trained on large datasets
to be adapted for resource-limited scenarios such as those with limited data.
However, the vast landscape of pre-trained neural network architectures makes
it challenging to select optimal models, particularly for researchers new to
the field. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based
transfer learning framework that employs an upper confidence bound (UCB)
algorithm to automatically select the most suitable pre-trained model for
animal detection tasks. Our approach systematically evaluates and ranks
candidate models based on their performance, streamlining the model selection
process. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves a higher
detection rate while requiring significantly less computational time compared
to traditional methods.

Motivation: To develop accurate automatic fungal species recognition tools that can handle highly imbalanced class distributions and reliably identify rare species with very few training samples, supporting biodiversity monitoring efforts.

Method: A robust deep learning method based on prototypical networks that enhances prototype representations for few-shot fungal classification.

Result: The prototypical network approach exceeded the competition baseline by more than 30 percentage points in Recall@5 on both public and private leaderboards, demonstrating strong performance for both common and rare species.

Conclusion: The proposed method shows strong potential for accurately identifying fungal species, particularly rare and under-documented taxa, supporting the main objectives of the FungiCLEF 2025 competition for biodiversity monitoring.

Abstract: The FungiCLEF 2025 competition addresses the challenge of automatic fungal
species recognition using realistic, field-collected observational data.
Accurate identification tools support both mycologists and citizen scientists,
greatly enhancing large-scale biodiversity monitoring. Effective recognition
systems in this context must handle highly imbalanced class distributions and
provide reliable performance even when very few training samples are available
for many species, especially rare and under-documented taxa that are often
missing from standard training sets. According to competition organizers, about
20\% of all verified fungi observations, representing nearly 20,000 instances,
are associated with these rarely recorded species. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a robust deep learning method based on prototypical networks, which
enhances prototype representations for few-shot fungal classification. Our
prototypical network approach exceeds the competition baseline by more than 30
percentage points in Recall@5 on both the public (PB) and private (PR)
leaderboards. This demonstrates strong potential for accurately identifying
both common and rare fungal species, supporting the main objectives of
FungiCLEF 2025.

Method: csMIL performs global clustering across all bags to establish cluster centers, then local clustering within each bag. It computes attention scores within each cluster and applies sparse regularization to cluster weights to selectively retain relevant clusters while discarding irrelevant ones.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows csMIL requires O(s log K) bags to recover s relevant clusters. Empirically, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on CAMELYON16 and TCGA-NSCLC histopathology benchmarks.

Conclusion: csMIL enhances robustness to noisy instances, improves interpretability by identifying critical regions, reduces computational complexity, and provides a theoretically grounded framework for sparse instance selection in MIL problems.

Abstract: Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) is pivotal for analyzing complex, weakly
labeled datasets, such as whole-slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology,
where bags comprise unordered collections of instances with sparse diagnostic
relevance. Traditional MIL approaches, including early statistical methods and
recent attention-based frameworks, struggle with instance redundancy and lack
explicit mechanisms for discarding non-informative instances, limiting their
robustness and interpretability. We propose Cluster-level Sparse MIL (csMIL), a
novel framework that integrates global-local instance clustering,
within-cluster attention, and cluster-level sparsity induction to address these
challenges. Our csMIL first performs global clustering across all bags to
establish $K$ cluster centers, followed by local clustering within each bag to
assign cluster labels. Attention scores are computed within each cluster, and
sparse regularization is applied to cluster weights, enabling the selective
retention of diagnostically relevant clusters while discarding irrelevant ones.
This approach enhances robustness to noisy instances, improves interpretability
by identifying critical regions, and reduces computational complexity.
Theoretical analysis demonstrates that csMIL requires $O(s log K)$ bags to
recover $s$ relevant clusters, aligning with compressed sensing principles.
Empirically, csMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public
histopathology benchmarks (CAMELYON16, TCGA-NSCLC).

*Canhui Tang,Sanping Zhou,Haoyue Shi,Le Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel zero-shot video anomaly detection framework using skeleton data with action typicality and uniqueness learning, achieving state-of-the-art results without target domain training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot video anomaly detection is crucial for practical applications like data privacy and new surveillance deployments, but existing skeleton-based methods lack generalization to new scenes with different normal/abnormal patterns.

Method: Uses language-guided semantic typicality modeling to project skeleton snippets into action semantic space with LLM knowledge distillation, plus test-time context uniqueness analysis for scene-adaptive boundaries.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four large-scale VAD datasets (ShanghaiTech, UBnormal, NWPU, UCF-Crime) with over 100 unseen surveillance scenes.

Conclusion: The framework successfully unlocks skeleton data potential through action typicality and uniqueness learning, enabling effective zero-shot anomaly detection across diverse unseen surveillance environments.

Abstract: Zero-Shot Video Anomaly Detection (ZS-VAD) requires temporally localizing
anomalies without target domain training data, which is a crucial task due to
various practical concerns, e.g., data privacy or new surveillance deployments.
Skeleton-based approach has inherent generalizable advantages in achieving
ZS-VAD as it eliminates domain disparities both in background and human
appearance. However, existing methods only learn low-level skeleton
representation and rely on the domain-limited normality boundary, which cannot
generalize well to new scenes with different normal and abnormal behavior
patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel zero-shot video anomaly detection
framework, unlocking the potential of skeleton data via action typicality and
uniqueness learning. Firstly, we introduce a language-guided semantic
typicality modeling module that projects skeleton snippets into action semantic
space and distills LLM's knowledge of typical normal and abnormal behaviors
during training. Secondly, we propose a test-time context uniqueness analysis
module to finely analyze the spatio-temporal differences between skeleton
snippets and then derive scene-adaptive boundaries. Without using any training
samples from the target domain, our method achieves state-of-the-art results
against skeleton-based methods on four large-scale VAD datasets: ShanghaiTech,
UBnormal, NWPU, and UCF-Crime, featuring over 100 unseen surveillance scenes.

Result: The platform quantifies key metrics like cyst formation rate, growth velocity, and morphological changes, and generates comprehensive reports for researchers.

Conclusion: Organoid Tracker provides an extensible, open-source framework that accelerates kidney development research, PKD modeling, and therapeutic discovery without requiring programming expertise.

Abstract: Recent advances in organoid models have revolutionized the study of human
kidney disease mechanisms and drug discovery by enabling scalable,
cost-effective research without the need for animal sacrifice. Here, we present
a kidney organoid platform optimized for efficient screening in polycystic
kidney disease (PKD). While these systems generate rich spatial-temporal
microscopy video datasets, current manual approaches to analysis remain limited

detailed, quantitative metrics without programming expertise. Built on the
cutting-edge vision foundation model Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), Organoid
Tracker enables zero-shot segmentation and automated analysis of
spatial-temporal microscopy videos. It quantifies key metrics such as cyst
formation rate, growth velocity, and morphological changes, while generating

*Zongwu Xie,Kaijie Yun,Yang Liu,Yiming Ji,Han Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Robust multi-modal framework for planetary rover traversability prediction using camera and LiDAR fusion with self-supervised IMU-derived training labels, showing strong geometric dominance and high robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a reliable traversability costmap prediction system for planetary rovers that can operate in challenging environments by fusing multiple sensor modalities and using self-supervised learning to reduce manual labeling requirements.

Method: Fuses camera and LiDAR data to produce bird's-eye-view terrain costmaps using DINOv3-based image encoder and FiLM-based sensor fusion, trained self-supervised with IMU-derived labels and optimized with Huber and smoothness loss terms.

Result: Highly robust performance with minor changes in MAE/MSE under various ablation tests (e.g., MAE increases from ~0.0775 to 0.0915 when LiDAR is sparsified), indicating geometry dominates learned cost and model is resilient to input variations.

Conclusion: The framework provides a strong multi-modal BEV costmap prediction solution with contributions including high-fidelity simulation environment, self-supervised labeling pipeline, and robust model architecture, though limited by data diversity and requiring future work on domain generalization.

Abstract: We present a robust multi-modal framework for predicting traversability
costmaps for planetary rovers. Our model fuses camera and LiDAR data to produce
a bird's-eye-view (BEV) terrain costmap, trained self-supervised using
IMU-derived labels. Key updates include a DINOv3-based image encoder,
FiLM-based sensor fusion, and an optimization loss combining Huber and
smoothness terms. Experimental ablations (removing image color, occluding
inputs, adding noise) show only minor changes in MAE/MSE (e.g. MAE increases
from ~0.0775 to 0.0915 when LiDAR is sparsified), indicating that geometry
dominates the learned cost and the model is highly robust. We attribute the
small performance differences to the IMU labeling primarily reflecting terrain
geometry rather than semantics and to limited data diversity. Unlike prior work
claiming large gains, we emphasize our contributions: (1) a high-fidelity,
reproducible simulation environment; (2) a self-supervised IMU-based labeling
pipeline; and (3) a strong multi-modal BEV costmap prediction model. We discuss
limitations and future work such as domain generalization and dataset
expansion.

*Chao Chen,Shunyu Yao,Yuanwu He,Tao Feng,Ruojing Song,Yuliang Guo,Xinyu Huang,Chenxu Wu,Ren Liu,Chen Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAA-Policy is an end-to-end imitation learning system that uses Control-Aided Attention to guide visual attention using control signals, improving parking policy stability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing end-to-end parking systems lack effective synergy between perception and control, with transformer-based self-attention producing unstable spatial attention that undermines policy reliability over time.

Method: Proposes CAA-Policy with Control-Aided Attention mechanism trained self-supervised using backpropagated gradients from control outputs. Integrates short-horizon waypoint prediction and a separate motion prediction module for enhanced stability.

Result: Extensive CARLA simulator experiments show CAA-Policy consistently surpasses end-to-end learning baseline and modular BEV segmentation + hybrid A* pipeline, achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

Conclusion: Using control signals to guide visual attention learning leads to more robust and generalizable policies than traditional loss minimization approaches, demonstrating the effectiveness of the CAA mechanism for precise parking tasks.

Abstract: Precise parking requires an end-to-end system where perception adaptively
provides policy-relevant details-especially in critical areas where fine
control decisions are essential. End-to-end learning offers a unified framework
by directly mapping sensor inputs to control actions, but existing approaches
lack effective synergy between perception and control. We find that
transformer-based self-attention, when used alone, tends to produce unstable
and temporally inconsistent spatial attention, which undermines the reliability
of downstream policy decisions over time. Instead, we propose CAA-Policy, an
end-to-end imitation learning system that allows control signal to guide the
learning of visual attention via a novel Control-Aided Attention (CAA)
mechanism. For the first time, we train such an attention module in a
self-supervised manner, using backpropagated gradients from the control outputs
instead of from the training loss. This strategy encourages the attention to
focus on visual features that induce high variance in action outputs, rather
than merely minimizing the training loss-a shift we demonstrate leads to a more
robust and generalizable policy. To further enhance stability, CAA-Policy
integrates short-horizon waypoint prediction as an auxiliary task, and
introduces a separately trained motion prediction module to robustly track the
target spot over time. Extensive experiments in the CARLA simulator show that
\titlevariable~consistently surpasses both the end-to-end learning baseline and
the modular BEV segmentation + hybrid A* pipeline, achieving superior accuracy,
robustness, and interpretability. Code is released at

*Zeyu Dong,Yuyang Yin,Yuqi Li,Eric Li,Hao-Xiang Guo,Yikai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel approach using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently generate high-quality 360° panoramic videos by fine-tuning pretrained video diffusion models, requiring only ~1,000 videos and outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional perspective video generation models struggle with panoramic content due to fundamental projection differences. Existing solutions are complex, inefficient, and produce suboptimal results for 360° panoramic video generation.

Method: Treat panoramic video generation as an adaptation problem from perspective views using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Theoretically analyze that LoRA can model the transformation between projections when rank exceeds task degrees of freedom. Efficiently fine-tune pretrained video diffusion models with only ~1,000 videos.

Result: The method maintains proper projection geometry and surpasses previous state-of-the-art approaches in visual quality, left-right consistency, and motion diversity.

Conclusion: LoRA-based adaptation provides an efficient and effective solution for panoramic video generation, demonstrating that minimal fine-tuning data can achieve superior results compared to complex architectures and large-scale training approaches.

Abstract: Generating high-quality 360{\deg} panoramic videos remains a significant
challenge due to the fundamental differences between panoramic and traditional
perspective-view projections. While perspective videos rely on a single
viewpoint with a limited field of view, panoramic content requires rendering
the full surrounding environment, making it difficult for standard video
generation models to adapt. Existing solutions often introduce complex
architectures or large-scale training, leading to inefficiency and suboptimal
results. Motivated by the success of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in style
transfer tasks, we propose treating panoramic video generation as an adaptation
problem from perspective views. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate
that LoRA can effectively model the transformation between these projections
when its rank exceeds the degrees of freedom in the task. Our approach
efficiently fine-tunes a pretrained video diffusion model using only
approximately 1,000 videos while achieving high-quality panoramic generation.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method maintains proper projection
geometry and surpasses previous state-of-the-art approaches in visual quality,
left-right consistency, and motion diversity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SMILE proposes a super-resolution guided multi-task learning method for hyperspectral unmixing with theoretical guarantees of task affinity and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral unmixing performance is constrained by low spatial resolution, and direct integration of super-resolution with unmixing faces challenges with unverified task affinity and lack of convergence guarantees.

Method: Proposes SMILE framework with theoretical analysis including relationship, existence, and accessibility theorems to validate task affinity and convergence. Learns both shared and specific representations to generalize positive information from super-resolution to unmixing.

Result: Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets substantiate the usefulness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: The work provides progressive theoretical support and a new framework for hyperspectral unmixing under super-resolution guidance, addressing key challenges in multi-task learning integration.

Abstract: The performance of hyperspectral unmixing may be constrained by low spatial
resolution, which can be enhanced using super-resolution in a multitask
learning way. However, integrating super-resolution and unmixing directly may
suffer two challenges: Task affinity is not verified, and the convergence of
unmixing is not guaranteed. To address the above issues, in this paper, we
provide theoretical analysis and propose super-resolution guided multi-task
learning method for hyperspectral unmixing (SMILE). The provided theoretical
analysis validates feasibility of multitask learning way and verifies task
affinity, which consists of relationship and existence theorems by proving the
positive guidance of super-resolution. The proposed framework generalizes
positive information from super-resolution to unmixing by learning both shared
and specific representations. Moreover, to guarantee the convergence, we
provide the accessibility theorem by proving the optimal solution of unmixing.
The major contributions of SMILE include providing progressive theoretical
support, and designing a new framework for unmixing under the guidance of
super-resolution. Our experiments on both synthetic and real datasets have
substantiate the usefulness of our work.

TL;DR: Proposes Cog-TD, a copula-guided temporal dependency method for multitemporal hyperspectral unmixing that models temporal dependency using copula theory to capture dynamical material evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to adequately model temporal dependency in multitemporal hyperspectral unmixing, limiting their ability to capture dynamical material evolution over time.

Method: Develops a mathematical model incorporating copula theory, constructs a copula-guided framework with two key modules (copula function estimation and temporal dependency guidance), and provides theoretical support for validity.

Result: Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of the proposed Cog-TD method.

Conclusion: The paper successfully redefines MTHU with temporal dependency, proposes a novel copula-guided framework, and provides both methodological and theoretical contributions for improved temporal modeling in hyperspectral unmixing.

Abstract: Multitemporal hyperspectral unmixing (MTHU) aims to model variable endmembers
and dynamical abundances, which emphasizes the critical temporal information.
However, existing methods have limitations in modeling temporal dependency,
thus fail to capture the dynamical material evolution. Motivated by the ability
of copula theory in modeling dependency structure explicitly, in this paper, we
propose a copula-guided temporal dependency method (Cog-TD) for multitemporal
hyperspectral unmixing. Cog-TD defines new mathematical model, constructs
copula-guided framework and provides two key modules with theoretical support.
The mathematical model provides explicit formulations for MTHU problem
definition, which describes temporal dependency structure by incorporating
copula theory. The copula-guided framework is constructed for utilizing copula
function, which estimates dynamical endmembers and abundances with temporal
dependency. The key modules consist of copula function estimation and temporal
dependency guidance, which computes and employs temporal information to guide
unmixing process. Moreover, the theoretical support demonstrates that estimated
copula function is valid and the represented temporal dependency exists in
hyperspectral images. The major contributions of this paper include redefining
MTHU problem with temporal dependency, proposing a copula-guided framework,
developing two key modules and providing theoretical support. Our experimental
results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the utility of
the proposed method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DAeroRelief is the first 3D benchmark dataset for post-disaster assessment, featuring dense 3D point clouds from UAV-collected imagery over hurricane-damaged regions with semantic annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D benchmarks focus on urban/indoor scenes and lack disaster contexts, while 2D imagery has limitations like depth absence and occlusions for structural damage assessment.

Method: Dataset collected using low-cost UAVs over hurricane areas, reconstructed via Structure-from-Motion and Multi-View Stereo techniques, with semantic annotations from manual 2D labeling projected into 3D space.

Result: Created a unique 3D dataset capturing large-scale outdoor environments with fine-grained structural damage in real disaster contexts, enabling evaluation of state-of-the-art 3D segmentation models.

Conclusion: 3DAeroRelief serves as a valuable resource for advancing robust 3D vision systems in post-disaster scenarios, highlighting both challenges and opportunities for 3D scene understanding in emergency response.

Abstract: Timely assessment of structural damage is critical for disaster response and
recovery. However, most prior work in natural disaster analysis relies on 2D
imagery, which lacks depth, suffers from occlusions, and provides limited
spatial context. 3D semantic segmentation offers a richer alternative, but
existing 3D benchmarks focus mainly on urban or indoor scenes, with little
attention to disaster-affected areas. To address this gap, we present
3DAeroRelief--the first 3D benchmark dataset specifically designed for
post-disaster assessment. Collected using low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs) over hurricane-damaged regions, the dataset features dense 3D point
clouds reconstructed via Structure-from-Motion and Multi-View Stereo
techniques. Semantic annotations were produced through manual 2D labeling and
projected into 3D space. Unlike existing datasets, 3DAeroRelief captures 3D
large-scale outdoor environments with fine-grained structural damage in
real-world disaster contexts. UAVs enable affordable, flexible, and safe data
collection in hazardous areas, making them particularly well-suited for
emergency scenarios. To demonstrate the utility of 3DAeroRelief, we evaluate
several state-of-the-art 3D segmentation models on the dataset to highlight
both the challenges and opportunities of 3D scene understanding in disaster
response. Our dataset serves as a valuable resource for advancing robust 3D
vision systems in real-world applications for post-disaster scenarios.

*Nhi Kieu,Kien Nguyen,Arnold Wiliem,Clinton Fookes,Sridha Sridharan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes GEMMNet, a generative-enhanced multimodal network for remote sensing semantic segmentation that addresses missing modalities through hybrid feature extraction, multiscale fusion, and complementary loss to outperform existing generative and non-generative methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal signals in real-world scenarios are prone to missing due to sensor failures and adverse weather, which severely degrades model performance. Existing generative approaches inadequately handle the heterogeneity of remote sensing data and suffer from bias towards dominant modalities.

Method: GEMMNet with three key components: 1) Hybrid Feature Extractor (HyFEx) for modality-specific representations, 2) Hybrid Fusion with Multiscale Awareness (HyFMA) for cross-scale semantic context, and 3) Complementary Loss (CoLoss) to reduce bias and encourage modality-task consistency.

Result: Outperforms generative baselines (AE, cGAN) and state-of-the-art non-generative approaches (mmformer, shaspec) on Vaihingen and Potsdam remote sensing semantic segmentation datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed GEMMNet effectively addresses missing modality challenges in remote sensing through generative enhancement, achieving superior performance while mitigating bias and improving robustness in complex scenes.

Abstract: Multimodal learning has shown significant performance boost compared to
ordinary unimodal models across various domains. However, in real-world
scenarios, multimodal signals are susceptible to missing because of sensor
failures and adverse weather conditions, which drastically deteriorates models'
operation and performance. Generative models such as AutoEncoder (AE) and
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) are intuitive solutions aiming to
reconstruct missing modality from available ones. Yet, their efficacy in remote
sensing semantic segmentation remains underexplored. In this paper, we first
examine the limitations of existing generative approaches in handling the
heterogeneity of multimodal remote sensing data. They inadequately capture
semantic context in complex scenes with large intra-class and small inter-class
variation. In addition, traditional generative models are susceptible to heavy
dependence on the dominant modality, introducing bias that affects model
robustness under missing modality conditions. To tackle these limitations, we
propose a novel Generative-Enhanced MultiModal learning Network (GEMMNet) with
three key components: (1) Hybrid Feature Extractor (HyFEx) to effectively learn
modality-specific representations, (2) Hybrid Fusion with Multiscale Awareness
(HyFMA) to capture modality-synergistic semantic context across scales and (3)
Complementary Loss (CoLoss) scheme to alleviate the inherent bias by
encouraging consistency across modalities and tasks. Our method, GEMMNet,
outperforms both generative baselines AE, cGAN (conditional GAN), and
state-of-the-art non-generative approaches - mmformer and shaspec - on two
challenging semantic segmentation remote sensing datasets (Vaihingen and
Potsdam). Source code is made available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fluid reconstruction methods rely on controlled lab environments, leaving real-world videos largely unexplored despite recent advances in 3D vision and fluid dynamics rendering.

Method: Targeted techniques for smoke extraction with background removal, initialization of smoke particles and camera poses, and inferring multi-view videos to address three key challenges of reconstructing smoke in real-world videos.

Result: Outperforms previous reconstruction and generation methods with high-quality smoke reconstructions (+2.22 average PSNR on wild videos) and enables diverse, realistic editing of fluid dynamics through simulation.

Conclusion: The method successfully bridges the gap between controlled lab environments and real-world video capture for smoke reconstruction, providing high-quality 4D smoke assets that support interactive design and editing applications.

Abstract: We propose a pipeline to extract and reconstruct dynamic 3D smoke assets from
a single in-the-wild video, and further integrate interactive simulation for
smoke design and editing. Recent developments in 3D vision have significantly
improved reconstructing and rendering fluid dynamics, supporting realistic and
temporally consistent view synthesis. However, current fluid reconstructions
rely heavily on carefully controlled clean lab environments, whereas real-world
videos captured in the wild are largely underexplored. We pinpoint three key
challenges of reconstructing smoke in real-world videos and design targeted
techniques, including smoke extraction with background removal, initialization
of smoke particles and camera poses, and inferring multi-view videos. Our
method not only outperforms previous reconstruction and generation methods with
high-quality smoke reconstructions (+2.22 average PSNR on wild videos), but
also enables diverse and realistic editing of fluid dynamics by simulating our

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SVR-GS introduces spatially variant regularization for 3D Gaussian Splatting, reducing Gaussian count by 1.79-5.63x with minimal PSNR drop, enabling smaller and faster models for real-time applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mask-based pruning methods like MaskGS use global mean regularization that doesn't align with per-pixel reconstruction loss, leading to suboptimal sparsity where it matters most for image quality.

Method: Proposes SVR-GS with per-pixel spatial masks that render each Gaussian's effective contribution along camera rays, applying sparsity pressure specifically on low-importance Gaussians. Implements three spatial-mask aggregation strategies in CUDA with gradient analysis.

Result: Achieves 1.79x reduction in Gaussians vs MaskGS and 5.63x vs 3DGS, with only 0.50 dB and 0.40 dB PSNR drops respectively across Tanks&Temples, Deep Blending, and Mip-NeRF360 datasets.

Conclusion: SVR-GS enables significantly smaller, faster, and more memory-efficient 3DGS models suitable for real-time applications in robotics, AR/VR, and mobile perception through better-aligned sparsity regularization.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables fast, high-quality novel view synthesis
but typically relies on densification followed by pruning to optimize the
number of Gaussians. Existing mask-based pruning, such as MaskGS, regularizes
the global mean of the mask, which is misaligned with the local per-pixel
(per-ray) reconstruction loss that determines image quality along individual
camera rays. This paper introduces SVR-GS, a spatially variant regularizer that
renders a per-pixel spatial mask from each Gaussian's effective contribution
along the ray, thereby applying sparsity pressure where it matters: on
low-importance Gaussians. We explore three spatial-mask aggregation strategies,
implement them in CUDA, and conduct a gradient analysis to motivate our final
design. Extensive experiments on Tanks\&Temples, Deep Blending, and Mip-NeRF360
datasets demonstrate that, on average across the three datasets, the proposed
SVR-GS reduces the number of Gaussians by 1.79\(\times\) compared to MaskGS and
5.63\(\times\) compared to 3DGS, while incurring only 0.50 dB and 0.40 dB PSNR
drops, respectively. These gains translate into significantly smaller, faster,
and more memory-efficient models, making them well-suited for real-time
applications such as robotics, AR/VR, and mobile perception.

TL;DR: A lightweight learning framework that predicts 3D volume and surface area of coral-like objects from 2D multi-view RGB images using pre-trained feature extraction and dual DGCNN decoders with uncertainty estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective reef monitoring requires accurate coral growth quantification through volumetric and surface area measurements, but coral's complex morphology makes this challenging from traditional 2D images.

Method: Uses pre-trained VGGT to extract dense point maps from multiple views, merges them into unified point clouds with confidence scores, then processes through parallel DGCNN decoder heads to jointly predict volume and surface area with uncertainty estimates using Gaussian negative log-likelihood loss.

Result: Achieves competitive accuracy and generalizes well to unseen coral morphologies, enabling efficient coral geometry estimation directly from sparse image sets.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable solution for coral growth analysis and reef monitoring by enabling accurate 3D geometry prediction from 2D images with built-in uncertainty estimation.

Abstract: Effective reef monitoring requires the quantification of coral growth via
accurate volumetric and surface area estimates, which is a challenging task due
to the complex morphology of corals. We propose a novel, lightweight, and
scalable learning framework that addresses this challenge by predicting the 3D
volume and surface area of coral-like objects from 2D multi-view RGB images.
Our approach utilizes a pre-trained module (VGGT) to extract dense point maps
from each view; these maps are merged into a unified point cloud and enriched
with per-view confidence scores. The resulting cloud is fed to two parallel
DGCNN decoder heads, which jointly output the volume and the surface area of
the coral, as well as their corresponding confidence estimate. To enhance
prediction stability and provide uncertainty estimates, we introduce a
composite loss function based on Gaussian negative log-likelihood in both real
and log domains. Our method achieves competitive accuracy and generalizes well
to unseen morphologies. This framework paves the way for efficient and scalable
coral geometry estimation directly from a sparse set of images, with potential
applications in coral growth analysis and reef monitoring.

Motivation: Existing traffic video understanding approaches struggle with accurately modeling spatiotemporal causality and integrating domain-specific knowledge, limiting effectiveness in complex traffic scenarios.

Method: Built on Qwen2.5-VL backbone with LoRA fine-tuning on traffic-specific multimodal datasets. Introduces knowledge prompting module combining Chain-of-Thought reasoning with Retrieval-Augmented Generation for precise injection of traffic regulations and domain knowledge.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on TrafficQA and DriveQA benchmarks, demonstrating superior multimodal traffic data processing, zero-shot reasoning, and cross-scenario generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: Traffic-MLLM effectively addresses spatiotemporal causality modeling and domain knowledge integration challenges in traffic video analysis, showing strong performance and generalization across complex traffic scenarios.

Abstract: As intelligent transportation systems advance, traffic video understanding
plays an increasingly pivotal role in comprehensive scene perception and causal
analysis. Yet, existing approaches face notable challenges in accurately
modeling spatiotemporal causality and integrating domain-specific knowledge,
limiting their effectiveness in complex scenarios. To address these
limitations, we propose Traffic-MLLM, a multimodal large language model
tailored for fine-grained traffic analysis. Built on the Qwen2.5-VL backbone,
our model leverages high-quality traffic-specific multimodal datasets and uses
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for lightweight fine-tuning, significantly enhancing
its capacity to model continuous spatiotemporal features in video sequences.
Furthermore, we introduce an innovative knowledge prompting module fusing
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
enabling precise injection of detailed traffic regulations and domain knowledge
into the inference process. This design markedly boosts the model's logical
reasoning and knowledge adaptation capabilities. Experimental results on
TrafficQA and DriveQA benchmarks show Traffic-MLLM achieves state-of-the-art
performance, validating its superior ability to process multimodal traffic
data. It also exhibits remarkable zero-shot reasoning and cross-scenario
generalization capabilities.

*Hong Zhang,Fei Guo,Zihan Xie,Dizhao Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multispectral-NeRF extends NeRF to handle 6-band spectral data for improved 3D reconstruction, addressing limitations of traditional RGB-only methods and existing multispectral approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D reconstruction relies on RGB data only, while existing multispectral methods suffer from high costs, low accuracy, and poor geometric features. Current NeRF models cannot handle multi-band information beyond three bands.

Method: Enhanced neural architecture derived from NeRF with three modifications: expanded hidden layers for 6-band inputs, redesigned residual functions for spectral discrepancy optimization, and adapted data compression modules for higher bit-depth multispectral imagery.

Result: Experimental results confirm successful processing of multi-band spectral features while accurately preserving original scenes' spectral characteristics.

Conclusion: Multispectral-NeRF effectively addresses the limitations of current multispectral 3D reconstruction methods by integrating expanded spectral data into the NeRF framework, producing high-precision reconstruction results.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction technology generates three-dimensional representations of
real-world objects, scenes, or environments using sensor data such as 2D
images, with extensive applications in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and
virtual reality systems. Traditional 3D reconstruction techniques based on 2D
images typically relies on RGB spectral information. With advances in sensor
technology, additional spectral bands beyond RGB have been increasingly
incorporated into 3D reconstruction workflows. Existing methods that integrate
these expanded spectral data often suffer from expensive scheme prices, low
accuracy and poor geometric features. Three - dimensional reconstruction based
on NeRF can effectively address the various issues in current multispectral 3D
reconstruction methods, producing high - precision and high - quality
reconstruction results. However, currently, NeRF and some improved models such
as NeRFacto are trained on three - band data and cannot take into account the
multi - band information. To address this problem, we propose
Multispectral-NeRF, an enhanced neural architecture derived from NeRF that can
effectively integrates multispectral information. Our technical contributions
comprise threefold modifications: Expanding hidden layer dimensionality to
accommodate 6-band spectral inputs; Redesigning residual functions to optimize
spectral discrepancy calculations between reconstructed and reference images;
Adapting data compression modules to address the increased bit-depth
requirements of multispectral imagery. Experimental results confirm that
Multispectral-NeRF successfully processes multi-band spectral features while
accurately preserving the original scenes' spectral characteristics.

*Zhiwen Yang,Yuxin Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPHERE integrates voxel and Gaussian representations for camera-based 3D semantic scene completion, combining semantic guidance with physical awareness to achieve realistic geometric details in autonomous driving scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing voxel-based and plane-based SSC methods struggle with realistic geometric details, while neural reconstruction methods like NeRF and 3DGS have high computational costs and poor semantic accuracy in large-scale autonomous driving scenes.

Method: Uses Semantic-guided Gaussian Initialization (SGI) with dual-branch 3D scene representations to locate focal voxels as anchors for efficient Gaussian initialization, and Physical-aware Harmonics Enhancement (PHE) with semantic spherical harmonics to model physical-aware contextual details through focal distribution alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks validate the effectiveness of SPHERE in generating SSC results with realistic details.

Conclusion: SPHERE successfully integrates semantic and physical information through voxel-Gaussian representation fusion, achieving superior performance in camera-based 3D semantic scene completion for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Camera-based 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is a critical task in
autonomous driving systems, assessing voxel-level geometry and semantics for
holistic scene perception. While existing voxel-based and plane-based SSC
methods have achieved considerable progress, they struggle to capture physical
regularities for realistic geometric details. On the other hand, neural
reconstruction methods like NeRF and 3DGS demonstrate superior physical
awareness, but suffer from high computational cost and slow convergence when
handling large-scale, complex autonomous driving scenes, leading to inferior
semantic accuracy. To address these issues, we propose the Semantic-PHysical
Engaged REpresentation (SPHERE) for camera-based SSC, which integrates voxel
and Gaussian representations for joint exploitation of semantic and physical
information. First, the Semantic-guided Gaussian Initialization (SGI) module
leverages dual-branch 3D scene representations to locate focal voxels as
anchors to guide efficient Gaussian initialization. Then, the Physical-aware
Harmonics Enhancement (PHE) module incorporates semantic spherical harmonics to
model physical-aware contextual details and promote semantic-geometry
consistency through focal distribution alignment, generating SSC results with
realistic details. Extensive experiments and analyses on the popular
SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks validate the effectiveness of
SPHERE. The code is available at

*Chengde Lin,Xuezhu Gong,Shuxue Ding,Mingzhe Yang,Xijun Lu,Chengjun Mo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StegOT is an autoencoder-based image steganography model that uses optimal transport theory to address mode collapse issues in GAN/VAE-based methods, achieving better information balance between cover and secret images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing steganography models based on GANs and VAEs suffer from mode collapse, which causes information imbalance between cover and secret images in the stego image and negatively impacts extraction quality.

Method: Proposes StegOT with a multiple channel optimal transport (MCOT) module that transforms multi-peak feature distributions into single-peak distributions to achieve information trade-off between cover and secret images.

Result: Experiments show the model achieves better trade-off between cover and secret images while enhancing quality of both stego and recovery images.

Conclusion: StegOT effectively addresses mode collapse in steganography through optimal transport theory, improving information balance and image quality in both hiding and extraction processes.

Abstract: Image hiding is often referred to as steganography, which aims to hide a
secret image in a cover image of the same resolution. Many steganography models
are based on genera-tive adversarial networks (GANs) and variational
autoencoders (VAEs). However, most existing models suffer from mode collapse.
Mode collapse will lead to an information imbalance between the cover and
secret images in the stego image and further affect the subsequent extraction.
To address these challenges, this paper proposes StegOT, an autoencoder-based
steganography model incorporating optimal transport theory. We designed the
multiple channel optimal transport (MCOT) module to transform the feature
distribution, which exhibits multiple peaks, into a single peak to achieve the
trade-off of information. Experiments demonstrate that we not only achieve a
trade-off between the cover and secret images but also enhance the quality of
both the stego and recovery images. The source code will be released on

*Partha Shah,Durva Sankhe,Maariyah Rashid,Zakaa Khaled,Esther Puyol-Antón,Tiarna Lee,Maram Alqarni,Sweta Rai,Andrew P. King*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Study shows FST scale granularity affects AI skin lesion classification performance and bias, with 3-group models outperforming general models and reduced granularity harming performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI skin lesion classification models show bias susceptibility to skin tone, and the Fitzpatrick Skin Tone (FST) scale has been criticized for uneven granularity favoring lighter skin tones.

Method: Trained multiple AI models to classify benign vs. malignant lesions using FST-specific data with different granularity levels (3 groups: FST 1/2, 3/4, 5/6 vs. reduced granularity approaches).

Result: Models trained on FST-specific data with 3 groups performed better than general models trained on FST-balanced data. Reducing FST scale granularity had detrimental effects on performance.

Conclusion: FST scale granularity significantly impacts AI model performance, suggesting a need to move away from FST scale to alternative scales that better represent skin tone diversity in fair AI research.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) models to automatically classify skin lesions
from dermatology images have shown promising performance but also
susceptibility to bias by skin tone. The most common way of representing skin
tone information is the Fitzpatrick Skin Tone (FST) scale. The FST scale has
been criticised for having greater granularity in its skin tone categories for
lighter-skinned subjects. This paper conducts an investigation of the impact
(on performance and bias) on AI classification models of granularity in the FST
scale. By training multiple AI models to classify benign vs. malignant lesions
using FST-specific data of differing granularity, we show that: (i) when
training models using FST-specific data based on three groups (FST 1/2, 3/4 and
5/6), performance is generally better for models trained on FST-specific data
compared to a general model trained on FST-balanced data; (ii) reducing the
granularity of FST scale information (from 1/2 and 3/4 to 1/2/3/4) can have a
detrimental effect on performance. Our results highlight the importance of the
granularity of FST groups when training lesion classification models. Given the
question marks over possible human biases in the choice of categories in the
FST scale, this paper provides evidence for a move away from the FST scale in
fair AI research and a transition to an alternative scale that better
represents the diversity of human skin tones.

*Yihang She,Andrew Blake,David Coomes,Srinivasan Keshav*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Synthetic forest data generation pipeline using game engines and LiDAR simulation reduces need for real labeled data in tree segmentation, achieving competitive results with minimal real data fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D forest datasets are too small for robust tree segmentation systems, and real data collection/annotation is expensive. Synthetic data has shown success in other domains like self-driving.

Method: Developed synthetic data generation pipeline integrating game engines with physics-based LiDAR simulation to create large-scale annotated 3D forest dataset. Used synthetic data for pretraining and minimal real forest plot annotation for fine-tuning.

Result: After fine-tuning on just a single real forest plot (<0.1 hectare), the pretrained model achieves segmentations competitive with models trained on full-scale real data. Critical success factors identified: physics, diversity, and scale.

Conclusion: Synthetic data can substantially reduce the need for labeled real data in tree segmentation, paving the way for more robust 3D forest vision systems. The pipeline and dataset are publicly available.

Abstract: Accurate tree segmentation is a key step in extracting individual tree
metrics from forest laser scans, and is essential to understanding ecosystem
functions in carbon cycling and beyond. Over the past decade, tree segmentation
algorithms have advanced rapidly due to developments in AI. However existing,
public, 3D forest datasets are not large enough to build robust tree
segmentation systems. Motivated by the success of synthetic data in other
domains such as self-driving, we investigate whether similar approaches can
help with tree segmentation. In place of expensive field data collection and
annotation, we use synthetic data during pretraining, and then require only
minimal, real forest plot annotation for fine-tuning.
  We have developed a new synthetic data generation pipeline to do this for
forest vision tasks, integrating advances in game-engines with physics-based
LiDAR simulation. As a result, we have produced a comprehensive, diverse,
annotated 3D forest dataset on an unprecedented scale. Extensive experiments
with a state-of-the-art tree segmentation algorithm and a popular real dataset
show that our synthetic data can substantially reduce the need for labelled
real data. After fine-tuning on just a single, real, forest plot of less than
0.1 hectare, the pretrained model achieves segmentations that are competitive
with a model trained on the full scale real data. We have also identified
critical factors for successful use of synthetic data: physics, diversity, and
scale, paving the way for more robust 3D forest vision systems in the future.

Motivation: Existing concept sliders struggle with no-AIGC images and real-world captured images, creating a need for better realism and customization in image generation.

Method: Integrates GANs and diffusion models with fine-grained textual and visual guidance in an adversarial manner to refine images.

Result: Shows marked enhancement in image quality and realism, with extensive experimental validation confirming robustness and versatility across applications.

Conclusion: Beyond Sliders successfully bridges the gap in image manipulation for diverse categories, particularly excelling with real-world images where previous methods faltered.

Abstract: In the realm of image generation, the quest for realism and customization has
never been more pressing. While existing methods like concept sliders have made
strides, they often falter when it comes to no-AIGC images, particularly images
captured in real world settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce Beyond
Sliders, an innovative framework that integrates GANs and diffusion models to
facilitate sophisticated image manipulation across diverse image categories.
Improved upon concept sliders, our method refines the image through fine
grained guidance both textual and visual in an adversarial manner, leading to a
marked enhancement in image quality and realism. Extensive experimental
validation confirms the robustness and versatility of Beyond Sliders across a
spectrum of applications.

TL;DR: Probabilistic component-wise Spatial Transformer Network for fine-grained visual classification that decomposes affine transformations into rotation, scaling, and shearing components with Gaussian variational posteriors to handle geometric variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained visual classification is highly sensitive to geometric variability (orientations, scales, perspective distortions). Existing equivariant architectures require substantial computational resources and restrict the hypothesis space, while Spatial Transformer Networks offer flexibility but need improved robustness.

Method: Proposed probabilistic component-wise STN extension that decomposes affine transformations into rotation, scaling, and shearing components. Uses shared localization encoder with geometric constraints, models each component with Gaussian variational posterior, and employs sampling-based canonicalization during inference. Includes novel component-wise alignment loss using augmentation parameters.

Result: Experiments on challenging moth classification benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvement in robustness compared to other STN methods.

Conclusion: The proposed probabilistic component-wise STN approach effectively handles geometric variability in fine-grained visual classification while maintaining flexibility and improving robustness over existing methods.

Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) remains highly sensitive to
geometric variability, where objects appear under arbitrary orientations,
scales, and perspective distortions. While equivariant architectures address
this issue, they typically require substantial computational resources and
restrict the hypothesis space. We revisit Spatial Transformer Networks (STNs)
as a canonicalization tool for transformer-based vision pipelines, emphasizing
their flexibility, backbone-agnostic nature, and lack of architectural
constraints. We propose a probabilistic, component-wise extension that improves
robustness. Specifically, we decompose affine transformations into rotation,
scaling, and shearing, and regress each component under geometric constraints
using a shared localization encoder. To capture uncertainty, we model each
component with a Gaussian variational posterior and perform sampling-based
canonicalization during inference.A novel component-wise alignment loss
leverages augmentation parameters to guide spatial alignment. Experiments on
challenging moth classification benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently improves robustness compared to other STNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RFID ear tags are unreliable due to loss, damage, tampering, and security vulnerabilities. Biometric identification using cattle muzzle patterns offers a more robust alternative, but deep learning approaches face data limitations and require frequent retraining.

Method: Novel few-shot learning framework combining Cooperative Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (CCoMAML) with Multi-Head Attention Feature Fusion (MHAFF) as feature extractor. Enables efficient learning from few samples without retraining.

Result: Achieved superior performance with 98.46% and 97.91% F1 scores, outperforming current state-of-the-art few-shot learning techniques in cattle identification.

Conclusion: The proposed CCoMAML with MHAFF framework provides an effective solution for real-time cattle identification that adapts well to new data with minimal samples, addressing key limitations of traditional RFID and deep learning approaches.

Abstract: Cattle identification is critical for efficient livestock farming management,
currently reliant on radio-frequency identification (RFID) ear tags. However,
RFID-based systems are prone to failure due to loss, damage, tampering, and
vulnerability to external attacks. As a robust alternative, biometric
identification using cattle muzzle patterns similar to human fingerprints has
emerged as a promising solution. Deep learning techniques have demonstrated
success in leveraging these unique patterns for accurate identification. But
deep learning models face significant challenges, including limited data
availability, disruptions during data collection, and dynamic herd compositions
that require frequent model retraining. To address these limitations, this
paper proposes a novel few-shot learning framework for real-time cattle
identification using Cooperative Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (CCoMAML) with
Multi-Head Attention Feature Fusion (MHAFF) as a feature extractor model. This
model offers great model adaptability to new data through efficient learning
from few data samples without retraining. The proposed approach has been
rigorously evaluated against current state-of-the-art few-shot learning
techniques applied in cattle identification. Comprehensive experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed CCoMAML with MHAFF has superior cattle
identification performance with 98.46% and 97.91% F1 scores.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ANROT-HELANet is a novel robust few-shot learning network that uses Hellinger distance-based aggregation and a new contrastive loss function to achieve state-of-the-art performance while being resilient to adversarial attacks and natural noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Bayesian-based few-shot learning methods using KL divergence are vulnerable to adversarial attacks and natural noises, creating a need for more robust approaches that can maintain performance under various perturbations.

Method: The approach implements an adversarially and naturally robust Hellinger distance-based feature class aggregation scheme with attention mechanisms and a novel Hellinger Similarity contrastive loss function that generalizes cosine similarity contrastive loss.

Result: Achieves resilience to adversarial perturbations up to ε=0.30 and Gaussian noise up to σ=0.30, with improvements of 1.20% and 1.40% for 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios on miniImageNet, and superior image reconstruction quality with FID score of 2.75.

Conclusion: ANROT-HELANet establishes new state-of-the-art performance in few-shot learning while maintaining robustness against both adversarial and natural perturbations through its Hellinger distance-based approach and novel loss function.

Abstract: Few-Shot Learning (FSL), which involves learning to generalize using only a
few data samples, has demonstrated promising and superior performances to
ordinary CNN methods. While Bayesian based estimation approaches using
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence have shown improvements, they remain
vulnerable to adversarial attacks and natural noises. We introduce
ANROT-HELANet, an Adversarially and Naturally RObusT Hellinger Aggregation
Network that significantly advances the state-of-the-art in FSL robustness and
performance. Our approach implements an adversarially and naturally robust
Hellinger distance-based feature class aggregation scheme, demonstrating
resilience to adversarial perturbations up to $\epsilon=0.30$ and Gaussian
noise up to $\sigma=0.30$. The network achieves substantial improvements across
benchmark datasets, including gains of 1.20\% and 1.40\% for 1-shot and 5-shot
scenarios on miniImageNet respectively. We introduce a novel Hellinger
Similarity contrastive loss function that generalizes cosine similarity
contrastive loss for variational few-shot inference scenarios. Our approach
also achieves superior image reconstruction quality with a FID score of 2.75,
outperforming traditional VAE (3.43) and WAE (3.38) approaches. Extensive
experiments conducted on four few-shot benchmarked datasets verify that
ANROT-HELANet's combination of Hellinger distance-based feature aggregation,
attention mechanisms, and our novel loss function establishes new

TL;DR: MIS-LSTM is a hybrid CNN-LSTM framework for sleep quality and stress prediction using multimodal lifelog data, achieving 0.647 Macro-F1 score with uncertainty-aware ensemble.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an effective framework for predicting sleep quality and stress from multimodal lifelog data by capturing both spatial patterns and long-term temporal dependencies.

Method: Uses CNN encoders for continuous sensor streams (rendered as multi-channel images) and discrete events (1D-CNN), fused with attention module, then aggregated by LSTM with uncertainty-aware ensemble (UALRE).

Result: Achieves Macro-F1 score of 0.615 for base model and 0.647 with UALRE ensemble, outperforming LSTM, 1D-CNN, and CNN baselines on ETRI Lifelog Challenge dataset.

Conclusion: The hybrid CNN-LSTM approach with multi-channel imaging, 4-hour blocks, modality-specific encoding, and uncertainty-aware ensemble effectively predicts sleep quality and stress from multimodal data.

Abstract: This paper presents MIS-LSTM, a hybrid framework that joins CNN encoders with
an LSTM sequence model for sleep quality and stress prediction at the day level
from multimodal lifelog data. Continuous sensor streams are first partitioned
into N-hour blocks and rendered as multi-channel images, while sparse discrete
events are encoded with a dedicated 1D-CNN. A Convolutional Block Attention
Module fuses the two modalities into refined block embeddings, which an LSTM
then aggregates to capture long-range temporal dependencies. To further boost
robustness, we introduce UALRE, an uncertainty-aware ensemble that overrides
lowconfidence majority votes with high-confidence individual predictions.
Experiments on the 2025 ETRI Lifelog Challenge dataset show that Our base
MISLSTM achieves Macro-F1 0.615; with the UALRE ensemble, the score improves to
0.647, outperforming strong LSTM, 1D-CNN, and CNN baselines. Ablations confirm
(i) the superiority of multi-channel over stacked-vertical imaging, (ii) the
benefit of a 4-hour block granularity, and (iii) the efficacy of

TL;DR: A novel CLIP-based framework called CMLReID that addresses both same-cloth and clothing-change person re-identification in continual learning settings, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world surveillance systems need person re-identification models that can handle clothing changes while maintaining continual learning capabilities, but existing methods either focus on same-cloth settings or treat clothing-change re-ID as a separate problem.

Method: CMLReID framework with two novel components: Context-Aware Semantic Prompt (CASP) for adaptive prompts and multi-grained visual-text alignment, and Adaptive Knowledge Fusion and Projection (AKFP) with dual-path learner and Clothing-State-Aware Projection Loss for robust prototypes.

Result: Experiments show CMLReID outperforms all state-of-the-art methods with strong robustness and generalization despite clothing variations and sequential learning challenges.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the hybrid continual learning problem for person re-identification with clothing changes, demonstrating superior performance and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Person Re-Identification (ReID) has several challenges in real-world
surveillance systems due to clothing changes (CCReID) and the need for
maintaining continual learning (LReID). Previous existing methods either
develop models specifically for one application, which is mostly a same-cloth
(SC) setting or treat CCReID as its own separate sub-problem. In this work, we
will introduce the LReID-Hybrid task with the goal of developing a model to
achieve both SC and CC while learning in a continual setting. Mismatched
representations and forgetting from one task to the next are significant
issues, we address this with CMLReID, a CLIP-based framework composed of two
novel tasks: (1) Context-Aware Semantic Prompt (CASP) that generates adaptive
prompts, and also incorporates context to align richly multi-grained visual
cues with semantic text space; and (2) Adaptive Knowledge Fusion and Projection
(AKFP) which produces robust SC/CC prototypes through the use of a dual-path
learner that aligns features with our Clothing-State-Aware Projection Loss.
Experiments performed on a wide range of datasets and illustrate that CMLReID
outperforms all state-of-the-art methods with strong robustness and
generalization despite clothing variations and a sophisticated process of
sequential learning.

### [52] [Cross-Domain Attribute Alignment with CLIP: A Rehearsal-Free Approach for Class-Incremental Unsupervised Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11264)
*Kerun Mi,Guoliang Kang,Guangyu Li,Lin Zhao,Tao Zhou,Chen Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel rehearsal-free approach for Class-Incremental Unsupervised Domain Adaptation that uses CLIP to extract domain-invariant class-agnostic attributes, represented as key-value pairs, and performs cross-domain alignment to mitigate domain shift while reducing catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CI-UDA methods require storing rehearsal samples and perform asymmetric alignment, leading to increasing memory usage and knowledge forgetting. The paper aims to address these limitations by mining domain-invariant knowledge.

Method: Uses CLIP to extract class-agnostic attributes as key-value pairs (visual prototype + textual prompt). Maintains two attribute dictionaries (source and target domains) and performs attribute alignment via visual attention consistency and prediction consistency.

Result: Outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on three CI-UDA benchmarks and effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting without requiring rehearsal samples.

Conclusion: The proposed attribute-based approach successfully mitigates domain shift while reducing catastrophic knowledge forgetting in a rehearsal-free manner, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (CI-UDA) aims to adapt a
model from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, where the
sets of potential target classes appearing at different time steps are disjoint
and are subsets of the source classes. The key to solving this problem lies in
avoiding catastrophic forgetting of knowledge about previous target classes
during continuously mitigating the domain shift. Most previous works
cumbersomely combine two technical components. On one hand, they need to store
and utilize rehearsal target sample from previous time steps to avoid
catastrophic forgetting; on the other hand, they perform alignment only between
classes shared across domains at each time step. Consequently, the memory will
continuously increase and the asymmetric alignment may inevitably result in
knowledge forgetting. In this paper, we propose to mine and preserve
domain-invariant and class-agnostic knowledge to facilitate the CI-UDA task.
Specifically, via using CLIP, we extract the class-agnostic properties which we
name as "attribute". In our framework, we learn a "key-value" pair to represent
an attribute, where the key corresponds to the visual prototype and the value
is the textual prompt. We maintain two attribute dictionaries, each
corresponding to a different domain. Then we perform attribute alignment across
domains to mitigate the domain shift, via encouraging visual attention
consistency and prediction consistency. Through attribute modeling and
cross-domain alignment, we effectively reduce catastrophic knowledge forgetting
while mitigating the domain shift, in a rehearsal-free way. Experiments on
three CI-UDA benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods and effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting.

### [53] [Synthetic Dataset Evaluation Based on Generalized Cross Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11273)
*Zhihang Song,Dingyi Yao,Ruibo Ming,Lihui Peng,Danya Yao,Yi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel evaluation framework with two key metrics to assess synthetic dataset quality through cross-validation and domain transfer learning principles


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation studies for synthetic datasets lack universally accepted standards, limiting robust quality assessment and optimization guidance

Method: Integrates generalized cross-validation experiments and domain transfer learning, training task-specific models on synthetic and real datasets to form cross-performance matrices and quantify domain transferability

Result: Experimental validation on Virtual KITTI demonstrates effectiveness in assessing synthetic data fidelity with scalable and quantifiable metrics

Conclusion: Provides a principled, scalable evaluation solution that overcomes traditional limitations and guides synthetic dataset optimization in AI research

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of synthetic dataset generation techniques,
evaluating the quality of synthetic data has become a critical research focus.
Robust evaluation not only drives innovations in data generation methods but
also guides researchers in optimizing the utilization of these synthetic
resources. However, current evaluation studies for synthetic datasets remain
limited, lacking a universally accepted standard framework. To address this,
this paper proposes a novel evaluation framework integrating generalized
cross-validation experiments and domain transfer learning principles, enabling
generalizable and comparable assessments of synthetic dataset quality. The
framework involves training task-specific models (e.g., YOLOv5s) on both
synthetic datasets and multiple real-world benchmarks (e.g., KITTI, BDD100K),
forming a cross-performance matrix. Following normalization, a Generalized
Cross-Validation (GCV) Matrix is constructed to quantify domain
transferability. The framework introduces two key metrics. One measures the
simulation quality by quantifying the similarity between synthetic data and
real-world datasets, while another evaluates the transfer quality by assessing
the diversity and coverage of synthetic data across various real-world
scenarios. Experimental validation on Virtual KITTI demonstrates the
effectiveness of our proposed framework and metrics in assessing synthetic data
fidelity. This scalable and quantifiable evaluation solution overcomes
traditional limitations, providing a principled approach to guide synthetic
dataset optimization in artificial intelligence research.

### [54] [ROSGS: Relightable Outdoor Scenes With Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11275)
*Lianjun Liao,Chunhui Zhang,Tong Wu,Henglei Lv,Bailin Deng,Lin Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ROSGS is a two-stage pipeline that efficiently reconstructs relightable outdoor scenes using Gaussian Splatting representation, combining 2DGS for geometry reconstruction and a hybrid lighting model for accurate texture and lighting decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Outdoor scenes present challenges with unbounded environments and varying lighting conditions. Existing NeRF and 3DGS approaches suffer from high computational overhead and low-frequency lighting representations that lead to inefficient rendering and poor relighting accuracy.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) Uses monocular normal priors with 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) for efficient geometry reconstruction, 2) Employs hybrid lighting model with spherical Gaussian function for high-frequency sunlight and Spherical Harmonic coefficients for low-frequency skylight modeling via radiance transfer function.

Result: ROSGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in relighting outdoor scenes, demonstrating superior relighting accuracy and rendering efficiency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed ROSGS framework effectively addresses the limitations of current outdoor scene reconstruction methods by combining efficient geometry representation with a comprehensive hybrid lighting model, resulting in both accurate relighting and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Image data captured outdoors often exhibit unbounded scenes and
unconstrained, varying lighting conditions, making it challenging to decompose
them into geometry, reflectance, and illumination. Recent works have focused on
achieving this decomposition using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or the 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation but remain hindered by two key
limitations: the high computational overhead associated with neural networks of
NeRF and the use of low-frequency lighting representations, which often result
in inefficient rendering and suboptimal relighting accuracy. We propose ROSGS,
a two-stage pipeline designed to efficiently reconstruct relightable outdoor
scenes using the Gaussian Splatting representation. By leveraging monocular
normal priors, ROSGS first reconstructs the scene's geometry with the compact
2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) representation, providing an efficient and
accurate geometric foundation. Building upon this reconstructed geometry, ROSGS
then decomposes the scene's texture and lighting through a hybrid lighting
model. This model effectively represents typical outdoor lighting by employing
a spherical Gaussian function to capture the directional, high-frequency
components of sunlight, while learning a radiance transfer function via
Spherical Harmonic coefficients to model the remaining low-frequency skylight
comprehensively. Both quantitative metrics and qualitative comparisons
demonstrate that ROSGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in relighting
outdoor scenes and highlight its ability to deliver superior relighting
accuracy and rendering efficiency.

### [55] [Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models by Self-Injecting Hallucinations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11287)
*Yifan Lu,Ziqi Zhang,Chunfeng Yuan,Jun Gao,Congxuan Zhang,Xiaojuan Qi,Bing Li,Weiming Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APASI is a novel method that autonomously mitigates hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models by self-injecting realistic hallucination patterns without external human annotations or auxiliary models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hallucination mitigation methods require external human annotations or auxiliary models for preference data collection, which increases costs and limits sustainable improvement.

Method: APASI leverages the target LVLM to self-inject hallucinations into generated responses, creating preference pairs based on three key observations of hallucinations. It uses iterative alignment training with curriculum learning to periodically update preference data with increasing challenge.

Result: Extensive experiments across six benchmarks show APASI effectively mitigates hallucinations for three baseline models and achieves comparable or superior performance to alignment-based methods with external dependencies.

Conclusion: APASI demonstrates a novel, generalizable approach to hallucination mitigation that eliminates external dependencies while maintaining or exceeding the performance of existing methods.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) suffer from serious hallucination
problems, where the model-generated responses are inconsistent with the visual
inputs. Existing hallucination mitigation methods are mainly based on
preference alignment and require external human annotations or auxiliary models
for preference data collection, which increase costs and limit sustainable
improvement. To tackle these challenges, we propose Autonomous Preference
Alignment via Self-Injection (APASI), a novel and generalizable method that
mitigates hallucinations without external dependencies. APASI leverages the
target LVLM to self-inject hallucinations into a generated response, creating a
pair of responses with varying preference levels. During the self-injection
process, the dis-preferred response is generated based on three key
observations of hallucinations, ensuring it simulates real hallucination
patterns. This fidelity offers an accurate learning signal for hallucination
mitigation. Moreover, APASI incorporates an iterative alignment training
strategy combined with curriculum learning to periodically update the
preference data with increasing challenge, enabling stable and continuous
enhancement of the LVLM. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks show that
APASI not only effectively mitigates hallucinations for three baseline models
but also achieves comparable or even superior performance to alignment-based
methods with external dependency, thereby demonstrating its effectiveness and
generalization capability. The code is available at

### [56] [Leveraging Geometric Priors for Unaligned Scene Change Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11292)
*Ziling Liu,Ziwei Chen,Mingqi Gao,Jinyu Yang,Feng Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a training-free framework that leverages geometric priors from a Geometric Foundation Model to address viewpoint misalignment challenges in unaligned scene change detection, achieving superior performance without relying solely on 2D visual cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for unaligned scene change detection rely only on 2D visual cues, which fail under large viewpoint changes and lack explicit geometric reasoning. The limited supervision from small-scale datasets restricts learning generalizable multi-view knowledge.

Method: Integrates geometric priors from a Geometric Foundation Model with visual foundation model representations to enable reliable change detection. The framework identifies visual overlaps, establishes robust correspondence, and detects occlusions without requiring training.

Result: Achieves superior and robust performance on PSCD, ChangeSim, and PASLCD datasets, demonstrating effectiveness in handling viewpoint misalignment.

Conclusion: Leveraging geometric priors addresses critical limitations of current 2D-only approaches, providing a more reliable solution for unaligned scene change detection under challenging viewpoint variations.

Abstract: Unaligned Scene Change Detection aims to detect scene changes between image
pairs captured at different times without assuming viewpoint alignment. To
handle viewpoint variations, current methods rely solely on 2D visual cues to
establish cross-image correspondence to assist change detection. However, large
viewpoint changes can alter visual observations, causing appearance-based
matching to drift or fail. Additionally, supervision limited to 2D change masks
from small-scale SCD datasets restricts the learning of generalizable
multi-view knowledge, making it difficult to reliably identify visual overlaps
and handle occlusions. This lack of explicit geometric reasoning represents a
critical yet overlooked limitation. In this work, we are the first to leverage
geometric priors from a Geometric Foundation Model to address the core
challenges of unaligned SCD, including reliable identification of visual
overlaps, robust correspondence establishment, and explicit occlusion
detection. Building on these priors, we propose a training-free framework that
integrates them with the powerful representations of a visual foundation model
to enable reliable change detection under viewpoint misalignment. Through
extensive evaluation on the PSCD, ChangeSim, and PASLCD datasets, we
demonstrate that our approach achieves superior and robust performance. Our
code will be released at https://github.com/ZilingLiu/GeoSCD.

*Matthias Wüest,Francis Engelmann,Ondrej Miksik,Marc Pollefeys,Daniel Barath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UnLoc is an efficient data-driven camera localization method that uses floorplans and probabilistic depth uncertainty modeling with pre-trained monocular depth networks, achieving significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Floorplan data is readily available, persistent, and robust to visual changes, but recent methods lack uncertainty modeling in depth predictions and require custom depth networks trained for each environment.

Method: Introduces a novel probabilistic model that incorporates uncertainty estimation by modeling depth predictions as explicit probability distributions, leveraging off-the-shelf pre-trained monocular depth models instead of per-environment-trained networks.

Result: Achieves 2.7x higher localization recall on long sequences (100 frames) and 16.7x higher on short sequences (15 frames) than state-of-the-art on the challenging LaMAR HGE dataset, with significant improvements in accuracy and robustness on large-scale synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: UnLoc provides an efficient and generalizable solution for sequential camera localization that eliminates the need for environment-specific training while incorporating crucial uncertainty modeling for improved performance.

Abstract: We propose UnLoc, an efficient data-driven solution for sequential camera
localization within floorplans. Floorplan data is readily available, long-term
persistent, and robust to changes in visual appearance. We address key
limitations of recent methods, such as the lack of uncertainty modeling in
depth predictions and the necessity for custom depth networks trained for each
environment. We introduce a novel probabilistic model that incorporates
uncertainty estimation, modeling depth predictions as explicit probability
distributions. By leveraging off-the-shelf pre-trained monocular depth models,
we eliminate the need to rely on per-environment-trained depth networks,
enhancing generalization to unseen spaces. We evaluate UnLoc on large-scale
synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over
existing methods in terms of accuracy and robustness. Notably, we achieve $2.7$
times higher localization recall on long sequences (100 frames) and $16.7$
times higher on short ones (15 frames) than the state of the art on the
challenging LaMAR HGE dataset.

*Jian Song,Wei Mei,Yunfeng Xu,Qiang Fu,Renke Kou,Lina Bu,Yucheng Long*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SIKNet - a learning-aided Kalman filter that uses semantic-independent encoding to improve motion estimation in multi-object tracking, outperforming traditional Kalman filters and other learning-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Kalman filters based on linear constant-velocity models perform poorly when parameters are mismatched and objects move non-stationarily, leading to tracking failures and identity switches in MOT.

Method: Proposes Semantic-Independent KalmanNet (SIKNet) with a Semantic-Independent Encoder that uses 1D convolution for homogeneous-semantic elements and fully-connected layers with nonlinear activation for heterogeneous-semantic elements to encode state vectors.

Result: Outperforms traditional Kalman filter and achieves superior robustness and accuracy compared to existing learning-aided filters on a large-scale semi-simulated dataset constructed from multiple MOT datasets.

Conclusion: SIKNet effectively handles motion estimation challenges in MOT by combining semantic-independent encoding with learning techniques, demonstrating improved performance over conventional methods.

Abstract: Motion estimation is a crucial component in multi-object tracking (MOT).
  It predicts the trajectory of objects by analyzing the changes in their
positions in consecutive frames of images, reducing tracking failures and
identity switches.
  The Kalman filter (KF) based on the linear constant-velocity model is one of
the most commonly used methods in MOT.
  However, it may yield unsatisfactory results when KF's parameters are
mismatched and objects move in non-stationary.
  In this work, we utilize the learning-aided filter to handle the motion
estimation of MOT.
  In particular, we propose a novel method named Semantic-Independent KalmanNet
(SIKNet), which encodes the state vector (the input feature) using a
Semantic-Independent Encoder (SIE) by two steps.
  First, the SIE uses a 1D convolution with a kernel size of 1, which convolves
along the dimension of homogeneous-semantic elements across different state
vectors to encode independent semantic information.
  Then it employs a fully-connected layer and a nonlinear activation layer to
encode nonlinear and cross-dependency information between
heterogeneous-semantic elements.
  To independently evaluate the performance of the motion estimation module in
MOT, we constructed a large-scale semi-simulated dataset from several
open-source MOT datasets.
  Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SIKNet outperforms the
traditional KF and achieves superior robustness and accuracy than existing
learning-aided filters.

### [59] [Toward Next-generation Medical Vision Backbones: Modeling Finer-grained Long-range Visual Dependency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11328)
*Mingyuan Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This doctoral research investigates long-range visual dependency modeling in medical image computing, comparing transformers and MLPs, finding MLPs superior for fine-grained analysis of high-resolution medical features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image computing requires models that capture both global context and local subtle details, necessitating fine-grained long-range visual dependency modeling that current CNN and transformer approaches struggle with.

Method: The research first explores transformers for pixel- and image-wise medical vision tasks, then pioneers MLP-based visual models to capture fine-grained long-range dependency in medical images through extensive experiments.

Result: Experiments confirm MLPs provide feasibility in modeling finer-grained long-range dependency among higher-resolution medical features containing enriched anatomical/pathological details, consistently enhancing performance across various medical vision tasks.

Conclusion: MLPs establish as a superior paradigm over transformers/CNNs for medical image computing, offering better fine-grained long-range dependency modeling and paving the way for next-generation medical vision backbones.

Abstract: Medical Image Computing (MIC) is a broad research topic covering both
pixel-wise (e.g., segmentation, registration) and image-wise (e.g.,
classification, regression) vision tasks. Effective analysis demands models
that capture both global long-range context and local subtle visual
characteristics, necessitating fine-grained long-range visual dependency
modeling. Compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that are limited by
intrinsic locality, transformers excel at long-range modeling; however, due to
the high computational loads of self-attention, transformers typically cannot
process high-resolution features (e.g., full-scale image features before
downsampling or patch embedding) and thus face difficulties in modeling
fine-grained dependency among subtle medical image details. Concurrently,
Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)-based visual models are recognized as
computation/memory-efficient alternatives in modeling long-range visual
dependency but have yet to be widely investigated in the MIC community. This
doctoral research advances deep learning-based MIC by investigating effective
long-range visual dependency modeling. It first presents innovative use of
transformers for both pixel- and image-wise medical vision tasks. The focus
then shifts to MLPs, pioneeringly developing MLP-based visual models to capture
fine-grained long-range visual dependency in medical images. Extensive
experiments confirm the critical role of long-range dependency modeling in MIC
and reveal a key finding: MLPs provide feasibility in modeling finer-grained
long-range dependency among higher-resolution medical features containing
enriched anatomical/pathological details. This finding establishes MLPs as a
superior paradigm over transformers/CNNs, consistently enhancing performance
across various medical vision tasks and paving the way for next-generation
medical vision backbones.

*Sriram Narayanan,Mani Ramanagopal,Srinivasa G. Narasimhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First method to separate reflected and emitted light components in thermal videos using dual-band thermal cameras with different spectral sensitivities, enabling accurate estimation of surface emissivity and time-varying temperature in near-ambient conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional thermography assumes either reflected or emitted light dominates, but in near-ambient conditions (most relevant for computer vision), both components are comparable and time-varying, making separation essential for understanding object properties like emissivity, temperature, reflectance and shape.

Method: Developed a dual-band thermal image formation model using two thermal cameras with different spectral sensitivities, with algorithms to estimate surface emissivity and time-varying temperature while isolating dynamic background.

Result: Quantitatively evaluated using carefully calibrated emissivities for various materials, with qualitative results showing effectiveness on complex everyday scenes like glass with hot liquid and people moving in background.

Conclusion: The method successfully separates reflected and emitted light components in thermal imaging, providing accurate property estimation for surfaces in dynamic near-ambient environments where traditional approaches fail.

Abstract: Long-wave infrared radiation captured by a thermal camera consists of two
components: (a) light from the environment reflected or transmitted by a
surface, and (b) light emitted by the surface after undergoing heat transport
through the object and exchanging heat with the surrounding environment.
Separating these components is essential for understanding object properties
such as emissivity, temperature, reflectance and shape. Previous thermography
studies often assume that only one component is dominant (e.g., in welding) or
that the second component is constant and can be subtracted. However, in
near-ambient conditions, which are most relevant to computer vision
applications, both components are typically comparable in magnitude and vary
over time. We introduce the first method that separates reflected and emitted
components of light in videos captured by two thermal cameras with different
spectral sensitivities. We derive a dual-band thermal image formation model and
develop algorithms to estimate the surface's emissivity and its time-varying
temperature while isolating a dynamic background. We quantitatively evaluate
our approach using carefully calibrated emissivities for a range of materials
and show qualitative results on complex everyday scenes, such as a glass filled
with hot liquid and people moving in the background.

*Huaiyuan Qin,Muli Yang,Siyuan Hu,Peng Hu,Yu Zhang,Chen Gong,Hongyuan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSL can learn meaningful representations even without strict instance consistency, with moderate view diversity enhancing performance but excessive diversity reducing effectiveness. EMD helps quantify optimal diversity range.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-supervised learning traditionally assumes instance consistency, but this breaks down for non-iconic data where different views may contain distinct objects. The paper investigates SSL effectiveness when instance consistency is not guaranteed.

Method: Extensive ablation studies examining SSL with varying view diversity levels, using zero overlapping and smaller crop scales to increase diversity. Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) is adopted as an estimator to measure mutual information between views.

Result: SSL can still learn meaningful representations without strict instance consistency. Moderate view diversity enhances downstream performance on classification and dense prediction tasks, but excessive diversity reduces effectiveness. Moderate EMD values correlate with improved SSL learning.

Conclusion: There is an optimal range for view diversity in SSL frameworks. EMD serves as a useful estimator for measuring mutual information and guiding future SSL design. Findings are robust across diverse data sources and settings.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) conventionally relies on the instance
consistency paradigm, assuming that different views of the same image can be
treated as positive pairs. However, this assumption breaks down for non-iconic
data, where different views may contain distinct objects or semantic
information. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of SSL when
instance consistency is not guaranteed. Through extensive ablation studies, we
demonstrate that SSL can still learn meaningful representations even when
positive pairs lack strict instance consistency. Furthermore, our analysis
further reveals that increasing view diversity, by enforcing zero overlapping
or using smaller crop scales, can enhance downstream performance on
classification and dense prediction tasks. However, excessive diversity is
found to reduce effectiveness, suggesting an optimal range for view diversity.
To quantify this, we adopt the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) as an estimator to
measure mutual information between views, finding that moderate EMD values
correlate with improved SSL learning, providing insights for future SSL
framework design. We validate our findings across a range of settings,
highlighting their robustness and applicability on diverse data sources.

*Robin Narsingh Ranabhat,Longwei Wang,Amit Kumar Patel,KC santosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two regularization methods to make CNNs more robust to image corruptions by promoting shape-based rather than texture-based representations, improving performance on CIFAR-10-C without sacrificing clean accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs are vulnerable to common image corruptions that humans handle easily because they rely too much on local texture cues rather than global object shapes like human perception does.

Method: Two complementary strategies: 1) auxiliary loss enforcing feature consistency between original and low-frequency filtered inputs to reduce high-frequency texture dependence, 2) supervised contrastive learning to structure feature space around class-consistent shape representations.

Result: Both methods improved corruption robustness on CIFAR-10-C benchmark while maintaining clean accuracy, demonstrating effective regularization.

Conclusion: Loss-level regularization can successfully guide CNNs toward more shape-aware and resilient representations, bridging the gap with human visual perception.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at image classification but remain
vulnerable to common corruptions that humans handle with ease. A key reason for
this fragility is their reliance on local texture cues rather than global
object shapes -- a stark contrast to human perception. To address this, we
propose two complementary regularization strategies designed to encourage
shape-biased representations and enhance robustness. The first introduces an
auxiliary loss that enforces feature consistency between original and
low-frequency filtered inputs, discouraging dependence on high-frequency
textures. The second incorporates supervised contrastive learning to structure
the feature space around class-consistent, shape-relevant representations.
Evaluated on the CIFAR-10-C benchmark, both methods improve corruption
robustness without degrading clean accuracy. Our results suggest that
loss-level regularization can effectively steer CNNs toward more shape-aware,
resilient representations.

*Wan Xu,Feng Zhu,Yihan Zeng,Yuanfan Guo,Ming Liu,Hang Xu,Wangmeng Zuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLaVE-Cap is a novel video captioning framework that addresses limitations in current local-to-global approaches by introducing TrackFusion for comprehensive local caption generation and CaptionBridge for local-global interaction, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current local-to-global video captioning paradigms produce less detailed and contextually inconsistent captions due to lack of fine-grained captioning mechanisms and weak interaction between local and global captions.

Method: Proposes GLaVE-Cap with two core modules: TrackFusion (uses vision experts for cross-frame visual prompts with dual-stream structure) and CaptionBridge (establishes local-global interaction using global context to guide local captioning and adaptive summarization). Also creates GLaVE-Bench benchmark and GLaVE-1.2M training dataset.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks. Ablation studies validate effectiveness of proposed modules and contribution of GLaVE-1.2M dataset to video understanding community.

Conclusion: GLaVE-Cap successfully addresses the limitations of existing video captioning approaches through improved local caption generation and enhanced local-global interaction, with comprehensive benchmarks and datasets to support future research.

Abstract: Video detailed captioning aims to generate comprehensive video descriptions
to facilitate video understanding. Recently, most efforts in the video detailed
captioning community have been made towards a local-to-global paradigm, which
first generates local captions from video clips and then summarizes them into a
global caption. However, we find this paradigm leads to less detailed and
contextual-inconsistent captions, which can be attributed to (1) no mechanism
to ensure fine-grained captions, and (2) weak interaction between local and
global captions. To remedy the above two issues, we propose GLaVE-Cap, a
Global-Local aligned framework with Vision Expert integration for Captioning,
which consists of two core modules: TrackFusion enables comprehensive local
caption generation, by leveraging vision experts to acquire cross-frame visual
prompts, coupled with a dual-stream structure; while CaptionBridge establishes
a local-global interaction, by using global context to guide local captioning,
and adaptively summarizing local captions into a coherent global caption.
Besides, we construct GLaVE-Bench, a comprehensive video captioning benchmark
featuring 5X more queries per video than existing benchmarks, covering diverse
visual dimensions to facilitate reliable evaluation. We further provide a
training dataset GLaVE-1.2M containing 16K high-quality fine-grained video
captions and 1.2M related question-answer pairs. Extensive experiments on four
benchmarks show that our GLaVE-Cap achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Besides, the ablation studies and student model analyses further validate the
effectiveness of the proposed modules and the contribution of GLaVE-1.2M to the
video understanding community. The source code, model weights, benchmark, and
dataset will be open-sourced.

Motivation: There is no existing portable, high-resolution device that has been validated for 3D skin surface reconstruction and depth measurement across various body locations for objective dermatological assessment.

Method: Developed a compact 3D skin reconstruction probe based on GelSight tactile imaging with custom elastic gel and learning-based reconstruction algorithm, integrated into a handheld probe with force sensing for consistent contact.

Conclusion: Provides a validated tool for clinical and cosmetic skin analysis with applications in diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and skincare efficacy evaluation.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3-D) skin surface reconstruction offers promise for
objective and quantitative dermatological assessment, but no portable,
high-resolution device exists that has been validated and used for depth
reconstruction across various body locations. We present a compact 3-D skin
reconstruction probe based on GelSight tactile imaging with a custom elastic
gel and a learning-based reconstruction algorithm for micron-level wrinkle
height estimation. Our probe, integrated into a handheld probe with force
sensing for consistent contact, achieves a mean absolute error of 12.55 micron
on wrinkle-like test objects. In a study with 15 participants without skin
disorders, we provide the first validated wrinkle depth metrics across multiple

wrinkle height at three locations following over-the-counter moisturizer
application. Our work offers a validated tool for clinical and cosmetic skin

TL;DR: MixANT introduces a mixture of experts approach to dynamically select contextually relevant forget-gate matrices in State Space Models, enabling input-dependent temporal memory for improved human activity anticipation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current State Space Models like Mamba have static forget-gate matrices that control temporal memory, limiting their ability to adapt to different input contexts for human activity prediction.

Method: Proposes a mixture of experts architecture that dynamically selects appropriate A matrices (forget-gates) based on input features, enhancing representational capacity while maintaining computational efficiency.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods consistently across 50Salads, Breakfast, and Assembly101 datasets in all evaluation settings for dense human activity anticipation.

Conclusion: Input-dependent forget-gate mechanisms are crucial for reliable human behavior prediction in diverse real-world scenarios, and MixANT's dynamic approach significantly improves performance.

Abstract: We present MixANT, a novel architecture for stochastic long-term dense
anticipation of human activities. While recent State Space Models (SSMs) like
Mamba have shown promise through input-dependent selectivity on three key
parameters, the critical forget-gate ($\textbf{A}$ matrix) controlling temporal
memory remains static. We address this limitation by introducing a mixture of
experts approach that dynamically selects contextually relevant $\textbf{A}$
matrices based on input features, enhancing representational capacity without
sacrificing computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on the 50Salads,
Breakfast, and Assembly101 datasets demonstrate that MixANT consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all evaluation settings. Our
results highlight the importance of input-dependent forget-gate mechanisms for
reliable prediction of human behavior in diverse real-world scenarios.

*Christoph Fürböck,Paul Weiser,Branko Mitic,Philipp Seeböck,Thomas Helbich,Georg Langs*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hypernetwork-based method that dynamically generates classification models conditioned on available medical imaging modalities, enabling robust training and inference on incomplete multi-modal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world clinical environments often have partially incomplete multi-modal medical imaging data, and standard approaches (discarding samples, imputation, or dropout) limit robustness and generalizability.

Method: A hypernetwork learns to predict parameters of task-specific classification models adapted to available modalities, allowing training and inference on all samples regardless of completeness.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with up to 8% absolute accuracy increase when trained on datasets with 25% completeness (75% missing modalities).

Conclusion: Provides an efficient solution for real-world multi-modal medical data analysis by enabling a single model to generalize across all modality configurations.

Abstract: In real world clinical environments, training and applying deep learning
models on multi-modal medical imaging data often struggles with partially
incomplete data. Standard approaches either discard missing samples, require
imputation or repurpose dropout learning schemes, limiting robustness and
generalizability. To address this, we propose a hypernetwork-based method that
dynamically generates task-specific classification models conditioned on the
set of available modalities. Instead of training a fixed model, a hypernetwork
learns to predict the parameters of a task model adapted to available
modalities, enabling training and inference on all samples, regardless of
completeness. We compare this approach with (1) models trained only on complete
data, (2) state of the art channel dropout methods, and (3) an imputation-based
method, using artificially incomplete datasets to systematically analyze
robustness to missing modalities. Results demonstrate superior adaptability of
our method, outperforming state of the art approaches with an absolute increase
in accuracy of up to 8% when trained on a dataset with 25% completeness (75% of
training data with missing modalities). By enabling a single model to
generalize across all modality configurations, our approach provides an
efficient solution for real-world multi-modal medical data analysis.

*Nikolaos Zioulis,Nikolaos Kotarelas,Georgios Albanis,Spyridon Thermos,Anargyros Chatzitofis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes weighted rotation blending using quaternion averaging to address Gaussian deformation artifacts in human avatar animation, enabling simpler vertex-based Gaussians that work with any Gaussian rasterizer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Gaussian splatting methods for human avatars suffer from artifacts when using linear blend skinning for Gaussian deformation due to non-linear rotation properties, requiring complex mesh-based solutions or corrective models.

Method: Weighted rotation blending approach leveraging quaternion averaging to properly handle Gaussian rotations, modifying only the linear blend skinning technique while maintaining compatibility with any Gaussian rasterizer.

Result: Creates simpler vertex-based Gaussians that can be efficiently animated and integrated into any engine without requiring complex mesh properties or corrective offset prediction models.

Conclusion: The proposed quaternion-based rotation blending provides a straightforward solution to Gaussian deformation artifacts, making human avatar animation more efficient and compatible with existing systems while maintaining the speed advantages of Gaussian splatting.

Abstract: Radiance field-based methods have recently been used to reconstruct human
avatars, showing that we can significantly downscale the systems needed for
creating animated human avatars. Although this progress has been initiated by
neural radiance fields, their slow rendering and backward mapping from the
observation space to the canonical space have been the main challenges. With
Gaussian splatting overcoming both challenges, a new family of approaches has
emerged that are faster to train and render, while also straightforward to
implement using forward skinning from the canonical to the observation space.
However, the linear blend skinning required for the deformation of the
Gaussians does not provide valid results for their non-linear rotation
properties. To address such artifacts, recent works use mesh properties to
rotate the non-linear Gaussian properties or train models to predict corrective
offsets. Instead, we propose a weighted rotation blending approach that
leverages quaternion averaging. This leads to simpler vertex-based Gaussians
that can be efficiently animated and integrated in any engine by only modifying
the linear blend skinning technique, and using any Gaussian rasterizer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a latent space rotation method to disentangle biological and technical factors in medical imaging, improving cluster consistency and enabling better biomarker discovery in multi-center data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging data suffers from domain shifts due to different vendors and acquisition parameters, which impedes learning biologically meaningful representations and discovering disease patterns.

Method: Introduces an approach to actively learn domain shift via post-hoc rotation of the data latent space, enabling disentanglement of biological and technical factors without requiring labels.

Result: Improves cluster consistency by +19.01% (ARI), +16.85% (NMI), and +12.39% (Dice) compared to entangled representation, outperforming four state-of-the-art harmonization methods. Enhances Cox survival prediction when quantifying tissue composition.

Conclusion: The label-free framework facilitates biomarker discovery in multi-center routine imaging data by providing stable clusters representing tissue-types across different acquisition settings.

Abstract: Identifying new disease-related patterns in medical imaging data with the
help of machine learning enlarges the vocabulary of recognizable findings. This
supports diagnostic and prognostic assessment. However, image appearance varies
not only due to biological differences, but also due to imaging technology
linked to vendors, scanning- or re- construction parameters. The resulting
domain shifts impedes data representation learning strategies and the discovery
of biologically meaningful cluster appearances. To address these challenges, we
introduce an approach to actively learn the domain shift via post-hoc rotation
of the data latent space, enabling disentanglement of biological and technical
factors. Results on real-world heterogeneous clinical data showcase that the
learned disentangled representation leads to stable clusters representing
tissue-types across different acquisition settings. Cluster consistency is
improved by +19.01% (ARI), +16.85% (NMI), and +12.39% (Dice) compared to the
entangled representation, outperforming four state-of-the-art harmonization
methods. When using the clusters to quantify tissue composition on idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis patients, the learned profiles enhance Cox survival
prediction. This indicates that the proposed label-free framework facilitates
biomarker discovery in multi-center routine imaging data. Code is available on

*Ayhan Can Erdur,Christian Beischl,Daniel Scholz,Jiazhen Pan,Benedikt Wiestler,Daniel Rueckert,Jan C Peeken*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A masked autoencoder approach for handling missing MRI sequences in 3D medical imaging, using multi-modal transformer architecture that improves performance on downstream tasks when inputs are incomplete.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Missing input sequences are common in medical imaging data, posing challenges for deep learning models that require complete input data for optimal performance.

Method: Developed a masked autoencoder paradigm inspired by MultiMAE, treating each MRI sequence as separate modality with late-fusion transformer encoder and individual decoder streams for multi-task reconstruction.

Result: Achieved absolute improvement of 10.1 overall Dice score and 0.46 MCC over MAE-ViT baselines in downstream segmentation and classification tasks with missing input sequences.

Conclusion: The method provides a flexible and generalizable encoder for brain MRIs that can infer missing sequences and be adapted to various downstream applications, demonstrating strong pretraining strategy effectiveness.

Abstract: Missing input sequences are common in medical imaging data, posing a
challenge for deep learning models reliant on complete input data. In this
work, inspired by MultiMAE [2], we develop a masked autoencoder (MAE) paradigm
for multi-modal, multi-task learning in 3D medical imaging with brain MRIs. Our
method treats each MRI sequence as a separate input modality, leveraging a
late-fusion-style transformer encoder to integrate multi-sequence information
(multi-modal) and individual decoder streams for each modality for multi-task
reconstruction. This pretraining strategy guides the model to learn rich
representations per modality while also equipping it to handle missing inputs
through cross-sequence reasoning. The result is a flexible and generalizable
encoder for brain MRIs that infers missing sequences from available inputs and
can be adapted to various downstream applications. We demonstrate the
performance and robustness of our method against an MAE-ViT baseline in
downstream segmentation and classification tasks, showing absolute improvement
of $10.1$ overall Dice score and $0.46$ MCC over the baselines with missing
input sequences. Our experiments demonstrate the strength of this pretraining
strategy. The implementation is made available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TrajTrack is a lightweight LiDAR-based 3D single object tracking framework that uses historical bounding box trajectories to enhance two-frame trackers, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 56 FPS speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D SOT methods face a dilemma: two-frame methods lack temporal context and struggle with sparse/occluded scenes, while sequence-based methods are robust but computationally expensive.

Method: Proposes trajectory-based paradigm with explicit motion proposal generation and implicit motion modeling module that predicts future trajectories to refine initial proposals using only historical bounding box data.

Result: Achieves 4.48% improvement in tracking precision over strong baseline on NuScenes benchmark while running at 56 FPS, demonstrating strong generalizability across different base trackers.

Conclusion: TrajTrack successfully resolves the efficiency-robustness trade-off in 3D SOT by leveraging trajectory information without additional point cloud inputs, setting new state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D single object tracking (3D SOT) is a critical task in robotics
and autonomous systems. Existing methods typically follow frame-wise motion
estimation or a sequence-based paradigm. However, the two-frame methods are
efficient but lack long-term temporal context, making them vulnerable in sparse
or occluded scenes, while sequence-based methods that process multiple point
clouds gain robustness at a significant computational cost. To resolve this
dilemma, we propose a novel trajectory-based paradigm and its instantiation,
TrajTrack. TrajTrack is a lightweight framework that enhances a base two-frame
tracker by implicitly learning motion continuity from historical bounding box
trajectories alone-without requiring additional, costly point cloud inputs. It
first generates a fast, explicit motion proposal and then uses an implicit
motion modeling module to predict the future trajectory, which in turn refines
and corrects the initial proposal. Extensive experiments on the large-scale
NuScenes benchmark show that TrajTrack achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, dramatically improving tracking precision by 4.48% over a strong
baseline while running at 56 FPS. Besides, we also demonstrate the strong
generalizability of TrajTrack across different base trackers. Video is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FusionNet is an end-to-end infrared and visible image fusion framework that uses modality-aware attention and pixel-wise alpha blending to integrate complementary information while preserving semantic content in critical regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared and visible image fusion aims to combine structural and textural information from different spectral domains, but existing methods often lack interpretability and semantic preservation in task-critical regions.

Method: Proposes FusionNet with modality-aware attention mechanism to dynamically adjust feature contributions, pixel-wise alpha blending for adaptive fusion weights, and target-aware loss using weak ROI supervision for semantic consistency.

Result: Experiments on M3FD dataset show FusionNet generates fused images with enhanced semantic preservation, high perceptual quality, and clear interpretability.

Conclusion: FusionNet provides a general and extensible solution for semantic-aware multi-modal image fusion that benefits downstream tasks like object detection and scene understanding.

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) is a fundamental task in multi-modal
perception that aims to integrate complementary structural and textural cues
from different spectral domains. In this paper, we propose FusionNet, a novel
end-to-end fusion framework that explicitly models inter-modality interaction
and enhances task-critical regions. FusionNet introduces a modality-aware
attention mechanism that dynamically adjusts the contribution of infrared and
visible features based on their discriminative capacity. To achieve
fine-grained, interpretable fusion, we further incorporate a pixel-wise alpha
blending module, which learns spatially-varying fusion weights in an adaptive
and content-aware manner. Moreover, we formulate a target-aware loss that
leverages weak ROI supervision to preserve semantic consistency in regions
containing important objects (e.g., pedestrians, vehicles). Experiments on the
public M3FD dataset demonstrate that FusionNet generates fused images with
enhanced semantic preservation, high perceptual quality, and clear
interpretability. Our framework provides a general and extensible solution for
semantic-aware multi-modal image fusion, with benefits for downstream tasks
such as object detection and scene understanding.

*Wenhao Tang,Sheng Huang,Heng Fang,Fengtao Zhou,Bo Liu,Qingshan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MHIM-MIL is a novel Multiple Instance Learning framework that uses masked hard instance mining with a Siamese structure to identify and learn from challenging tissue instances in whole slide images, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MIL methods in computational pathology focus on easy-to-classify instances via attention mechanisms, creating bias and neglecting hard examples that are crucial for accurate discriminative boundary modeling.

Method: Uses Siamese structure with consistency constraint, class-aware instance probability, momentum teacher to mask salient instances and mine hard instances, large-scale random masking with global recycle network to preserve key features, and exponential moving average for teacher updates.

Result: Outperforms latest methods in performance and efficiency on cancer diagnosis, subtyping, survival analysis tasks across 12 benchmarks.

Conclusion: MHIM-MIL effectively addresses the bias towards easy instances in MIL frameworks and demonstrates superior performance by focusing on hard instance mining for better discriminative learning in computational pathology.

Abstract: Digitizing pathological images into gigapixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs) has
opened new avenues for Computational Pathology (CPath). As positive tissue
comprises only a small fraction of gigapixel WSIs, existing Multiple Instance
Learning (MIL) methods typically focus on identifying salient instances via
attention mechanisms. However, this leads to a bias towards easy-to-classify
instances while neglecting challenging ones. Recent studies have shown that
hard examples are crucial for accurately modeling discriminative boundaries.
Applying such an idea at the instance level, we elaborate a novel MIL framework
with masked hard instance mining (MHIM-MIL), which utilizes a Siamese structure
with a consistency constraint to explore the hard instances. Using a
class-aware instance probability, MHIM-MIL employs a momentum teacher to mask
salient instances and implicitly mine hard instances for training the student
model. To obtain diverse, non-redundant hard instances, we adopt large-scale
random masking while utilizing a global recycle network to mitigate the risk of
losing key features. Furthermore, the student updates the teacher using an
exponential moving average, which identifies new hard instances for subsequent
training iterations and stabilizes optimization. Experimental results on cancer
diagnosis, subtyping, survival analysis tasks, and 12 benchmarks demonstrate
that MHIM-MIL outperforms the latest methods in both performance and
efficiency. The code is available at: https://github.com/DearCaat/MHIM-MIL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing camouflaged object detection studies overlook semantic differences among textual prompts of different targets and fine-grained frequency features, limiting their performance.

Method: Proposed SFGNet with Multi-Band Fourier Module (MBFM) to handle complex backgrounds and blurred boundaries, and Interactive Structure Enhancement Block (ISEB) to ensure structural integrity and boundary details.

Result: Extensive experiments on three COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that the method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The incorporation of semantic prompts and frequency-domain features with specialized modules effectively improves camouflaged object detection performance.

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) aims to segment objects that blend into
their surroundings. However, most existing studies overlook the semantic
differences among textual prompts of different targets as well as fine-grained
frequency features. In this work, we propose a novel Semantic and Frequency
Guided Network (SFGNet), which incorporates semantic prompts and
frequency-domain features to capture camouflaged objects and improve boundary
perception. We further design Multi-Band Fourier Module(MBFM) to enhance the
ability of the network in handling complex backgrounds and blurred boundaries.
In addition, we design an Interactive Structure Enhancement Block (ISEB) to
ensure structural integrity and boundary details in the predictions. Extensive
experiments conducted on three COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that our

*Weiming Li,Yan Shao,Jing Yang,Yujing Lu,Ling Zhong,Yuhan Wang,Manni Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Zero-shot auxiliary reasoning methods using spatial cues (axes, grids, labeled intersections) significantly improve GUI grounding performance in vision-language models without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs have latent grounding potential but underperform in explicit coordinate output tasks for GUI grounding, while current fine-tuning approaches require high data and annotation costs.

Method: Three zero-shot auxiliary reasoning methods that provide explicit spatial cues (axes, grids, labeled intersections) as part of input images to help VLMs articulate their implicit spatial understanding.

Result: Substantial performance improvement on four GUI grounding benchmarks across seven open-source and proprietary VLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed zero-shot methods effectively bridge the gap between VLMs' latent grounding capabilities and explicit coordinate output requirements for GUI grounding tasks.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) grounding is a fundamental task for building
GUI agents. However, general vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with this
task due to a lack of specific optimization. We identify a key gap in this
paper: while VLMs exhibit significant latent grounding potential, as
demonstrated by their performance measured by Pointing Game, they underperform
when tasked with outputting explicit coordinates. To address this discrepancy,
and bypass the high data and annotation costs of current fine-tuning
approaches, we propose three zero-shot auxiliary reasoning methods. By
providing explicit spatial cues such as axes, grids and labeled intersections
as part of the input image, these methods enable VLMs to articulate their
implicit spatial understanding capabilities. We evaluate these methods on four
GUI grounding benchmarks across seven open-source and proprietary VLMs. The
evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed methods substantially improve
the performance of GUI grounding.

*Zhexi Peng,Kun Zhou,Tianjia Shao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPS-SLAM combines Gaussian and SDF representations to achieve real-time 3D reconstruction at 150+ fps, offering 10x speedup over current Gaussian-based SLAM methods while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Gaussian-based SLAM methods suffer from computational bottlenecks (under 20 fps) compared to geometry-centric approaches (hundreds of fps), due to the heavy computational burden of modeling scenes with numerous Gaussians and complex iterative optimization.

Method: Proposes a Gaussian-SDF hybrid representation: uses colorized Signed Distance Field (SDF) for smooth geometry and appearance via efficient RGB-D fusion, combined with 3D Gaussians to capture underrepresented details through targeted iterative optimization.

Result: Achieves over 150 fps on real-world Azure Kinect sequences with 50% fewer Gaussians and 75% fewer optimization iterations, delivering an order-of-magnitude speedup while maintaining comparable reconstruction quality to state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: The hybrid representation enables real-time performance by avoiding full-scene Gaussian modeling and enabling efficient targeted optimization, making high-quality Gaussian-based SLAM practical for real-time applications.

Abstract: While recent Gaussian-based SLAM methods achieve photorealistic
reconstruction from RGB-D data, their computational performance remains a
critical bottleneck. State-of-the-art techniques operate at less than 20 fps,
significantly lagging behind geometry-centric approaches like KinectFusion
(hundreds of fps). This limitation stems from the heavy computational burden:
modeling scenes requires numerous Gaussians and complex iterative optimization
to fit RGB-D data, where insufficient Gaussian counts or optimization
iterations cause severe quality degradation. To address this, we propose a
Gaussian-SDF hybrid representation, combining a colorized Signed Distance Field
(SDF) for smooth geometry and appearance with 3D Gaussians to capture
underrepresented details. The SDF is efficiently constructed via RGB-D fusion
(as in geometry-centric methods), while Gaussians undergo iterative
optimization. Our representation enables drastic Gaussian reduction (50% fewer)
by avoiding full-scene Gaussian modeling, and efficient Gaussian optimization
(75% fewer iterations) through targeted appearance refinement. Building upon
this representation, we develop GPS-SLAM (Gaussian-Plus-SDF SLAM), a real-time
3D reconstruction system achieving over 150 fps on real-world Azure Kinect
sequences -- delivering an order-of-magnitude speedup over state-of-the-art
techniques while maintaining comparable reconstruction quality. We will release
the source code and data to facilitate future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Hierarchical Identity Learning (HIL) framework with Multi-Center Contrastive Learning and Bidirectional Reverse Selection Transmission to address fine-grained differences in unsupervised visible-infrared person re-identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised VI-ReID methods focus on cluster commonality but neglect finer-grained differences among images within clusters, limiting performance.

Method: HIL framework with secondary clustering to generate multiple memories per cluster, MCCL for representation refinement, and BRST mechanism for reliable cross-modal matching.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches on SYSU-MM01 and RegDB datasets through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical approach effectively captures fine-grained variations and improves cross-modal matching in unsupervised VI-ReID.

Abstract: Unsupervised visible-infrared person re-identification (USVI-ReID) aims to
learn modality-invariant image features from unlabeled cross-modal person
datasets by reducing the modality gap while minimizing reliance on costly
manual annotations. Existing methods typically address USVI-ReID using
cluster-based contrastive learning, which represents a person by a single
cluster center. However, they primarily focus on the commonality of images
within each cluster while neglecting the finer-grained differences among them.
To address the limitation, we propose a Hierarchical Identity Learning (HIL)
framework. Since each cluster may contain several smaller sub-clusters that
reflect fine-grained variations among images, we generate multiple memories for
each existing coarse-grained cluster via a secondary clustering. Additionally,
we propose Multi-Center Contrastive Learning (MCCL) to refine representations
for enhancing intra-modal clustering and minimizing cross-modal discrepancies.
To further improve cross-modal matching quality, we design a Bidirectional
Reverse Selection Transmission (BRST) mechanism, which establishes reliable
cross-modal correspondences by performing bidirectional matching of
pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments conducted on the SYSU-MM01 and RegDB
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the need for performance prioritization in safety-critical scenarios (e.g., prioritizing 'Human' over 'Dog') and aims to minimize bias and variance in multi-class classification by optimizing class distributions rather than using uniform distributions.

Method: Iterative framework that identifies Pareto optimized class distributions, determines optimal number of images per class, and can be incorporated into existing training pipelines with minimal code changes. Validated using EfficientNet, ResNet and ConvNeXt on CIFAR-10 and iNaturalist21 datasets.

Result: Demonstrated improved and balanced model performance through optimized data distribution across different architectures and datasets.

Conclusion: BiCDO provides an effective data-centric approach to enhance reliability in multi-class image classification by optimizing class distributions, particularly valuable for safety-critical applications where certain classes require higher performance prioritization.

Abstract: We propose BiCDO (Bias-Controlled Class Distribution Optimizer), an
iterative, data-centric framework that identifies Pareto optimized class
distributions for multi-class image classification. BiCDO enables performance
prioritization for specific classes, which is useful in safety-critical
scenarios (e.g. prioritizing 'Human' over 'Dog'). Unlike uniform distributions,
BiCDO determines the optimal number of images per class to enhance reliability
and minimize bias and variance in the objective function. BiCDO can be
incorporated into existing training pipelines with minimal code changes and
supports any labelled multi-class dataset. We have validated BiCDO using
EfficientNet, ResNet and ConvNeXt on CIFAR-10 and iNaturalist21 datasets,
demonstrating improved, balanced model performance through optimized data

TL;DR: MVQA-68K is a novel multi-dimensional video quality assessment dataset with 68K+ videos annotated across 7 quality dimensions with chain-of-thought reasoning, significantly improving MLLM performance on VQA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional VQA methods produce single numerical scores that lack comprehensiveness and interpretability, while video generation models like Sora create need for better quality assessment tools for large-scale datasets.

Method: Created MVQA-68K dataset with over 68,000 videos annotated across seven quality dimensions (aesthetics, camera movement, dynamic degree, texture detail, composition, visual quality, factual consistency) with detailed chain-of-thought reasoning.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art results on internal test set and public benchmarks (LSVQ-test, LSVQ-1080p, LIVE-VQC), with substantial zero-shot generalization improvement through explicit reasoning process.

Conclusion: Multi-dimensional VQA with chain-of-thought reasoning significantly enhances video quality assessment performance and interpretability, providing comprehensive evaluation framework for video generation models.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of video generation models such as Sora, video
quality assessment (VQA) is becoming increasingly crucial for selecting
high-quality videos from large-scale datasets used in pre-training. Traditional
VQA methods, typically producing single numerical scores, often lack
comprehensiveness and interpretability. To address these challenges, we
introduce MVQA-68K, a novel multi-dimensional VQA dataset comprising over
68,000 carefully annotated videos, covering seven essential quality dimensions:
overall aesthetics, camera movement, dynamic degree, texture detail,
composition, visual quality, and factual consistency. Each annotation includes
detailed chain-of-thought reasoning to facilitate interpretability and
comprehensive understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVQA-68K
significantly enhances the performance of various multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) on the VQA task, achieving state-of-the-art results not only on
our internal test set (Fig.1) but also on public benchmarks including
LSVQ-test, LSVQ-1080p, and LIVE-VQC. Meantime, incorporating explicit reasoning
process during VQA training substantially boosts the zero-shot generalization.

*Siming Fu,Sijun Dong,Xiaoliang Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyGDL is a hybrid generative-discriminative framework that addresses shortcut learning in SSL by enforcing content-style disentanglement through vector projection and invariance pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-supervised learning suffers from shortcut learning where models rely on superficial features like texture instead of intrinsic structure, limiting generalization to unseen domains.

Method: Proposes HyGDL framework with single encoder that analytically defines style as orthogonal component to content via vector projection, guided by invariance pre-training principle that systematically varies bias while keeping supervision constant.

Result: Not specified in the abstract - requires full paper for experimental results.

Conclusion: HyGDL addresses shortcut learning at its core by altering the underlying learning mechanism through explicit content-style disentanglement, rather than surface-level feature alignment approaches.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), its
generalization is fundamentally hindered by Shortcut Learning, where models
exploit superficial features like texture instead of intrinsic structure. We
experimentally verify this flaw within the generative paradigm (e.g., MAE) and
argue it is a systemic issue also affecting discriminative methods, identifying
it as the root cause of their failure on unseen domains. While existing methods
often tackle this at a surface level by aligning or separating domain-specific
features, they fail to alter the underlying learning mechanism that fosters
shortcut dependency. To address this at its core, we propose HyGDL (Hybrid
Generative-Discriminative Learning Framework), a hybrid framework that achieves
explicit content-style disentanglement. Our approach is guided by the
Invariance Pre-training Principle: forcing a model to learn an invariant
essence by systematically varying a bias (e.g., style) at the input while
keeping the supervision signal constant. HyGDL operates on a single encoder and
analytically defines style as the component of a representation that is
orthogonal to its style-invariant content, derived via vector projection.

Motivation: Existing video anomaly detection benchmarks are limited to either frame-level or video-level tasks, which restricts a holistic view of model generalization capabilities.

Method: Proposes a softmax-based frame allocation strategy that focuses on anomaly-dense segments while ensuring full-video coverage. Builds two benchmarks: image-based for frame-level reasoning and video-based for temporally localized segments with abnormality scoring.

Result: Experiments on UCF-Crime dataset show improvements at both frame and video levels. Ablation studies confirm clear advantages of anomaly-focused sampling over uniform and random baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides balanced sampling across temporal scales and enables more comprehensive evaluation of video anomaly detection models through complementary benchmarks.

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is critical for surveillance and public safety.
However, existing benchmarks are limited to either frame-level or video-level
tasks, restricting a holistic view of model generalization. This work first
introduces a softmax-based frame allocation strategy that prioritizes
anomaly-dense segments while maintaining full-video coverage, enabling balanced
sampling across temporal scales. Building on this process, we construct two
complementary benchmarks. The image-based benchmark evaluates frame-level
reasoning with representative frames, while the video-based benchmark extends
to temporally localized segments and incorporates an abnormality scoring
task.Experiments on UCF-Crime demonstrate improvements at both the frame and
video levels, and ablation studies confirm clear advantages of anomaly-focused
sampling over uniform and random baselines.

Method: Combines parametric head model with dynamic Gaussian representations, separates head and background Gaussians, uses pre-trained 2D guidance for facial optimization, and includes a repair module for extreme poses and expressions.

Result: Achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art 2D methods in identity preservation and expression consistency, while significantly outperforming them in multi-view rendering quality and 3D consistency.

Conclusion: Bridges the gap between 3D modeling and deepfake synthesis, enabling scene-aware and immersive visual forgeries while revealing potential threats of 3D Gaussian Splatting for manipulation attacks.

Abstract: We propose a novel 3D deepfake generation framework based on 3D Gaussian
Splatting that enables realistic, identity-preserving face swapping and
reenactment in a fully controllable 3D space. Compared to conventional 2D
deepfake approaches that suffer from geometric inconsistencies and limited
generalization to novel view, our method combines a parametric head model with
dynamic Gaussian representations to support multi-view consistent rendering,
precise expression control, and seamless background integration. To address
editing challenges in point-based representations, we explicitly separate the
head and background Gaussians and use pre-trained 2D guidance to optimize the
facial region across views. We further introduce a repair module to enhance
visual consistency under extreme poses and expressions. Experiments on
NeRSemble and additional evaluation videos demonstrate that our method achieves
comparable performance to state-of-the-art 2D approaches in identity
preservation, as well as pose and expression consistency, while significantly
outperforming them in multi-view rendering quality and 3D consistency. Our
approach bridges the gap between 3D modeling and deepfake synthesis, enabling
new directions for scene-aware, controllable, and immersive visual forgeries,
revealing the threat that emerging 3D Gaussian Splatting technique could be
used for manipulation attacks.

*Yongzhe Lyu,Yu Wu,Yutian Lin,Bo Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IS-Diff is a training-free diffusion model that uses distributional harmonious seeds from unmasked areas to improve inpainting consistency and coherence, avoiding biased results from random noise initialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random noise initialization in vanilla diffusion models can introduce mismatched semantic information in masked regions, leading to biased inpainting results with low consistency and coherence with unmasked areas.

Method: Proposes Initial Seed refined Diffusion Model (IS-Diff) that samples initial seeds from unmasked areas to imitate masked data distribution, plus dynamic selective refinement mechanism to detect and adjust unharmonious inpaintings during diffusion process.

Result: Validated on CelebA-HQ, ImageNet, and Places2 datasets for standard and large-mask inpainting tasks, showing effectiveness across all metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: IS-Diff provides a training-free approach that significantly improves inpainting quality by using harmonious seeds from unmasked regions and dynamic refinement, achieving superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown promising results in free-form inpainting. Recent
studies based on refined diffusion samplers or novel architectural designs led
to realistic results and high data consistency. However, random initialization
seed (noise) adopted in vanilla diffusion process may introduce mismatched
semantic information in masked regions, leading to biased inpainting results,
e.g., low consistency and low coherence with the other unmasked area. To
address this issue, we propose the Initial Seed refined Diffusion Model
(IS-Diff), a completely training-free approach incorporating distributional
harmonious seeds to produce harmonious results. Specifically, IS-Diff employs
initial seeds sampled from unmasked areas to imitate the masked data
distribution, thereby setting a promising direction for the diffusion
procedure. Moreover, a dynamic selective refinement mechanism is proposed to
detect severe unharmonious inpaintings in intermediate latent and adjust the
strength of our initialization prior dynamically. We validate our method on
both standard and large-mask inpainting tasks using the CelebA-HQ, ImageNet,
and Places2 datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness across all metrics
compared to state-of-the-art inpainting methods.

Abstract: Existing all-in-one image restoration approaches, which aim to handle
multiple weather degradations within a single framework, are predominantly
trained and evaluated using mixed single-weather synthetic datasets. However,
these datasets often differ significantly in resolution, style, and domain
characteristics, leading to substantial domain gaps that hinder the development

in advancing this field. To address these limitations, we present a real-world
all-in-one adverse weather image restoration benchmark dataset, which contains
image pairs captured under various weather conditions, including rain, snow,

resulting dataset provides precisely aligned degraded and clean images,
enabling supervised learning and rigorous evaluation. We conduct comprehensive

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tableware cleaning methods suffer from coarse-grained classification and few-shot data scarcity, making them inadequate for industrial requirements in food safety and smart homes.

Method: DTGen uses generative diffusion models with LoRA for domain specialization, structured prompts for diverse dirty image generation, and CLIP-based cross-modal filtering for data quality assurance.

Result: Under limited real few-shot conditions, DTGen synthesizes unlimited high-quality samples that significantly improve classifier performance for fine-grained dirty tableware recognition.

Conclusion: DTGen demonstrates generative AI's value in few-shot industrial vision and provides a feasible deployment path for automated tableware cleaning and food safety monitoring in embedded dishwashers.

Abstract: Intelligent tableware cleaning is a critical application in food safety and
smart homes, but existing methods are limited by coarse-grained classification
and scarcity of few-shot data, making it difficult to meet industrialization
requirements. We propose DTGen, a few-shot data augmentation scheme based on
generative diffusion models, specifically designed for fine-grained dirty
tableware recognition. DTGen achieves efficient domain specialization through
LoRA, generates diverse dirty images via structured prompts, and ensures data
quality through CLIP-based cross-modal filtering. Under extremely limited real
few-shot conditions, DTGen can synthesize virtually unlimited high-quality
samples, significantly improving classifier performance and supporting
fine-grained dirty tableware recognition. We further elaborate on lightweight
deployment strategies, promising to transfer DTGen's benefits to embedded
dishwashers and integrate with cleaning programs to intelligently regulate
energy consumption and detergent usage. Research results demonstrate that DTGen
not only validates the value of generative AI in few-shot industrial vision but
also provides a feasible deployment path for automated tableware cleaning and
food safety monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a high-performance multimodal language model that can process images at original variable resolutions without degradation, particularly for visually dense content like charts and diagrams, while being efficiently trained on Ascend NPUs.

Method: Uses native-resolution Vision Transformers to avoid fixed-resolution tiling issues. Developed Mindspeed-MLLM distributed training framework with operator replacements for Ascend NPUs. Three-phase training: warm-up, multitask training, and supervised instruction tuning. Employs multimodal data packaging, hybrid parallelism, test-time resolution search, and model weight averaging.

Result: Achieves performance on par with Qwen2.5-VL despite using only 1/10 of the training data. Performs well in general multimodal understanding, document/table comprehension, and delivers leading performance in OCR assessments.

Conclusion: MindVL demonstrates that efficient training on specialized hardware (Ascend NPUs) with native-resolution processing and optimized training strategies can achieve state-of-the-art multimodal performance with significantly reduced training data requirements.

Abstract: We propose MindVL, a multimodal large langauge model trained on Ascend NPUs.
Similar to Qwen2.5-VL, MindVL adopts native-resolution Vision Transformers,
which enables it to process images at their original variable resolutions. This
design avoids the degradation caused by fixed-resolution tiling while
preserving fine-grained details and global layouts, which is crucial for
visually dense content such as complex charts and diagrams. To ensure the
smooth training of MindVL on Ascend NPUs, we develop Mindspeed-MLLM, a
distributed multimodal training framework tailored for Ascend NPUs. To maintain
training accuracy, we implement equivalent replacements for certain operators.
MindVL undergoes a three-phase training process, namely the warm-up phase,
multitask training phase, and supervised instruction tuning phase, to gradually
enhance its capabilities. This process starts with basic visual and multimodal
pre-training, followed by large-scale multiask trainging and instruction
tuning. We also adopt multimodal data packaging and hybrid parallelism
techniques, which significantly improve end-to-end training speed. To further
boost model performance, we specifically introduce test-time resolution search
and model weight averaging. Notably, despite using about 1/10 of the training
data required by Qwen2.5-VL, MindVL achieves performance on par with Qwen2.5-VL
in evaluations of general multimodal understanding and document/table
comprehension. Beyond overall scores, MindVL also delivers leading performance
in OCR assessments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 6D pose estimation benchmarks use everyday objects with rich textures and low-reflectivity, limiting generalization to industrial scenarios where objects are metallic, texture-less, and highly reflective.

Method: Created IMD dataset with 45 industrial components captured using RGB-D camera under natural lighting and varied arrangements. Evaluated state-of-the-art models (XMem, SAM2 for segmentation; BundleTrack, BundleSDF for pose estimation) on three tasks: video object segmentation, 6D pose tracking, and one-shot 6D pose estimation.

Result: The industrial dataset proved more challenging than existing household object datasets, demonstrating the need for specialized benchmarks for industrial robotics applications.

Conclusion: IMD provides a baseline for developing and comparing segmentation and pose estimation algorithms that better generalize to industrial robotics scenarios.

Abstract: Object 6DoF (6D) pose estimation is essential for robotic perception,
especially in industrial settings. It enables robots to interact with the
environment and manipulate objects. However, existing benchmarks on object 6D
pose estimation primarily use everyday objects with rich textures and
low-reflectivity, limiting model generalization to industrial scenarios where
objects are often metallic, texture-less, and highly reflective. To address
this gap, we propose a novel dataset and benchmark namely \textit{Industrial
Metallic Dataset (IMD)}, tailored for industrial applications. Our dataset
comprises 45 true-to-scale industrial components, captured with an RGB-D camera
under natural indoor lighting and varied object arrangements to replicate
real-world conditions. The benchmark supports three tasks, including video
object segmentation, 6D pose tracking, and one-shot 6D pose estimation. We
evaluate existing state-of-the-art models, including XMem and SAM2 for
segmentation, and BundleTrack and BundleSDF for pose estimation, to assess
model performance in industrial contexts. Evaluation results show that our
industrial dataset is more challenging than existing household object datasets.
This benchmark provides the baseline for developing and comparing segmentation
and pose estimation algorithms that better generalize to industrial robotics
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep Ensembles improve medical image segmentation but increase training and testing costs with more ensemble members. Need for efficient uncertainty estimation in retinal vessel analysis.

Method: Propose Ensemble Distillation that distills knowledge from multiple ensemble models into a single model to reduce computational complexity.

Result: Achieves comparable performance via calibration and segmentation metrics on DRIVE and FIVES datasets while significantly reducing computational complexity.

Conclusion: Ensemble distillation provides an efficient and reliable approach for uncertainty estimation in retinal vessel segmentation, making it promising for medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is critical for reliable medical image segmentation,
particularly in retinal vessel analysis, where accurate predictions are
essential for diagnostic applications. Deep Ensembles, where multiple networks
are trained individually, are widely used to improve medical image segmentation
performance. However, training and testing costs increase with the number of
ensembles. In this work, we propose Ensemble Distillation as a robust
alternative to commonly used uncertainty estimation techniques by distilling
the knowledge of multiple ensemble models into a single model. Through
extensive experiments on the DRIVE and FIVES datasets, we demonstrate that
Ensemble Distillation achieves comparable performance via calibration and
segmentation metrics, while significantly reducing computational complexity.
These findings suggest that Ensemble distillation provides an efficient and

TL;DR: Depthwise separable CNNs naturally converge to just 8 universal filters that are linear shifts of fundamental patterns like DoGs and Gaussians, achieving strong performance even when frozen.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the Master Key Filters Hypothesis by showing that DS-CNNs inherently converge to a minimal set of universal filters regardless of task or architecture.

Method: Systematic unsupervised search to extract fundamental filter patterns across different architectures and datasets, then testing networks initialized with these 8 frozen filters.

Result: Networks with just 8 unique frozen filters achieve over 80% ImageNet accuracy and outperform models with thousands of trainable parameters on smaller datasets.

Conclusion: Depthwise convolutional layers naturally gravitate toward fundamental spatial operators similar to classical image processing and biological visual systems, providing insights for generalization and transfer learning.

Abstract: A recent study has proposed the "Master Key Filters Hypothesis" for
convolutional neural network filters. This paper extends this hypothesis by
radically constraining its scope to a single set of just 8 universal filters
that depthwise separable convolutional networks inherently converge to. While
conventional DS-CNNs employ thousands of distinct trained filters, our analysis
reveals these filters are predominantly linear shifts (ax+b) of our discovered
universal set. Through systematic unsupervised search, we extracted these
fundamental patterns across different architectures and datasets. Remarkably,
networks initialized with these 8 unique frozen filters achieve over 80%
ImageNet accuracy, and even outperform models with thousands of trainable
parameters when applied to smaller datasets. The identified master key filters
closely match Difference of Gaussians (DoGs), Gaussians, and their derivatives,
structures that are not only fundamental to classical image processing but also
strikingly similar to receptive fields in mammalian visual systems. Our
findings provide compelling evidence that depthwise convolutional layers
naturally gravitate toward this fundamental set of spatial operators regardless
of task or architecture. This work offers new insights for understanding
generalization and transfer learning through the universal language of these
master key filters.

Conclusion: EchoCare provides a fully open and generalizable foundation model that can boost AI development for diverse clinical ultrasound applications through fine-tuning and local adaptation.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) that can effectively learn ultrasound
representations by integrating multi-source data holds significant promise for
advancing clinical care. However, the scarcity of large labeled datasets in
real-world clinical environments and the limited generalizability of

TL;DR: Proposes MSMA framework for 3D face reconstruction from single unconstrained images using multi-scale feature fusion and multi-attribute learning with large-kernel attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with detailed feature capture under diverse facial conditions and require large 3D datasets. Need for better feature extraction without heavy reliance on labeled 3D data.

Method: Multi-Scale Feature Fusion with Multi-Attribute (MSMA) framework using large-kernel attention module for precise feature extraction across scales from single 2D images.

Result: Achieves results on par with state-of-the-art methods on MICC Florence, Facewarehouse and custom datasets, surpassing SOTA in some challenging conditions.

Conclusion: The MSMA framework effectively addresses limitations in capturing detailed multi-scale features for 3D face reconstruction from unconstrained images.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D face from a single unconstrained image remains a
challenging problem due to diverse conditions in unconstrained environments.
Recently, learning-based methods have achieved notable results by effectively
capturing complex facial structures and details across varying conditions.
Consequently, many existing approaches employ projection-based losses between
generated and input images to constrain model training. However, learning-based
methods for 3D face reconstruction typically require substantial amounts of 3D
facial data, which is difficult and costly to obtain. Consequently, to reduce
reliance on labeled 3D face datasets, many existing approaches employ
projection-based losses between generated and input images to constrain model
training. Nonetheless, despite these advancements, existing approaches
frequently struggle to capture detailed and multi-scale features under diverse
facial attributes and conditions, leading to incomplete or less accurate
reconstructions. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion with
Multi-Attribute (MSMA) framework for 3D face reconstruction from unconstrained
images. Our method integrates multi-scale feature fusion with a focus on
multi-attribute learning and leverages a large-kernel attention module to
enhance the precision of feature extraction across scales, enabling accurate 3D
facial parameter estimation from a single 2D image. Comprehensive experiments
on the MICC Florence, Facewarehouse and custom-collect datasets demonstrate
that our approach achieves results on par with current state-of-the-art
methods, and in some instances, surpasses SOTA performance across challenging
conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Seg2Track-SAM2 is a zero-shot MOTS framework that integrates object detectors with SAM2 and a novel Seg2Track module, achieving SOTA performance on KITTI benchmarks with 75% memory reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundation models like SAM2 have strong zero-shot segmentation capabilities but lack proper identity management and memory efficiency for MOTS applications in autonomous systems.

Method: Integrates pre-trained object detectors with SAM2 and a novel Seg2Track module for track initialization, management, and reinforcement. Uses sliding-window memory strategy and requires no fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance (4th overall on KITTI MOTS for car/pedestrian classes), establishes new benchmark in association accuracy (AssA), and reduces memory usage by 75% with negligible performance degradation.

Conclusion: Seg2Track-SAM2 advances MOTS by combining robust zero-shot tracking, enhanced identity preservation, and efficient memory utilization for autonomous systems.

Abstract: Autonomous systems require robust Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) capabilities to
operate reliably in dynamic environments. MOT ensures consistent object
identity assignment and precise spatial delineation. Recent advances in
foundation models, such as SAM2, have demonstrated strong zero-shot
generalization for video segmentation, but their direct application to MOTS
(MOT+Segmentation) remains limited by insufficient identity management and
memory efficiency. This work introduces Seg2Track-SAM2, a framework that
integrates pre-trained object detectors with SAM2 and a novel Seg2Track module
to address track initialization, track management, and reinforcement. The
proposed approach requires no fine-tuning and remains detector-agnostic.
Experimental results on KITTI MOT and KITTI MOTS benchmarks show that
Seg2Track-SAM2 achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, ranking fourth
overall in both car and pedestrian classes on KITTI MOTS, while establishing a
new benchmark in association accuracy (AssA). Furthermore, a sliding-window
memory strategy reduces memory usage by up to 75% with negligible performance
degradation, supporting deployment under resource constraints. These results
confirm that Seg2Track-SAM2 advances MOTS by combining robust zero-shot
tracking, enhanced identity preservation, and efficient memory utilization. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SA-UNetv2 is a lightweight retinal vessel segmentation model that improves on SA-UNet by adding cross-scale spatial attention to skip connections and using a weighted BCE+MCC loss to handle class imbalance, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retinal vessel segmentation is crucial for early disease diagnosis, but existing SA-UNet underuses attention in skip connections and fails to address severe foreground-background class imbalance issues.

Method: Proposed SA-UNetv2 injects cross-scale spatial attention into all skip connections to enhance multi-scale feature fusion, and adopts a weighted Binary Cross-Entropy plus Matthews Correlation Coefficient loss to improve robustness to class imbalance.

Result: On DRIVE and STARE datasets, SA-UNetv2 achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1.2MB memory, 0.26M parameters (less than 50% of SA-UNet), and 1 second CPU inference on 592x592x3 images.

Conclusion: SA-UNetv2 demonstrates strong efficiency and deployability in resource-constrained, CPU-only settings, making it suitable for practical medical applications.

Abstract: Retinal vessel segmentation is essential for early diagnosis of diseases such
as diabetic retinopathy, hypertension, and neurodegenerative disorders.
Although SA-UNet introduces spatial attention in the bottleneck, it underuses
attention in skip connections and does not address the severe
foreground-background imbalance. We propose SA-UNetv2, a lightweight model that
injects cross-scale spatial attention into all skip connections to strengthen
multi-scale feature fusion and adopts a weighted Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE)
plus Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) loss to improve robustness to class
imbalance. On the public DRIVE and STARE datasets, SA-UNetv2 achieves
state-of-the-art performance with only 1.2MB memory and 0.26M parameters (less
than 50% of SA-UNet), and 1 second CPU inference on 592 x 592 x 3 images,

Motivation: VideoQA based on LLMs struggles with the complexity of sports videos due to domain-specific knowledge gaps and the need for specialized reasoning.

Method: Proposes FineQuest framework with dual-mode reasoning: reactive for simple queries, deliberative for complex ones. Incorporates SSGraph - a multimodal sports knowledge scene graph spanning 9 sports with visual instances and domain terminology.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on new benchmarks (Gym-QA, Diving-QA) and existing SPORTU dataset, while maintaining strong general VideoQA capabilities.

Conclusion: FineQuest successfully bridges the knowledge gap for sports VideoQA through cognitive-inspired dual reasoning and domain-specific knowledge representation, demonstrating effective training-free sports video understanding.

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) based on Large Language Models (LLMs) has
shown potential in general video understanding but faces significant challenges
when applied to the inherently complex domain of sports videos. In this work,
we propose FineQuest, the first training-free framework that leverages
dual-mode reasoning inspired by cognitive science: i) Reactive Reasoning for
straightforward sports queries and ii) Deliberative Reasoning for more complex
ones. To bridge the knowledge gap between general-purpose models and
domain-specific sports understanding, FineQuest incorporates SSGraph, a
multimodal sports knowledge scene graph spanning nine sports, which encodes
both visual instances and domain-specific terminology to enhance reasoning
accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce two new sports VideoQA benchmarks, Gym-QA
and Diving-QA, derived from the FineGym and FineDiving datasets, enabling
diverse and comprehensive evaluation. FineQuest achieves state-of-the-art
performance on these benchmarks as well as the existing SPORTU dataset, while

*Ang Nan Gu,Michael Tsang,Hooman Vaseli,Purang Abolmaesumi,Teresa Tsang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework that uses neural network training dynamics to generate uncertainty-aware pseudo-labels for medical image diagnosis, addressing the problem of overconfident predictions from simplistic one-hot labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current computer-aided diagnosis systems use overly simplistic one-hot labels that ignore diagnostic uncertainty and inter-rater variability, leading to overconfident predictions especially with noisy or ambiguous medical images.

Method: Leverages neural network training dynamics to assess sample difficulty, aggregates and calibrates model predictions during training to generate uncertainty-aware pseudo-labels that reflect diagnostic ambiguity.

Result: Validated on echocardiography classification benchmark, demonstrating superior performance over specialized baselines in calibration, selective classification, and multi-view fusion.

Conclusion: The proposed uncertainty-aware label augmentation framework enhances uncertainty estimation and robustness in medical image diagnosis, is architecture-agnostic, and can be applied to any supervised learning pipeline.

Abstract: Computer-aided diagnosis systems must make critical decisions from medical
images that are often noisy, ambiguous, or conflicting, yet today's models are
trained on overly simplistic labels that ignore diagnostic uncertainty. One-hot
labels erase inter-rater variability and force models to make overconfident
predictions, especially when faced with incomplete or artifact-laden inputs. We
address this gap by introducing a novel framework that brings uncertainty back
into the label space. Our method leverages neural network training dynamics
(NNTD) to assess the inherent difficulty of each training sample. By
aggregating and calibrating model predictions during training, we generate
uncertainty-aware pseudo-labels that reflect the ambiguity encountered during
learning. This label augmentation approach is architecture-agnostic and can be
applied to any supervised learning pipeline to enhance uncertainty estimation
and robustness. We validate our approach on a challenging echocardiography
classification benchmark, demonstrating superior performance over specialized
baselines in calibration, selective classification, and multi-view fusion.

TL;DR: LFRA-Net is a lightweight retinal vessel segmentation network that achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational resources (0.17M parameters, 0.66MB memory, 10.50 GFLOPs) using focal modulation attention and region-aware attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retinal vessel segmentation is crucial for early disease diagnosis, but current deep learning models struggle with extracting tiny vessels and have high computational costs, making them unsuitable for resource-limited clinical settings.

Method: LFRA-Net incorporates focal modulation attention at the encoder-decoder bottleneck and region-aware attention in selective skip connections to enhance feature representation and regional focus by capturing both local and global dependencies efficiently.

Result: LFRA-Net outperformed state-of-the-art models on three datasets: DRIVE (Dice: 84.28%, Jaccard: 72.86%), STARE (Dice: 88.44%, Jaccard: 79.31%), and CHASE_DB (Dice: 85.50%, Jaccard: 74.70%) while maintaining extremely lightweight characteristics.

Conclusion: LFRA-Net provides an optimal balance between segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency, making it highly suitable for real-time clinical applications in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Retinal vessel segmentation is critical for the early diagnosis of
vision-threatening and systemic diseases, especially in real-world clinical
settings with limited computational resources. Although significant
improvements have been made in deep learning-based segmentation methods,
current models still face challenges in extracting tiny vessels and suffer from
high computational costs. In this study, we present LFRA-Net by incorporating
focal modulation attention at the encoder-decoder bottleneck and region-aware
attention in the selective skip connections. LFRA-Net is a lightweight network
optimized for precise and effective retinal vascular segmentation. It enhances
feature representation and regional focus by efficiently capturing local and
global dependencies. LFRA-Net outperformed many state-of-the-art models while
maintaining lightweight characteristics with only 0.17 million parameters, 0.66
MB memory size, and 10.50 GFLOPs. We validated it on three publicly available
datasets: DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE\_DB. It performed better in terms of Dice
score (84.28\%, 88.44\%, and 85.50\%) and Jaccard index (72.86\%, 79.31\%, and
74.70\%) on the DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE\_DB datasets, respectively. LFRA-Net
provides an ideal ratio between segmentation accuracy and computational cost
compared to existing deep learning methods, which makes it suitable for
real-time clinical applications in areas with limited resources. The code can

*Haiduo Huang,Fuwei Yang,Zhenhua Liu,Xuanwu Yin,Dong Li,Pengju Ren,Emad Barsoum*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecVLM accelerates vision-language models through speculative decoding with an elastic visual compressor and online-logit distillation, achieving 2.5-2.9x speedups while maintaining lossless decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct porting of speculative decoding to VLMs faces challenges due to visual token dominance in prefill stage, causing compute and memory inflation, especially with KV cache scaling with image resolution and video length.

Method: Introduces EagleVLM baseline (1.5-2.3x speedup) and SpecVLM with elastic visual compressor (pruning/pooling/convolution/resampler selection) plus online-logit distillation protocol using teacher logits and penultimate features with cross-entropy and Smooth L1 objective.

Result: Achieves 2.5-2.9x end-to-end speedups within 5 epochs across LLaVA and MMMU, consistent over resolutions and task difficulties while preserving target model's output distribution (lossless decoding).

Conclusion: SpecVLM provides practical acceleration for VLMs through adaptive visual compression and efficient online training, demonstrating training-time scaling effects that improve speculative efficiency without costly offline distillation.

Abstract: Speculative decoding is a powerful way to accelerate autoregressive large
language models (LLMs), but directly porting it to vision-language models
(VLMs) faces unique systems constraints: the prefill stage is dominated by
visual tokens whose count scales with image resolution and video length,
inflating both compute and memory, especially the key-value (KV) cache. We
study speculative decoding for VLMs and introduce SpecVLM, a practical system
that (1) establishes a strong EAGLE-2-style baseline, EagleVLM, delivering
1.5--2.3x end-to-end speedups over full autoregressive inference, and (2)
further accelerates VLM inference with an elastic visual compressor that
adaptively selects among pruning, pooling, convolution, and resampler
primitives to balance FLOPs/parameters and accuracy per input. To avoid costly
offline distillation corpora, we propose an online-logit distillation protocol
that trains the draft model with on-the-fly teacher logits and penultimate
features using a combined cross-entropy and Smooth L1 objective, eliminating
storage and preprocessing while remaining compute-efficient. This protocol
reveals a training-time scaling effect: longer online training monotonically
increases the draft model's average accepted length, improving speculative
efficiency. Empirically, SpecVLM achieves additional acceleration, culminating
in 2.5--2.9x end-to-end speedups within 5 epochs across LLaVA and MMMU,
consistently over resolutions and task difficulties, while preserving the
target model's output distribution (lossless decoding). Our code is available

*Liying Wang,Xiaoli Zhang,Chuanmin Jia,Siwei Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAFS is a unified network that jointly performs infrared-visible image fusion and semantic segmentation using a parallel structure with mutual promotion between tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods don't explore reciprocal promotion between pixel-wise image fusion and cross-modal feature fusion perception tasks from a macroscopic task-level perspective.

Method: Parallel structure with fusion and segmentation sub-networks, heterogeneous feature fusion strategy, multi-stage Transformer decoder, and dynamic factor for adaptive task weighting.

Result: Achieves competitive results compared with state-of-the-art methods in both image fusion and semantic segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed MAFS framework successfully demonstrates mutual enhancement between image fusion and semantic segmentation tasks through a unified multi-task approach.

Abstract: Infrared-visible image fusion methods aim at generating fused images with
good visual quality and also facilitate the performance of high-level tasks.
Indeed, existing semantic-driven methods have considered semantic information
injection for downstream applications. However, none of them investigates the
potential for reciprocal promotion between pixel-wise image fusion and
cross-modal feature fusion perception tasks from a macroscopic task-level
perspective. To address this limitation, we propose a unified network for image
fusion and semantic segmentation. MAFS is a parallel structure, containing a
fusion sub-network and a segmentation sub-network. On the one hand, We devise a
heterogeneous feature fusion strategy to enhance semantic-aware capabilities
for image fusion. On the other hand, by cascading the fusion sub-network and a
segmentation backbone, segmentation-related knowledge is transferred to promote
feature-level fusion-based segmentation. Within the framework, we design a
novel multi-stage Transformer decoder to aggregate fine-grained multi-scale
fused features efficiently. Additionally, a dynamic factor based on the max-min
fairness allocation principle is introduced to generate adaptive weights of two
tasks and guarantee smooth training in a multi-task manner. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive results compared
with state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

TL;DR: A scalable probabilistic verification framework for semantic segmentation networks that combines sampling-based reachability analysis with conformal inference to provide reliable safety guarantees while reducing conservatism in high-dimensional settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing probabilistic verification approaches struggle with the complexity and dimensionality of modern segmentation tasks, often producing overly conservative guarantees that limit practical utility in safety-critical domains like medical imaging and autonomous driving.

Method: Combines sampling-based reachability analysis with conformal inference, introducing novel strategies to reduce conservatism in high-dimensional settings while maintaining rigorous provable guarantees.

Result: Empirical evaluation on large-scale segmentation models across multiple datasets (CamVid, OCTA-500, Lung Segmentation, Cityscapes) shows reliable safety guarantees with substantially tighter bounds compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides architecture-agnostic, scalable probabilistic verification for semantic segmentation networks, offering practical safety guarantees with reduced conservatism, accompanied by an open-source implementation toolbox.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation networks (SSNs) play a critical role in domains such as
medical imaging, autonomous driving, and environmental monitoring, where safety
hinges on reliable model behavior under uncertainty. Yet, existing
probabilistic verification approaches struggle to scale with the complexity and
dimensionality of modern segmentation tasks, often yielding guarantees that are
too conservative to be practical. We introduce a probabilistic verification
framework that is both architecture-agnostic and scalable to high-dimensional
outputs. Our approach combines sampling-based reachability analysis with
conformal inference (CI) to deliver provable guarantees while avoiding the
excessive conservatism of prior methods. To counteract CI's limitations in
high-dimensional settings, we propose novel strategies that reduce conservatism
without compromising rigor. Empirical evaluation on large-scale segmentation
models across CamVid, OCTA-500, Lung Segmentation, and Cityscapes demonstrates
that our method provides reliable safety guarantees while substantially
tightening bounds compared to SOTA. We also provide a toolbox implementing this
technique, available on Github.

TL;DR: Densely aligning images with synthetic VLM-generated descriptions improves zero-shot open-vocabulary segmentation performance and data efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative VLMs lack spatially dense vision-language alignment, while existing dense alignment methods need better semantic understanding from synthetic captions.

Method: Using inexpensive, scalable synthetic descriptions generated by VLMs for dense image-text alignment in representation learning.

Result: Outperforms prior work on zero-shot open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks while being more data-efficient.

Conclusion: Synthetic VLM-generated captions provide excellent high-level semantic understanding for dense vision-language alignment tasks.

Abstract: Generative vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit strong high-level image
understanding but lack spatially dense alignment between vision and language
modalities, as our findings indicate. Orthogonal to advancements in generative
VLMs, another line of research has focused on representation learning for
vision-language alignment, targeting zero-shot inference for dense tasks like
segmentation. In this work, we bridge these two directions by densely aligning
images with synthetic descriptions generated by VLMs. Synthetic captions are
inexpensive, scalable, and easy to generate, making them an excellent source of
high-level semantic understanding for dense alignment methods. Empirically, our
approach outperforms prior work on standard zero-shot open-vocabulary
segmentation benchmarks/datasets, while also being more data-efficient.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDI-GS reduces 3D Gaussian count by 50% while maintaining rendering quality through segmentation-driven initialization that preserves structurally significant regions only.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS methods struggle with sparse-view synthesis due to SfM limitations in sparse settings and MVS-based approaches generating excessive Gaussians with high memory costs.

Method: Leverages region-based segmentation to identify structurally significant regions, enabling selective downsampling of dense point clouds while preserving scene fidelity.

Result: Reduces Gaussian count by up to 50%, achieves comparable/superior PSNR and SSIM with marginal LPIPS degradation, enables faster training and lower memory footprint.

Conclusion: Advances practicality of 3DGS for constrained-view scenarios through efficient segmentation-driven initialization that maintains quality while reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Sparse-view synthesis remains a challenging problem due to the difficulty of
recovering accurate geometry and appearance from limited observations. While
recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled real-time
rendering with competitive quality, existing pipelines often rely on
Structure-from-Motion (SfM) for camera pose estimation, an approach that
struggles in genuinely sparse-view settings. Moreover, several SfM-free methods
replace SfM with multi-view stereo (MVS) models, but generate massive numbers
of 3D Gaussians by back-projecting every pixel into 3D space, leading to high
memory costs. We propose Segmentation-Driven Initialization for Gaussian
Splatting (SDI-GS), a method that mitigates inefficiency by leveraging
region-based segmentation to identify and retain only structurally significant
regions. This enables selective downsampling of the dense point cloud,
preserving scene fidelity while substantially reducing Gaussian count.
Experiments across diverse benchmarks show that SDI-GS reduces Gaussian count
by up to 50% and achieves comparable or superior rendering quality in PSNR and
SSIM, with only marginal degradation in LPIPS. It further enables faster
training and lower memory footprint, advancing the practicality of 3DGS for
constrained-view scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision language models for video QA rely on shallow correlations and have weak temporal grounding and limited interpretability.

Method: SG-VLM is a modular framework that combines frozen VLMs with symbolic scene graph grounding through prompting and visual localization techniques.

Result: The approach improves causal and temporal reasoning across three benchmarks (NExT-QA, iVQA, ActivityNet-QA) and outperforms prior baselines, though gains over strong VLMs are limited.

Conclusion: Symbolic scene graphs show promise for VQA but have current limitations, providing guidance for future hybrid VLM-symbolic approaches in video understanding.

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VQA) requires models to reason over spatial,
temporal, and causal cues in videos. Recent vision language models (VLMs)
achieve strong results but often rely on shallow correlations, leading to weak
temporal grounding and limited interpretability. We study symbolic scene graphs
(SGs) as intermediate grounding signals for VQA. SGs provide structured
object-relation representations that complement VLMs holistic reasoning. We
introduce SG-VLM, a modular framework that integrates frozen VLMs with scene
graph grounding via prompting and visual localization. Across three benchmarks
(NExT-QA, iVQA, ActivityNet-QA) and multiple VLMs (QwenVL, InternVL), SG-VLM
improves causal and temporal reasoning and outperforms prior baselines, though
gains over strong VLMs are limited. These findings highlight both the promise

Abstract: Recent advancements in large video models (LVMs) have significantly enhance

hallucinations, producing content that conflicts with input videos. To address
this issue, we propose Dr.V, a hierarchical framework covering perceptive,

TL;DR: MOT approaches outperform traditional MAT tools for long-term pig tracking, showing potential to improve livestock monitoring accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precision livestock farming needs better monitoring tools. Current MAT tools underperform compared to state-of-the-art MOT methods, leading to inaccurate behavior analysis and health monitoring.

Method: Benchmarked both MAT (DeepLabCut, idTracker) and MOT (ByteTrack, DeepSORT, cross-input consistency, Track-Anything, PromptTrack) approaches on a 10-minute pig tracking dataset.

Result: MOT approaches overall outperformed traditional MAT tools, even for long-term tracking scenarios.

Conclusion: Recent MOT techniques have strong potential to enhance accuracy and reliability of automated livestock tracking systems.

Abstract: Precision livestock farming requires advanced monitoring tools to meet the
increasing management needs of the industry. Computer vision systems capable of
long-term multi-animal tracking (MAT) are essential for continuous behavioral
monitoring in livestock production. MAT, a specialized subset of multi-object
tracking (MOT), shares many challenges with MOT, but also faces domain-specific
issues including frequent animal occlusion, highly similar appearances among
animals, erratic motion patterns, and a wide range of behavior types.
  While some existing MAT tools are user-friendly and widely adopted, they
often underperform compared to state-of-the-art MOT methods, which can result
in inaccurate downstream tasks such as behavior analysis, health state
estimation, and related applications. In this study, we benchmarked both MAT
and MOT approaches for long-term tracking of pigs. We compared tools such as
DeepLabCut and idTracker with MOT-based methods including ByteTrack, DeepSORT,
cross-input consistency, and newer approaches like Track-Anything and
PromptTrack.
  All methods were evaluated on a 10-minute pig tracking dataset. Our results
demonstrate that, overall, MOT approaches outperform traditional MAT tools,
even for long-term tracking scenarios. These findings highlight the potential
of recent MOT techniques to enhance the accuracy and reliability of automated
livestock tracking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Poetry invites multiple interpretations based on readers' emotions and backgrounds, so there's a need to generate and modify images for poems in a zero-shot setting to accommodate diverse personal requirements.

Method: Introduces Weighted Prompt Manipulation (WPM) technique that systematically modifies attention weights and text embeddings within diffusion models, combined with large language models (LLMs) like GPT and poetry datasets.

Result: WPM enhances or suppresses specific word influences, leading to semantically richer and more contextually accurate visualizations of poetic language.

Conclusion: First attempt at integrating weighted prompt manipulation for enhancing imagery in poetic language, providing a comprehensive methodology for improved literary image generation.

Abstract: Poetry is an expressive form of art that invites multiple interpretations, as
readers often bring their own emotions, experiences, and cultural backgrounds
into their understanding of a poem. Recognizing this, we aim to generate images
for poems and improve these images in a zero-shot setting, enabling audiences
to modify images as per their requirements. To achieve this, we introduce a
novel Weighted Prompt Manipulation (WPM) technique, which systematically
modifies attention weights and text embeddings within diffusion models. By
dynamically adjusting the importance of specific words, WPM enhances or
suppresses their influence in the final generated image, leading to
semantically richer and more contextually accurate visualizations. Our approach
exploits diffusion models and large language models (LLMs) such as GPT in
conjunction with existing poetry datasets, ensuring a comprehensive and
structured methodology for improved image generation in the literary domain. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at integrating weighted

### [110] [SAM-TTT: Segment Anything Model via Reverse Parameter Configuration and Test-Time Training for Camouflaged Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11884)
*Zhenni Yu,Li Zhao,Guobao Xiao,Xiaoqin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM-TTT enhances Segment Anything Model for Camouflaged Object Detection by suppressing adverse parameters and reinforcing advantageous ones through reverse parameter configuration and test-time training layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SAM-based COD models focus on enhancing favorable features but neglect adverse parameters that impair semantic understanding in downstream tasks.

Method: Proposes Reverse SAM Parameter Configuration Module to mitigate adverse parameters in train-free manner, and T-Visioner Module with Test-Time Training layers to strengthen advantageous parameters.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on various COD benchmarks, significantly improving SAM's semantic understanding in COD tasks.

Conclusion: SAM-TTT sets new benchmark in COD by simultaneously suppressing adverse parameters while reinforcing advantageous ones through innovative parameter configuration and test-time training integration.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new Segment Anything Model (SAM) that leverages
reverse parameter configuration and test-time training to enhance its
performance on Camouflaged Object Detection (COD), named SAM-TTT. While most
existing SAM-based COD models primarily focus on enhancing SAM by extracting
favorable features and amplifying its advantageous parameters, a crucial gap is
identified: insufficient attention to adverse parameters that impair SAM's
semantic understanding in downstream tasks. To tackle this issue, the Reverse
SAM Parameter Configuration Module is proposed to effectively mitigate the
influence of adverse parameters in a train-free manner by configuring SAM's
parameters. Building on this foundation, the T-Visioner Module is unveiled to
strengthen advantageous parameters by integrating Test-Time Training layers,
originally developed for language tasks, into vision tasks. Test-Time Training
layers represent a new class of sequence modeling layers characterized by
linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. By integrating two modules,
SAM-TTT simultaneously suppresses adverse parameters while reinforcing
advantageous ones, significantly improving SAM's semantic understanding in COD
task. Our experimental results on various COD benchmarks demonstrate that the
proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, setting a new
benchmark in the field. The code will be available at

*Francis Xiatian Zhang,Emile Mackute,Mohammadreza Kasaei,Kevin Dhaliwal,Robert Thomson,Mohsen Khadem*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Brea-Depth integrates airway-specific geometric priors into foundation models for more accurate bronchoscopic depth estimation, addressing overfitting to local textures and improving global airway structure awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular depth estimation in bronchoscopy can improve navigation accuracy and intervention safety, but current depth foundation models lack anatomical awareness and overfit to local textures rather than capturing global airway structure, especially under ambiguous depth cues and poor lighting.

Method: Proposes Brea-Depth framework with depth-aware CycleGAN to translate between real bronchoscopic images and airway geometries from anatomical data, plus an airway structure awareness loss to enforce depth consistency within airway lumen while preserving smooth transitions.

Result: Validated on ex vivo human lung dataset and open bronchoscopic dataset, outperforms existing methods in anatomical depth preservation and yields more robust, accurate 3D airway reconstructions.

Conclusion: Brea-Depth enhances model generalization by incorporating anatomical priors and introduces a new Airway Depth Structure Evaluation metric for structural consistency assessment, demonstrating superior performance in bronchoscopic depth estimation.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation in bronchoscopy can significantly improve
real-time navigation accuracy and enhance the safety of interventions in
complex, branching airways. Recent advances in depth foundation models have
shown promise for endoscopic scenarios, yet these models often lack anatomical
awareness in bronchoscopy, overfitting to local textures rather than capturing
the global airway structure, particularly under ambiguous depth cues and poor
lighting. To address this, we propose Brea-Depth, a novel framework that
integrates airway-specific geometric priors into foundation model adaptation
for bronchoscopic depth estimation. Our method introduces a depth-aware
CycleGAN, refining the translation between real bronchoscopic images and airway
geometries from anatomical data, effectively bridging the domain gap. In
addition, we introduce an airway structure awareness loss to enforce depth
consistency within the airway lumen while preserving smooth transitions and
structural integrity. By incorporating anatomical priors, Brea-Depth enhances
model generalization and yields more robust, accurate 3D airway
reconstructions. To assess anatomical realism, we introduce Airway Depth
Structure Evaluation, a new metric for structural consistency. We validate
BREA-Depth on a collected ex vivo human lung dataset and an open bronchoscopic
dataset, where it outperforms existing methods in anatomical depth
preservation.

### [112] [Logit Mixture Outlier Exposure for Fine-grained Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11892)
*Akito Shinohara,Kohei Fukuda,Hiroaki Aizawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes logit-space linear interpolation mixing in-distribution and out-of-distribution data to improve OOD detection performance, particularly for data near decision boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OOD detection methods like Outlier Exposure struggle with learning effective class relationships and clearly distinguishing in-distribution from out-of-distribution data, especially near decision boundaries.

Method: Linear interpolation technique in logit space that mixes in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, with consistency enforcement between logit-space and input-space mixing results.

Result: Reduces abrupt fluctuations in model outputs near decision boundaries, creates smoother and more reliable separation between in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.

Conclusion: Logit-space mixing technique effectively improves OOD detection performance, particularly for challenging cases where out-of-distribution data lies close to in-distribution data.

Abstract: The ability to detect out-of-distribution data is essential not only for
ensuring robustness against unknown or unexpected input data but also for
improving the generalization performance of the model. Among various
out-of-distribution detection methods, Outlier Exposure and Mixture Outlier
Exposure are promising approaches that enhance out-of-distribution detection
performance by exposing the outlier data during training. However, even with
these sophisticated techniques, it remains challenging for models to learn the
relationships between classes effectively and to distinguish data sampling from
in-distribution and out-of-distribution clearly. Therefore, we focus on the
logit space, where the properties between class-wise distributions are
distinctly separated from those in the input or feature spaces. Specifically,
we propose a linear interpolation technique in the logit space that mixes
in-distribution and out-of-distribution data to facilitate smoothing logits
between classes and improve the out-of-distribution detection performance,
particularly for out-of-distribution data that lie close to the in-distribution
data. Additionally, we enforce consistency between the logits obtained through
mixing in the logit space and those generated via mixing in the input space.
Our experiments demonstrate that our logit-space mixing technique reduces the
abrupt fluctuations in the model outputs near the decision boundaries,
resulting in smoother and more reliable separation between in-distribution and
out-of-distribution data. Furthermore, we evaluate the effectiveness of the
proposed method on a fine-grained out-of-distribution detection task.

*Marian Renz,Felix Igelbrink,Martin Atzmueller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel heterogeneous graph model for incremental 3D semantic scene graph prediction that integrates multi-modal information like prior observations and semantic embeddings into message-passing, without requiring complete scene reconstructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DSSG methods rely mainly on sensor data and assume complete scene reconstructions, limiting their applicability in real-world incremental settings where partial information is available.

Method: Heterogeneous graph model with multiple layers that flexibly incorporates global and local scene representations, integrating multi-modal information (semantic embeddings like CLIP, prior observations) directly into the message-passing process.

Result: Evaluation on 3DSSG dataset shows that GNNs enriched with multi-modal information offer scalable and generalizable solutions for complex real-world environments.

Conclusion: The approach provides a more practical solution for incremental 3D semantic scene graph prediction in real-world settings by leveraging multi-modal information without requiring specialized modules or full scene reconstructions.

Abstract: 3D semantic scene graphs (3DSSG) provide compact structured representations
of environments by explicitly modeling objects, attributes, and relationships.
While 3DSSGs have shown promise in robotics and embodied AI, many existing
methods rely mainly on sensor data, not integrating further information from
semantically rich environments. Additionally, most methods assume access to
complete scene reconstructions, limiting their applicability in real-world,
incremental settings. This paper introduces a novel heterogeneous graph model
for incremental 3DSSG prediction that integrates additional, multi-modal
information, such as prior observations, directly into the message-passing
process. Utilizing multiple layers, the model flexibly incorporates global and
local scene representations without requiring specialized modules or full scene
reconstructions. We evaluate our approach on the 3DSSG dataset, showing that
GNNs enriched with multi-modal information such as semantic embeddings (e.g.,
CLIP) and prior observations offer a scalable and generalizable solution for
complex, real-world environments. The full source code of the presented
architecture will be made available at

*Zilin Li,Weiwei Xu,Xuanqi Zhao,Yiran Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeuroGaze-Distill uses brain-informed priors from EEG data to improve facial emotion recognition model generalization via cross-modal distillation with valence/arousal prototypes and depression-inspired geometric regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FER models trained only on pixel data fail to generalize across datasets because facial appearance is an indirect and biased proxy for underlying affect. Brain signals provide more direct affect information.

Method: Cross-modal distillation framework that transfers EEG-informed priors into image-only FER student using static V/A prototypes and depression-inspired geometric prior (D-Geo). Teacher trained on EEG topographic maps produces 5x5 V/A prototype grid, student trained with Proto-KD and D-Geo regularizers.

Result: Method improves robustness without architectural complexity, shows consistent gains from prototypes and D-Geo, favors 5x5 grid over denser grids for stability. Evaluated on within-domain and cross-dataset protocols with improved performance.

Conclusion: Simple, deployable framework that enhances FER generalization by incorporating brain-informed affective priors through distillation, requiring no EEG signals at deployment while improving cross-dataset robustness.

Abstract: Facial emotion recognition (FER) models trained only on pixels often fail to
generalize across datasets because facial appearance is an indirect and biased
proxy for underlying affect. We present NeuroGaze-Distill, a cross-modal
distillation framework that transfers brain-informed priors into an image-only
FER student via static Valence/Arousal (V/A) prototypes and a
depression-inspired geometric prior (D-Geo). A teacher trained on EEG
topographic maps from DREAMER (with MAHNOB-HCI as unlabeled support) produces a
consolidated 5x5 V/A prototype grid that is frozen and reused; no EEG-face
pairing and no non-visual signals at deployment are required. The student
(ResNet-18/50) is trained on FERPlus with conventional CE/KD and two
lightweight regularizers: (i) Proto-KD (cosine) aligns student features to the
static prototypes; (ii) D-Geo softly shapes the embedding geometry in line with
affective findings often reported in depression research (e.g., anhedonia-like
contraction in high-valence regions). We evaluate both within-domain (FERPlus
validation) and cross-dataset protocols (AffectNet-mini; optional CK+),
reporting standard 8-way scores alongside present-only Macro-F1 and balanced
accuracy to fairly handle label-set mismatch. Ablations attribute consistent
gains to prototypes and D-Geo, and favor 5x5 over denser grids for stability.
The method is simple, deployable, and improves robustness without architectural
complexity.

*Bo Cao,Fan Yu,Mengmeng Feng,SenHao Zhang,Xin Meng,Yue Zhang,Zhen Qian,Jie Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VMD method uses variation inference and multimodal knowledge distillation to leverage radiologists' domain knowledge from limited annotations and reports for automated carotid plaque vulnerability diagnosis from 3D MRI images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diagnosing carotid plaque vulnerability from 3D MRI is challenging for both radiologists and conventional 3D vision networks. Clinical practice uses multimodal approaches combining various imaging modalities and domain expertise, suggesting the need for multimodal diagnostic networks.

Method: Variation inference and Multimodal knowledge Distillation (VMD) strategy that harnesses cross-modality prior knowledge from limited image annotations and radiology reports to enhance diagnostic accuracy for unannotated 3D MRI images.

Result: Conducted in-depth experiments on in-house dataset and verified the effectiveness of the proposed VMD strategy.

Conclusion: The VMD method provides an effective approach to leverage radiologists' domain knowledge for automated diagnosis of carotid plaque vulnerability, demonstrating improved performance through multimodal learning.

Abstract: Multimodal learning has attracted much attention in recent years due to its
ability to effectively utilize data features from a variety of different
modalities. Diagnosing the vulnerability of atherosclerotic plaques directly
from carotid 3D MRI images is relatively challenging for both radiologists and
conventional 3D vision networks. In clinical practice, radiologists assess
patient conditions using a multimodal approach that incorporates various
imaging modalities and domain-specific expertise, paving the way for the
creation of multimodal diagnostic networks. In this paper, we have developed an
effective strategy to leverage radiologists' domain knowledge to automate the
diagnosis of carotid plaque vulnerability through Variation inference and
Multimodal knowledge Distillation (VMD). This method excels in harnessing
cross-modality prior knowledge from limited image annotations and radiology
reports within training data, thereby enhancing the diagnostic network's
accuracy for unannotated 3D MRI images. We conducted in-depth experiments on
the dataset collected in-house and verified the effectiveness of the VMD
strategy we proposed.

*Xue Zhang,Bingshuo Hu,Gene Cheung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach to image interpolation by initializing network parameters based on a known interpolator mapped to a graph filter, then learning perturbation matrices from data to enhance performance via unrolled Douglas-Rachford iterations, achieving state-of-the-art results with significantly fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional DNNs initialize parameters randomly and optimize via SGD, which risks poor local minima. The authors aim to develop a more reliable initialization and optimization method for image interpolation tasks.

Method: Map a pseudo-linear interpolator to a directed graph filter solution, initialize graph adjacency matrix from known interpolator, learn perturbation matrices from data, and implement restoration via unrolled Douglas-Rachford iterations into an interpretable neural net.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art image interpolation results while drastically reducing the number of network parameters compared to conventional approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an effective alternative to random initialization and SGD optimization, offering better performance with fewer parameters through graph-based initialization and learned perturbations.

Abstract: Conventional deep neural nets (DNNs) initialize network parameters at random
and then optimize each one via stochastic gradient descent (SGD), resulting in
substantial risk of poor-performing local minima.Focusing on the image
interpolation problem and leveraging a recent theorem that maps a
(pseudo-)linear interpolator {\Theta} to a directed graph filter that is a
solution to a MAP problem regularized with a graph shift variation (GSV) prior,
we first initialize a directed graph adjacency matrix A based on a known
interpolator {\Theta}, establishing a baseline performance.Then, towards
further gain, we learn perturbation matrices P and P(2) from data to augment A,
whose restoration effects are implemented via Douglas-Rachford (DR) iterations,
which we unroll into a lightweight interpretable neural net.Experimental
results demonstrate state-of-the-art image interpolation results, while
drastically reducing network parameters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sphere-GAN is a new saliency detection model for 360° videos that uses a Generative Adversarial Network with spherical convolutions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of immersive applications requires new approaches for processing 360° content, but few saliency estimation algorithms exist for 360° videos compared to 2D content.

Method: Leverages a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with spherical convolutions specifically designed for 360° video saliency detection.

Result: Extensive experiments on a public 360° video saliency dataset show Sphere-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art models in accurately predicting saliency maps.

Conclusion: Sphere-GAN provides an effective solution for 360° video saliency estimation, addressing the gap in existing methods for immersive content processing.

Abstract: The recent success of immersive applications is pushing the research
community to define new approaches to process 360{\deg} images and videos and
optimize their transmission. Among these, saliency estimation provides a
powerful tool that can be used to identify visually relevant areas and,
consequently, adapt processing algorithms. Although saliency estimation has
been widely investigated for 2D content, very few algorithms have been proposed
for 360{\deg} saliency estimation. Towards this goal, we introduce Sphere-GAN,
a saliency detection model for 360{\deg} videos that leverages a Generative
Adversarial Network with spherical convolutions. Extensive experiments were
conducted using a public 360{\deg} video saliency dataset, and the results
demonstrate that Sphere-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art models in accurately
predicting saliency maps.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed CLAIRE - a dual encoder architecture with cross-modality attention fusion for land cover classification using optical and SAR imagery, addressing class imbalance with RIFT loss function and adding interpretability through SLM-generated explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Land cover classification from satellite imagery faces challenges due to complex natural landscapes, visual similarity between classes, and significant class imbalance in datasets.

Method: Dual encoder architecture extracts modality-specific features from optical and SAR imagery, fused using cross-modality attention module (CLAIRE). Uses hybrid RIFT loss (Weighted Focal + Tversky) to handle class imbalance. Includes SLM-generated metric-driven reasoning for interpretability.

Result: Achieved mIoU of 56.02% and OA of 84.56% on WHU-OPT-SAR; mIoU 59.89% and OA 73.92% on OpenEarthMap-SAR; mIoU 86.86% and OA 94.58% on PIE-RGB-SAR under cloud-obstructed conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses class imbalance and modality fusion challenges in land cover classification while providing interpretable explanations through SLM-generated reasoning.

Abstract: Accurate land cover classification from satellite imagery is crucial in
environmental monitoring and sustainable resource management. However, it
remains challenging due to the complexity of natural landscapes, the visual
similarity between classes, and the significant class imbalance in the
available datasets. To address these issues, we propose a dual encoder
architecture that independently extracts modality-specific features from
optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, which are then fused using
a cross-modality attention-fusion module named Cross-modality Land cover
segmentation with Attention and Imbalance-aware Reasoning-Enhanced Explanations
(CLAIRE). This fusion mechanism highlights complementary spatial and textural
features, enabling the network to better capture detailed and diverse land
cover patterns. We incorporate a hybrid loss function that utilizes Weighted
Focal Loss and Tversky Loss named RIFT (Rare-Instance Focal-Tversky) to address
class imbalance and improve segmentation performance across underrepresented
categories. Our model achieves competitive performance across multiple
benchmarks: a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 56.02% and Overall
Accuracy (OA) of 84.56% on the WHU-OPT-SAR dataset; strong generalization with
a mIoU of 59.89% and OA of 73.92% on the OpenEarthMap-SAR dataset; and
remarkable robustness under cloud-obstructed conditions, achieving an mIoU of
86.86% and OA of 94.58% on the PIE-RGB-SAR dataset. Additionally, we introduce
a metric-driven reasoning module generated by a Small Language Model (Phi-3),
which generates expert-level, sample-specific justifications for model
predictions, thereby enhancing transparency and interpretability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiDARCrafter is a unified framework that converts free-form language into editable 4D LiDAR sequences using scene graphs and diffusion models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in fidelity, controllability, and temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR generation remains underexplored despite its importance for accurate 3D perception, with challenges in controllability, temporal stability, and evaluation for 4D LiDAR data.

Method: Parses instructions into ego-centric scene graphs, uses tri-branch diffusion model for object layouts/trajectories/shapes, range-image diffusion for initial scan, and autoregressive module for temporal coherence. Supports object-level editing.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art fidelity, controllability, and temporal consistency on nuScenes dataset. Provides EvalSuite benchmark for comprehensive evaluation.

Conclusion: Offers a foundation for LiDAR-based simulation and data augmentation with superior performance in generating controllable and temporally coherent 4D LiDAR sequences from language input.

Abstract: While generative world models have advanced video and occupancy-based data
synthesis, LiDAR generation remains underexplored despite its importance for
accurate 3D perception. Extending generation to 4D LiDAR data introduces
challenges in controllability, temporal stability, and evaluation. We present
LiDARCrafter, a unified framework that converts free-form language into
editable LiDAR sequences. Instructions are parsed into ego-centric scene
graphs, which a tri-branch diffusion model transforms into object layouts,
trajectories, and shapes. A range-image diffusion model generates the initial
scan, and an autoregressive module extends it into a temporally coherent
sequence. The explicit layout design further supports object-level editing,
such as insertion or relocation. To enable fair assessment, we provide
EvalSuite, a benchmark spanning scene-, object-, and sequence-level metrics. On
nuScenes, LiDARCrafter achieves state-of-the-art fidelity, controllability, and
temporal consistency, offering a foundation for LiDAR-based simulation and data
augmentation.

*Wenyan Li,Raphael Tang,Chengzu Li,Caiqi Zhang,Ivan Vulić,Anders Søgaard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-language models suffer from significant information loss when projecting visual embeddings through connector components, with 40-60% distortion in nearest neighbor relationships and measurable degradation in retrieval performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the under-explored information loss that occurs when visual inputs are projected into language model embedding space through connector components in vision-language models.

Method: Two approaches: 1) Analyzing k-nearest neighbor relationships between image representations before/after projection to evaluate semantic preservation; 2) Reconstructing visual embeddings from projected representations to measure patch-level information loss.

Result: Connectors substantially distort local geometry of visual representations (40-60% divergence in k-nearest neighbors), correlating with retrieval performance degradation. Patch-level reconstruction identifies areas of high loss that predict model struggles in visually grounded QA tasks.

Conclusion: The projection step in VLMs causes significant information loss that impacts model capabilities, and patch-level analysis provides interpretable insights for understanding model behavior and failure cases.

Abstract: Vision--language models (VLMs) often process visual inputs through a
pretrained vision encoder, followed by a projection into the language model's
embedding space via a connector component. While crucial for modality fusion,
the potential information loss induced by this projection step and its direct
impact on model capabilities remain understudied. We introduce two
complementary approaches to examine and quantify this loss by analyzing the
latent representation space. First, we evaluate semantic information
preservation by analyzing changes in k-nearest neighbor relationships between
image representations, before and after projection. Second, we directly measure
information loss by reconstructing visual embeddings from the projected
representation, localizing loss at an image patch level. Experiments reveal
that connectors substantially distort the local geometry of visual
representations, with k-nearest neighbors diverging by 40--60\%
post-projection, correlating with degradation in retrieval performance. The
patch-level embedding reconstruction provides interpretable insights for model
behavior on visually grounded question-answering tasks, finding that areas of
high information loss reliably predict instances where models struggle.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCORE is a novel framework for robust concept removal in diffusion models that formulates erasure as an adversarial independence problem, providing theoretical guarantees and outperforming state-of-the-art methods by up to 12.5% in erasure efficacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models pose increasing risks in privacy, fairness, and security, creating a growing demand to erase sensitive or harmful concepts (NSFW content, private individuals, artistic styles) while preserving overall generative capabilities.

Method: SCORE minimizes mutual information between target concepts and generated outputs through adversarial optimization, trajectory consistency, and saliency-driven fine-tuning, providing formal proofs of convergence and upper bounds on residual concept leakage.

Result: SCORE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods (EraseAnything, ANT, MACE, ESD, UCE) across four benchmarks: object erasure, NSFW removal, celebrity face suppression, and artistic style unlearning, achieving up to 12.5% higher erasure efficacy while maintaining comparable or superior image quality.

Conclusion: SCORE sets a new standard for secure and robust concept erasure in diffusion models by integrating adversarial optimization with theoretical guarantees, addressing critical privacy and security concerns while preserving model utility.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved unprecedented success in image generation but
pose increasing risks in terms of privacy, fairness, and security. A growing
demand exists to \emph{erase} sensitive or harmful concepts (e.g., NSFW
content, private individuals, artistic styles) from these models while
preserving their overall generative capabilities. We introduce \textbf{SCORE}
(Secure and Concept-Oriented Robust Erasure), a novel framework for robust
concept removal in diffusion models. SCORE formulates concept erasure as an
\emph{adversarial independence} problem, theoretically guaranteeing that the
model's outputs become statistically independent of the erased concept. Unlike
prior heuristic methods, SCORE minimizes the mutual information between a
target concept and generated outputs, yielding provable erasure guarantees. We
provide formal proofs establishing convergence properties and derive upper
bounds on residual concept leakage. Empirically, we evaluate SCORE on Stable
Diffusion and FLUX across four challenging benchmarks: object erasure, NSFW
removal, celebrity face suppression, and artistic style unlearning. SCORE
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods including EraseAnything, ANT,
MACE, ESD, and UCE, achieving up to \textbf{12.5\%} higher erasure efficacy
while maintaining comparable or superior image quality. By integrating
adversarial optimization, trajectory consistency, and saliency-driven
fine-tuning, SCORE sets a new standard for secure and robust concept erasure in
diffusion models.

*Zilong Zhang,Chujie Qin,Chunle Guo,Yong Zhang,Chao Xue,Ming-Ming Cheng,Chongyi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAM++ is a two-stage framework for all-in-one image restoration that combines semantic understanding with texture generation to address limitations of degradation-oriented methods in extreme scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing degradation-oriented methods struggle with extreme scenarios where degradations are strongly coupled with image structures, leading to unbalanced performance across tasks, overfitting to seen degradations, and weak generalization to unseen ones.

Method: Three key designs: 1) Adaptive Semantic-Aware Mask (AdaSAM) for pretraining with pixel-level masks on semantically rich regions, 2) Mask Attribute Conductance (MAC) for selective fine-tuning to bridge integrity gaps, and 3) Robust Feature Regularization (RFR) using DINOv2's representations for semantically coherent restoration.

Result: RAM++ achieves robust, well-balanced, and state-of-the-art performance across seen, unseen, extreme, and mixed degradations.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates high-level semantic understanding with low-level texture generation for content-oriented robust image restoration, overcoming limitations of previous approaches.

Abstract: This work presents Robust Representation Learning via Adaptive Mask (RAM++),
a two-stage framework for all-in-one image restoration. RAM++ integrates
high-level semantic understanding with low-level texture generation to achieve
content-oriented robust restoration. It addresses the limitations of existing
degradation-oriented methods in extreme scenarios (e.g., degradations strongly
coupled with image structures). RAM++ also mitigates common challenges such as
unbalanced performance across tasks, overfitting to seen degradations, and weak
generalization to unseen ones through three key designs: 1) Adaptive
Semantic-Aware Mask (AdaSAM): a pretraining strategy that applies pixel-level
masks to semantically rich and textured regions. This design enables the
network to learn both generative priors and image content priors from various
degradations. 2) Mask Attribute Conductance (MAC): a selective fine-tuning
strategy that adjusts the layers with higher contributions to bridge the
integrity gap between masked pretraining and full-image fine-tuning while
retaining learned priors. 3) Robust Feature Regularization (RFR): a strategy
that leverages DINOv2's semantically consistent and degradation-invariant
representations, together with efficient feature fusion, to achieve faithful
and semantically coherent restoration. With these designs, RAM++ achieves
robust, well-balanced, and state-of-the-art performance across seen, unseen,
extreme, and mixed degradations. Our code and model will be released at

TL;DR: The paper introduces OVRSISBench, a standardized benchmark for open-vocabulary remote sensing image segmentation, and proposes RSKT-Seg, a novel framework that outperforms existing methods by +3.8 mIoU and +5.9 mACC with 2x faster inference.


<details>

Result: RSKT-Seg consistently outperforms strong OVS baselines by +3.8 mIoU and +5.9 mACC while achieving 2x faster inference through efficient aggregation.

Conclusion: The proposed RSKT-Seg framework effectively addresses the domain gap in remote sensing segmentation and sets a new state-of-the-art performance on the established OVRSISBench benchmark.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (OVRSIS), an emerging task
that adapts Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) to the remote sensing (RS)
domain, remains underexplored due to the absence of a unified evaluation
benchmark and the domain gap between natural and RS images. To bridge these
gaps, we first establish a standardized OVRSIS benchmark (\textbf{OVRSISBench})
based on widely-used RS segmentation datasets, enabling consistent evaluation
across methods. Using this benchmark, we comprehensively evaluate several
representative OVS/OVRSIS models and reveal their limitations when directly
applied to remote sensing scenarios. Building on these insights, we propose
\textbf{RSKT-Seg}, a novel open-vocabulary segmentation framework tailored for
remote sensing. RSKT-Seg integrates three key components: (1) a
Multi-Directional Cost Map Aggregation (RS-CMA) module that captures
rotation-invariant visual cues by computing vision-language cosine similarities
across multiple directions; (2) an Efficient Cost Map Fusion (RS-Fusion)
transformer, which jointly models spatial and semantic dependencies with a
lightweight dimensionality reduction strategy; and (3) a Remote Sensing
Knowledge Transfer (RS-Transfer) module that injects pre-trained knowledge and
facilitates domain adaptation via enhanced upsampling. Extensive experiments on
the benchmark show that RSKT-Seg consistently outperforms strong OVS baselines
by +3.8 mIoU and +5.9 mACC, while achieving 2x faster inference through
efficient aggregation. Our code is

TL;DR: SMARLI is a novel autoregressive framework for layout-to-image generation that uses structured masking to integrate layout constraints and prevent feature entanglement, achieving superior layout control while maintaining generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models face challenges in layout-conditioned image generation due to sparse layout conditions and risk of feature entanglement between different regions and their descriptions.

Method: Uses structured masking strategy in attention computation to govern interactions among global prompt, layout, and image tokens. Incorporates Group Relative Policy Optimization with layout reward functions for post-training.

Result: Achieves seamless integration of layout tokens with text and image tokens without compromising generation quality. Maintains structural simplicity and generation efficiency of AR models.

Conclusion: SMARLI effectively integrates spatial layout constraints into AR-based image generation, preventing mis-association while enabling sufficient layout constraint injection.

Abstract: While autoregressive (AR) models have demonstrated remarkable success in
image generation, extending them to layout-conditioned generation remains
challenging due to the sparse nature of layout conditions and the risk of
feature entanglement. We present Structured Masking for AR-based
Layout-to-Image (SMARLI), a novel framework for layoutto-image generation that
effectively integrates spatial layout constraints into AR-based image
generation. To equip AR model with layout control, a specially designed
structured masking strategy is applied to attention computation to govern the
interaction among the global prompt, layout, and image tokens. This design
prevents mis-association between different regions and their descriptions while
enabling sufficient injection of layout constraints into the generation
process. To further enhance generation quality and layout accuracy, we
incorporate Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based post-training
scheme with specially designed layout reward functions for next-set-based AR
models. Experimental results demonstrate that SMARLI is able to seamlessly
integrate layout tokens with text and image tokens without compromising
generation quality. It achieves superior layoutaware control while maintaining
the structural simplicity and generation efficiency of AR models.

Abstract: Animal behavior analysis plays a crucial role in understanding animal
welfare, health status, and productivity in agricultural settings. However,
traditional manual observation methods are time-consuming, subjective, and
limited in scalability. We present a modular pipeline that leverages
open-sourced state-of-the-art computer vision techniques to automate animal
behavior analysis in a group housing environment. Our approach combines
state-of-the-art models for zero-shot object detection, motion-aware tracking
and segmentation, and advanced feature extraction using vision transformers for
robust behavior recognition. The pipeline addresses challenges including animal
occlusions and group housing scenarios as demonstrated in indoor pig
monitoring. We validated our system on the Edinburgh Pig Behavior Video Dataset
for multiple behavioral tasks. Our temporal model achieved 94.2% overall
accuracy, representing a 21.2 percentage point improvement over existing
methods. The pipeline demonstrated robust tracking capabilities with 93.3%
identity preservation score and 89.3% object detection precision. The modular
design suggests potential for adaptation to other contexts, though further
validation across species would be required. The open-source implementation
provides a scalable solution for behavior monitoring, contributing to precision
pig farming and welfare assessment through automated, objective, and continuous

*Yuchen Deng,Xiuyang Wu,Hai-Tao Zheng,Suiyang Zhang,Yi He,Yuxing Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AvatarSync is an autoregressive framework that generates realistic talking-head animations from a single image using phoneme representations, addressing flicker and identity drift issues with a two-stage generation approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GAN and diffusion-based talking-head animation methods suffer from inter-frame flicker, identity drift, and slow inference, limiting their practical applications.

Method: Two-stage autoregressive framework: 1) Facial Keyframe Generation using phoneme-to-visual mapping with text-frame causal attention, 2) Inter-frame interpolation with timestamp-aware adaptive strategy using selective state space models for bidirectional context reasoning.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in visual fidelity, temporal consistency, and computational efficiency while maintaining low latency and high visual quality.

Conclusion: AvatarSync provides a scalable and controllable solution for realistic talking-head animation that addresses key limitations of previous approaches through its innovative two-stage phoneme-based architecture.

Abstract: Existing talking-head animation approaches based on Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) or diffusion models often suffer from inter-frame flicker,
identity drift, and slow inference. These limitations inherent to their video
generation pipelines restrict their suitability for applications. To address
this, we introduce AvatarSync, an autoregressive framework on phoneme
representations that generates realistic and controllable talking-head
animations from a single reference image, driven directly text or audio input.
In addition, AvatarSync adopts a two-stage generation strategy, decoupling
semantic modeling from visual dynamics, which is a deliberate "Divide and
Conquer" design. The first stage, Facial Keyframe Generation (FKG), focuses on
phoneme-level semantic representation by leveraging the many-to-one mapping
from text or audio to phonemes. A Phoneme-to-Visual Mapping is constructed to
anchor abstract phonemes to character-level units. Combined with a customized
Text-Frame Causal Attention Mask, the keyframes are generated. The second
stage, inter-frame interpolation, emphasizes temporal coherence and visual
smoothness. We introduce a timestamp-aware adaptive strategy based on a
selective state space model, enabling efficient bidirectional context
reasoning. To support deployment, we optimize the inference pipeline to reduce
latency without compromising visual fidelity. Extensive experiments show that
AvatarSync outperforms existing talking-head animation methods in visual
fidelity, temporal consistency, and computational efficiency, providing a
scalable and controllable solution.

*Sebastian Diaz,Benjamin Billot,Neel Dey,Molin Zhang,Esra Abaci Turk,P. Ellen Grant,Polina Golland,Elfar Adalsteinsson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A cross-population data augmentation framework for fetal pose estimation that enables models trained on older gestational age data to generalize to early gestational ages by simulating early GA intrauterine environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fetal motion tracking methods fail to generalize to early gestational ages due to significant anatomical changes and lack of annotated early GA data, limiting early clinical detection capabilities.

Method: Developed a fetal-specific augmentation strategy that simulates the distinct intrauterine environment and fetal positioning of early gestational ages using only annotated images from older GA cohorts.

Result: Cross-population augmentation yields reduced variability and significant improvements across both older GA and challenging early GA cases, enabling more reliable pose estimation across gestation.

Conclusion: The framework facilitates early clinical detection and intervention in challenging 4D fetal imaging settings by enabling robust generalization to younger GA clinical cohorts without requiring annotated early GA data.

Abstract: Fetal motion is a critical indicator of neurological development and
intrauterine health, yet its quantification remains challenging, particularly
at earlier gestational ages (GA). Current methods track fetal motion by
predicting the location of annotated landmarks on 3D echo planar imaging (EPI)
time-series, primarily in third-trimester fetuses. The predicted landmarks
enable simplification of the fetal body for downstream analysis. While these
methods perform well within their training age distribution, they consistently
fail to generalize to early GAs due to significant anatomical changes in both
mother and fetus across gestation, as well as the difficulty of obtaining
annotated early GA EPI data. In this work, we develop a cross-population data
augmentation framework that enables pose estimation models to robustly
generalize to younger GA clinical cohorts using only annotated images from
older GA cohorts. Specifically, we introduce a fetal-specific augmentation
strategy that simulates the distinct intrauterine environment and fetal
positioning of early GAs. Our experiments find that cross-population
augmentation yields reduced variability and significant improvements across
both older GA and challenging early GA cases. By enabling more reliable pose
estimation across gestation, our work potentially facilitates early clinical
detection and intervention in challenging 4D fetal imaging settings. Code is

TL;DR: ImplMORe is a deep learning method using implicit surface representations for high-resolution multi-organ reconstruction from 3D medical images, outperforming traditional discrete approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained organ surface reconstruction from 3D medical imaging is limited by resolution constraints and high memory/computational requirements. Existing implicit representation methods from computer vision cannot be directly applied to medical images due to architectural and data-related differences.

Method: End-to-end deep learning approach using implicit surface representations with a 3D CNN encoder that incorporates local features and performs multi-scale interpolation to learn features in continuous domain using occupancy functions.

Result: Outperforms discrete explicit representation-based surface reconstruction approaches, providing fine-grained surface details at resolutions higher than the input image on the totalsegmentator dataset for both single and multiple organ reconstructions.

Conclusion: ImplMORe successfully bridges the gap between general computer vision implicit representation methods and medical imaging, enabling high-resolution organ reconstruction with continuous occupancy functions while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: The fine-grained surface reconstruction of different organs from 3D medical
imaging can provide advanced diagnostic support and improved surgical planning.
However, the representation of the organs is often limited by the resolution,
with a detailed higher resolution requiring more memory and computing
footprint. Implicit representations of objects have been proposed to alleviate
this problem in general computer vision by providing compact and differentiable
functions to represent the 3D object shapes. However, architectural and
data-related differences prevent the direct application of these methods to
medical images. This work introduces ImplMORe, an end-to-end deep learning
method using implicit surface representations for multi-organ reconstruction
from 3D medical images. ImplMORe incorporates local features using a 3D CNN
encoder and performs multi-scale interpolation to learn the features in the
continuous domain using occupancy functions. We apply our method for single and
multiple organ reconstructions using the totalsegmentator dataset. By
leveraging the continuous nature of occupancy functions, our approach
outperforms the discrete explicit representation based surface reconstruction
approaches, providing fine-grained surface details of the organ at a resolution
higher than the given input image. The source code will be made publicly

Conclusion: U-Mamba2 demonstrates both effectiveness and efficiency for dental CBCT segmentation, providing a strong solution that balances performance with computational efficiency.

Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is a widely used 3D imaging technique in
dentistry, providing volumetric information about the anatomical structures of
jaws and teeth. Accurate segmentation of these anatomies is critical for
clinical applications such as diagnosis and surgical planning, but remains
time-consuming and challenging. In this paper, we present U-Mamba2, a new
neural network architecture designed for multi-anatomy CBCT segmentation in the
context of the ToothFairy3 challenge. U-Mamba2 integrates the Mamba2 state
space models into the U-Net architecture, enforcing stronger structural
constraints for higher efficiency without compromising performance. In
addition, we integrate interactive click prompts with cross-attention blocks,
pre-train U-Mamba2 using self-supervised learning, and incorporate dental
domain knowledge into the model design to address key challenges of dental
anatomy segmentation in CBCT. Extensive experiments, including independent

TL;DR: A novel trajectory-controllable unfolding framework for CASSI hyperspectral image reconstruction that enforces smooth optimization paths using diffusion-inspired trajectories and flow matching, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep unfolding networks for CASSI reconstruction suffer from uncontrollable reconstruction trajectories, leading to abrupt quality jumps and non-gradual refinement across stages.

Method: Proposes a trajectory-controllable unfolding framework inspired by diffusion trajectories and flow matching, with an efficient spatial-spectral Transformer and frequency-domain fusion module for feature consistency.

Result: Experiments on simulation and real data demonstrate better reconstruction quality and efficiency than prior state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves superior performance in CASSI hyperspectral image reconstruction through controlled, smooth optimization trajectories and efficient architecture design.

Abstract: Coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging (CASSI) retrieves a 3D hyperspectral
image (HSI) from a single 2D compressed measurement, which is a highly
challenging reconstruction task. Recent deep unfolding networks (DUNs),
empowered by explicit data-fidelity updates and implicit deep denoisers, have
achieved the state of the art in CASSI reconstruction. However, existing
unfolding approaches suffer from uncontrollable reconstruction trajectories,
leading to abrupt quality jumps and non-gradual refinement across stages.
Inspired by diffusion trajectories and flow matching, we propose a novel
trajectory-controllable unfolding framework that enforces smooth, continuous
optimization paths from noisy initial estimates to high-quality
reconstructions. To achieve computational efficiency, we design an efficient
spatial-spectral Transformer tailored for hyperspectral reconstruction, along
with a frequency-domain fusion module to gurantee feature consistency.
Experiments on simulation and real data demonstrate that our method achieves
better reconstruction quality and efficiency than prior state-of-the-art
approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reflection-V enhances visual reasoning in VLMs by improving visual reflection through vision-centered data construction and visual attention rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models show limited visual reflection - their attention to visual information diminishes with longer responses, hindering effective visual reasoning.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Construct vision-centered reasoning data using agent interaction between VLMs and reasoning LLMs for cold-start learning; 2) Use visual attention-based reward model during reinforcement learning to encourage visual-based reasoning.

Result: Significant improvements across multiple visual reasoning benchmarks, with stronger and more consistent reliance on visual information during reasoning.

Conclusion: Reflection-V effectively enhances visual reflection capabilities in vision-language models, enabling better visual reasoning through improved attention to visual information.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-only "slow-thinking" reasoning have prompted efforts
to transfer this capability to vision-language models (VLMs), for training
visual reasoning models (\textbf{VRMs}). owever, such transfer faces critical
challenges: Effective "slow thinking" in VRMs requires \textbf{visual
reflection}, the ability to check the reasoning process based on visual
information. Through quantitative analysis, we observe that current VRMs
exhibit limited visual reflection, as their attention to visual information
diminishes rapidly with longer generated responses. To address this challenge,
we propose a new VRM \textbf{Reflection-V}, which enhances visual reflection
based on reasoning data construction for cold-start and reward design for
reinforcement learning (RL). Firstly, we construct vision-centered reasoning
data by leveraging an agent that interacts between VLMs and reasoning LLMs,
enabling cold-start learning of visual reflection patterns. Secondly, a visual
attention based reward model is employed during RL to encourage reasoning based
on visual information. Therefore, \textbf{Reflection-V} demonstrates
significant improvements across multiple visual reasoning benchmarks.
Furthermore, \textbf{Reflection-V} maintains a stronger and more consistent
reliance on visual information during visual reasoning, indicating effective
enhancement in visual reflection capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TetHeart is an end-to-end framework that reconstructs 4D cardiac motion from both complete CMR stacks and sparse intra-procedural slices using deep deformable tetrahedra representation and attentive feature assembly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cardiac motion reconstruction methods require complete CMR stacks, limiting their utility in intra-procedural scenarios where only sparse slice observations are available during medical interventions.

Method: Uses deep deformable tetrahedra (explicit-implicit hybrid representation) with attentive slice-adaptive 2D-3D feature assembly, distillation strategy from full to sparse slices, and two-stage weakly supervised motion learning requiring only keyframe annotations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and strong generalization on three large public datasets and external evaluation on private interventional and public CMR datasets in both pre- and intra-procedural settings.

Conclusion: TetHeart is the first framework that can reconstruct full 4D multi-structure heart meshes from both complete acquisitions and sparse intra-procedural observations, enabling accurate cardiac motion reconstruction even with extreme sparsity.

Abstract: Reconstructing cardiac motion from cine CMR sequences is critical for
diagnosis, prediction, and intervention. Existing methods rely on complete CMR
stacks to infer full heart motion, limiting their utility in intra-procedural
scenarios where only sparse observations are available. We present TetHeart,
the first end-to-end framework that unifies full 4D multi-structure heart mesh
recovery from both offline full-stack acquisitions and intra-procedural
sparse-slice observations. Our method leverages deep deformable tetrahedra, an
explicit-implicit hybrid representation, to capture shape and motion in a
coherent space shared across cardiac structures. It is initialized from
high-quality pre-procedural or offline-acquired full stacks to build detailed,
patient-specific heart meshes, which can then be updated using whatever slices
are available, from full stacks down to a single slice. We further incorporate
several key innovations: (i) an attentive mechanism for slice-adaptive 2D-3D
feature assembly that dynamically integrates information from arbitrary numbers
of slices at any position, combined with a distillation strategy from
full-slice to sparse-slice settings to ensure accurate reconstruction under
extreme sparsity; and (ii) a two-stage weakly supervised motion learning scheme
requiring only keyframe (e.g., ED and ES) annotations. Trained and validated on
three large public datasets and externally evaluated zero-shot on additional
private interventional and public CMR datasets, TetHeart achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and strong generalization in both pre- and
intra-procedural settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing few-shot segmentation methods require extensive training on large datasets. SAM2 offers powerful zero-shot segmentation capabilities that could be adapted for few-shot learning with minimal parameter tuning.

Method: Repurpose SAM2's video segmentation modules for few-shot segmentation, apply Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to handle diverse images from standard datasets, and meta-train only a small number of parameters.

Result: Achieves remarkable results on PASCAL-5i, COCO-20i, and FSS-1000 datasets with excellent computational efficiency during inference.

Conclusion: FS-SAM2 effectively adapts SAM2 for few-shot segmentation with minimal parameter tuning, demonstrating strong performance across multiple benchmarks while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation has recently attracted great attention. The
goal is to develop a model capable of segmenting unseen classes using only a
few annotated samples. Most existing approaches adapt a pre-trained model by
training from scratch an additional module. Achieving optimal performance with
these approaches requires extensive training on large-scale datasets. The
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) is a foundational model for zero-shot image and
video segmentation with a modular design. In this paper, we propose a Few-Shot
segmentation method based on SAM2 (FS-SAM2), where SAM2's video capabilities
are directly repurposed for the few-shot task. Moreover, we apply a Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) to the original modules in order to handle the diverse images
typically found in standard datasets, unlike the temporally connected frames
used in SAM2's pre-training. With this approach, only a small number of
parameters is meta-trained, which effectively adapts SAM2 while benefiting from
its impressive segmentation performance. Our method supports any K-shot
configuration. We evaluate FS-SAM2 on the PASCAL-5$^i$, COCO-20$^i$ and
FSS-1000 datasets, achieving remarkable results and demonstrating excellent
computational efficiency during inference. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tram-human interaction safety is critical in urban areas where collisions can cause serious injuries or fatalities. The paper aims to improve safety for pedestrians, drivers, cyclists, pets, and tram passengers using AI technologies.

Method: The framework fuses semantic segmentation (SegFormer B3 model) for rail detection, object detection (YOLOv8) for nearby object localization, and a rule-based Distance Assessor that compares projected distances with the standard 1435mm rail gauge to classify risk levels.

Result: On the RailSem19 dataset, the system achieved 65% IoU for rail segmentation and 75.6% mAP for object detection at IoU threshold 0.50, demonstrating accurate real-time performance.

Conclusion: RailSafeNet provides accurate, annotation-light scene understanding that can effectively warn tram drivers before dangerous situations escalate, offering a practical solution for improving tram safety in urban environments.

Abstract: Tram-human interaction safety is an important challenge, given that trams
frequently operate in densely populated areas, where collisions can range from
minor injuries to fatal outcomes. This paper addresses the issue from the
perspective of designing a solution leveraging digital image processing, deep
learning, and artificial intelligence to improve the safety of pedestrians,
drivers, cyclists, pets, and tram passengers. We present RailSafeNet, a
real-time framework that fuses semantic segmentation, object detection and a
rule-based Distance Assessor to highlight track intrusions. Using only
monocular video, the system identifies rails, localises nearby objects and
classifies their risk by comparing projected distances with the standard 1435mm
rail gauge. Experiments on the diverse RailSem19 dataset show that a
class-filtered SegFormer B3 model achieves 65% intersection-over-union (IoU),
while a fine-tuned YOLOv8 attains 75.6% mean average precision (mAP) calculated
at an intersection over union (IoU) threshold of 0.50. RailSafeNet therefore
delivers accurate, annotation-light scene understanding that can warn drivers
before dangerous situations escalate. Code available at

TL;DR: A unified deep learning pipeline combining Vision Transformers and Graph Neural Networks for automated detection of major depressive disorder from structural MRI data, achieving 78.98% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MDD detection methods using sMRI and deep learning are limited by voxel-level features or handcrafted regional representations from predefined brain atlases, which fail to capture complex brain patterns effectively.

Method: Developed a unified pipeline using Vision Transformers to extract 3D region embeddings from sMRI data and Graph Neural Networks for classification. Explored two region definition strategies: atlas-based (predefined structural/functional atlases) and cube-based (ViTs trained on 3D patches). Used cosine similarity graphs to model interregional relationships.

Result: Achieved 78.98% accuracy, 76.54% sensitivity, 81.58% specificity, 81.58% precision, and 78.98% F1-score using stratified 10-fold cross-validation on REST-meta-MDD dataset. Atlas-based models consistently outperformed cube-based approach.

Conclusion: Domain-specific anatomical priors are crucial for MDD detection, as atlas-based methods demonstrated superior performance over the cube-based approach in capturing meaningful brain patterns for depression diagnosis.

Abstract: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent mental health condition that
negatively impacts both individual well-being and global public health.
Automated detection of MDD using structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI)
and deep learning (DL) methods holds increasing promise for improving
diagnostic accuracy and enabling early intervention. Most existing methods
employ either voxel-level features or handcrafted regional representations
built from predefined brain atlases, limiting their ability to capture complex
brain patterns. This paper develops a unified pipeline that utilizes Vision
Transformers (ViTs) for extracting 3D region embeddings from sMRI data and
Graph Neural Network (GNN) for classification. We explore two strategies for
defining regions: (1) an atlas-based approach using predefined structural and
functional brain atlases, and (2) an cube-based method by which ViTs are
trained directly to identify regions from uniformly extracted 3D patches.
Further, cosine similarity graphs are generated to model interregional
relationships, and guide GNN-based classification. Extensive experiments were
conducted using the REST-meta-MDD dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of
our model. With stratified 10-fold cross-validation, the best model obtained
78.98% accuracy, 76.54% sensitivity, 81.58% specificity, 81.58% precision, and
78.98% F1-score. Further, atlas-based models consistently outperformed the
cube-based approach, highlighting the importance of using domain-specific
anatomical priors for MDD detection.

various conditions is developed. The proposed model is based on traffic,
meteorology and emission data measured in Prague, Czech Republic. The main
objective of the work is to provide insight into how urban planners and
policymakers can plan and manage urban transport more effectively with
environmental protection in mind.

### [137] [ZapGPT: Free-form Language Prompting for Simulated Cellular Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10660)
*Nam H. Le,Patrick Erickson,Yanbo Zhang,Michael Levin,Josh Bongard*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that simple agents' collective behavior can be guided by free-form natural language prompts without task-specific tuning or engineered rewards, using two AI models - one to transform prompts into interventions and another to score the results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between human language expressiveness and artificial/biological systems' ability to interpret it, enabling natural language control over complex systems without engineered rewards or domain-specific programming.

Method: Uses two AI models: one transforms imperative language prompts into interventions for simulated cells, and another scores how well prompts describe resulting cellular dynamics. The first model is evolved to improve scores from the second model.

Result: The evolved system successfully guides collective behavior using free-form language prompts and generalizes to unseen prompts without retraining, eliminating the need for engineered fitness functions or domain-specific prompt design.

Conclusion: This work provides a concrete step toward AI-biology partnerships where natural language replaces mathematical objective functions and domain-specific programming, suggesting a future where spoken/written prompts could direct computational, robotic, or biological systems.

Abstract: Human language is one of the most expressive tools for conveying intent, yet
most artificial or biological systems lack mechanisms to interpret or respond
meaningfully to it. Bridging this gap could enable more natural forms of
control over complex, decentralized systems. In AI and artificial life, recent
work explores how language can specify high-level goals, but most systems still
depend on engineered rewards, task-specific supervision, or rigid command sets,
limiting generalization to novel instructions. Similar constraints apply in
synthetic biology and bioengineering, where the locus of control is often
genomic rather than environmental perturbation.
  A key open question is whether artificial or biological collectives can be
guided by free-form natural language alone, without task-specific tuning or
carefully designed evaluation metrics. We provide one possible answer here by
showing, for the first time, that simple agents' collective behavior can be
guided by free-form language prompts: one AI model transforms an imperative
prompt into an intervention that is applied to simulated cells; a second AI
model scores how well the prompt describes the resulting cellular dynamics; and
the former AI model is evolved to improve the scores generated by the latter.
  Unlike previous work, our method does not require engineered fitness
functions or domain-specific prompt design. We show that the evolved system
generalizes to unseen prompts without retraining. By treating natural language
as a control layer, the system suggests a future in which spoken or written
prompts could direct computational, robotic, or biological systems to desired
behaviors. This work provides a concrete step toward this vision of AI-biology
partnerships, in which language replaces mathematical objective functions,
fixed rules, and domain-specific programming.

*Xingchen Wan,Han Zhou,Ruoxi Sun,Hootan Nakhost,Ke Jiang,Rajarishi Sinha,Sercan Ö. Arık*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Maestro is a self-evolving image generation system that enables text-to-image models to autonomously improve generated images through iterative prompt evolution using only an initial prompt, without requiring human intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models are highly reliant on manual prompt engineering and human intervention, posing significant usability challenges that require iterative refinement of often underspecified prompts.

Method: Uses two key innovations: 1) self-critique with specialized MLLM agents acting as critics to identify weaknesses and provide edit signals, and 2) self-evolution using MLLM-as-a-judge for head-to-head comparisons between iteratively generated images to evolve better prompts.

Result: Extensive experiments on complex T2I tasks demonstrate that Maestro significantly improves image quality over initial prompts and state-of-the-art automated methods, with effectiveness scaling with more advanced MLLM components.

Conclusion: Maestro presents a robust, interpretable, and effective pathway towards self-improving text-to-image generation by enabling autonomous image quality improvement through iterative prompt evolution.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models, while offering immense creative potential, are
highly reliant on human intervention, posing significant usability challenges
that often necessitate manual, iterative prompt engineering over often
underspecified prompts. This paper introduces Maestro, a novel self-evolving
image generation system that enables T2I models to autonomously self-improve
generated images through iterative evolution of prompts, using only an initial
prompt. Maestro incorporates two key innovations: 1) self-critique, where
specialized multimodal LLM (MLLM) agents act as 'critics' to identify
weaknesses in generated images, correct for under-specification, and provide
interpretable edit signals, which are then integrated by a 'verifier' agent
while preserving user intent; and 2) self-evolution, utilizing MLLM-as-a-judge
for head-to-head comparisons between iteratively generated images, eschewing
problematic images, and evolving creative prompt candidates that align with
user intents. Extensive experiments on complex T2I tasks using black-box models
demonstrate that Maestro significantly improves image quality over initial
prompts and state-of-the-art automated methods, with effectiveness scaling with
more advanced MLLM components. This work presents a robust, interpretable, and
effective pathway towards self-improving T2I generation.

*Sajjad Abdoli,Rudi Cilibrasi,Rima Al-Shikh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI models exhibit distinct evaluation personalities with systematic biases - GPT-4o-mini shows consistency, GPT-4o detects errors well, GPT-5 is extremely conservative, and all GPT models demonstrate 2:1 negative bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding AI assessment behavior is crucial as AI systems increasingly evaluate other AI outputs to prevent cascading biases in automated evaluation systems.

Method: Analyzed vision-language descriptions from NVIDIA's Describe Anything Model evaluated by three GPT variants. Used Gemini 2.5 Pro as independent question generator for controlled experiments and conducted cross-family analysis through semantic similarity of generated questions.

Result: GPT models show distinct evaluation personalities: GPT-4o-mini has systematic consistency, GPT-4o excels at error detection, GPT-5 shows extreme conservatism with high variability. All GPT models demonstrate consistent 2:1 bias favoring negative assessment over positive confirmation. GPT models cluster together while Gemini shows markedly different evaluation strategies.

Conclusion: Evaluation competence does not scale with general capability, and robust AI assessment requires diverse architectural perspectives to mitigate systematic biases inherent in model families.

Abstract: As AI systems increasingly evaluate other AI outputs, understanding their
assessment behavior becomes crucial for preventing cascading biases. This study
analyzes vision-language descriptions generated by NVIDIA's Describe Anything
Model and evaluated by three GPT variants (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-5) to
uncover distinct "evaluation personalities" the underlying assessment
strategies and biases each model demonstrates. GPT-4o-mini exhibits systematic
consistency with minimal variance, GPT-4o excels at error detection, while
GPT-5 shows extreme conservatism with high variability. Controlled experiments
using Gemini 2.5 Pro as an independent question generator validate that these
personalities are inherent model properties rather than artifacts. Cross-family
analysis through semantic similarity of generated questions reveals significant
divergence: GPT models cluster together with high similarity while Gemini
exhibits markedly different evaluation strategies. All GPT models demonstrate a
consistent 2:1 bias favoring negative assessment over positive confirmation,
though this pattern appears family-specific rather than universal across AI
architectures. These findings suggest that evaluation competence does not scale
with general capability and that robust AI assessment requires diverse
architectural perspectives.

*Arlen Kumar,Leanid Palkhouski*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GEO-16 framework audits web page quality for AI citation, finding that higher quality pages (GEO score ≥0.70 with 12+ pillar hits) get cited more by AI engines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how AI answer engines select and cite web sources, and develop a quality assessment framework to evaluate citation patterns.

Method: Created GEO-16 framework with 16 quality pillars, collected 1,702 citations from 3 AI engines using 70 prompts, audited 1,100 URLs with logistic modeling and domain clustering.

Result: Engines differed in citation quality; Metadata/Freshness, Semantic HTML, and Structured Data pillars most strongly associated with citation. Higher quality pages (G≥0.70 + 12+ pillars) had significantly higher citation rates.

Conclusion: Page quality strongly predicts AI citation. Framework provides practical guidance for publishers to improve citation chances, though limited to English B2B SaaS content.

Abstract: AI answer engines increasingly mediate access to domain knowledge by
generating responses and citing web sources. We introduce GEO-16, a 16 pillar
auditing framework that converts on page quality signals into banded pillar
scores and a normalized GEO score G that ranges from 0 to 1. Using 70 product
intent prompts, we collected 1,702 citations across three engines (Brave
Summary, Google AI Overviews, and Perplexity) and audited 1,100 unique URLs. In
our corpus, the engines differed in the GEO quality of the pages they cited,
and pillars related to Metadata and Freshness, Semantic HTML, and Structured
Data showed the strongest associations with citation. Logistic models with
domain clustered standard errors indicate that overall page quality is a strong
predictor of citation, and simple operating points (for example, G at least
0.70 combined with at least 12 pillar hits) align with substantially higher
citation rates in our data. We report per engine contrasts, vertical effects,
threshold analysis, and diagnostics, then translate findings into a practical
playbook for publishers. The study is observational and focuses on English
language B2B SaaS pages; we discuss limitations, threats to validity, and
reproducibility considerations.

*Tara Bogavelli,Roshnee Sharma,Hari Subramani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Comprehensive benchmark study of 18 agentic configurations across LLMs, revealing model-specific architectural preferences and significant performance gaps in enterprise tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited empirical understanding of how different design dimensions interact in complex multi-agent systems, addressing gaps in agentic architecture evaluation.

Method: Evaluated 18 distinct agentic configurations across state-of-the-art LLMs, examining four dimensions: orchestration strategy, agent prompt implementation (ReAct vs function calling), memory architecture, and thinking tool integration.

Result: Revealed significant model-specific architectural preferences challenging one-size-fits-all paradigms. Highest scoring models achieved only 35.3% success on complex tasks and 70.8% on simpler enterprise tasks, showing significant performance weaknesses.

Conclusion: Findings should inform future agentic system design by enabling empirically-backed decisions regarding architectural components and model selection.

Abstract: While individual components of agentic architectures have been studied in
isolation, there remains limited empirical understanding of how different
design dimensions interact within complex multi-agent systems. This study aims
to address these gaps by providing a comprehensive enterprise-specific
benchmark evaluating 18 distinct agentic configurations across state-of-the-art
large language models. We examine four critical agentic system dimensions:
orchestration strategy, agent prompt implementation (ReAct versus function
calling), memory architecture, and thinking tool integration. Our benchmark
reveals significant model-specific architectural preferences that challenge the
prevalent one-size-fits-all paradigm in agentic AI systems. It also reveals
significant weaknesses in overall agentic performance on enterprise tasks with
the highest scoring models achieving a maximum of only 35.3\% success on the
more complex task and 70.8\% on the simpler task. We hope these findings inform
the design of future agentic systems by enabling more empirically backed
decisions regarding architectural components and model selection.

### [142] [LLM Enhancement with Domain Expert Mental Model to Reduce LLM Hallucination with Causal Prompt Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10818)
*Boris Kovalerchuk,Brent D. Fegley*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with decision-making due to missing information and hallucinations. The paper proposes an Expert Mental Model (EMM) algorithm using human-machine dialogue and Boolean functions to create structured decision models for LLM prompt engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have limitations in decision-making tasks due to missing training data, hallucinations, and inability to capture complex expert mental models. Existing solutions like RAG are insufficient for tasks requiring critical missing information.

Method: Proposes a 4-step EMM algorithm: (1) factor identification, (2) hierarchical structuring of factors, (3) generating generalized expert mental model specification, (4) creating detailed generalized expert mental model from specification, using optimized human-machine dialogue and monotone Boolean/k-valued functions.

Result: The approach enables computationally tractable personal expert mental models for decision-making, addressing LLMs' knowledge gaps and improving their effectiveness in complex decision tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed EMM framework provides a systematic way to capture expert decision-making models for LLM prompt engineering, making decision-making more efficient and addressing limitations of current LLM approaches.

Abstract: Difficult decision-making problems abound in various disciplines and domains.
The proliferation of generative techniques, especially large language models
(LLMs), has excited interest in using them for decision support. However, LLMs
cannot yet resolve missingness in their training data, leading to
hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by
incorporating external information retrieval, reducing hallucinations and
improving accuracy. Yet, RAG and related methods are only partial solutions, as
they may lack access to all necessary sources or key missing information. Even
everyday issues often challenge LLMs' abilities. Submitting longer prompts with
context and examples is one approach to address knowledge gaps, but designing
effective prompts is non-trivial and may not capture complex mental models of
domain experts. For tasks with missing critical information, LLMs are
insufficient, as are many existing systems poorly represented in available
documents. This paper explores how LLMs can make decision-making more
efficient, using a running example of evaluating whether to respond to a call
for proposals. We propose a technology based on optimized human-machine
dialogue and monotone Boolean and k-valued functions to discover a
computationally tractable personal expert mental model (EMM) of
decision-making. Our EMM algorithm for LLM prompt engineering has four steps:
(1) factor identification, (2) hierarchical structuring of factors, (3)
generating a generalized expert mental model specification, and (4) generating
a detailed generalized expert mental model from that specification.

*Yuyin Lu,Hegang Chen,Yanghui Rao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LVSA is a neuro-symbolic framework that combines differentiable Skolemization and neural negation to address the trade-off between logical soundness and computational efficiency in complex query answering over incomplete knowledge graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for complex query answering face a fundamental trade-off: Grounding-based methods suffer from combinatorial explosion, while Skolemization-based methods often compromise logical consistency by not explicitly modeling Skolem functions.

Method: Proposes Logic-constrained Vector Symbolic Architecture (LVSA) with a differentiable Skolemization module, neural negator, and logical constraint-driven optimization protocol to harmonize geometric and logical requirements.

Result: Theoretically guarantees universality for all EFO$_1$ queries. Empirically outperforms state-of-the-art Skolemization-based methods and reduces inference costs by orders of magnitude compared to Grounding-based baselines.

Conclusion: LVSA successfully addresses the soundness-efficiency trade-off in complex query answering by unifying differentiable Skolemization with logical constraints, achieving both computational efficiency and logical consistency.

Abstract: Complex Query Answering (CQA) over incomplete Knowledge Graphs (KGs),
typically formalized as reasoning with Existential First-Order predicate logic
with one free variable (EFO$_1$), faces a fundamental trade-off between logical
soundness and computational efficiency. This work establishes the
Grounding-Skolemization dichotomy for systematically analyzing CQA methods
through the lens of formal logic. While Grounding-based methods inherently
suffer from combinatorial explosion, most Skolemization-based methods neglect
to explicitly model Skolem functions and compromise logical consistency. To
address these limitations, we propose the Logic-constrained Vector Symbolic
Architecture (LVSA), a neuro-symbolic framework that unifies a differentiable
Skolemization module and a neural negator, as well as a logical
constraint-driven optimization protocol to harmonize geometric and logical
requirements. Theoretically, LVSA guarantees universality for all EFO$_1$
queries. Empirically, it outperforms state-of-the-art Skolemization-based
methods and reduces inference costs by orders of magnitude compared to
Grounding-based baselines.

### [144] [Is the `Agent' Paradigm a Limiting Framework for Next-Generation Intelligent Systems?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10875)
*Jesse Gardner,Vladimir A. Baulin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critically re-evaluates the agent-centric paradigm in AI, arguing it has conceptual ambiguities and anthropocentric biases that limit progress. It proposes shifting focus to system-level dynamics and non-agentic frameworks for more robust general intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the dominant agent-centric paradigm in AI research, which the authors argue suffers from persistent conceptual ambiguities, inherent anthropocentric biases, and may represent a limiting framework that obscures underlying computational mechanisms.

Method: Systematic review of relevant literature to deconstruct the agent paradigm across various AI frameworks, distinguishing between agentic systems (AI inspired by agency), agential systems (fully autonomous biological systems), and non-agentic systems (tools without agency impression).

Result: The analysis reveals challenges in defining and measuring properties like autonomy and goal-directedness within the agent paradigm. The agentic framing of many AI systems, while heuristically useful, can be misleading particularly for Large Language Models.

Conclusion: Investigating non-agentic and systemic frameworks inspired by complex systems, biology, and unconventional computing is essential for advancing robust, scalable, and potentially non-anthropomorphic forms of general intelligence, requiring new architectures and fundamental reconsideration of intelligence beyond the agent metaphor.

Abstract: The concept of the 'agent' has profoundly shaped Artificial Intelligence (AI)
research, guiding development from foundational theories to contemporary
applications like Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems. This paper
critically re-evaluates the necessity and optimality of this agent-centric
paradigm. We argue that its persistent conceptual ambiguities and inherent
anthropocentric biases may represent a limiting framework. We distinguish
between agentic systems (AI inspired by agency, often semi-autonomous, e.g.,
LLM-based agents), agential systems (fully autonomous, self-producing systems,
currently only biological), and non-agentic systems (tools without the
impression of agency). Our analysis, based on a systematic review of relevant
literature, deconstructs the agent paradigm across various AI frameworks,
highlighting challenges in defining and measuring properties like autonomy and
goal-directedness. We argue that the 'agentic' framing of many AI systems,
while heuristically useful, can be misleading and may obscure the underlying
computational mechanisms, particularly in Large Language Models (LLMs). As an
alternative, we propose a shift in focus towards frameworks grounded in
system-level dynamics, world modeling, and material intelligence. We conclude
that investigating non-agentic and systemic frameworks, inspired by complex
systems, biology, and unconventional computing, is essential for advancing
towards robust, scalable, and potentially non-anthropomorphic forms of general
intelligence. This requires not only new architectures but also a fundamental
reconsideration of our understanding of intelligence itself, moving beyond the
agent metaphor.

*Seongho Joo,Hyukhun Koh,Kyomin Jung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HaPLa is a novel jailbreaking technique that achieves high success rates on LLMs using abductive framing and symbolic encoding to bypass safety filters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate universal jailbreak attacks that exploit intrinsic weaknesses in LLM architecture and learning paradigms to strengthen defenses against misuse.

Method: Uses two strategies: 1) abductive framing (inferring intermediate steps toward harmful activities) and 2) symbolic encoding (obfuscating harmful content to bypass keyword filters).

Result: Achieves over 95% attack success rate on GPT-series models and 70% across all targets. Shows difficulty in safely tuning LLMs without diminishing helpfulness.

Conclusion: Reveals fundamental challenges in LLM safety - current defenses remain vulnerable to sophisticated attacks, and safety tuning often compromises model helpfulness.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse tasks, but their potential misuse for harmful purposes remains a
significant concern. To strengthen defenses against such vulnerabilities, it is
essential to investigate universal jailbreak attacks that exploit intrinsic
weaknesses in the architecture and learning paradigms of LLMs. In response, we
propose \textbf{H}armful \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{La}undering (HaPLa), a novel
and broadly applicable jailbreaking technique that requires only black-box
access to target models. HaPLa incorporates two primary strategies: 1)
\textit{abductive framing}, which instructs LLMs to infer plausible
intermediate steps toward harmful activities, rather than directly responding
to explicit harmful queries; and 2) \textit{symbolic encoding}, a lightweight
and flexible approach designed to obfuscate harmful content, given that current
LLMs remain sensitive primarily to explicit harmful keywords. Experimental
results show that HaPLa achieves over 95% attack success rate on GPT-series
models and 70% across all targets. Further analysis with diverse symbolic
encoding rules also reveals a fundamental challenge: it remains difficult to
safely tune LLMs without significantly diminishing their helpfulness in
responding to benign queries.

TL;DR: A private in-context learning algorithm that incorporates public data to balance privacy protection and utility while maintaining differential privacy guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the privacy risks of data leakage in in-context learning while overcoming the utility reduction typically associated with differential privacy.

Method: Incorporate task-related public data into the ICL framework while maintaining differential privacy guarantees through a proposed private ICL algorithm.

Result: Significantly improves utility of private ICL with public data assistance and demonstrates robustness against membership inference attacks.

Conclusion: The approach effectively balances privacy protection and model utility in in-context learning scenarios.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) in Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown
remarkable performance across various tasks without requiring fine-tuning.
However, recent studies have highlighted the risk of private data leakage
through the prompt in ICL, especially when LLMs are exposed to malicious
attacks. While differential privacy (DP) provides strong privacy guarantees, it
often significantly reduces the utility of in-context learning (ICL). To
address this challenge, we incorporate task-related public data into the ICL
framework while maintaining the DP guarantee. Based on this approach, we
propose a private in-context learning algorithm that effectively balances
privacy protection and model utility. Through experiments, we demonstrate that
our approach significantly improves the utility of private ICL with the
assistance of public data. Additionally, we show that our method is robust
against membership inference attacks, demonstrating empirical privacy
protection.

TL;DR: Integrating LLMs into cognitive architectures to combine computational power with psychological realism, using Clarion as a case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cognitive architectures have limited computational capabilities despite psychological plausibility, while LLMs offer superior computational power but lack psychological validation. Combining them addresses both real-world complexity and psychological realism.

Method: Synergistic combination of Clarion cognitive architecture with LLMs, leveraging Clarion's implicit-explicit dichotomy for seamless integration.

Result: Successful integration that combines the computational power of LLMs with the psychological nicety and validation of the Clarion architecture.

Conclusion: Incorporating LLMs into cognitive architectures is an important approach for achieving both computational capability and psychological realism in modeling human cognition.

Abstract: Computational cognitive architectures are broadly scoped models of the human
mind that combine different psychological functionalities (as well as often
different computational methods for these different functionalities) into one
unified framework. They structure them in a psychologically plausible and
validated way. However, such models thus far have only limited computational
capabilities, mostly limited by the computational tools and techniques that
were adopted. More recently, LLMs have proved to be more capable
computationally than any other tools. Thus, in order to deal with both
real-world complexity and psychological realism at the same time, incorporating
LLMs into cognitive architectures naturally becomes an important task. In the
present article, a synergistic combination of the Clarion cognitive
architecture and LLMs is discussed as a case study. The implicit-explicit
dichotomy that is fundamental to Clarion is leveraged for a seamless
integration of Clarion and LLMs. As a result, computational power of LLMs is
combined with psychological nicety of Clarion.

*Ziang Li,Manasi Ganti,Zixian Ma,Helena Vasconcelos,Qijia He,Ranjay Krishna*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a fine-grained attribute-based evaluation framework for LLM-generated rationales, moving beyond binary preference judgments to provide more nuanced insights into rationale quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for LLM-generated rationales rely on opaque binary preference judgments that offer limited insight into what makes one rationale better than another, creating a need for more interpretable and granular evaluation approaches.

Method: The authors identify key rationale attributes from literature, assess them using automatic metrics, LLM judgments, and human annotations, analyze human preference datasets using SHAP to identify influential attributes, and re-evaluate rationales using attribute-specific ELO scores.

Result: The analysis reveals that fine-grained attribute evaluations can better characterize rationale quality and provide more nuanced model comparisons, identifying which specific attributes best explain human preference outcomes.

Conclusion: Attribute-based evaluation overcomes limitations of binary comparisons and can guide future research toward more interpretable and reliable evaluation practices for LLM-generated rationales.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate natural language rationales --
free-form explanations that help improve performance on complex reasoning tasks
and enhance interpretability for human users. However, evaluating these
rationales remains challenging. While recent work has relied on binary
preference judgments from humans or LLM judges, such evaluations are often
opaque and coarse-grained, offering limited insight into what makes one
rationale better than another. In this work, we rethink preference evaluation
for LLM-generated rationales by asking: (1) What attributes define good
rationales? (2) Can human preferences be explained by these attributes? (3) Can
attribute-based evaluation overcome the limitations of binary comparisons? We
identify a set of key rationale attributes from prior literature and assess
them using automatic metrics, LLM judgments, and human annotations. We then
analyze two standard human preference datasets MT Bench and Chatbot Arena using
SHAP to identify which attributes best explain human preference outcomes.
Finally, we re-evaluate model-generated rationales using attribute-specific ELO
scores, revealing more nuanced model comparisons and insights. Our findings
suggest that fine-grained attribute evaluations can better characterize
rationale quality and guide future research toward more interpretable and
reliable evaluation practices.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Free-MAD is a novel multi-agent debate framework that eliminates consensus requirements, uses score-based decision making on entire debate trajectories, and introduces anti-conformity mechanisms to improve reasoning performance while reducing token costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent debate methods face limitations including high token overhead from multiple communication rounds, error propagation due to LLM conformity, and unfair decision-making through majority voting.

Method: Proposes Free-MAD with score-based decision mechanism that evaluates entire debate trajectories, anti-conformity mechanism to mitigate majority influence, and requires only single-round debate.

Result: Experiments on eight benchmark datasets show significant reasoning performance improvements, reduced token costs, and improved robustness in real-world attack scenarios compared to existing MAD approaches.

Conclusion: Free-MAD successfully addresses limitations of consensus-based multi-agent debate frameworks by providing more accurate, fair, and efficient reasoning while maintaining robustness.

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) is an emerging approach to improving the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Existing MAD methods rely on
multiple rounds of interaction among agents to reach consensus, and the final
output is selected by majority voting in the last round. However, this
consensus-based design faces several limitations. First, multiple rounds of
communication increases token overhead and limits scalability. Second, due to
the inherent conformity of LLMs, agents that initially produce correct
responses may be influenced by incorrect ones during the debate process,
causing error propagation. Third, majority voting introduces randomness and
unfairness in the decision-making phase, and can degrade the reasoning
performance.
  To address these issues, we propose \textsc{Free-MAD}, a novel MAD framework
that eliminates the need for consensus among agents. \textsc{Free-MAD}
introduces a novel score-based decision mechanism that evaluates the entire
debate trajectory rather than relying on the last round only. This mechanism
tracks how each agent's reasoning evolves, enabling more accurate and fair
outcomes. In addition, \textsc{Free-MAD} reconstructs the debate phase by
introducing anti-conformity, a mechanism that enables agents to mitigate
excessive influence from the majority. Experiments on eight benchmark datasets
demonstrate that \textsc{Free-MAD} significantly improves reasoning performance
while requiring only a single-round debate and thus reducing token costs. We
also show that compared to existing MAD approaches, \textsc{Free-MAD} exhibits
improved robustness in real-world attack scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autonomous agents struggle with complex multi-step desktop tasks due to poor coordination and inadequate quality control.

Method: A multi-agent system with finite-state machine architecture comprising Controller, Manager, three Workers (Technician, Operator, Analyst), and Evaluator, using FSM-based routing for dynamic execution strategy selection.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art 57.07% success rate in 50 steps on OSWorld benchmark, substantially outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: Principled multi-agent orchestration with continuous quality control provides superior reliability for generalized desktop automation in complex computing environments.

Abstract: Autonomous agents for desktop automation struggle with complex multi-step
tasks due to poor coordination and inadequate quality control. We introduce
\textsc{Agentic Lybic}, a novel multi-agent system where the entire
architecture operates as a finite-state machine (FSM). This core innovation
enables dynamic orchestration. Our system comprises four components: a
Controller, a Manager, three Workers (Technician for code-based operations,
Operator for GUI interactions, and Analyst for decision support), and an
Evaluator. The critical mechanism is the FSM-based routing between these
components, which provides flexibility and generalization by dynamically
selecting the optimal execution strategy for each subtask. This principled
orchestration, combined with robust quality gating, enables adaptive replanning
and error recovery. Evaluated officially on the OSWorld benchmark,
\textsc{Agentic Lybic} achieves a state-of-the-art 57.07\% success rate in 50
steps, substantially outperforming existing methods. Results demonstrate that
principled multi-agent orchestration with continuous quality control provides
superior reliability for generalized desktop automation in complex computing

*Zan-Kai Chong,Hiroyuki Ohsaki,Bryan Ng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A verification framework for LLM outputs that enables efficient probabilistic auditing with asymmetric effort - verification is much cheaper than computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of computational trust in multi-agent LLM systems, ensuring outputs are genuinely produced by claimed models and not falsified or inferior alternatives.

Method: Built on deterministic replicability principle, requiring homogeneous hardware/software environment. Uses probabilistic auditing of random output segments with distributed verification workload.

Result: Simulations show targeted verification can be over 12x faster than full regeneration, with tunable detection probability parameters.

Conclusion: Provides tractable mechanism for auditable LLM systems, serving as foundation for responsible AI and future heterogeneous multi-agent systems research.

Abstract: The landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs) shifts rapidly towards dynamic,
multi-agent systems. This introduces a fundamental challenge in establishing
computational trust, specifically how one agent can verify that another's
output was genuinely produced by a claimed LLM, and not falsified or generated
by a cheaper or inferior model. To address this challenge, this paper proposes
a verification framework that achieves tractable asymmetric effort, where the
cost to verify a computation is substantially lower than the cost to perform
it. Our approach is built upon the principle of deterministic replicability, a
property inherent to autoregressive models that strictly necessitates a
computationally homogeneous environment where all agents operate on identical
hardware and software stacks. Within this defined context, our framework
enables multiple validators to probabilistically audit small, random segments
of an LLM's output and it distributes the verification workload effectively.
The simulations demonstrated that targeted verification can be over 12 times
faster than full regeneration, with tunable parameters to adjust the detection
probability. By establishing a tractable mechanism for auditable LLM systems,
our work offers a foundational layer for responsible AI and serves as a
cornerstone for future research into the more complex, heterogeneous
multi-agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based medical data generation methods have limitations in privacy, accuracy, diversity, and lack realistic patient interaction capabilities, requiring a new approach that doesn't rely on real medical records.

Method: A medically-aligned multi-step generation architecture with hierarchical medical knowledge injection, dynamic updating mechanism for interaction optimization, and real-time clinical plausibility verification.

Result: The model achieves good performance in accuracy, diversity, and consistency. Training with generated virtual patients significantly improves existing models on the MedQA dataset.

Conclusion: Patient-Zero successfully addresses limitations of existing methods by generating realistic synthetic patient data without privacy concerns while maintaining medical coherence and enabling effective model training.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation using large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a
promising solution across various domains, particularly in medical field, to
mitigate data collection challenges. However, existing studies mainly utilize
LLMs to rewrite and complete existing medical records, where the limitations in
data privacy, accuracy, and diversity sill exist, and additionally lack the
ability to interact like real patients. To address these issues, we propose a
realistic patient generation framework, Patient-Zero, which requires no real
medical records. Patient-Zero first introduces a medically-aligned multi-step
generation architecture, which builds comprehensive patient records through
hierarchical medical knowledge injection without real medical records. Then, to
optimize the virtual patient's interaction abilities with humans, Patient-Zero
designs a dynamic updating mechanism to improve the consistency and
conversational performance. Our framework enables the generation of
contextually diverse patient records while maintaining strict medical
coherence, supported by adaptive dialogue strategies and real-time clinical
plausibility verification. Experimental results demonstrate that our model
achieves good performance in accuracy, diversity, and consistency. After
training with our generated virtual patients, existing models show significant
improvements on the MedQA dataset.

TL;DR: DAAO is a dynamic multi-agent framework that adapts workflow depth, operator selection, and LLM assignment based on query difficulty, outperforming static approaches in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent frameworks use static workflows that either over-process simple queries or underperform on complex ones, while ignoring efficiency-performance trade-offs across different LLMs.

Method: Proposes Difficulty-Aware Agentic Orchestration (DAAO) with three modules: VAE for difficulty estimation, modular operator allocator, and cost-performance-aware LLM router to dynamically tailor workflows.

Result: DAAO outperforms prior multi-agent systems in both accuracy and inference efficiency across six benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework enables fine-grained, query-specific reasoning strategies by leveraging heterogeneous LLMs and dynamically adapting to query difficulty, achieving better performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems have shown strong
capabilities across various tasks. However, existing multi-agent frameworks
often rely on static or task-level workflows, which either over-process simple
queries or underperform on complex ones, while also neglecting the
efficiency-performance trade-offs across heterogeneous LLMs. To address these
limitations, we propose Difficulty-Aware Agentic Orchestration (DAAO), a
dynamic framework that adapts workflow depth, operator selection, and LLM
assignment based on the difficulty of each input query. DAAO comprises three
interdependent modules: a variational autoencoder (VAE) for difficulty
estimation, a modular operator allocator, and a cost- and performance-aware LLM
router. By leveraging heterogeneous LLMs and dynamically tailoring workflows,
DAAO enables fine-grained, query-specific reasoning strategies. DAAO
outperforms prior multi-agent systems in both accuracy and inference efficiency
across six benchmarks. We will release our code and implementation details upon
publication.

TL;DR: Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) combine trainable neural networks with cellular automata to model biological self-organization across scales, showing robustness and generalization capabilities for biological applications, robotics, and AI reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge classical rule-based systems with modern machine learning for modeling adaptive biological self-organization across molecular, cellular, tissue, and system levels, and to explore applications beyond biology including robotics and AI reasoning.

Method: Embedding Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) as local decision-making centers within cellular automata frameworks, creating differentiable and evolvable update rules that enable localized interactions to produce coordinated system-level outcomes.

Result: NCAs successfully reproduce biological patterns, demonstrate robustness to perturbations, generalize to novel conditions, and show potential in robotic control, regeneration, and reasoning tasks like ARC-AGI-1, while connecting to modern generative AI principles.

Conclusion: NCAs represent a unifying computationally efficient paradigm that connects multiscale biology with generative AI, offering potential for designing bio-inspired collective intelligence capable of hierarchical reasoning and control without centralized systems.

Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) represent a powerful framework for modeling
biological self-organization, extending classical rule-based systems with
trainable, differentiable (or evolvable) update rules that capture the adaptive
self-regulatory dynamics of living matter. By embedding Artificial Neural
Networks (ANNs) as local decision-making centers and interaction rules between
localized agents, NCA can simulate processes across molecular, cellular,
tissue, and system-level scales, offering a multiscale competency architecture
perspective on evolution, development, regeneration, aging, morphogenesis, and
robotic control. These models not only reproduce biologically inspired target
patterns but also generalize to novel conditions, demonstrating robustness to
perturbations and the capacity for open-ended adaptation and reasoning. Given
their immense success in recent developments, we here review current literature
of NCAs that are relevant primarily for biological or bioengineering
applications. Moreover, we emphasize that beyond biology, NCAs display robust
and generalizing goal-directed dynamics without centralized control, e.g., in
controlling or regenerating composite robotic morphologies or even on
cutting-edge reasoning tasks such as ARC-AGI-1. In addition, the same
principles of iterative state-refinement is reminiscent to modern generative
Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as probabilistic diffusion models. Their
governing self-regulatory behavior is constraint to fully localized
interactions, yet their collective behavior scales into coordinated
system-level outcomes. We thus argue that NCAs constitute a unifying
computationally lean paradigm that not only bridges fundamental insights from
multiscale biology with modern generative AI, but have the potential to design
truly bio-inspired collective intelligence capable of hierarchical reasoning
and control.

TL;DR: AlignKT introduces a frontend-to-backend architecture with contrastive learning to model stable knowledge states in Knowledge Tracing, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KT models focus on fitting interaction sequences but overlook knowledge state modeling, reducing interpretability and instructional support in Intelligent Tutoring Systems.

Method: Uses frontend-to-backend architecture with five encoders and contrastive learning module to align preliminary knowledge state with an ideal state based on pedagogical theories.

Result: Outperforms seven KT baselines on three real-world datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on two datasets and competitive performance on the third.

Conclusion: AlignKT successfully addresses the limitation of traditional KT models by explicitly modeling stable knowledge states, enhancing both performance and interpretability.

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) serves as a fundamental component of Intelligent
Tutoring Systems (ITS), enabling these systems to monitor and understand
learners' progress by modeling their knowledge state. However, many existing KT
models primarily focus on fitting the sequences of learners' interactions, and
often overlook the knowledge state itself. This limitation leads to reduced
interpretability and insufficient instructional support from the ITS. To
address this challenge, we propose AlignKT, which employs a frontend-to-backend
architecture to explicitly model a stable knowledge state. In this approach,
the preliminary knowledge state is aligned with an additional criterion.
Specifically, we define an ideal knowledge state based on pedagogical theories
as the alignment criterion, providing a foundation for interpretability. We
utilize five encoders to implement this set-up, and incorporate a contrastive
learning module to enhance the robustness of the alignment process. Through
extensive experiments, AlignKT demonstrates superior performance, outperforming
seven KT baselines on three real-world datasets. It achieves state-of-the-art
results on two of these datasets and exhibits competitive performance on the
third. The code of this work is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing document automation tools focus on static media like posters and slides, lacking mechanisms for personalized dynamic orchestration and multimodal content synchronization needed for effective scientific video generation.

Method: VideoAgent parses source papers into fine-grained asset libraries and orchestrates narrative flows that synthesize both static slides and dynamic animations based on user requirements through a conversational interface.

Result: Extensive experiments show VideoAgent significantly outperforms existing commercial scientific video generation services and approaches human-level quality in scientific communication.

Conclusion: The proposed VideoAgent framework successfully addresses the challenges of automated scientific video generation with personalized dynamic orchestration and multimodal synchronization, demonstrating superior performance over commercial alternatives.

Abstract: Automating the generation of scientific videos is a crucial yet challenging
task for effective knowledge dissemination. However, existing works on document
automation primarily focus on static media such as posters and slides, lacking
mechanisms for personalized dynamic orchestration and multimodal content
synchronization. To address these challenges, we introduce VideoAgent, a novel
multi-agent framework that synthesizes personalized scientific videos through a
conversational interface. VideoAgent parses a source paper into a fine-grained
asset library and, guided by user requirements, orchestrates a narrative flow
that synthesizes both static slides and dynamic animations to explain complex
concepts. To enable rigorous evaluation, we also propose SciVidEval, the first
comprehensive suite for this task, which combines automated metrics for
multimodal content quality and synchronization with a Video-Quiz-based human
evaluation to measure knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms existing commercial scientific video
generation services and approaches human-level quality in scientific
communication.

TL;DR: Proposes P2P framework that uses LLMs as survey respondent proxies to address rising survey costs and demographic imbalances, achieving high-fidelity response reproduction without demographic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address rising costs of survey deployment and demographic imbalance in survey response data by using LLMs as cost-effective, steerable agent proxies for human respondents.

Method: Two-stage alignment: 1) construct diverse agent personas (endowments) simulating respondent profiles, 2) select representative subset using structured prompt engineering, entropy-based sampling, and regression-based selection. Demographic-agnostic approach relying only on aggregate survey results.

Result: Aligned agent populations reproduce aggregate response patterns with high fidelity and exhibit substantial response diversity without demographic conditioning, demonstrated on real-world opinion survey datasets.

Conclusion: Framework provides cost-effective solution for social science research while serving as testbed for studying pluralistic alignment, offering better generalizability and parsimony compared to personalization-heavy approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promise in emulating
human-like responses across a wide range of tasks. In this paper, we propose a
novel alignment framework that treats LLMs as agent proxies for human survey
respondents, affording a cost-effective and steerable solution to two pressing
challenges in the social sciences: the rising cost of survey deployment and the
growing demographic imbalance in survey response data. Drawing inspiration from
the theory of revealed preference, we formulate alignment as a two-stage
problem: constructing diverse agent personas called endowments that simulate
plausible respondent profiles, and selecting a representative subset to
approximate a ground-truth population based on observed data. To implement the
paradigm, we introduce P2P, a system that steers LLM agents toward
representative behavioral patterns using structured prompt engineering,
entropy-based sampling, and regression-based selection. Unlike
personalization-heavy approaches, our alignment approach is
demographic-agnostic and relies only on aggregate survey results, offering
better generalizability and parsimony. Beyond improving data efficiency in
social science research, our framework offers a testbed for studying the
operationalization of pluralistic alignment. We demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach on real-world opinion survey datasets, showing that our aligned agent
populations can reproduce aggregate response patterns with high fidelity and
exhibit substantial response diversity, even without demographic conditioning.

Result: The approach demonstrates strong performance in extracting reliable, high-utility relational knowledge from noisy scientific text and provides a scalable solution for mining complex cause-effect structures.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively extracts structured relational knowledge connecting environmental pollutants to health impacts, offering a reliable and scalable method for analyzing complex toxicity pathways in scientific literature.

Abstract: The widespread use of plastics and their persistence in the environment have
led to the accumulation of micro- and nano-plastics across air, water, and

linking pollutant sources to health impacts, from scientific abstracts. Our
system identifies and connects entities across diverse contexts to construct
structured relational metapaths, which are aggregated into a Toxicity
Trajectory Graph that traces pollutant propagation through exposure routes and
biological systems. Moreover, to ensure consistency and reliability, we
incorporate a dynamic evidence reconciliation module that resolves semantic
conflicts arising from evolving or contradictory research findings. Our
approach demonstrates strong performance in extracting reliable, high-utility
relational knowledge from noisy scientific text and offers a scalable solution
for mining complex cause-effect structures in domain-specific corpora.

*William Farlessyost,Sebastian Oberst,Shweta Singh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Novel framework for optimizing observer-based soft sensors using dynamic causality analysis with LTC networks to identify minimal sensor sets that improve prediction accuracy while aligning with physical principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sensor selection methods based on linearized observability indices or statistical correlations fail to capture temporal evolution and dynamic causal relationships in complex systems.

Method: Uses liquid-time constant (LTC) networks for iterative workflow: train LTC observer, quantify causal impact through perturbation analysis, prune negligible inputs, and retrain until performance degradation occurs.

Result: Demonstrated on three mechanistic testbeds (spring-mass-damper, nonlinear reactor, predator-prey model), the approach consistently identifies minimal sensor sets that improve accuracy while aligning with underlying physics.

Conclusion: The causality-guided framework enhances interpretability by grounding sensor selection in dynamic causal relationships rather than static correlations, offering benefits for soft sensing across engineering, ecological monitoring, and agricultural applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for optimizing observer-based soft
sensors through dynamic causality analysis. Traditional approaches to sensor
selection often rely on linearized observability indices or statistical
correlations that fail to capture the temporal evolution of complex systems. We
address this gap by leveraging liquid-time constant (LTC) networks,
continuous-time neural architectures with input-dependent time constants, to
systematically identify and prune sensor inputs with minimal causal influence
on state estimation. Our methodology implements an iterative workflow: training
an LTC observer on candidate inputs, quantifying each input's causal impact
through controlled perturbation analysis, removing inputs with negligible
effect, and retraining until performance degradation occurs. We demonstrate
this approach on three mechanistic testbeds representing distinct physical
domains: a harmonically forced spring-mass-damper system, a nonlinear
continuous stirred-tank reactor, and a predator-prey model following the
structure of the Lotka-Volterra model, but with seasonal forcing and added
complexity. Results show that our causality-guided pruning consistently
identifies minimal sensor sets that align with underlying physics while
improving prediction accuracy. The framework automatically distinguishes
essential physical measurements from noise and determines when derived
interaction terms provide complementary versus redundant information. Beyond
computational efficiency, this approach enhances interpretability by grounding
sensor selection decisions in dynamic causal relationships rather than static
correlations, offering significant benefits for soft sensing applications
across process engineering, ecological monitoring, and agricultural domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have limitations from static training data and require fine-tuning. AI agents using LLMs face security threats like prompt injection that compromise integrity and reliability.

Method: Framework for integrating Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) into AI agents to provide robust security guardrails.

Result: Enables effective and scalable deployment of AI agents with enhanced security, particularly for on-premises implementations.

Conclusion: RBAC integration addresses critical security vulnerabilities in AI agents, supporting safer industrial applications and real-time decision-making systems.

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced
solutions across various domains, from political science to software
development. However, these models are constrained by their training data,
which is static and limited to information available up to a specific date.
Additionally, their generalized nature often necessitates fine-tuning --
whether for classification or instructional purposes -- to effectively perform
specific downstream tasks. AI agents, leveraging LLMs as their core, mitigate
some of these limitations by accessing external tools and real-time data,
enabling applications such as live weather reporting and data analysis. In
industrial settings, AI agents are transforming operations by enhancing
decision-making, predictive maintenance, and process optimization. For example,
in manufacturing, AI agents enable near-autonomous systems that boost
productivity and support real-time decision-making. Despite these advancements,
AI agents remain vulnerable to security threats, including prompt injection
attacks, which pose significant risks to their integrity and reliability. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a framework for integrating
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) into AI agents, providing a robust security
guardrail. This framework aims to support the effective and scalable deployment
of AI agents, with a focus on on-premises implementations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate precipitation forecasting is crucial for agriculture and disaster management, but challenging due to complex climate systems and heterogeneous multi-source data (radar, satellite, surface measurements) with varying resolutions and domain-specific features.

Method: Developed an Adaptive Mixture of Experts model where each expert specializes in specific modalities or spatio-temporal patterns, with a dynamic router that learns to assign inputs to relevant experts. Also created an interactive web-based visualization tool for exploring weather patterns.

Result: The model significantly outperformed all baseline methods when evaluated on a multimodal climate dataset from Hurricane Ian (2022), demonstrating enhanced predictive accuracy and interpretability.

Conclusion: The Adaptive MoE framework effectively addresses the challenge of integrating heterogeneous climate data sources and provides both accurate predictions and interpretable results, supporting decision-making in climate-sensitive sectors.

Abstract: Accurate precipitation forecasting is indispensable in agriculture, disaster
management, and sustainable strategies. However, predicting rainfall has been
challenging due to the complexity of climate systems and the heterogeneous
nature of multi-source observational data, including radar, satellite imagery,
and surface-level measurements. The multi-source data vary in spatial and
temporal resolution, and they carry domain-specific features, making it
challenging for effective integration in conventional deep learning models.
Previous research has explored various machine learning techniques for weather
prediction; however, most struggle with the integration of data with
heterogeneous modalities. To address these limitations, we propose an Adaptive
Mixture of Experts (MoE) model tailored for precipitation rate prediction. Each
expert within the model specializes in a specific modality or spatio-temporal
pattern. We also incorporated a dynamic router that learns to assign inputs to
the most relevant experts. Our results show that this modular design enhances
predictive accuracy and interpretability. In addition to the modeling
framework, we introduced an interactive web-based visualization tool that
enables users to intuitively explore historical weather patterns over time and
space. The tool was designed to support decision-making for stakeholders in
climate-sensitive sectors. We evaluated our approach using a curated multimodal
climate dataset capturing real-world conditions during Hurricane Ian in 2022.
The benchmark results show that the Adaptive MoE significantly outperformed all
the baselines.

Method: Evaluated 5 representative VLA models using LIBERO benchmark, measuring accuracy with system metrics (latency, throughput, memory) under varying edge power constraints and datacenter GPU configurations.

Result: Identified distinct scaling trends: architectural choices strongly influence throughput/memory; edge devices show non-linear degradation but can match older datacenter GPUs; high-throughput variants achievable without significant accuracy loss.

Conclusion: Provides actionable insights for VLA selection/optimization across deployment constraints, challenging assumptions about datacenter hardware superiority for robotic inference.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as powerful generalist
policies for robotic control, yet their performance scaling across model
architectures and hardware platforms, as well as their associated power
budgets, remain poorly understood. This work presents an evaluation of five
representative VLA models -- spanning state-of-the-art baselines and two newly
proposed architectures -- targeting edge and datacenter GPU platforms. Using
the LIBERO benchmark, we measure accuracy alongside system-level metrics,
including latency, throughput, and peak memory usage, under varying edge power
constraints and high-performance datacenter GPU configurations. Our results
identify distinct scaling trends: (1) architectural choices, such as action
tokenization and model backbone size, strongly influence throughput and memory
footprint; (2) power-constrained edge devices exhibit non-linear performance
degradation, with some configurations matching or exceeding older datacenter
GPUs; and (3) high-throughput variants can be achieved without significant
accuracy loss. These findings provide actionable insights when selecting and
optimizing VLAs across a range of deployment constraints. Our work challenges
current assumptions about the superiority of datacenter hardware for robotic
inference.

Motivation: Current digital health systems are difficult to learn and use, requiring clinicians to manage multiple tools, perform repetitive manual actions, and navigate complex UIs, taking time away from patient care. LLM-based agents show potential for natural language interaction with software systems.

Method: Developed MedicalOS as a domain-specific abstraction layer that translates human instructions into pre-defined healthcare commands (patient inquiry, history retrieval, exam management, etc.) wrapped as tools using machine languages like Python, APIs, MCP, and Linux.

Conclusion: MedicalOS provides a trustworthy and scalable foundation for advancing workflow automation in clinical practice by enabling natural language interaction with healthcare systems while maintaining clinical safety standards.

Abstract: Decades' advances in digital health technologies, such as electronic health
records, have largely streamlined routine clinical processes. Yet, most these
systems are still hard to learn and use: Clinicians often face the burden of
managing multiple tools, repeating manual actions for each patient, navigating
complicated UI trees to locate functions, and spending significant time on
administration instead of caring for patients. The recent rise of large
language model (LLM) based agents demonstrates exceptional capability in coding
and computer operation, revealing the potential for humans to interact with
operating systems and software not by direct manipulation, but by instructing
agents through natural language. This shift highlights the need for an
abstraction layer, an agent-computer interface, that translates human language
into machine-executable commands. In digital healthcare, however, requires a
more domain-specific abstractions that strictly follow trusted clinical
guidelines and procedural standards to ensure safety, transparency, and
compliance. To address this need, we present \textbf{MedicalOS}, a unified
agent-based operational system designed as such a domain-specific abstract
layer for healthcare. It translates human instructions into pre-defined digital
healthcare commands, such as patient inquiry, history retrieval, exam
management, report generation, referrals, treatment planning, that we wrapped
as off-the-shelf tools using machine languages (e.g., Python, APIs, MCP,
Linux). We empirically validate MedicalOS on 214 patient cases across 22
specialties, demonstrating high diagnostic accuracy and confidence, clinically
sound examination requests, and consistent generation of structured reports and
medication recommendations. These results highlight MedicalOS as a trustworthy
and scalable foundation for advancing workflow automation in clinical practice.

### [166] [Task Decoding based on Eye Movements using Synthetic Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11547)
*Shanmuka Sadhu,Arca Baran,Preeti Pandey,Ayush Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Using synthetic data generation (CTGAN, CopulaGAN, Gretel AI) to augment eye movement data significantly improves task decoding accuracy from 28.1% to 82% with Inception Time, supporting Yarbus' hypothesis that tasks can be decoded from eye movements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To support Yarbus' claim that observer tasks can be decoded from eye movements, and address mixed results from traditional ML algorithms by using synthetic data augmentation to improve classification accuracy.

Method: Generate synthetic eye movement data using CTGAN, CopulaGAN, and Gretel AI synthetic data generators on real dataset from user study. Combine real and synthetic data, then evaluate with various ML algorithms including Random Forest and Inception Time.

Result: Significant improvement from 28.1% accuracy (Random Forest) to 82% accuracy (Inception Time) when augmenting 320 real samples with 5x more synthetic data. Framework outperforms all previous studies on this dataset.

Conclusion: Augmenting real eye movement data with synthetically generated data substantially improves task decoding accuracy, validating Yarbus' hypothesis and demonstrating the effectiveness of synthetic data generation for eye-tracking research.

Abstract: Machine learning has been extensively used in various applications related to
eye-tracking research. Understanding eye movement is one of the most
significant subsets of eye-tracking research that reveals the scanning pattern
of an individual. Researchers have thoroughly analyzed eye movement data to
understand various eye-tracking applications, such as attention mechanisms,
navigational behavior, task understanding, etc. The outcome of traditional
machine learning algorithms used for decoding tasks based on eye movement data
has received a mixed reaction to Yarbus' claim that it is possible to decode
the observer's task from their eye movements. In this paper, to support the
hypothesis by Yarbus, we are decoding tasks categories while generating
synthetic data samples using well-known Synthetic Data Generators CTGAN and its
variations such as CopulaGAN and Gretel AI Synthetic Data generators on
available data from an in-person user study. Our results show that augmenting
more eye movement data combined with additional synthetically generated
improves classification accuracy even with traditional machine learning
algorithms. We see a significant improvement in task decoding accuracy from
28.1% using Random Forest to 82% using Inception Time when five times more data
is added in addition to the 320 real eye movement dataset sample. Our proposed
framework outperforms all the available studies on this dataset because of the
use of additional synthetic datasets. We validated our claim with various
algorithms and combinations of real and synthetic data to show how decoding
accuracy increases with the increase in the augmentation of generated data to
real data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MCFR integrates LLMs with model checking for verifiable QA, improving reasoning faithfulness in closed-domain applications


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce unfaithful reasoning traces, and existing neuro-symbolic approaches struggle with dynamic, state-based reasoning needed for procedural correctness in high-stakes domains

Method: MCFR framework that translates natural language into formal specifications and verifies them over transition models using model checking techniques

Result: MCFR improves reasoning faithfulness and interpretability, outperforming state-of-the-art LLMs like ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Claude on the EduMC-QA benchmark

Conclusion: MCFR offers a viable path toward verifiable QA in high-stakes closed-domain applications by combining LLMs with formal verification methods

Abstract: Reasoning is essential for closed-domain QA systems in which procedural
correctness and policy compliance are critical. While large language models
(LLMs) have shown strong performance on many reasoning tasks, recent work
reveals that their reasoning traces are often unfaithful - serving more as
plausible justifications than as causally grounded derivations. Efforts to
combine LLMs with symbolic engines (e.g., Prover9, Z3) have improved
reliability but remain limited to static forms of logic, struggling with
dynamic, state-based reasoning such as multi-step progressions and conditional
transitions.
  In this paper, we propose MCFR (Model Checking for Formal Reasoning), a
neuro-symbolic framework that integrates LLMs with model checking to support
property verification. MCFR translates natural language into formal
specifications and verifies them over transition models. To support evaluation,
we introduce EduMC-QA, a benchmark dataset grounded in real academic
procedures. Our results show that MCFR improves reasoning faithfulness and
interpretability, offering a viable path toward verifiable QA in high-stakes
closed-domain applications. In addition to evaluating MCFR, we compare its
performance with state-of-the-art LLMs such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Claude to
contextualize its effectiveness.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Survey paper on time series reasoning that organizes literature by reasoning topologies (direct, linear chain, branch-structured) and objectives, with evaluation practices and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To define time series reasoning as a distinct problem, organize the literature systematically, and provide guidance for building reliable reasoning systems that handle temporal evidence.

Method: Survey methodology organizing literature by reasoning topology (direct, linear chain, branch-structured) crossed with field objectives, with analysis of methods across domains and evaluation practices.

Result: Comprehensive organization of time series reasoning literature, identification of what each topology enables and where it breaks down, curated datasets and benchmarks, and evaluation guidance.

Conclusion: Time series reasoning requires balancing grounding capacity against computational cost, with future progress depending on utility-focused benchmarks and closed-loop testbeds for reliable systems that understand and act on dynamic worlds.

Abstract: Time series reasoning treats time as a first-class axis and incorporates
intermediate evidence directly into the answer. This survey defines the problem
and organizes the literature by reasoning topology with three families: direct
reasoning in one step, linear chain reasoning with explicit intermediates, and
branch-structured reasoning that explores, revises, and aggregates. The
topology is crossed with the main objectives of the field, including
traditional time series analysis, explanation and understanding, causal
inference and decision making, and time series generation, while a compact tag
set spans these axes and captures decomposition and verification, ensembling,
tool use, knowledge access, multimodality, agent loops, and LLM alignment
regimes. Methods and systems are reviewed across domains, showing what each
topology enables and where it breaks down in faithfulness or robustness, along
with curated datasets, benchmarks, and resources that support study and
deployment (https://github.com/blacksnail789521/Time-Series-Reasoning-Survey).
Evaluation practices that keep evidence visible and temporally aligned are
highlighted, and guidance is distilled on matching topology to uncertainty,
grounding with observable artifacts, planning for shift and streaming, and
treating cost and latency as design budgets. We emphasize that reasoning
structures must balance capacity for grounding and self-correction against
computational cost and reproducibility, while future progress will likely
depend on benchmarks that tie reasoning quality to utility and on closed-loop
testbeds that trade off cost and risk under shift-aware, streaming, and
long-horizon settings. Taken together, these directions mark a shift from
narrow accuracy toward reliability at scale, enabling systems that not only
analyze but also understand, explain, and act on dynamic worlds with traceable
evidence and credible outcomes.

TL;DR: AMLNet is a knowledge-based multi-agent framework that generates synthetic anti-money laundering transaction data with regulatory alignment and achieves high detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anti-money laundering research is constrained by the lack of publicly shareable, regulation-aligned transaction datasets, limiting reproducible experimentation.

Method: A knowledge-based multi-agent framework with two coordinated units: a regulation-aware transaction generator and an ensemble detection pipeline that produces synthetic transactions spanning core laundering phases and advanced typologies.

Result: Generated 1,090,173 synthetic transactions (0.16% laundering-positive) with 75% regulatory alignment and composite technical fidelity score of 0.75. Detection ensemble achieved F1 0.90 (precision 0.84, recall 0.97) and demonstrated generalizability across different synthetic generation paradigms.

Conclusion: AMLNet provides a reproducible, regulation-conscious framework for AML experimentation with released dataset to advance anti-money laundering research.

Abstract: Anti-money laundering (AML) research is constrained by the lack of publicly
shareable, regulation-aligned transaction datasets. We present AMLNet, a
knowledge-based multi-agent framework with two coordinated units: a
regulation-aware transaction generator and an ensemble detection pipeline. The
generator produces 1,090,173 synthetic transactions (approximately 0.16\%
laundering-positive) spanning core laundering phases (placement, layering,
integration) and advanced typologies (e.g., structuring, adaptive threshold
behavior). Regulatory alignment reaches 75\% based on AUSTRAC rule coverage
(Section 4.2), while a composite technical fidelity score of 0.75 summarizes
temporal, structural, and behavioral realism components (Section 4.4). The
detection ensemble achieves F1 0.90 (precision 0.84, recall 0.97) on the
internal test partitions of AMLNet and adapts to the external SynthAML dataset,
indicating architectural generalizability across different synthetic generation
paradigms. We provide multi-dimensional evaluation (regulatory, temporal,
network, behavioral) and release the dataset (Version 1.0,

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: First comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs for Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis self-management reveals significant limitations in interpreting spinal X-rays and AIS care knowledge, with proposed solutions showing partial improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the capability of Multimodal Large Language Models in supporting Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis self-management and identify their limitations in medical imaging interpretation and domain knowledge.

Method: Constructed database of 3,000 X-rays with diagnostic texts, evaluated 5 MLLMs using a 'Divide and Conquer' framework with three tasks: visual question-answering, domain knowledge assessment, and patient education counseling. Enhanced models with spinal keypoint prompting and AIS knowledge base for RAG.

Result: MLLMs showed poor performance in interpreting complex spinal radiographs and AIS care knowledge. Spinal keypoint prompting had varying effectiveness across architectures, while RAG substantially improved knowledge assessment performance. Best accuracy for spinal deformity location detection was 0.55 and for direction detection was 0.13.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs are far from capable of serving as personalized assistants in AIS care, with the greatest challenge being accurate detection of spinal deformity locations and directions.

Abstract: This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) for Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS)
self-management. We constructed a database of approximately 3,000
anteroposterior X-rays with diagnostic texts and evaluated five MLLMs through a
`Divide and Conquer' framework consisting of a visual question-answering task,
a domain knowledge assessment task, and a patient education counseling
assessment task. Our investigation revealed limitations of MLLMs' ability in
interpreting complex spinal radiographs and comprehending AIS care knowledge.
To address these, we pioneered enhancing MLLMs with spinal keypoint prompting
and compiled an AIS knowledge base for retrieval augmented generation (RAG),
respectively. Results showed varying effectiveness of visual prompting across
different architectures, while RAG substantially improved models' performances
on the knowledge assessment task. Our findings indicate current MLLMs are far
from capable in realizing personalized assistant in AIS care. The greatest
challenge lies in their abilities to obtain accurate detections of spinal
deformity locations (best accuracy: 0.55) and directions (best accuracy: 0.13).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HeLoFusion is a novel encoder for multi-agent trajectory prediction that models heterogeneous and multi-scale interactions through local graphs and type-specific networks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on Waymo Open Motion Dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to capture the full richness of complex social dynamics in autonomous driving, particularly multi-scale interactions and diverse behaviors of heterogeneous agents.

Method: Constructs local, multi-scale graphs centered on each agent with aggregation-decomposition message-passing and type-specific feature networks to model both pairwise dependencies and group-wise interactions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Waymo Open Motion Dataset, setting new benchmarks for key metrics including Soft mAP and minADE.

Conclusion: A locality-grounded architecture that explicitly models multi-scale and heterogeneous interactions is highly effective for advancing motion forecasting in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Multi-agent trajectory prediction in autonomous driving requires a
comprehensive understanding of complex social dynamics. Existing methods,
however, often struggle to capture the full richness of these dynamics,
particularly the co-existence of multi-scale interactions and the diverse
behaviors of heterogeneous agents. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces HeLoFusion, an efficient and scalable encoder for modeling
heterogeneous and multi-scale agent interactions. Instead of relying on global
context, HeLoFusion constructs local, multi-scale graphs centered on each
agent, allowing it to effectively model both direct pairwise dependencies and
complex group-wise interactions (\textit{e.g.}, platooning vehicles or
pedestrian crowds). Furthermore, HeLoFusion tackles the critical challenge of
agent heterogeneity through an aggregation-decomposition message-passing scheme
and type-specific feature networks, enabling it to learn nuanced,
type-dependent interaction patterns. This locality-focused approach enables a
principled representation of multi-level social context, yielding powerful and
expressive agent embeddings. On the challenging Waymo Open Motion Dataset,
HeLoFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, setting new benchmarks for
key metrics including Soft mAP and minADE. Our work demonstrates that a
locality-grounded architecture, which explicitly models multi-scale and
heterogeneous interactions, is a highly effective strategy for advancing motion
forecasting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To learn more effective state representations that better capture action-relevant factors in video game environments, improving the modeling of cause-effect relationships between observations and demonstrator actions.

Method: Integrates SupCon loss with continuous output spaces, allowing SupCon to work without constraints on environment action types. Combines contrastive learning with imitation learning frameworks.

Result: Experiments on 3D games (Astro Bot, Returnal) and 2D Atari games show improved representation quality, faster learning convergence, and better generalization compared to supervised action prediction baselines.

Conclusion: SupCon integration with imitation learning effectively enhances state representation learning for game agents, leading to superior performance across various game environments.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel application of Supervised Contrastive Learning
(SupCon) to Imitation Learning (IL), with a focus on learning more effective
state representations for agents in video game environments. The goal is to
obtain latent representations of the observations that capture better the
action-relevant factors, thereby modeling better the cause-effect relationship
from the observations that are mapped to the actions performed by the
demonstrator, for example, the player jumps whenever an obstacle appears ahead.
We propose an approach to integrate the SupCon loss with continuous output
spaces, enabling SupCon to operate without constraints regarding the type of
actions of the environment. Experiments on the 3D games Astro Bot and Returnal,
and multiple 2D Atari games show improved representation quality, faster
learning convergence, and better generalization compared to baseline models
trained only with supervised action prediction loss functions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a system that can process real-time omnimodal streams, recognize multiple users, provide personalized responses, and maintain long-term user knowledge from audiovisual history for lifelong, real-time, and embodied scenarios.

Method: Three asynchronous processes: (1) retrieval process for user identification via face/voice and context gathering, (2) omnimodal dialog process for personalized audio responses, (3) memory management process for detecting dialog boundaries and updating long-term memory from omnimodal streams.

Result: Retrieval and memory management modules achieve over 95% accuracy. Integrated with RoboEgo chatbot, the system achieves fact-consistency scores above 87% in real-time personalized dialogs.

Conclusion: EgoMem establishes a strong baseline for lifelong memory agents in real-time omnimodal processing, demonstrating high accuracy and effectiveness in personalized dialog scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce EgoMem, the first lifelong memory agent tailored for full-duplex
models that process real-time omnimodal streams. EgoMem enables real-time
models to recognize multiple users directly from raw audiovisual streams, to
provide personalized response, and to maintain long-term knowledge of users'
facts, preferences, and social relationships extracted from audiovisual
history. EgoMem operates with three asynchronous processes: (i) a retrieval
process that dynamically identifies user via face and voice, and gathers
relevant context from a long-term memory; (ii) an omnimodal dialog process that
generates personalized audio responses based on the retrieved context; and
(iii) a memory management process that automatically detects dialog boundaries
from omnimodal streams, and extracts necessary information to update the
long-term memory. Unlike existing memory agents for LLMs, EgoMem relies
entirely on raw audiovisual streams, making it especially suitable for
lifelong, real-time, and embodied scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate
that EgoMem's retrieval and memory management modules achieve over 95% accuracy
on the test set. When integrated with a fine-tuned RoboEgo omnimodal chatbot,
the system achieves fact-consistency scores above 87% in real-time personalized
dialogs, establishing a strong baseline for future research.

Motivation: There is a lack of flexible frameworks to implement reinforcement learning across various control problems in building energy management, limiting the adoption of AI-based solutions.

Method: Developed BuildingGym as a research-friendly framework that integrates EnergyPlus simulator, supports system-level and room-level control, accepts external signals, and provides built-in RL algorithms for training control strategies.

Conclusion: BuildingGym bridges the gap between building managers and AI specialists by enabling easy configuration and replacement of RL algorithms, simulators, and control environments, making it suitable for various building energy management applications including smart grid and EV communities.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for AI-based building energy
management. However, there is a lack of flexible framework to implement RL
across various control problems in building energy management. To address this
gap, we propose BuildingGym, an open-source tool designed as a
research-friendly and flexible framework for training RL control strategies for
common challenges in building energy management. BuildingGym integrates
EnergyPlus as its core simulator, making it suitable for both system-level and
room-level control. Additionally, BuildingGym is able to accept external
signals as control inputs instead of taking the building as a stand-alone
entity. This feature makes BuildingGym applicable for more flexible
environments, e.g. smart grid and EVs community. The tool provides several
built-in RL algorithms for control strategy training, simplifying the process
for building managers to obtain optimal control strategies. Users can achieve
this by following a few straightforward steps to configure BuildingGym for
optimization control for common problems in the building energy management
field. Moreover, AI specialists can easily implement and test state-of-the-art
control algorithms within the platform. BuildingGym bridges the gap between
building managers and AI specialists by allowing for the easy configuration and
replacement of RL algorithms, simulators, and control environments or problems.
With BuildingGym, we efficiently set up training tasks for cooling load
management, targeting both constant and dynamic cooling load management. The
built-in algorithms demonstrated strong performance across both tasks,
highlighting the effectiveness of BuildingGym in optimizing cooling strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a unifying theoretical framework that can bridge diverse disciplines (AI, neuroscience, physics, chemistry, materials science) in neuromorphic computing and achieve brain-like efficiency and adaptability.

Method: Proposes dynamical systems theory as the foundational framework, using differential calculus for modeling inference, learning, and control. Utilizes noise as a learning resource and differential genetic programming to discover dynamical systems that implement adaptive behaviors.

Result: The framework enables the development of energy-efficient neuromorphic systems where intelligent behavior emerges from physical substrate dynamics, advancing both AI science and sustainability.

Conclusion: Dynamical systems theory provides the necessary unifying foundation for neuromorphic computing, paving the way for emergent intelligence from physical dynamics and promoting sustainable AI development.

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing seeks to replicate the remarkable efficiency,
flexibility, and adaptability of the human brain in artificial systems. Unlike
conventional digital approaches, which depend on massive computational and
energy resources, neuromorphic systems exploit brain-inspired principles of
computation to achieve orders of magnitude greater energy efficiency. By
drawing on insights from artificial intelligence, neuroscience, physics,
chemistry, and materials science, neuromorphic computing promises to deliver
intelligent systems that are sustainable, transparent, and widely accessible. A
central challenge, however, is to identify a unifying theoretical framework
capable of bridging these diverse disciplines. We argue that dynamical systems
theory provides such a foundation. Rooted in differential calculus, it offers a
principled language for modeling inference, learning, and control in both
natural and artificial substrates. Within this framework, noise can be
harnessed as a resource for learning, while differential genetic programming
enables the discovery of dynamical systems that implement adaptive behaviors.
Embracing this perspective paves the way toward emergent neuromorphic
intelligence, where intelligent behavior arises from the dynamics of physical
substrates, advancing both the science and sustainability of AI.

TL;DR: New metrics RPAD and RRAD evaluate AI medical diagnostics by comparing against multiple expert opinions instead of single references, normalizing performance against inter-expert disagreement for more realistic assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional metrics like precision and recall fail to account for variability in expert judgments, leading to inconsistent AI performance assessments. Cohen's Kappa is more reliable but lacks interpretability.

Method: Introduced Relative Precision and Recall of Algorithmic Diagnostics (RPAD and RRAD) that compare AI outputs against multiple expert opinions. Evaluated using 360 medical dialogues comparing LLMs against physician panels with free-form diagnosis methodology.

Result: Achieved 98% accuracy in automated methodology for establishing identity of free-form clinical diagnoses. Top-performing models like DeepSeek-V3 achieved consistency on par with or exceeding expert consensus. Expert judgments showed significant variability - often greater than AI-human differences.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates limitations of absolute metrics and supports adopting relative metrics in medical AI evaluation, as expert variability exceeds AI-human differences, making relative comparison essential for realistic assessment.

Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into medical diagnostic
workflows requires robust and consistent evaluation methods to ensure
reliability, clinical relevance, and the inherent variability in expert
judgments. Traditional metrics like precision and recall often fail to account
for the inherent variability in expert judgments, leading to inconsistent
assessments of AI performance. Inter-rater agreement statistics like Cohen's
Kappa are more reliable but they lack interpretability. We introduce Relative
Precision and Recall of Algorithmic Diagnostics (RPAD and RRAD) - a new
evaluation metrics that compare AI outputs against multiple expert opinions
rather than a single reference. By normalizing performance against inter-expert
disagreement, these metrics provide a more stable and realistic measure of the
quality of predicted diagnosis. In addition to the comprehensive analysis of
diagnostic quality measures, our study contains a very important side result.
Our evaluation methodology allows us to avoid selecting diagnoses from a
limited list when evaluating a given case. Instead, both the models being
tested and the examiners verifying them arrive at a free-form diagnosis. In
this automated methodology for establishing the identity of free-form clinical
diagnoses, a remarkable 98% accuracy becomes attainable. We evaluate our
approach using 360 medical dialogues, comparing multiple large language models
(LLMs) against a panel of physicians. Large-scale study shows that
top-performing models, such as DeepSeek-V3, achieve consistency on par with or
exceeding expert consensus. Moreover, we demonstrate that expert judgments
exhibit significant variability - often greater than that between AI and
humans. This finding underscores the limitations of any absolute metrics and
supports the need to adopt relative metrics in medical AI.

*Antonin Sulc,Thorsten Hellert*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a neuro-symbolic multi-agent architecture that combines language models with modal logic reasoning to create more robust and verifiable autonomous agents capable of diagnosing complex failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI research focuses on scaling model size and datasets, but neglects scaling the structure, fidelity, and logical consistency of agent reasoning in complex environments that require adaptive decision-making.

Method: A neuro-symbolic multi-agent architecture where individual agents' belief states are formally represented as Kripke models, enabling reasoning about possibility and necessity using modal logic. The approach uses domain-specific knowledge encoded as logical constraints to guide hypothesis generation.

Result: The system successfully diagnoses complex, cascading failures in a high-fidelity simulated particle accelerator environment by combining language models' semantic intuition with rigorous modal logic validation.

Conclusion: This approach provides a viable path toward more robust, reliable, and verifiable autonomous agents by preventing physically or logically untenable conclusions through formal reasoning constraints.

Abstract: The development of intelligent agents, particularly those powered by language
models (LMs), has shown the critical role in various environments that require
intelligent and autonomous decision. Environments are not passive testing
grounds and they represent the data required for agents to learn and exhibit
very challenging conditions that require adaptive, complex and autonomous
capacity to make decisions. While the paradigm of scaling models and datasets
has led to remarkable emergent capabilities, we argue that scaling the
structure, fidelity, and logical consistency of agent reasoning within these
environments is a crucial, yet underexplored, dimension of AI research. This
paper introduces a neuro-symbolic multi-agent architecture where the belief
states of individual agents are formally represented as Kripke models. This
foundational choice enables them to reason about known concepts of
\emph{possibility} and \emph{necessity} using the formal language of modal
logic. In this work, we use of immutable, domain-specific knowledge to make
infere information, which is encoded as logical constraints essential for
proper diagnosis. In the proposed model, we show constraints that actively
guide the hypothesis generation of LMs, effectively preventing them from
reaching physically or logically untenable conclusions. In a high-fidelity
simulated particle accelerator environment, our system successfully diagnoses
complex, cascading failures by combining the powerful semantic intuition of LMs
with the rigorous, verifiable validation of modal logic and a factual world
model and showcasing a viable path toward more robust, reliable, and verifiable
autonomous agents.

*Susanta Mitra*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel temporal graph-based reasoning framework for multimodal medical diagnosis that handles dynamic reasoning through backtracking and multi-agent validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal reasoning models fall short in correct medical diagnosis, and healthcare needs better tools to handle multimodal data and track patient health progression over time.

Method: Temporal graph-based reasoning process using directed graphs with backtracking, content refinement, and multi-agent framework for task distribution and cross-validation of multimodal data across different time points.

Result: Preliminary experiments show the approach has practical utility and novelty in handling dynamic medical reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework addresses multimodal medical reasoning challenges by accommodating dynamic changes and improving diagnostic accuracy through temporal analysis and multi-agent validation.

Abstract: Healthcare and medicine are multimodal disciplines that deal with multimodal
data for reasoning and diagnosing multiple diseases. Although some multimodal
reasoning models have emerged for reasoning complex tasks in scientific
domains, their applications in the healthcare domain remain limited and fall
short in correct reasoning for diagnosis. To address the challenges of
multimodal medical reasoning for correct diagnosis and assist the healthcare
professionals, a novel temporal graph-based reasoning process modelled through
a directed graph has been proposed in the current work. It helps in
accommodating dynamic changes in reasons through backtracking, refining the
reasoning content, and creating new or deleting existing reasons to reach the
best recommendation or answer. Again, consideration of multimodal data at
different time points can enable tracking and analysis of patient health and
disease progression. Moreover, the proposed multi-agent temporal reasoning
framework provides task distributions and a cross-validation mechanism to
further enhance the accuracy of reasoning outputs. A few basic experiments and
analysis results justify the novelty and practical utility of the proposed

*Markus J. Buehler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Decentralized swarm of identical AI models creates coherent musical compositions through peer-to-peer coordination without weight updates, outperforming centralized systems in quality, diversity and structural variety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how coherent long-form creative works can emerge from decentralized systems without centralized control or model updates, providing a compute-efficient alternative to traditional approaches.

Method: A fully decentralized swarm system where bar-wise agents sense and deposit harmonic, rhythmic and structural cues, adapt short-term memory, and reach consensus through stigmergic peer-to-peer signals, compared against a centralized multi-agent system with global critic.

Result: The swarm yields superior quality with greater diversity and structural variety across symbolic, audio, and graph-theoretic analyses, contracting toward stable complementary roles with small-world architecture and efficient connectivity.

Conclusion: MusicSwarm demonstrates that specialization through interaction rules and shared memory rather than parameter updates provides an efficient route to long-horizon creative structure, transferable to writing, design and scientific discovery.

Abstract: We show that coherent, long-form musical composition can emerge from a
decentralized swarm of identical, frozen foundation models that coordinate via
stigmergic, peer-to-peer signals, without any weight updates. We compare a
centralized multi-agent system with a global critic to a fully decentralized
swarm in which bar-wise agents sense and deposit harmonic, rhythmic, and
structural cues, adapt short-term memory, and reach consensus. Across symbolic,
audio, and graph-theoretic analyses, the swarm yields superior quality while
delivering greater diversity and structural variety and leads across creativity
metrics. The dynamics contract toward a stable configuration of complementary
roles, and self-similarity networks reveal a small-world architecture with
efficient long-range connectivity and specialized bridging motifs, clarifying
how local novelties consolidate into global musical form. By shifting
specialization from parameter updates to interaction rules, shared memory, and
dynamic consensus, MusicSwarm provides a compute- and data-efficient route to
long-horizon creative structure that is immediately transferable beyond music
to collaborative writing, design, and scientific discovery.

Abstract: In high-stakes disaster scenarios, timely and informed decision-making is
critical yet often challenged by uncertainty, dynamic environments, and limited
resources. This paper presents a systematic review of Human-AI collaboration
patterns that support decision-making across all disaster management phases.
Drawing from 51 peer-reviewed studies, we identify four major categories:
Human-AI Decision Support Systems, Task and Resource Coordination, Trust and
Transparency, and Simulation and Training. Within these, we analyze
sub-patterns such as cognitive-augmented intelligence, multi-agent
coordination, explainable AI, and virtual training environments. Our review
highlights how AI systems may enhance situational awareness, improves response
efficiency, and support complex decision-making, while also surfacing critical
limitations in scalability, interpretability, and system interoperability. We
conclude by outlining key challenges and future research directions,
emphasizing the need for adaptive, trustworthy, and context-aware Human-AI
systems to improve disaster resilience and equitable recovery outcomes.

### [181] [When Safe Unimodal Inputs Collide: Optimizing Reasoning Chains for Cross-Modal Safety in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12060)
*Wei Cai,Shujuan Liu,Jian Zhao,Ziyan Shi,Yusheng Zhao,Yuchen Yuan,Tianle Zhang,Chi Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MLLMs have implicit reasoning risks where safe unimodal inputs combine into dangerous multimodal outputs. The paper introduces SSUI dataset and SRPO training framework to align MLLM reasoning with human safety values, achieving SOTA results on safety benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs are vulnerable to implicit reasoning risks where harmless individual inputs can combine to produce harmful outputs through long-chain reasoning, due to difficulty maintaining safety alignment.

Method: Created Safe-Semantics-but-Unsafe-Interpretation (SSUI) dataset with interpretable reasoning paths, and developed Safety-aware Reasoning Path Optimization (SRPO) training framework to align MLLM reasoning with safety values.

Result: SRPO-trained models achieved state-of-the-art performance on safety benchmarks including the proposed Reasoning Path Benchmark (RSBench), significantly outperforming both open-source and top commercial MLLMs.

Conclusion: The SSUI dataset and SRPO framework effectively address implicit reasoning risks in MLLMs by aligning internal reasoning processes with human safety values, demonstrating superior safety performance compared to existing models.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are susceptible to the implicit
reasoning risk, wherein innocuous unimodal inputs synergistically assemble into
risky multimodal data that produce harmful outputs. We attribute this
vulnerability to the difficulty of MLLMs maintaining safety alignment through
long-chain reasoning. To address this issue, we introduce
Safe-Semantics-but-Unsafe-Interpretation (SSUI), the first dataset featuring
interpretable reasoning paths tailored for such a cross-modal challenge. A
novel training framework, Safety-aware Reasoning Path Optimization (SRPO), is
also designed based on the SSUI dataset to align the MLLM's internal reasoning
process with human safety values. Experimental results show that our
SRPO-trained models achieve state-of-the-art results on key safety benchmarks,
including the proposed Reasoning Path Benchmark (RSBench), significantly
outperforming both open-source and top-tier commercial MLLMs.

### [182] [Bridging Engineering and AI Planning through Model-Based Knowledge Transformation for the Validation of Automated Production System Variants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12091)
*Hamied Nabizada,Lasse Beers,Alain Chahine,Felix Gehlhoff,Oliver Niggemann,Alexander Fay*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A model-driven method for generating symbolic planning artifacts from SysML-based engineering models to enable AI planning validation of system variants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MBSE models lack symbolic planning semantics (preconditions, effects, constraints) needed to evaluate system variant performance and task fulfillment capabilities.

Method: Developed a dedicated SysML profile with reusable stereotypes for planning constructs, integrated into existing models, and an algorithm that automatically generates PDDL domain and problem files.

Result: Successfully demonstrated through aircraft assembly case study, showing how engineering models can be enriched with planning semantics and generate consistent planning artifacts.

Conclusion: The method enables native integration of planning semantics into engineering models and maintains consistency between engineering and planning artifacts, supporting AI planning-based validation of system variants.

Abstract: Engineering models created in Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)
environments contain detailed information about system structure and behavior.
However, they typically lack symbolic planning semantics such as preconditions,
effects, and constraints related to resource availability and timing. This
limits their ability to evaluate whether a given system variant can fulfill
specific tasks and how efficiently it performs compared to alternatives.
  To address this gap, this paper presents a model-driven method that enables
the specification and automated generation of symbolic planning artifacts
within SysML-based engineering models. A dedicated SysML profile introduces
reusable stereotypes for core planning constructs. These are integrated into
existing model structures and processed by an algorithm that generates a valid
domain file and a corresponding problem file in Planning Domain Definition
Language (PDDL). In contrast to previous approaches that rely on manual
transformations or external capability models, the method supports native
integration and maintains consistency between engineering and planning
artifacts.
  The applicability of the method is demonstrated through a case study from
aircraft assembly. The example illustrates how existing engineering models are
enriched with planning semantics and how the proposed workflow is applied to
generate consistent planning artifacts from these models. The generated
planning artifacts enable the validation of system variants through AI
planning.

*Yubo Li,Weiyi Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BiCA enables bidirectional co-alignment where humans and AI mutually adapt through learnable protocols, achieving superior collaboration and safety compared to traditional single-directional alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI alignment methods treat human cognition as fixed while only AI adapts to human preferences. This paper proposes a paradigm shift to bidirectional co-evolution where both humans and AI mutually adapt.

Method: Bidirectional Cognitive Alignment (BiCA) uses learnable protocols, representation mapping, and KL-budget constraints to enable controlled co-evolution between humans and AI systems.

Result: BiCA achieved 85.5% success rate (vs 70.3% baseline), 230% better mutual adaptation, 332% better protocol convergence, 84% outperformance over handcrafted protocols, and 23% improved out-of-distribution robustness.

Conclusion: Optimal collaboration exists at the intersection of human and AI capabilities, validating the shift from single-directional to co-alignment paradigms with demonstrated synergy improvement of 46%.

Abstract: Current AI alignment through RLHF follows a single directional paradigm that
AI conforms to human preferences while treating human cognition as fixed. We
propose a shift to co-alignment through Bidirectional Cognitive Alignment
(BiCA), where humans and AI mutually adapt. BiCA uses learnable protocols,
representation mapping, and KL-budget constraints for controlled co-evolution.
In collaborative navigation, BiCA achieved 85.5% success versus 70.3% baseline,
with 230% better mutual adaptation and 332% better protocol convergence.
Emergent protocols outperformed handcrafted ones by 84%, while bidirectional
adaptation unexpectedly improved safety (+23% out-of-distribution robustness).
The 46% synergy improvement demonstrates optimal collaboration exists at the
intersection, not union, of human and AI capabilities, validating the shift
from single-directional to co-alignment paradigms.

TL;DR: LLMs outperform physicians in complex medical diagnosis tasks but struggle with image interpretation and literature retrieval. The study introduces CPC-Bench benchmark and Dr. CaBot AI system for medical reasoning evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in AI evaluations that focus only on final diagnoses without assessing the comprehensive reasoning and presentation skills required of expert medical discussants in clinical case conferences.

Method: Used 7102 Clinicopathological Conferences and 1021 Image Challenges to create CPC-Bench, a physician-validated benchmark with 10 tasks. Evaluated leading LLMs and developed Dr. CaBot AI system to produce medical presentations mimicking human experts.

Result: OpenAI's o3 model ranked first in 60% of diagnoses and top-ten in 84% of cases, outperforming 20 physicians. CaBot presentations were misclassified as human in 74% of trials and scored more favorably than human experts across quality dimensions.

Conclusion: LLMs exceed physician performance in text-based differential diagnosis and can convincingly emulate expert medical presentations, though image interpretation and literature retrieval remain challenging areas needing improvement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: For over a century, the New England Journal of Medicine
Clinicopathological Conferences (CPCs) have tested the reasoning of expert
physicians and, recently, artificial intelligence (AI). However, prior AI
evaluations have focused on final diagnoses without addressing the multifaceted
reasoning and presentation skills required of expert discussants.
  METHODS: Using 7102 CPCs (1923-2025) and 1021 Image Challenges (2006-2025),
we conducted extensive physician annotation and automated processing to create
CPC-Bench, a physician-validated benchmark spanning 10 text-based and
multimodal tasks, against which we evaluated leading large language models
(LLMs). Then, we developed "Dr. CaBot," an AI discussant designed to produce
written and slide-based video presentations using only the case presentation,
modeling the role of the human expert in these cases.
  RESULTS: When challenged with 377 contemporary CPCs, o3 (OpenAI) ranked the
final diagnosis first in 60% of cases and within the top ten in 84% of cases,
outperforming a 20-physician baseline; next-test selection accuracy reached
98%. Event-level physician annotations quantified AI diagnostic accuracy per
unit of information. Performance was lower on literature search and image
tasks; o3 and Gemini 2.5 Pro (Google) achieved 67% accuracy on image
challenges. In blinded comparisons of CaBot vs. human expert-generated text,
physicians misclassified the source of the differential in 46 of 62 (74%) of
trials, and scored CaBot more favorably across quality dimensions. To promote
research, we are releasing CaBot and CPC-Bench.
  CONCLUSIONS: LLMs exceed physician performance on complex text-based
differential diagnosis and convincingly emulate expert medical presentations,
but image interpretation and literature retrieval remain weaker. CPC-Bench and
CaBot may enable transparent and continued tracking of progress in medical AI.

*Gang Cheng,Haibo Jin,Wenbin Zhang,Haohan Wang,Jun Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Financial LLMs are vulnerable to Risk-Concealment Attacks that bypass safety measures, achieving 93% success rate on mainstream models including GPT-4.1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing red-teaming research focuses on harmful content but neglects regulatory risks in financial applications of LLMs, creating a critical safety gap.

Method: Developed Risk-Concealment Attacks (RCA) - a multi-turn framework that iteratively conceals regulatory risks to provoke compliant-looking but regulatory-violating responses. Created FIN-Bench benchmark for systematic evaluation.

Result: RCA achieved 93.18% average attack success rate across nine mainstream LLMs, including 98.28% on GPT-4.1 and 97.56% on OpenAI o1, revealing significant vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: Current alignment techniques have critical gaps in financial domains, highlighting urgent need for stronger moderation mechanisms and domain-aware LLM safety approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into financial
applications, yet existing red-teaming research primarily targets harmful
content, largely neglecting regulatory risks. In this work, we aim to
investigate the vulnerability of financial LLMs through red-teaming approaches.
We introduce Risk-Concealment Attacks (RCA), a novel multi-turn framework that
iteratively conceals regulatory risks to provoke seemingly compliant yet
regulatory-violating responses from LLMs. To enable systematic evaluation, we
construct FIN-Bench, a domain-specific benchmark for assessing LLM safety in
financial contexts. Extensive experiments on FIN-Bench demonstrate that RCA
effectively bypasses nine mainstream LLMs, achieving an average attack success
rate (ASR) of 93.18%, including 98.28% on GPT-4.1 and 97.56% on OpenAI o1.
These findings reveal a critical gap in current alignment techniques and
underscore the urgent need for stronger moderation mechanisms in financial
domains. We hope this work offers practical insights for advancing robust and
domain-aware LLM alignment.

*Iván Vicente Moreno Cencerrado,Arnau Padrés Masdemont,Anton Gonzalvez Hawthorne,David Demitri Africa,Lorenzo Pacchiardi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can internally predict answer correctness before generating responses, with linear probes trained on trivia questions generalizing to diverse knowledge tasks, though mathematical reasoning poses challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs have internal mechanisms that anticipate answer correctness before generating responses, and to understand how this self-assessment capability emerges and generalizes across different domains.

Method: Extract activations after question reading but before token generation, train linear probes to predict forthcoming answer correctness across three open-source model families (7-70B parameters) using generic trivia questions.

Result: Probes trained on trivia questions successfully predict correctness in-distribution and on diverse out-of-distribution knowledge datasets, outperforming black-box baselines and verbal confidence. Predictive power saturates in intermediate layers, and models' "I don't know" responses strongly correlate with probe scores.

Conclusion: LLMs develop internal self-assessment capabilities that emerge mid-computation, with the same direction capturing both correctness prediction and confidence, though mathematical reasoning presents a generalization challenge.

Abstract: Do large language models (LLMs) anticipate when they will answer correctly?
To study this, we extract activations after a question is read but before any
tokens are generated, and train linear probes to predict whether the model's
forthcoming answer will be correct. Across three open-source model families
ranging from 7 to 70 billion parameters, projections on this "in-advance
correctness direction" trained on generic trivia questions predict success in
distribution and on diverse out-of-distribution knowledge datasets,
outperforming black-box baselines and verbalised predicted confidence.
Predictive power saturates in intermediate layers, suggesting that
self-assessment emerges mid-computation. Notably, generalisation falters on
questions requiring mathematical reasoning. Moreover, for models responding "I
don't know", doing so strongly correlates with the probe score, indicating that
the same direction also captures confidence. By complementing previous results
on truthfulness and other behaviours obtained with probes and sparse
auto-encoders, our work contributes essential findings to elucidate LLM
internals.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Computational morphology tools like GlossLM show strong technical performance but fail to meet real-world usability needs in language documentation, requiring user-centered design integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the disconnect between computational morphology research and practical language documentation needs, where research outputs see limited real-world use despite technical advancements.

Method: Position paper with case study of GlossLM (multilingual IGT generation model) and small-scale user study with three documentary linguists to evaluate usability in real documentation contexts.

Result: Despite strong metric-based performance, the system fails to meet core usability needs in documentation settings, revealing issues with model constraints, label standardization, segmentation, and personalization.

Conclusion: User-centered design is essential for creating effective computational morphology tools and surfaces richer research directions; without systematic UCD integration, the field risks becoming decontextualized and ineffectual.

Abstract: Computational morphology has the potential to support language documentation
through tasks like morphological segmentation and the generation of Interlinear
Glossed Text (IGT). However, our research outputs have seen limited use in
real-world language documentation settings. This position paper situates the
disconnect between computational morphology and language documentation within a
broader misalignment between research and practice in NLP and argues that the
field risks becoming decontextualized and ineffectual without systematic
integration of User-Centered Design (UCD). To demonstrate how principles from
UCD can reshape the research agenda, we present a case study of GlossLM, a
state-of-the-art multilingual IGT generation model. Through a small-scale user
study with three documentary linguists, we find that despite strong metric
based performance, the system fails to meet core usability needs in real
documentation contexts. These insights raise new research questions around
model constraints, label standardization, segmentation, and personalization. We
argue that centering users not only produces more effective tools, but surfaces
richer, more relevant research directions

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Entropy neurons in LLMs suppress context copying behavior when contextual information conflicts with parametric knowledge, and ablating these neurons significantly alters generation processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs handle conflicting information between context and internal knowledge, specifically investigating the role of entropy neurons in inhibiting context copying behavior.

Method: Investigated entropy neurons in autoregressive transformer models by analyzing their impact on output entropy and token ranking, and performed ablation studies to observe changes in generation behavior.

Result: Entropy neurons are responsible for suppressing context copying across various LLMs, and their ablation leads to significant changes in the generation process when handling conflicting information.

Conclusion: These findings enhance our understanding of LLM internal dynamics when processing conflicting contextual and parametric information, revealing the specific role of entropy neurons in context suppression.

Abstract: The behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) when facing contextual
information that conflicts with their internal parametric knowledge is
inconsistent, with no generally accepted explanation for the expected outcome
distribution. Recent work has identified in autoregressive transformer models a
class of neurons -- called entropy neurons -- that produce a significant effect
on the model output entropy while having an overall moderate impact on the
ranking of the predicted tokens. In this paper, we investigate the preliminary
claim that these neurons are involved in inhibiting context copying behavior in
transformers by looking at their role in resolving conflicts between contextual
and parametric information. We show that entropy neurons are responsible for
suppressing context copying across a range of LLMs, and that ablating them
leads to a significant change in the generation process. These results enhance
our understanding of the internal dynamics of LLMs when handling conflicting
information.

TL;DR: EthosAgents is a lightweight pluralistic alignment approach that simulates diverse perspectives and values to improve LLM outputs in healthcare and other high-stakes domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing alignment approaches fall short in healthcare where personal, cultural, and situational factors shape pluralism, creating a need for models that respect diverse values across populations.

Method: Proposed EthosAgents approach designed to simulate diverse perspectives and values, tested across seven varying-sized open and closed models for three different modes.

Result: Empirically demonstrated that EthosAgents advances pluralistic alignment across all three modes and various model sizes, showing improved respect for diversity.

Conclusion: Health-related pluralism requires adaptable and normatively aware approaches, and EthosAgents offers insights for better respecting diversity in high-stakes domains beyond healthcare.

Abstract: As large language models are increasingly deployed in sensitive domains such
as healthcare, ensuring their outputs reflect the diverse values and
perspectives held across populations is critical. However, existing alignment
approaches, including pluralistic paradigms like Modular Pluralism, often fall
short in the health domain, where personal, cultural, and situational factors
shape pluralism. Motivated by the aforementioned healthcare challenges, we
propose a first lightweight, generalizable, pluralistic alignment approach,
EthosAgents, designed to simulate diverse perspectives and values. We
empirically show that it advances the pluralistic alignment for all three modes
across seven varying-sized open and closed models. Our findings reveal that
health-related pluralism demands adaptable and normatively aware approaches,
offering insights into how these models can better respect diversity in other
high-stakes domains.

TL;DR: Struct-Bench is a framework and benchmark for evaluating differentially private synthetic data generation methods on structured datasets containing natural language, using Context-Free Grammars to represent dataset structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing synthetic data evaluation techniques struggle to capture structural properties and correlations in structured datasets with natural language components, which are common in enterprise settings but lack proper evaluation standards.

Method: Proposes Struct-Bench framework requiring users to represent dataset structure as Context-Free Grammars (CFGs), includes 5 real-world and 2 synthetic datasets annotated with CFGs, and provides reference implementations of metrics and a leaderboard.

Result: The benchmark demonstrates significant challenges for state-of-the-art DP synthetic data generation methods and provides a standardized evaluation platform for researchers to benchmark privacy-preserving methods.

Conclusion: Struct-Bench offers a comprehensive evaluation framework that enables standardized benchmarking and improvement of DP synthetic data generation quality on structured datasets with natural language components.

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) synthetic data generation is a promising
technique for utilizing private datasets that otherwise cannot be exposed for
model training or other analytics. While much research literature has focused
on generating private unstructured text and image data, in enterprise settings,
structured data (e.g., tabular) is more common, often including natural
language fields or components. Existing synthetic data evaluation techniques
(e.g., FID) struggle to capture the structural properties and correlations of
such datasets. In this work, we propose Struct-Bench, a framework and benchmark
for evaluating synthetic datasets derived from structured datasets that contain
natural language data. The Struct-Bench framework requires users to provide a
representation of their dataset structure as a Context-Free Grammar (CFG). Our
benchmark comprises 5 real-world and 2 synthetically generated datasets, each
annotated with CFGs. We show that these datasets demonstrably present a great
challenge even for state-of-the-art DP synthetic data generation methods.
Struct-Bench also includes reference implementations of different metrics and a
leaderboard, thereby providing researchers a standardized evaluation platform
to benchmark and investigate privacy-preserving synthetic data generation
methods. Further, we also present a case study showing how to use Struct-Bench
to improve the synthetic data quality of Private Evolution (PE) on structured
data. The benchmark and the leaderboard have been publicly made available at

TL;DR: SearchInstruct is a method for automatically generating high-quality instruction datasets for supervised fine-tuning of LLMs by expanding limited human-generated questions with LLM augmentation and retrieving domain-specific resources for accurate answer generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating suitable training datasets for domain-specific SFT is challenging due to unique domain constraints and data scarcity, requiring an automated approach to generate diverse and high-quality instruction-response pairs.

Method: Starts with limited human-generated domain questions, systematically expands them using LLM, then dynamically retrieves domain-relevant resources to generate accurate contextually appropriate answers for each augmented question.

Result: Enhances both diversity and quality of SFT datasets, leading to measurable improvements in LLM performance within specialized domains, and also facilitates model editing tasks for efficient model updates.

Conclusion: SearchInstruct provides an effective automated solution for generating high-quality instruction datasets, addressing domain-specific data scarcity and improving LLM fine-tuning performance, with additional applications in model editing.

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is essential for training large language models
(LLMs), significantly enhancing critical capabilities such as instruction
following and in-context learning. Nevertheless, creating suitable training
datasets tailored for specific domains remains challenging due to unique domain
constraints and data scarcity. In this paper, we propose SearchInstruct, an
innovative method explicitly designed to construct high quality instruction
datasets for SFT. Our approach begins with a limited set of domain specific,
human generated questions, which are systematically expanded using a large
language model. Subsequently, domain relevant resources are dynamically
retrieved to generate accurate and contextually appropriate answers for each
augmented question. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that SearchInstruct
enhances both the diversity and quality of SFT datasets, leading to measurable
improvements in LLM performance within specialized domains. Additionally, we
show that beyond dataset generation, the proposed method can also effectively
facilitate tasks such as model editing, enabling efficient updates to existing
models. To facilitate reproducibility and community adoption, we provide full
implementation details, the complete set of generated instruction response
pairs, and the source code in a publicly accessible Git repository:

*Zaur Gouliev,Jennifer Waters,Chengqian Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Systematic comparison of 5 multilingual transformer models for disinformation detection across 25 languages, revealing performance variations and limitations in low-resource settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Disinformation spreads rapidly across languages but most AI models are benchmarked only on English, creating a gap in multilingual disinformation detection capabilities.

Method: Evaluated mBERT, XLM, XLM-RoBERTa, RemBERT, and mT5 on fake-vs-true classification using PolyTruth Disinfo Corpus - 60,486 statement pairs across 25 languages covering 5 language families and diverse topics.

Result: RemBERT achieved better overall accuracy, especially in low-resource languages, while mBERT and XLM showed significant limitations when training data was scarce.

Conclusion: The study reveals both potential and current limitations of AI systems for multilingual disinformation detection, with performance patterns varying by model and language resource availability.

Abstract: Disinformation spreads rapidly across linguistic boundaries, yet most AI
models are still benchmarked only on English. We address this gap with a
systematic comparison of five multilingual transformer models: mBERT, XLM,
XLM-RoBERTa, RemBERT, and mT5 on a common fake-vs-true machine learning
classification task. While transformer-based language models have demonstrated
notable success in detecting disinformation in English, their effectiveness in
multilingual contexts still remains up for debate. To facilitate evaluation, we
introduce PolyTruth Disinfo Corpus, a novel corpus of 60,486 statement pairs
(false claim vs. factual correction) spanning over twenty five languages that
collectively cover five language families and a broad topical range from
politics, health, climate, finance, and conspiracy, half of which are
fact-checked disinformation claims verified by an augmented MindBugs Discovery
dataset. Our experiments revealed performance variations. Models such as
RemBERT achieved better overall accuracy, particularly excelling in
low-resource languages, whereas models like mBERT and XLM exhibit considerable
limitations when training data is scarce. We provide a discussion of these
performance patterns and implications for real-world deployment. The dataset is
publicly available on our GitHub repository to encourage further
experimentation and advancement. Our findings illuminate both the potential and
the current limitations of AI systems for multilingual disinformation
detection.

*Mobina Pournemat,Keivan Rezaei,Gaurang Sriramanan,Arman Zarei,Jiaxiang Fu,Yang Wang,Hamid Eghbalzadeh,Soheil Feizi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Comprehensive study shows LLMs have inconsistent probabilistic reasoning abilities, with performance gaps between model sizes, notation sensitivity, and context length degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate LLMs' probabilistic reasoning capabilities over explicit discrete probability distributions, as current models exhibit unclear and inconsistent behavior in probabilistic tasks.

Method: Evaluated LLMs on three tasks (mode identification, maximum likelihood estimation, sample generation) using prompting techniques to query joint distributions and conditionals, testing frequency analysis, marginalization, and generative behavior.

Result: Larger models outperform smaller ones in probabilistic inference and show surprising sample generation capabilities, but models are sensitive to notation variations and suffer over 60% performance degradation with increasing context length.

Conclusion: The study provides detailed understanding of LLMs' probabilistic reasoning limitations and identifies key areas for future improvement, particularly in notation robustness and context handling.

Abstract: Despite widespread success in language understanding and generation, large
language models (LLMs) exhibit unclear and often inconsistent behavior when
faced with tasks that require probabilistic reasoning. In this work, we present
the first comprehensive study of the reasoning capabilities of LLMs over
explicit discrete probability distributions. Given observations from a
probability distribution, we evaluate models on three carefully designed tasks,
mode identification, maximum likelihood estimation, and sample generation, by
prompting them to provide responses to queries about either the joint
distribution or its conditionals. These tasks thus probe a range of
probabilistic skills, including frequency analysis, marginalization, and
generative behavior. Through comprehensive empirical evaluations, we
demonstrate that there exists a clear performance gap between smaller and
larger models, with the latter demonstrating stronger inference and surprising
capabilities in sample generation. Furthermore, our investigations reveal
notable limitations, including sensitivity to variations in the notation
utilized to represent probabilistic outcomes and performance degradation of
over 60% as context length increases. Together, our results provide a detailed
understanding of the probabilistic reasoning abilities of LLMs and identify key
directions for future improvement.

*Ozan Gokdemir,Neil Getty,Robert Underwood,Sandeep Madireddy,Franck Cappello,Arvind Ramanathan,Ian T. Foster,Rick L. Stevens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A scalable framework for generating multiple-choice question benchmarks from scientific papers, with a case study showing reasoning-trace retrieval helps small models outperform GPT-4 on cancer biology exams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific knowledge grows rapidly, requiring evolving benchmarks to test language models on current literature and ensure they reflect new discoveries.

Method: Automated pipeline for MCQA creation including PDF parsing, semantic chunking, question generation, and model evaluation. Uses retrieval-augmented generation with paper-derived semantic chunks and reasoning traces distilled from GPT-4.1.

Result: Generated 16,000+ MCQs from 22,000 radiation/cancer biology papers. Reasoning-trace retrieval consistently improved performance, enabling small models (1.1B-14B parameters) to surpass GPT-4 on the 2023 Astro Radiation and Cancer Biology exam.

Conclusion: The framework successfully creates scalable scientific benchmarks, and reasoning-trace retrieval is an effective method for enhancing small language model performance on specialized scientific domains.

Abstract: As scientific knowledge grows at an unprecedented pace, evaluation benchmarks
must evolve to reflect new discoveries and ensure language models are tested on
current, diverse literature. We propose a scalable, modular framework for
generating multiple-choice question-answering (MCQA) benchmarks directly from
large corpora of scientific papers. Our pipeline automates every stage of MCQA
creation, including PDF parsing, semantic chunking, question generation, and
model evaluation. As a case study, we generate more than 16,000 MCQs from
22,000 open-access articles in radiation and cancer biology. We then evaluate a
suite of small language models (1.1B-14B parameters) on these questions,
comparing baseline accuracy with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) from
paper-derived semantic chunks and from reasoning traces distilled from GPT-4.1.
We find that reasoning-trace retrieval consistently improves performance on
both synthetic and expert-annotated benchmarks, enabling several small models
to surpass GPT-4 on the 2023 Astro Radiation and Cancer Biology exam.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RECAP is an inference-time framework that improves emotional reasoning in medical AI by 22-28% on 8B models and 10-13% on larger models through structured emotional reasoning without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models in healthcare often deliver medically sound but emotionally flat advice, missing critical emotional cues that are essential for patient care, especially when patients are distressed and vulnerable.

Method: RECAP (Reflect-Extract-Calibrate-Align-Produce) framework uses structured emotional reasoning with transparent appraisal-theoretic stages and per-dimension Likert signals to produce nuanced, auditable responses without model retraining.

Result: Significant improvements in emotional reasoning: 22-28% on 8B models and 10-13% on larger models over zero-shot baselines across EmoBench, SECEU, and EQ-Bench. Clinician evaluations confirm superior empathetic communication.

Conclusion: Modular, theory-grounded prompting can systematically enhance emotional intelligence in medical AI while preserving the accountability required for clinical deployment.

Abstract: Large language models in healthcare often miss critical emotional cues,
delivering medically sound but emotionally flat advice. This is especially
problematic in clinical contexts where patients are distressed and vulnerable,
and require empathic communication to support safety, adherence, and trust. We
present RECAP (Reflect-Extract-Calibrate-Align-Produce), an inference-time
framework that adds structured emotional reasoning without retraining. By
decomposing empathy into transparent appraisal-theoretic stages and exposing
per-dimension Likert signals, RECAP produces nuanced, auditable responses.
Across EmoBench, SECEU, and EQ-Bench, RECAP improves emotional reasoning by
22-28% on 8B models and 10-13% on larger models over zero-shot baselines.
Clinician evaluations further confirm superior empathetic communication. RECAP
shows that modular, theory-grounded prompting can systematically enhance
emotional intelligence in medical AI while preserving the accountability
required for deployment.

### [198] [Judge Q: Trainable Queries for Optimized Information Retention in KV Cache Eviction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10798)
*Yijun Liu,Yixuan Wang,Yuzhuang Xu,Shiyu Ji,Yang Xu,Qingfu Zhu,Wanxiang Che*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Judge Q is a novel training method that uses soft tokens to improve KV cache eviction by capturing global information, reducing performance degradation while maintaining low training costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current KV cache eviction methods focus too much on local information from the last window, potentially missing crucial global context, which affects memory usage and decoding efficiency in large language models.

Method: Propose Judge Q method that adds a soft token list at the end of input sequences and trains these tokens' attention maps to align with actual decoded tokens, tuning only the embedding layer at low cost.

Result: Under same eviction budget, shows less performance degradation - improves by ~1 point on LongBench and over 3 points on RULER benchmarks with Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 models.

Conclusion: The method effectively captures global information for better KV importance evaluation, maintains decoding quality during eviction, and can be easily integrated into existing models with minimal training overhead.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) utilize key-value (KV) cache to store historical
information during sequence processing. The size of KV cache grows linearly as
the length of the sequence extends, which seriously affects memory usage and
decoding efficiency. Current methods for KV cache eviction typically utilize
the last window from the pre-filling phase as queries to compute the KV
importance scores for eviction. Although this scheme is simple to implement, it
tends to overly focus on local information, potentially leading to the neglect
or omission of crucial global information. To mitigate this issue, we propose
Judge Q, a novel training method which incorporates a soft token list. This
method only tunes the model's embedding layer at a low training cost. By
concatenating the soft token list at the end of the input sequence, we train
these tokens' attention map to the original input sequence to align with that
of the actual decoded tokens. In this way, the queries corresponding to the
soft tokens can effectively capture global information and better evaluate the
importance of the keys and values within the KV cache, thus maintaining
decoding quality when KV cache is evicted. Under the same eviction budget, our
method exhibits less performance degradation compared to existing eviction
approaches. We validate our approach through experiments conducted on models
such as Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, using benchmarks
including LongBench, RULER, and Needle-in-a-Haystack. Results indicate an
improvement of approximately 1 point on the LongBench and over 3 points on
RULER. This proposed methodology can be seamlessly integrated into existing
open-source models with minimal training overhead, thereby enhancing
performance in KV cache eviction scenarios.

### [199] [Towards Automated Error Discovery: A Study in Conversational AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10833)
*Dominic Petrak,Thy Thy Tran,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework called Automated Error Discovery with SEEED implementation that detects unknown errors in conversational AI using enhanced contrastive learning, outperforming LLM baselines by up to 8% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based conversational agents still produce undesirable errors that are hard to detect, especially those not explicitly specified in instructions or arising from model updates and user behavior shifts.

Method: Proposes SEEED (Soft Clustering Extended Encoder-Based Error Detection) with enhanced Soft Nearest Neighbor Loss (amplifying negative sample distance weighting) and Label-Based Sample Ranking for better contrastive representation learning.

Result: Outperforms adapted baselines including GPT-4o and Phi-4 across multiple error-annotated dialogue datasets, improving unknown error detection accuracy by up to 8 points with strong generalization to unknown intent detection.

Conclusion: The SEEED framework provides an effective encoder-based approach for automated error discovery in conversational AI, demonstrating superior performance over LLM-based methods for detecting unspecified and emerging errors.

Abstract: Although LLM-based conversational agents demonstrate strong fluency and
coherence, they still produce undesirable behaviors (errors) that are
challenging to prevent from reaching users during deployment. Recent research
leverages large language models (LLMs) to detect errors and guide
response-generation models toward improvement. However, current LLMs struggle
to identify errors not explicitly specified in their instructions, such as
those arising from updates to the response-generation model or shifts in user
behavior. In this work, we introduce Automated Error Discovery, a framework for
detecting and defining errors in conversational AI, and propose SEEED (Soft
Clustering Extended Encoder-Based Error Detection), as an encoder-based
approach to its implementation. We enhance the Soft Nearest Neighbor Loss by
amplifying distance weighting for negative samples and introduce Label-Based
Sample Ranking to select highly contrastive examples for better representation
learning. SEEED outperforms adapted baselines -- including GPT-4o and Phi-4 --
across multiple error-annotated dialogue datasets, improving the accuracy for
detecting unknown errors by up to 8 points and demonstrating strong
generalization to unknown intent detection.

### [200] [Evaluating Large Language Models for Evidence-Based Clinical Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10843)
*Can Wang,Yiqun Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show promise for clinical question answering but performance varies significantly based on source structure and evidence quality, with retrieval-augmented prompting improving accuracy when using relevant source materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rigorously evaluate LLMs' ability to answer nuanced, evidence-based clinical questions from diverse sources including systematic reviews and clinical guidelines.

Method: Curated multi-source benchmark from Cochrane reviews and clinical guidelines, tested GPT-4o-mini and GPT-5 with various prompting strategies including retrieval-augmented generation using PubMed abstracts.

Result: 90% accuracy on structured guidelines, 60-70% on narrative/systematic review questions. Citation count strongly correlates with accuracy. Retrieval with gold-source abstracts improved accuracy to 79%, while relevant PubMed abstracts reached 23% and random abstracts reduced performance.

Conclusion: Source clarity and targeted retrieval drive performance more than model size. Retrieval-augmented prompting improves factual accuracy, but stratified evaluation by specialty and question type remains essential for understanding LLM capabilities in clinical contexts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial progress in
biomedical and clinical applications, motivating rigorous evaluation of their
ability to answer nuanced, evidence-based questions. We curate a multi-source
benchmark drawing from Cochrane systematic reviews and clinical guidelines,
including structured recommendations from the American Heart Association and
narrative guidance used by insurers. Using GPT-4o-mini and GPT-5, we observe
consistent performance patterns across sources and clinical domains: accuracy
is highest on structured guideline recommendations (90%) and lower on narrative
guideline and systematic review questions (60--70%). We also find a strong
correlation between accuracy and the citation count of the underlying
systematic reviews, where each doubling of citations is associated with roughly
a 30% increase in the odds of a correct answer. Models show moderate ability to
reason about evidence quality when contextual information is supplied. When we
incorporate retrieval-augmented prompting, providing the gold-source abstract
raises accuracy on previously incorrect items to 0.79; providing top 3 PubMed
abstracts (ranked by semantic relevance) improves accuracy to 0.23, while
random abstracts reduce accuracy (0.10, within temperature variation). These
effects are mirrored in GPT-4o-mini, underscoring that source clarity and
targeted retrieval -- not just model size -- drive performance. Overall, our
results highlight both the promise and current limitations of LLMs for
evidence-based clinical question answering. Retrieval-augmented prompting
emerges as a useful strategy to improve factual accuracy and alignment with
source evidence, while stratified evaluation by specialty and question type
remains essential to understand current knowledge access and to contextualize
model performance.

### [201] [GAPrune: Gradient-Alignment Pruning for Domain-Aware Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10844)
*Yixuan Tang,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GAPrune is a novel pruning framework that distinguishes between general and domain-specific parameters using Fisher Information and gradient alignment, achieving effective model compression while preserving domain performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain-specific embedding models outperform general models but are resource-intensive due to large parameter counts. Existing pruning methods treat all parameters uniformly, failing to distinguish between general semantic representations and domain-specific patterns.

Method: Uses Fisher Information to measure importance and general-domain gradient alignment to assess parameter behavior, combining these signals with Domain Alignment Importance (DAI) scoring. Lower DAI scores indicate parameters less important for domain tasks or causing conflicts between objectives.

Result: Maintains performance within 2.5% of dense models at 50% sparsity in one-shot pruning. With 100-step retraining, achieves +4.51% improvement on FinMTEB and +1.73% on ChemTEB, outperforming all baselines.

Conclusion: Principled pruning strategies can achieve both model compression and enhanced domain specialization, providing a new approach for developing efficient domain-specific embedding models.

Abstract: Domain-specific embedding models have shown promise for applications that
require specialized semantic understanding, such as coding agents and financial
retrieval systems, often achieving higher performance gains than general
models. However, state-of-the-art embedding models are typically based on LLMs,
which contain billions of parameters, making deployment challenging in
resource-constrained environments. Model compression through pruning offers a
promising solution, but existing pruning methods treat all parameters
uniformly, failing to distinguish between general semantic representations and
domain-specific patterns, leading to suboptimal pruning decisions. Thus, we
propose GAPrune, a pruning framework that addresses this challenge by
considering both domain importance and preserving general linguistic
foundation. Our method uses Fisher Information to measure importance and
general-domain gradient alignment to assess parameter behavior, then combines
these signals using our Domain Alignment Importance (DAI) scoring. Lower DAI
scores indicate that the parameter is either less important for the domain task
or creates conflicts between domain and general objectives. Experiments on two
domain benchmarks, FinMTEB and ChemTEB, show that GAPrune maintains performance
within 2.5% of dense models in one-shot pruning at 50% sparsity, while
outperforming all baselines. With retraining in 100 steps, GAPrune achieves
+4.51% improvement on FinMTEB and +1.73% on ChemTEB, demonstrating that our
pruning strategy not only preserves but enhances domain-specific capabilities.
Our findings demonstrate that principled pruning strategies can achieve model
compression and enhanced domain specialization, providing the research
community with a new approach for development.

*Liqian Feng,Lintao Wang,Kun Hu,Dehui Kong,Zhiyong Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Text2SignDiff: A gloss-free sign language production method using diffusion models to directly translate spoken text to sign language sequences without intermediate gloss representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SLP methods rely on gloss annotations which are often unavailable and language-specific, limiting flexibility and generalization. There's a need for gloss-free approaches to bridge the communication gap for deaf communities.

Method: Proposes a gloss-free latent diffusion model that generates sign sequences from noisy latent codes and spoken text through non-autoregressive iterative denoising. Includes a cross-modal signing aligner to bridge visual and textual content in a shared latent space.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on PHOENIX14T and How2Sign datasets, demonstrating effectiveness without gloss annotations.

Conclusion: The proposed diffusion-based approach enables accurate and contextually relevant sign language generation directly from spoken text, eliminating the need for gloss intermediate representations and improving generalization.

Abstract: Sign language production (SLP) aims to translate spoken language sentences
into a sequence of pose frames in a sign language, bridging the communication
gap and promoting digital inclusion for deaf and hard-of-hearing communities.
Existing methods typically rely on gloss, a symbolic representation of sign
language words or phrases that serves as an intermediate step in SLP. This
limits the flexibility and generalization of SLP, as gloss annotations are
often unavailable and language-specific. Therefore, we present a novel
diffusion-based generative approach - Text2Sign Diffusion (Text2SignDiff) for
gloss-free SLP. Specifically, a gloss-free latent diffusion model is proposed
to generate sign language sequences from noisy latent sign codes and spoken
text jointly, reducing the potential error accumulation through a
non-autoregressive iterative denoising process. We also design a cross-modal
signing aligner that learns a shared latent space to bridge visual and textual
content in sign and spoken languages. This alignment supports the conditioned
diffusion-based process, enabling more accurate and contextually relevant sign
language generation without gloss. Extensive experiments on the commonly used
PHOENIX14T and How2Sign datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method,
achieving the state-of-the-art performance.

### [203] [A funny companion: Distinct neural responses to perceived AI- versus human- generated humor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10847)
*Xiaohui Rao,Hanlin Wu,Zhenguang G. Cai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: People find AI humor as funny as human humor, but brain activity shows different processing patterns - AI humor requires less cognitive effort but elicits more surprise and emotional response, with neural responses improving over time as expectations adapt.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how people cognitively and emotionally respond to AI humor as AI companions become capable of human-like communication including joke-telling, and to compare neural processing of humor from AI versus human sources.

Method: Used electroencephalography (EEG) to measure brain activity while participants processed humor from AI and human sources, combined with behavioral ratings of funniness.

Result: Behavioral ratings showed AI and human humor were rated equally funny. Neurophysiological data revealed AI humor elicited smaller N400 (reduced cognitive effort) but larger LPP (greater surprise/emotional response). AI humor showed increasing processing efficiency and emotional reward over time, while human humor showed habituation effects. Social attitudes toward AI modulated neural responses.

Conclusion: The brain responds to AI humor with surprisingly positive and intense reactions, demonstrating how cognitive adaptation to AI's language patterns can lead to intensified emotional reward, challenging algorithm aversion and highlighting humor's potential for fostering genuine engagement in human-AI interaction.

Abstract: As AI companions become capable of human-like communication, including
telling jokes, understanding how people cognitively and emotionally respond to
AI humor becomes increasingly important. This study used electroencephalography
(EEG) to compare how people process humor from AI versus human sources.
Behavioral analysis revealed that participants rated AI and human humor as
comparably funny. However, neurophysiological data showed that AI humor
elicited a smaller N400 effect, suggesting reduced cognitive effort during the
processing of incongruity. This was accompanied by a larger Late Positive
Potential (LPP), indicating a greater degree of surprise and emotional
response. This enhanced LPP likely stems from the violation of low initial
expectations regarding AI's comedic capabilities. Furthermore, a key temporal
dynamic emerged: human humor showed habituation effects, marked by an
increasing N400 and a decreasing LPP over time. In contrast, AI humor
demonstrated increasing processing efficiency and emotional reward, with a
decreasing N400 and an increasing LPP. This trajectory reveals how the brain
can dynamically update its predictive model of AI capabilities. This process of
cumulative reinforcement challenges "algorithm aversion" in humor, as it
demonstrates how cognitive adaptation to AI's language patterns can lead to an
intensified emotional reward. Additionally, participants' social attitudes
toward AI modulated these neural responses, with higher perceived AI
trustworthiness correlating with enhanced emotional engagement. These findings
indicate that the brain responds to AI humor with surprisingly positive and
intense reactions, highlighting humor's potential for fostering genuine
engagement in human-AI social interaction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PREMem shifts complex reasoning from response generation to memory construction, creating enriched memory representations that improve conversational AI performance across all model sizes while reducing computational demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current conversational AI systems place excessive reasoning burden on response generation, making performance heavily dependent on model sizes. Effective long-term memory requires synthesizing information across multiple sessions.

Method: PREMem extracts fine-grained memory fragments categorized into factual, experiential, and subjective information, then establishes explicit relationships between memory items across sessions to capture evolution patterns like extensions, transformations, and implications.

Result: Experiments show significant performance improvements across all model sizes, with smaller models achieving results comparable to much larger baselines while maintaining effectiveness even with constrained token budgets.

Conclusion: By performing reasoning during pre-storage rather than response generation, PREMem creates enriched memory representations while reducing computational demands during interactions, enabling more effective long-term memory in conversational AI.

Abstract: Effective long-term memory in conversational AI requires synthesizing
information across multiple sessions. However, current systems place excessive
reasoning burden on response generation, making performance significantly
dependent on model sizes. We introduce PREMem (Pre-storage Reasoning for
Episodic Memory), a novel approach that shifts complex reasoning processes from
inference to memory construction. PREMem extracts fine-grained memory fragments
categorized into factual, experiential, and subjective information; it then
establishes explicit relationships between memory items across sessions,
capturing evolution patterns like extensions, transformations, and
implications. By performing this reasoning during pre-storage rather than when
generating a response, PREMem creates enriched representations while reducing
computational demands during interactions. Experiments show significant
performance improvements across all model sizes, with smaller models achieving
results comparable to much larger baselines while maintaining effectiveness
even with constrained token budgets. Code and dataset are available at

*Shaohua Fang,Yue Li,Yan Cong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs generally prefer surface scope interpretations like humans, with some showing language-specific inverse scope patterns similar to human tendencies across English and Chinese.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine how LLMs handle quantifier scope ambiguities across different languages (English and Chinese) and assess their alignment with human interpretive patterns.

Method: Cross-linguistic approach using probabilities to assess interpretive likelihood, with Human Similarity (HS) scores to quantify how closely LLMs emulate human performance across language groups.

Result: Most LLMs prefer surface scope interpretations (aligning with humans), some differentiate English vs Chinese inverse scope preferences (reflecting human patterns), and HS scores show variability in human approximation.

Conclusion: Model architecture, scale, and particularly pre-training data language background significantly influence how closely LLMs approximate human quantifier scope interpretations, though overall alignment potential is notable.

Abstract: Sentences with multiple quantifiers often lead to interpretive ambiguities,
which can vary across languages. This study adopts a cross-linguistic approach
to examine how large language models (LLMs) handle quantifier scope
interpretation in English and Chinese, using probabilities to assess
interpretive likelihood. Human similarity (HS) scores were used to quantify the
extent to which LLMs emulate human performance across language groups. Results
reveal that most LLMs prefer the surface scope interpretations, aligning with
human tendencies, while only some differentiate between English and Chinese in
the inverse scope preferences, reflecting human-similar patterns. HS scores
highlight variability in LLMs' approximation of human behavior, but their
overall potential to align with humans is notable. Differences in model
architecture, scale, and particularly models' pre-training data language
background, significantly influence how closely LLMs approximate human
quantifier scope interpretations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Term2Note is a differentially private method for generating synthetic clinical notes that separates content and form, achieving high fidelity and utility while maintaining strong privacy guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy concerns in healthcare limit the use of real-world training data for machine learning models. Differentially private synthetic data offers a solution but balancing privacy and utility is challenging for clinical note synthesis due to domain specificity and long-form text complexity.

Method: Term2Note structurally separates content and form, generating section-wise note content conditioned on differentially private medical terms with separate DP constraints. It uses a DP quality maximizer to select high-quality outputs.

Result: Term2Note produces synthetic notes with statistical properties closely aligned with real clinical notes (strong fidelity). Classification models trained on synthetic notes perform comparably to those trained on real data (high utility), outperforming existing DP text generation baselines.

Conclusion: Term2Note demonstrates potential as a viable privacy-preserving alternative to using sensitive clinical notes, achieving substantial improvements in both fidelity and utility while operating under fewer assumptions than existing methods.

Abstract: Training data is fundamental to the success of modern machine learning
models, yet in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, the use of real-world
training data is severely constrained by concerns over privacy leakage. A
promising solution to this challenge is the use of differentially private (DP)
synthetic data, which offers formal privacy guarantees while maintaining data
utility. However, striking the right balance between privacy protection and
utility remains challenging in clinical note synthesis, given its domain
specificity and the complexity of long-form text generation. In this paper, we
present Term2Note, a methodology to synthesise long clinical notes under strong
DP constraints. By structurally separating content and form, Term2Note
generates section-wise note content conditioned on DP medical terms, with each
governed by separate DP constraints. A DP quality maximiser further enhances
synthetic notes by selecting high-quality outputs. Experimental results show
that Term2Note produces synthetic notes with statistical properties closely
aligned with real clinical notes, demonstrating strong fidelity. In addition,
multi-label classification models trained on these synthetic notes perform
comparably to those trained on real data, confirming their high utility.
Compared to existing DP text generation baselines, Term2Note achieves
substantial improvements in both fidelity and utility while operating under
fewer assumptions, suggesting its potential as a viable privacy-preserving
alternative to using sensitive clinical notes.

Motivation: Current cultural benchmarks for LLMs suffer from fragmented taxonomies, domain specificity, and heavy reliance on manual annotation, limiting scalable evaluation of cultural competence.

Method: Developed a comprehensive hierarchical multilingual cultural taxonomy and used Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with factual knowledge to synthesize culturally relevant question-answer pairs.

Result: Created CultureSynth-7 benchmark with 19,360 entries (4,149 manually verified) across 7 languages. Evaluation of 14 LLMs showed ChatGPT-4o-Latest and Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct lead performance, with 3B parameters needed for basic competence, architectural biases, and geographic disparities.

Conclusion: CultureSynth provides a scalable framework for developing culturally aware AI systems while reducing manual annotation dependency, enabling better assessment of LLM cultural competence in global contexts.

Abstract: Cultural competence, defined as the ability to understand and adapt to
multicultural contexts, is increasingly vital for large language models (LLMs)
in global environments. While several cultural benchmarks exist to assess LLMs'
cultural competence, current evaluations suffer from fragmented taxonomies,
domain specificity, and heavy reliance on manual data annotation. To address
these limitations, we introduce CultureSynth, a novel framework comprising (1)
a comprehensive hierarchical multilingual cultural taxonomy covering 12 primary
and 130 secondary topics, and (2) a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based
methodology leveraging factual knowledge to synthesize culturally relevant
question-answer pairs. The CultureSynth-7 synthetic benchmark contains 19,360
entries and 4,149 manually verified entries across 7 languages. Evaluation of
14 prevalent LLMs of different sizes reveals clear performance stratification
led by ChatGPT-4o-Latest and Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct. The results demonstrate that
a 3B-parameter threshold is necessary for achieving basic cultural competence,
models display varying architectural biases in knowledge processing, and
significant geographic disparities exist across models. We believe that
CultureSynth offers a scalable framework for developing culturally aware AI
systems while reducing reliance on manual annotation\footnote{Benchmark is

*Tsuyoshi Iwata,Guillaume Comte,Melissa Flores,Ryoma Kondo,Ryohei Hisano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A semi-automatic method using ontology design, pattern modeling, and LLMs to convert ESG principles into RDF templates for extracting structured knowledge from news to identify sustainability guideline non-compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing need for accurate ESG data alignment with international frameworks like UN Global Compact and SDGs, but challenges exist due to abstract language and lack of standardized taxonomies.

Method: Uses lightweight ontology design, formal pattern modeling, and large language models to convert normative principles into reusable RDF templates for extracting information from news content to build structured knowledge graphs.

Result: Creates a scalable and transparent framework that links reported ESG incidents to specific international sustainability framework principles.

Conclusion: Provides an effective approach for structured knowledge representation of ESG events that enables better identification and interpretation of non-compliance with international sustainability guidelines.

Abstract: The growing importance of environmental, social, and governance data in
regulatory and investment contexts has increased the need for accurate,
interpretable, and internationally aligned representations of non-financial
risks, particularly those reported in unstructured news sources. However,
aligning such controversy-related data with principle-based normative
frameworks, such as the United Nations Global Compact or Sustainable
Development Goals, presents significant challenges. These frameworks are
typically expressed in abstract language, lack standardized taxonomies, and
differ from the proprietary classification systems used by commercial data
providers. In this paper, we present a semi-automatic method for constructing
structured knowledge representations of environmental, social, and governance
events reported in the news. Our approach uses lightweight ontology design,
formal pattern modeling, and large language models to convert normative
principles into reusable templates expressed in the Resource Description
Framework. These templates are used to extract relevant information from news
content and populate a structured knowledge graph that links reported incidents
to specific framework principles. The result is a scalable and transparent
framework for identifying and interpreting non-compliance with international
sustainability guidelines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional summaries prioritize comprehensive coverage but may lack engagement. The goal is to create narratives that foster deeper reader engagement with source material by emphasizing intriguing content.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Fine-tuning a large language model on benchmark data, 2) Alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Uses new datasets curated specifically for this work.

Result: The model demonstrates precision in identifying key elements, enhances readability, and boosts engagement value of original documents.

Conclusion: Spotlight represents a novel paradigm shift from comprehensive summaries to engaging narratives, successfully achieving higher reader engagement through selective emphasis on compelling content.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Spotlight, a novel paradigm for information
extraction that produces concise, engaging narratives by highlighting the most
compelling aspects of a document. Unlike traditional summaries, which
prioritize comprehensive coverage, spotlights selectively emphasize intriguing
content to foster deeper reader engagement with the source material. We
formally differentiate spotlights from related constructs and support our
analysis with a detailed benchmarking study using new datasets curated for this
work. To generate high-quality spotlights, we propose a two-stage approach:
fine-tuning a large language model on our benchmark data, followed by alignment
via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our comprehensive evaluation
demonstrates that the resulting model not only identifies key elements with
precision but also enhances readability and boosts the engagement value of the
original document.

TL;DR: A two-stage explainable clickbait detection model that identifies clickbait headlines and attributes them to specific linguistic manipulation strategies, using synthetic data and comparing BERT with LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of explainability in existing clickbait detection systems and improve trustworthiness of AI systems for combating manipulative media content.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Detection stage comparing fine-tuned BERT with GPT-4.0 and Gemini 2.4 Flash using zero-shot and few-shot prompting, 2) Strategy attribution stage using dedicated BERT-based classifier on synthetic dataset generated from real news headlines.

Result: Developed an explainable clickbait detection system that not only detects clickbait but also identifies specific manipulation tactics, with publicly available synthetic dataset for research.

Conclusion: This work advances transparent AI systems for media content analysis and provides a valuable dataset for controlled experimentation in clickbait detection research.

Abstract: The proliferation of clickbait headlines poses significant challenges to the
credibility of information and user trust in digital media. While recent
advances in machine learning have improved the detection of manipulative
content, the lack of explainability limits their practical adoption. This paper
presents a model for explainable clickbait detection that not only identifies
clickbait titles but also attributes them to specific linguistic manipulation
strategies. We introduce a synthetic dataset generated by systematically
augmenting real news headlines using a predefined catalogue of clickbait
strategies. This dataset enables controlled experimentation and detailed
analysis of model behaviour. We present a two-stage framework for automatic
clickbait analysis comprising detection and tactic attribution. In the first
stage, we compare a fine-tuned BERT classifier with large language models
(LLMs), specifically GPT-4.0 and Gemini 2.4 Flash, under both zero-shot
prompting and few-shot prompting enriched with illustrative clickbait headlines
and their associated persuasive tactics. In the second stage, a dedicated
BERT-based classifier predicts the specific clickbait strategies present in
each headline. This work advances the development of transparent and
trustworthy AI systems for combating manipulative media content. We share the
dataset with the research community at

*Haokun Li,Yazhou Zhang,Jizhi Ding,Qiuchi Li,Peng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EmoBench-Reddit is a hierarchical benchmark for evaluating multimodal emotion understanding in MLLMs, featuring 350 curated Reddit samples with images, text, and emotion categories, progressing from basic perception to advanced cognition tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation benchmarks focus on objective visual question answering and captioning, inadequately assessing models' ability to understand complex and subjective human emotions in multimodal contexts.

Method: Created a dataset of 350 samples from Reddit with images, user-provided text, and emotion categories (sad, humor, sarcasm, happy). Designed hierarchical tasks with six multiple-choice and one open-ended question per sample, progressing from perception (basic visual elements) to cognition (scene reasoning, intent understanding, empathy). Used AI assistance (Claude 4) and manual verification for annotation quality.

Result: The paper introduces EmoBench-Reddit as a comprehensive benchmark that addresses the gap in evaluating multimodal emotion understanding capabilities of MLLMs.

Conclusion: EmoBench-Reddit provides a novel framework for assessing MLLMs' ability to understand complex human emotions through hierarchical tasks that bridge basic perception with advanced cognitive and empathetic reasoning.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), they
have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across a variety of vision-language
tasks. However, current evaluation benchmarks predominantly focus on objective
visual question answering or captioning, inadequately assessing the models'
ability to understand complex and subjective human emotions. To bridge this
gap, we introduce EmoBench-Reddit, a novel, hierarchical benchmark for
multimodal emotion understanding. The dataset comprises 350 meticulously
curated samples from the social media platform Reddit, each containing an
image, associated user-provided text, and an emotion category (sad, humor,
sarcasm, happy) confirmed by user flairs. We designed a hierarchical task
framework that progresses from basic perception to advanced cognition, with
each data point featuring six multiple-choice questions and one open-ended
question of increasing difficulty. Perception tasks evaluate the model's
ability to identify basic visual elements (e.g., colors, objects), while
cognition tasks require scene reasoning, intent understanding, and deep empathy
integrating textual context. We ensured annotation quality through a
combination of AI assistance (Claude 4) and manual verification.

*Valentin Hofmann,David Heineman,Ian Magnusson,Kyle Lo,Jesse Dodge,Maarten Sap,Pang Wei Koh,Chun Wang,Hannaneh Hajishirzi,Noah A. Smith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fluid Benchmarking is a new adaptive evaluation approach for language models that uses item response theory and dynamic item selection to improve efficiency, validity, and reduce variance compared to static benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LM benchmarking faces challenges including high evaluation costs, poor measurement of intended capabilities, labeling errors, and benchmark saturation. Existing solutions address individual issues in isolation rather than improving overall evaluation quality.

Method: Fluid Benchmarking estimates an item response model from existing LM evaluation results and uses the inferred quantities to dynamically select evaluation items, similar to computerized adaptive testing in education. It combines item response theory (to map performance into latent ability space) with dynamic item selection.

Result: Fluid Benchmarking achieves superior performance across four dimensions - efficiency, validity, variance, and saturation. It shows higher validity and less variance on MMLU with fifty times fewer items compared to random sampling and other IRT-based baselines.

Conclusion: LM benchmarking can be substantially improved by moving beyond static evaluation to adaptive approaches like Fluid Benchmarking, which combines psychometric principles with dynamic item selection to provide more efficient and accurate evaluations.

Abstract: Language model (LM) benchmarking faces several challenges: comprehensive
evaluations are costly, benchmarks often fail to measure the intended
capabilities, and evaluation quality can degrade due to labeling errors and
benchmark saturation. Although various strategies have been proposed to
mitigate these issues, they tend to address individual aspects in isolation,
neglecting broader questions about overall evaluation quality. Here, we
introduce Fluid Benchmarking, a new evaluation approach that advances LM
benchmarking across multiple dimensions. Inspired by psychometrics, Fluid
Benchmarking is based on the insight that the relative value of benchmark items
depends on an LM's capability level, suggesting that evaluation should adapt to
each LM. Methodologically, Fluid Benchmarking estimates an item response model
based on existing LM evaluation results and uses the inferred quantities to
select evaluation items dynamically, similar to computerized adaptive testing
in education. In our experiments, we compare Fluid Benchmarking against the
common practice of random item sampling as well as more sophisticated
baselines, including alternative methods grounded in item response theory. We
examine four dimensions -- efficiency, validity, variance, and saturation --
and find that Fluid Benchmarking achieves superior performance in all of them
(e.g., higher validity and less variance on MMLU with fifty times fewer items).
Our analysis shows that the two components of Fluid Benchmarking have distinct
effects: item response theory, used to map performance into a latent ability
space, increases validity, while dynamic item selection reduces variance.
Overall, our results suggest that LM benchmarking can be substantially improved
by moving beyond static evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes PAN-DG task for personality-driven argumentation-based negotiation dialogue generation and introduces PACT dataset with three personality profiles for tourism sector negotiations, showing fine-tuned LLMs effectively generate personalized rational responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance negotiation dialogue systems by integrating argumentation mechanisms and personality attributes for better conflict resolution and adaptability to individual preferences and styles.

Method: Created PACT dataset using LLMs with three personality profiles (Argumentation, Preference, Buying Style) for tourism negotiations. Conducted comparative experiments between pre-trained and fine-tuned LLMs for the PAN-DG task.

Result: Automatic and manual evaluations confirmed high-quality dialogues in PACT dataset. Fine-tuned LLMs effectively generated personality-driven rational responses during negotiations in multi-dimensional evaluation.

Conclusion: PACT dataset effectively enhances personalization and reasoning capabilities in negotiation dialogue systems, establishing a foundation for future research in personality-driven argumentation-based negotiation.

Abstract: Integrating argumentation mechanisms into negotiation dialogue systems
improves conflict resolution through exchanges of arguments and critiques.
Moreover, incorporating personality attributes enhances adaptability by
aligning interactions with individuals' preferences and styles. To advance
these capabilities in negotiation dialogue systems, we propose a novel
Personality-driven Argumentation-based Negotiation Dialogue Generation (PAN-DG)
task. To support this task, we introduce PACT, a dataset of Personality-driven
Argumentation-based negotiation Conversations for Tourism sector. This dataset,
generated using Large Language Models (LLMs), features three distinct
personality profiles, viz. Argumentation Profile, Preference Profile, and
Buying Style Profile to simulate a variety of negotiation scenarios involving
diverse personalities. Thorough automatic and manual evaluations indicate that
the dataset comprises high-quality dialogues. Further, we conduct comparative
experiments between pre-trained and fine-tuned LLMs for the PAN-DG task.
Multi-dimensional evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned LLMs effectively
generate personality-driven rational responses during negotiations. This
underscores the effectiveness of PACT in enhancing personalization and
reasoning capabilities in negotiation dialogue systems, thereby establishing a
foundation for future research in this domain.

*Hongxu Zhou,Hylke Westerdijk,Khondoker Ittehadul Islam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Context and emotional tone metadata often harm LLM performance in fallacy classification, with emotional tone biasing models toward Appeal to Emotion fallacies and basic prompts outperforming enhanced ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how context and emotional tone metadata affect LLM reasoning and performance in fallacy classification tasks within political debate settings.

Method: Used Qwen-3 (8B) model with data from U.S. presidential debates, testing six fallacy types through various prompting strategies including Pragma-Dialectics and Periodic Table of Arguments frameworks against baseline prompts under three input settings: text-only, text with context, and text with context plus audio-based emotional tone metadata.

Result: Theoretical prompting improved interpretability but context and emotional tone metadata often lowered performance. Emotional tone metadata biased the model toward labeling statements as Appeal to Emotion, worsening logical reasoning. Basic prompts frequently outperformed enhanced ones.

Conclusion: Attention dilution from added inputs may worsen fallacy classification in LLMs, with emotional tone metadata particularly problematic as it biases reasoning and reduces classification accuracy.

Abstract: This study investigates how context and emotional tone metadata influence
large language model (LLM) reasoning and performance in fallacy classification
tasks, particularly within political debate settings. Using data from U.S.
presidential debates, we classify six fallacy types through various prompting
strategies applied to the Qwen-3 (8B) model. We introduce two theoretically
grounded Chain-of-Thought frameworks: Pragma-Dialectics and the Periodic Table
of Arguments, and evaluate their effectiveness against a baseline prompt under
three input settings: text-only, text with context, and text with both context
and audio-based emotional tone metadata. Results suggest that while theoretical
prompting can improve interpretability and, in some cases, accuracy, the
addition of context and especially emotional tone metadata often leads to
lowered performance. Emotional tone metadata biases the model toward labeling
statements as \textit{Appeal to Emotion}, worsening logical reasoning. Overall,
basic prompts often outperformed enhanced ones, suggesting that attention
dilution from added inputs may worsen rather than improve fallacy
classification in LLMs.

*Shiyao Cui,Xijia Feng,Yingkang Wang,Junxiao Yang,Zhexin Zhang,Biplab Sikdar,Hongning Wang,Han Qiu,Minlie Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Emojis can trigger toxic content generation in LLMs by bypassing safety mechanisms, with experiments showing emojis easily induce toxicity across multiple languages and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Observation that emojis, typically associated with friendliness, may actually trigger toxic content generation in large language models, prompting investigation into this phenomenon.

Method: Automated construction of prompts with emojis to subtly express toxic intent, tested across 5 languages on 7 LLMs with jailbreak tasks, followed by model-level interpretations and pre-training corpus analysis.

Result: Prompts with emojis could easily induce toxicity generation in LLMs, with emojis acting as a heterogeneous semantic channel to bypass safety mechanisms, and correlation found between emoji-related data pollution and toxicity behaviors.

Conclusion: Emojis present a significant vulnerability in LLM safety mechanisms, serving as effective triggers for toxic content generation that bypasses existing safeguards, highlighting the need for improved safety measures.

Abstract: Emojis are globally used non-verbal cues in digital communication, and
extensive research has examined how large language models (LLMs) understand and
utilize emojis across contexts. While usually associated with friendliness or
playfulness, it is observed that emojis may trigger toxic content generation in
LLMs. Motivated by such a observation, we aim to investigate: (1) whether
emojis can clearly enhance the toxicity generation in LLMs and (2) how to
interpret this phenomenon. We begin with a comprehensive exploration of
emoji-triggered LLM toxicity generation by automating the construction of
prompts with emojis to subtly express toxic intent. Experiments across 5
mainstream languages on 7 famous LLMs along with jailbreak tasks demonstrate
that prompts with emojis could easily induce toxicity generation. To understand
this phenomenon, we conduct model-level interpretations spanning semantic
cognition, sequence generation and tokenization, suggesting that emojis can act
as a heterogeneous semantic channel to bypass the safety mechanisms. To pursue
deeper insights, we further probe the pre-training corpus and uncover potential
correlation between the emoji-related data polution with the toxicity
generation behaviors. Supplementary materials provide our implementation code
and data. (Warning: This paper contains potentially sensitive contents)

*Felix Wang,Boyu Chen,Kerun Xu,Bo Tang,Feiyu Xiong,Zhiyu Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Text2Mem is a unified memory operation language that provides standardized natural language to execution for LLM agent memory systems, addressing limitations of existing frameworks with a formal specification and comprehensive operation set.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agent memory frameworks are limited with only basic primitives and lack formal specifications, causing unpredictable behavior and inconsistent support for higher-order operations.

Method: Text2Mem defines a JSON-based schema with required fields and semantic invariants, uses a parser to create typed operation objects, includes validation for correctness, and provides adapters for backend integration with unified execution contract.

Result: The system ensures safety, determinism, and portability across heterogeneous backends, establishing a standardized foundation for memory control in agents.

Conclusion: Text2Mem provides the first standardized memory operation language for LLM agents, with planned benchmark Text2Mem Bench to enable systematic evaluation of memory systems.

Abstract: Large language model agents increasingly depend on memory to sustain long
horizon interaction, but existing frameworks remain limited. Most expose only a
few basic primitives such as encode, retrieve, and delete, while higher order
operations like merge, promote, demote, split, lock, and expire are missing or
inconsistently supported. Moreover, there is no formal and executable
specification for memory commands, leaving scope and lifecycle rules implicit
and causing unpredictable behavior across systems. We introduce Text2Mem, a
unified memory operation language that provides a standardized pathway from
natural language to reliable execution. Text2Mem defines a compact yet
expressive operation set aligned with encoding, storage, and retrieval. Each
instruction is represented as a JSON based schema instance with required fields
and semantic invariants, which a parser transforms into typed operation objects
with normalized parameters. A validator ensures correctness before execution,
while adapters map typed objects either to a SQL prototype backend or to real
memory frameworks. Model based services such as embeddings or summarization are
integrated when required. All results are returned through a unified execution
contract. This design ensures safety, determinism, and portability across
heterogeneous backends. We also outline Text2Mem Bench, a planned benchmark
that separates schema generation from backend execution to enable systematic
evaluation. Together, these components establish the first standardized
foundation for memory control in agents.

*Erion Çano,Ivan Habernal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DP fine-tuned LLMs produce shorter, less grammatical, and less diverse texts with reduced utility in downstream classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the impact of differential privacy fine-tuning on LLM text quality and utility, as this hasn't been studied despite the popularity of DP for user privacy.

Method: Tuned five LLMs with three corpora under four privacy levels, assessed text length, grammatical correctness, lexical diversity, and utility in downstream classification tasks (book genre recognition and cause of death recognition).

Result: Stronger privacy constraints led to texts that are shorter by at least 77%, less grammatically correct by at least 9%, less diverse by at least 10% in bi-gram diversity, and decreased accuracy in downstream classification tasks.

Conclusion: Differential privacy fine-tuning significantly degrades text quality and utility, which may limit the usefulness of synthetic data generated for privacy-preserving applications.

Abstract: Ensuring user privacy by synthesizing data from large language models (LLMs)
tuned under differential privacy (DP) has become popular recently. However, the
impact of DP fine-tuned LLMs on the quality of the language and the utility of
the texts they produce has not been investigated. In this work, we tune five
LLMs with three corpora under four levels of privacy and assess the length, the
grammatical correctness, and the lexical diversity of the text outputs they
produce. We also probe the utility of the synthetic outputs in downstream
classification tasks such as book genre recognition based on book descriptions
and cause of death recognition based on verbal autopsies. The results indicate
that LLMs tuned under stronger privacy constrains produce texts that are
shorter by at least 77 %, that are less grammatically correct by at least 9 %,
and are less diverse by at least 10 % in bi-gram diversity. Furthermore, the
accuracy they reach in downstream classification tasks decreases, which might
be detrimental to the usefulness of the generated synthetic data.

*Hang Guo,Yawei Li,Luca Benini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OBR is a training-free framework that combines quantization and sparsity for LLM compression, achieving 4.72x speedup and 6.4x memory reduction with W4A4KV4 quantization and 50% sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single compression methods (quantization or pruning) are reaching their limits, so combining both approaches is promising but challenging due to conflicting weight distribution requirements.

Method: Optimal Brain Restoration (OBR) uses error compensation between quantization and pruning via a second-order Hessian objective, reformulated through surrogate approximation and group error compensation for closed-form solution.

Result: Enables aggressive W4A4KV4 quantization with 50% sparsity on existing LLMs, achieving 4.72x speedup and 6.4x memory reduction compared to FP16-dense baseline.

Conclusion: OBR provides an effective training-free solution for joint quantization and sparsity compression, overcoming the inherent conflicts between these methods and delivering significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) compression, such as
quantization and pruning, have achieved notable success. However, as these
techniques gradually approach their respective limits, relying on a single
method for further compression has become increasingly challenging. In this
work, we explore an alternative solution by combining quantization and
sparsity. This joint approach, though promising, introduces new difficulties
due to the inherently conflicting requirements on weight distributions:
quantization favors compact ranges, while pruning benefits from high variance.
To attack this problem, we propose Optimal Brain Restoration (OBR), a general
and training-free framework that aligns pruning and quantization by error
compensation between both. OBR minimizes performance degradation on downstream
tasks by building on a second-order Hessian objective, which is then
reformulated into a tractable problem through surrogate approximation and
ultimately reaches a closed-form solution via group error compensation.
Experiments show that OBR enables aggressive W4A4KV4 quantization with 50%
sparsity on existing LLMs, and delivers up to 4.72x speedup and 6.4x memory
reduction compared to the FP16-dense baseline.

TL;DR: RAT (Random Adversarial Training) is a novel framework that combines random sampling with adversarial training to improve biomedical information extraction performance while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional adversarial training improves BioIE performance but introduces significant computational overhead, creating a need for more efficient solutions.

Method: Built on PubMedBERT, RAT integrates random sampling mechanisms with adversarial training principles to enhance model generalization and robustness while reducing computational requirements.

Result: RAT demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline models across various BioIE tasks while significantly reducing computational costs.

Conclusion: RAT offers a transformative balanced solution for biomedical NLP, achieving both enhanced model performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce random adversarial training (RAT), a novel framework
successfully applied to biomedical information extraction (BioIE) tasks.
Building on PubMedBERT as the foundational architecture, our study first
validates the effectiveness of conventional adversarial training in enhancing
pre-trained language models' performance on BioIE tasks. While adversarial
training yields significant improvements across various performance metrics, it
also introduces considerable computational overhead. To address this
limitation, we propose RAT as an efficiency solution for biomedical information
extraction. This framework strategically integrates random sampling mechanisms
with adversarial training principles, achieving dual objectives: enhanced model
generalization and robustness while significantly reducing computational costs.
Through comprehensive evaluations, RAT demonstrates superior performance
compared to baseline models in BioIE tasks. The results highlight RAT's
potential as a transformative framework for biomedical natural language
processing, offering a balanced solution to the model performance and
computational efficiency.

*Valentin Romanov,Steven A Niederer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper distills 58 prompt engineering techniques into 6 core methods for life sciences workflows, providing actionable guidelines to improve research efficiency and quality through systematic prompting practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the cognitive investment and friction in prompt engineering for life sciences researchers by providing focused, actionable guidance on core techniques rather than overwhelming them with numerous approaches.

Method: The authors distill 58 prompt engineering techniques from a 2025 report into 6 core methods: zero-shot, few-shot approaches, thought generation, ensembling, self-criticism, and decomposition. They provide detailed recommendations, address common pitfalls, and analyze various LLM platforms and tools.

Result: The paper provides structured guidance on prompt construction, addresses limitations of current LLMs, and demonstrates how prompt engineering can augment existing research practices in literature summarization, data extraction, and editorial tasks.

Conclusion: Systematic prompt engineering can significantly enhance research quality and efficiency in life sciences when implemented as a low-friction practice that complements rather than replaces established individual research methods.

Abstract: Developing effective prompts demands significant cognitive investment to
generate reliable, high-quality responses from Large Language Models (LLMs). By
deploying case-specific prompt engineering techniques that streamline
frequently performed life sciences workflows, researchers could achieve
substantial efficiency gains that far exceed the initial time investment
required to master these techniques. The Prompt Report published in 2025
outlined 58 different text-based prompt engineering techniques, highlighting
the numerous ways prompts could be constructed. To provide actionable
guidelines and reduce the friction of navigating these various approaches, we
distil this report to focus on 6 core techniques: zero-shot, few-shot
approaches, thought generation, ensembling, self-criticism, and decomposition.
We breakdown the significance of each approach and ground it in use cases
relevant to life sciences, from literature summarization and data extraction to
editorial tasks. We provide detailed recommendations for how prompts should and
shouldn't be structured, addressing common pitfalls including multi-turn
conversation degradation, hallucinations, and distinctions between reasoning
and non-reasoning models. We examine context window limitations, agentic tools
like Claude Code, while analyzing the effectiveness of Deep Research tools
across OpenAI, Google, Anthropic and Perplexity platforms, discussing current
limitations. We demonstrate how prompt engineering can augment rather than
replace existing established individual practices around data processing and
document editing. Our aim is to provide actionable guidance on core prompt
engineering principles, and to facilitate the transition from opportunistic
prompting to an effective, low-friction systematic practice that contributes to
higher quality research.

TL;DR: Ko-PIQA is a Korean physical commonsense reasoning dataset with cultural context, created from web-crawled questions and refined through multi-stage filtering and human validation, featuring culturally specific elements that challenge current language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing physical commonsense reasoning datasets like PIQA are predominantly English-centric and lack cultural diversity, creating a need for culturally diverse benchmarks.

Method: Multi-stage filtering approach using three language models on 3.01 million web-crawled questions, followed by GPT-4o refinement and human validation to create 441 high-quality question-answer pairs with cultural grounding.

Result: Best model achieved 83.22% accuracy while weakest reached only 59.86%, with models particularly struggling with culturally specific scenarios containing traditional Korean elements.

Conclusion: Ko-PIQA serves as both a benchmark for Korean language models and a foundation for more inclusive commonsense reasoning research, highlighting the importance of culturally diverse datasets.

Abstract: Physical commonsense reasoning datasets like PIQA are predominantly
English-centric and lack cultural diversity. We introduce Ko-PIQA, a Korean
physical commonsense reasoning dataset that incorporates cultural context.
Starting from 3.01 million web-crawled questions, we employed a multi-stage
filtering approach using three language models to identify 11,553 PIQA-style
questions. Through GPT-4o refinement and human validation, we obtained 441
high-quality question-answer pairs. A key feature of Ko-PIQA is its cultural
grounding: 19.7\% of questions contain culturally specific elements like
traditional Korean foods (kimchi), clothing (hanbok), and specialized
appliances (kimchi refrigerators) that require culturally-aware reasoning
beyond direct translation. We evaluate seven language models on Ko-PIQA, with
the best model achieving 83.22\% accuracy while the weakest reaches only
59.86\%, demonstrating significant room for improvement. Models particularly
struggle with culturally specific scenarios, highlighting the importance of
culturally diverse datasets. Ko-PIQA serves as both a benchmark for Korean
language models and a foundation for more inclusive commonsense reasoning
research. The dataset and code will be publicly available.

Motivation: To develop effective systems for Arabic clinical question answering that can handle both multiple-choice and open-ended formats in healthcare contexts.

Method: For multiple-choice: Gemini 2.5 Flash with few-shot prompting, dataset preprocessing, and ensemble of three prompt configurations. For open-ended: unified prompt with role-playing as Arabic medical expert, few-shot examples, and post-processing.

Result: Secured 2nd place in both Sub-Task 1 (multiple-choice QA) and Sub-Task 2 (open-ended QA) in the AraHealthQA-2025 shared task.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the effectiveness of large language models with tailored prompting strategies and post-processing for Arabic clinical question answering across different question formats.

Abstract: We present our systems for Track 2 (General Arabic Health QA, MedArabiQ) of
the AraHealthQA-2025 shared task, where our methodology secured 2nd place in
both Sub-Task 1 (multiple-choice question answering) and Sub-Task 2 (open-ended
question answering) in Arabic clinical contexts. For Sub-Task 1, we leverage
the Gemini 2.5 Flash model with few-shot prompting, dataset preprocessing, and
an ensemble of three prompt configurations to improve classification accuracy
on standard, biased, and fill-in-the-blank questions. For Sub-Task 2, we employ
a unified prompt with the same model, incorporating role-playing as an Arabic
medical expert, few-shot examples, and post-processing to generate concise
responses across fill-in-the-blank, patient-doctor Q&A, GEC, and paraphrased
variants.

TL;DR: Transformer-based models outperform non-transformer models in relation extraction, achieving 80-90% micro F1 scores vs 64-67% for non-transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically compare performance between deep supervised learning approaches with and without transformers for relation extraction tasks.

Method: Compared non-transformer architectures (PA-LSTM, C-GCN, AGGCN) against transformer architectures (BERT, RoBERTa, R-BERT) using traditional metrics and various evaluation scenarios on TACRED, TACREV, and RE-TACRED datasets.

Result: Transformer-based models significantly outperformed non-transformer models, achieving micro F1 scores of 80-90% compared to 64-67% for non-transformer approaches.

Conclusion: Transformers demonstrate superior performance in relation extraction tasks, and the paper also reviews the research journey in supervised relation classification and discusses LLMs' role in this domain.

Abstract: In the era of large language model, relation extraction (RE) plays an
important role in information extraction through the transformation of
unstructured raw text into structured data (Wadhwa et al., 2023). In this
paper, we systematically compare the performance of deep supervised learning
approaches without transformers and those with transformers. We used a series
of non-transformer architectures such as PA-LSTM(Zhang et al., 2017),
C-GCN(Zhang et al., 2018), and AGGCN(attention guide GCN)(Guo et al., 2019),
and a series of transformer architectures such as BERT, RoBERTa, and R-BERT(Wu
and He, 2019). Our comparison included traditional metrics like micro F1, as
well as evaluations in different scenarios, varying sentence lengths, and
different percentages of the dataset for training. Our experiments were
conducted on TACRED, TACREV, and RE-TACRED. The results show that
transformer-based models outperform non-transformer models, achieving micro F1
scores of 80-90% compared to 64-67% for non-transformer models. Additionally,
we briefly review the research journey in supervised relation classification
and discuss the role and current status of large language models (LLMs) in
relation extraction.

*Abraham Toluwase Owodunni,Sachin Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Layer-Selective LoRA (LayRA) enables adding new languages to multilingual models without retraining from scratch or accessing original pretraining data, using selective layer adaptation to prevent catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multilingual models require expensive retraining from scratch to add new languages, and naive approaches suffer from catastrophic forgetting without access to original pretraining data.

Method: Proposes Layer-Selective LoRA (LayRA) that adds Low-Rank Adapters to selected initial and final layers while keeping intermediate layers frozen, based on insights about language encoding patterns in multilingual models.

Result: LayRA provides the best tradeoff between preserving existing language capabilities and learning new languages, outperforming approaches like standard LoRA, and enables instruction following without target language instruction data.

Conclusion: LayRA offers an effective solution for continual language addition to multilingual models, addressing catastrophic forgetting while maintaining performance across supported languages.

Abstract: Multilingual language models are trained on a fixed set of languages, and to
support new languages, the models need to be retrained from scratch. This is an
expensive endeavor and is often infeasible, as model developers tend not to
release their pre-training data. Naive approaches, such as continued
pretraining, suffer from catastrophic forgetting; however, mitigation
strategies like experience replay cannot be applied due to the lack of original
pretraining data. In this work, we investigate the problem of continually
adding new languages to a multilingual model, assuming access to pretraining
data in only the target languages. We explore multiple approaches to address
this problem and propose Layer-Selective LoRA (LayRA), which adds Low-Rank
Adapters (LoRA) to selected initial and final layers while keeping the rest of
the model frozen. LayRA builds on two insights: (1) LoRA reduces forgetting,
and (2) multilingual models encode inputs in the source language in the initial
layers, reason in English in intermediate layers, and translate back to the
source language in final layers. We experiment with adding multiple
combinations of Galician, Swahili, and Urdu to pretrained language models and
evaluate each method on diverse multilingual tasks. We find that LayRA provides
the overall best tradeoff between preserving models' capabilities in previously
supported languages, while being competitive with existing approaches such as
LoRA in learning new languages. We also demonstrate that using model
arithmetic, the adapted models can be equipped with strong instruction
following abilities without access to any instruction tuning data in the target
languages.

Abstract: This study presents the first multi-platform sentiment analysis of public
opinion on the 15-minute city concept across Twitter, Reddit, and news media.
Using compressed transformer models and Llama-3-8B for annotation, we classify
sentiment across heterogeneous text domains. Our pipeline handles long-form and
short-form text, supports consistent annotation, and enables reproducible
evaluation. We benchmark five models (DistilRoBERTa, DistilBERT, MiniLM,
ELECTRA, TinyBERT) using stratified 5-fold cross-validation, reporting
F1-score, AUC, and training time. DistilRoBERTa achieved the highest F1
(0.8292), TinyBERT the best efficiency, and MiniLM the best cross-platform
consistency. Results show News data yields inflated performance due to class
imbalance, Reddit suffers from summarization loss, and Twitter offers moderate
challenge. Compressed models perform competitively, challenging assumptions
that larger models are necessary. We identify platform-specific trade-offs and
propose directions for scalable, real-world sentiment classification in urban
planning discourse.

TL;DR: CEMTM is a context-enhanced multimodal topic model that processes text and images using fine-tuned vision language models and distributional attention to create coherent, interpretable topics from both short and long documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal topic models struggle with processing multiple images per document efficiently while maintaining interpretability and semantic consistency across text and image modalities.

Method: Uses fine-tuned large vision language models for contextualized embeddings, distributional attention mechanism for token-level weighting, and reconstruction objective to align topic representations with document embeddings.

Result: Outperforms unimodal and multimodal baselines on six benchmarks with average LLM score of 2.61, effective in few-shot retrieval and capturing visually grounded semantics in scientific articles.

Conclusion: CEMTM provides an efficient and interpretable solution for multimodal topic modeling that handles multiple images without repeated encoding while maintaining semantic consistency across modalities.

Abstract: We introduce CEMTM, a context-enhanced multimodal topic model designed to
infer coherent and interpretable topic structures from both short and long
documents containing text and images. CEMTM builds on fine-tuned large vision
language models (LVLMs) to obtain contextualized embeddings, and employs a
distributional attention mechanism to weight token-level contributions to topic
inference. A reconstruction objective aligns topic-based representations with
the document embedding, encouraging semantic consistency across modalities.
Unlike existing approaches, CEMTM can process multiple images per document
without repeated encoding and maintains interpretability through explicit
word-topic and document-topic distributions. Extensive experiments on six
multimodal benchmarks show that CEMTM consistently outperforms unimodal and
multimodal baselines, achieving a remarkable average LLM score of 2.61. Further
analysis shows its effectiveness in downstream few-shot retrieval and its
ability to capture visually grounded semantics in complex domains such as
scientific articles.

*Zhongyang Hu,Naijie Gu,Xiangzhi Tao,Tianhui Gu,Yibing Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Two novel approaches for ranking lexical substitution candidates using attention weights and integrated gradients to measure bidirectional semantic influence between target words and context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to effectively model the bidirectional influence of candidate substitutions on both target words and their context, often focusing only on semantic changes at target positions or requiring complex parameter tuning.

Method: Proposes two approaches: 1) using attention weights to measure context token influence on target tokens, and 2) leveraging integrated gradients method for better interpretability. Both methods incorporate semantic similarity between original and substituted sentences to rank candidates.

Result: Experiments on LS07 and SWORDS datasets show that both approaches improve ranking performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The attention-based and integrated gradients approaches effectively address the challenge of modeling bidirectional semantic influence in lexical substitution ranking tasks.

Abstract: A key subtask in lexical substitution is ranking the given candidate words. A
common approach is to replace the target word with a candidate in the original
sentence and feed the modified sentence into a model to capture semantic
differences before and after substitution. However, effectively modeling the
bidirectional influence of candidate substitution on both the target word and
its context remains challenging. Existing methods often focus solely on
semantic changes at the target position or rely on parameter tuning over
multiple evaluation metrics, making it difficult to accurately characterize
semantic variation. To address this, we investigate two approaches: one based
on attention weights and another leveraging the more interpretable integrated
gradients method, both designed to measure the influence of context tokens on
the target token and to rank candidates by incorporating semantic similarity
between the original and substituted sentences. Experiments on the LS07 and
SWORDS datasets demonstrate that both approaches improve ranking performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LVLMs struggle as overhearers in collaborative object-matching conversations, failing to improve performance across multiple rounds of the same task between human participants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how well Large Vision Language Models can understand and learn from spontaneous human conversations involving collaborative referring expressions, which is crucial for embodied agents to operate effectively in real-world tasks.

Method: Tested seven state-of-the-art LVLMs as overhearers on a corpus of spontaneous human conversations during collaborative object-matching tasks, analyzing performance across multiple conversation rounds.

Result: Current LVLMs perform poorly on this task and show no consistent performance improvement even after overhearing multiple conversations between the same participants repeating the same task.

Conclusion: Understanding collaborative referring expressions in spontaneous conversations remains a significant challenge for current LVLMs, highlighting the need for better integration of language, vision, and conversational interaction capabilities.

Abstract: During spontaneous conversations, speakers collaborate on novel referring
expressions, which they can then re-use in subsequent conversations.
Understanding such referring expressions is an important ability for an
embodied agent, so that it can carry out tasks in the real world. This requires
integrating and understanding language, vision, and conversational interaction.
We study the capabilities of seven state-of-the-art Large Vision Language
Models (LVLMs) as overhearers to a corpus of spontaneous conversations between
pairs of human discourse participants engaged in a collaborative
object-matching task. We find that such a task remains challenging for current
LVLMs and they all fail to show a consistent performance improvement as they
overhear more conversations from the same discourse participants repeating the
same task for multiple rounds. We release our corpus and code for
reproducibility and to facilitate future research.

TL;DR: The study evaluates medical LLMs on Spanish medical questions from Peru, creates PeruMedQA dataset, fine-tunes medgemma-4b-it, and finds medgemma-27b-text-it performs best (>90% accuracy), while smaller models (<10B params) struggle (<60%). Fine-tuned medgemma-4b-it rivals 70B models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if high performance of medical LLMs transfers to Spanish medical questions from Latin America (Peru), as LLM-based medical applications gain traction in the region.

Method: Curated PeruMedQA dataset (8,380 MCQA questions across 12 medical domains). Selected 8 medical LLMs, used zero-shot prompts, and fine-tuned medgemma-4b-it using PEFT/LoRA on all questions except 2025 test set.

Result: medgemma-27b-text-it achieved >90% accuracy in several cases. Models <10B parameters showed <60% accuracy (some <50%). Fine-tuned medgemma-4b-it outperformed all <10B models and rivaled a 70B parameter model.

Conclusion: For medical AI applications requiring Spanish knowledge from countries with Peru's epidemiological profile, use medgemma-27b-text-it or fine-tuned medgemma-4b-it.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Medical large language models (LLMS) have demonstrated remarkable
performance in answering medical examinations. However, the extent to which
this high performance is transferable to medical questions in Spanish and from
a Latin American country remains unexplored. This knowledge is crucial as
LLM-based medical applications gain traction in Latin America. AIMS: to build a
dataset of questions from medical examinations taken by Peruvian physicians
pursuing specialty training; to fine-tune a LLM on this dataset; to evaluate
and compare the performance in terms of accuracy between vanilla LLMs and the
fine-tuned LLM. METHODS: We curated PeruMedQA, a multiple-choice
question-answering (MCQA) datasets containing 8,380 questions spanning 12
medical domains (2018-2025). We selected eight medical LLMs including
medgemma-4b-it and medgemma-27b-text-it, and developed zero-shot task-specific
prompts to answer the questions appropriately. We employed parameter-efficient
fine tuning (PEFT)and low-rant adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune medgemma-4b-it
utilizing all questions except those from 2025 (test set). RESULTS:
medgemma-27b-text-it outperformed all other models, achieving a proportion of
correct answers exceeding 90% in several instances. LLMs with <10 billion
parameters exhibited <60% of correct answers, while some exams yielded results
<50%. The fine-tuned version of medgemma-4b-it emerged victorious agains all
LLMs with <10 billion parameters and rivaled a LLM with 70 billion parameters
across various examinations. CONCLUSIONS: For medical AI application and
research that require knowledge bases from Spanish-speaking countries and those
exhibiting similar epidemiological profiles to Peru's, interested parties
should utilize medgemma-27b-text-it or a fine-tuned version of medgemma-4b-it.

*Zhihan Cao,Hiroaki Yamada,Takenobu Tokunaga*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Antonymy shows distinctive co-occurrence patterns with high strength, preferred linear order, and short spans compared to other semantic relations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies showed antonym pairs co-occur frequently but lacked comparison with other semantic relations to determine if this pattern is distinctive to antonymy.

Method: Compared antonymy with three other semantic relations across parts of speech using robust co-occurrence metrics.

Result: Antonymy is distinctive in three ways: high co-occurrence strength, preferred linear order, and occurrence within short spans.

Conclusion: Antonymy has unique co-occurrence characteristics that distinguish it from other semantic relations, with all results available online.

Abstract: Antonymy has long received particular attention in lexical semantics.
Previous studies have shown that antonym pairs frequently co-occur in text,
across genres and parts of speech, more often than would be expected by chance.
However, whether this co-occurrence pattern is distinctive of antonymy remains
unclear, due to a lack of comparison with other semantic relations. This work
fills the gap by comparing antonymy with three other relations across parts of
speech using robust co-occurrence metrics. We find that antonymy is distinctive
in three respects: antonym pairs co-occur with high strength, in a preferred
linear order, and within short spans. All results are available online.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HARP is a novel hallucination detection framework that decomposes LLM hidden states into semantic and reasoning subspaces, using reasoning subspace projections for more robust and accurate detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hallucination detection methods struggle with disentangling semantic and reasoning information and maintaining robustness, which limits reliable use of LLMs in critical decision-making.

Method: HARP decomposes LLM hidden states into semantic and reasoning subspaces using SVD on Unembedding layer parameters, then projects hidden states onto reasoning subspace basis vectors for feature extraction.

Result: HARP achieves state-of-the-art performance with 92.8% AUROC on TriviaQA, outperforming previous best method by 7.5%, while reducing feature dimension to ~5% of original and filtering noise.

Conclusion: The reasoning subspace projection approach provides enhanced robustness and superior hallucination detection performance, making LLMs more reliable for critical applications.

Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) pose a major barrier to their
reliable use in critical decision-making. Although existing hallucination
detection methods have improved accuracy, they still struggle with
disentangling semantic and reasoning information and maintaining robustness. To
address these challenges, we propose HARP (Hallucination detection via
reasoning subspace projection), a novel hallucination detection framework. HARP
establishes that the hidden state space of LLMs can be decomposed into a direct
sum of a semantic subspace and a reasoning subspace, where the former encodes
linguistic expression and the latter captures internal reasoning processes.
Moreover, we demonstrate that the Unembedding layer can disentangle these
subspaces, and by applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to its
parameters, the basis vectors spanning the semantic and reasoning subspaces are
obtained. Finally, HARP projects hidden states onto the basis vectors of the
reasoning subspace, and the resulting projections are then used as input
features for hallucination detection in LLMs. By using these projections, HARP
reduces the dimension of the feature to approximately 5% of the original,
filters out most noise, and achieves enhanced robustness. Experiments across
multiple datasets show that HARP achieves state-of-the-art hallucination
detection performance; in particular, it achieves an AUROC of 92.8% on
TriviaQA, outperforming the previous best method by 7.5%.

### [237] [HiChunk: Evaluating and Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Hierarchical Chunking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11552)
*Wensheng Lu,Keyu Chen,Ruizhi Qiao,Xing Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HiCBench is a new benchmark for evaluating document chunking in RAG systems, addressing evidence sparsity issues in existing benchmarks, and HiChunk framework improves chunking quality with reasonable time consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG evaluation benchmarks are inadequate for assessing document chunking quality due to evidence sparsity, creating a need for better evaluation tools.

Method: Proposed HiCBench with manually annotated multi-level document chunking points and synthesized evidence-dense QA pairs. Introduced HiChunk framework using fine-tuned LLMs for multi-level document structuring combined with Auto-Merge retrieval algorithm.

Result: HiCBench effectively evaluates different chunking methods across the RAG pipeline. HiChunk achieves better chunking quality with reasonable time consumption, enhancing overall RAG system performance.

Conclusion: The proposed HiCBench benchmark and HiChunk framework successfully address document chunking evaluation challenges and improve RAG system performance through better chunking quality.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the response capabilities of
language models by integrating external knowledge sources. However, document
chunking as an important part of RAG system often lacks effective evaluation
tools. This paper first analyzes why existing RAG evaluation benchmarks are
inadequate for assessing document chunking quality, specifically due to
evidence sparsity. Based on this conclusion, we propose HiCBench, which
includes manually annotated multi-level document chunking points, synthesized
evidence-dense quetion answer(QA) pairs, and their corresponding evidence
sources. Additionally, we introduce the HiChunk framework, a multi-level
document structuring framework based on fine-tuned LLMs, combined with the
Auto-Merge retrieval algorithm to improve retrieval quality. Experiments
demonstrate that HiCBench effectively evaluates the impact of different
chunking methods across the entire RAG pipeline. Moreover, HiChunk achieves
better chunking quality within reasonable time consumption, thereby enhancing
the overall performance of RAG systems.

### [238] [D$^2$HScore: Reasoning-Aware Hallucination Detection via Semantic Breadth and Depth Analysis in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11569)
*Yue Ding,Xiaofang Zhu,Tianze Xia,Junfei Wu,Xinlong Chen,Qiang Liu,Liang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: D^2HScore is a training-free hallucination detection framework that analyzes intra-layer dispersion and inter-layer drift of token representations in LLMs to identify non-factual content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs generate hallucinations that hinder practical applications in high-stakes domains like finance and healthcare, requiring reliable detection methods without additional training.

Method: Proposes D^2HScore framework that measures semantic diversity within layers (intra-layer dispersion) and tracks concept evolution across layers (inter-layer drift) using attention-guided token selection.

Result: Extensive experiments across five LLMs and five benchmarks show D^2HScore consistently outperforms existing training-free baselines for hallucination detection.

Conclusion: The architecture-aware approach provides an interpretable, lightweight solution for detecting hallucinations by capturing both horizontal and vertical representation dynamics during inference.

Abstract: Although large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, their
practical application is often hindered by the generation of non-factual
content, which is called "hallucination". Ensuring the reliability of LLMs'
outputs is a critical challenge, particularly in high-stakes domains such as
finance, security, and healthcare. In this work, we revisit hallucination
detection from the perspective of model architecture and generation dynamics.
Leveraging the multi-layer structure and autoregressive decoding process of
LLMs, we decompose hallucination signals into two complementary dimensions: the
semantic breadth of token representations within each layer, and the semantic
depth of core concepts as they evolve across layers. Based on this insight, we
propose \textbf{D$^2$HScore (Dispersion and Drift-based Hallucination Score)},
a training-free and label-free framework that jointly measures: (1)
\textbf{Intra-Layer Dispersion}, which quantifies the semantic diversity of
token representations within each layer; and (2) \textbf{Inter-Layer Drift},
which tracks the progressive transformation of key token representations across
layers. To ensure drift reflects the evolution of meaningful semantics rather
than noisy or redundant tokens, we guide token selection using attention
signals. By capturing both the horizontal and vertical dynamics of
representation during inference, D$^2$HScore provides an interpretable and
lightweight proxy for hallucination detection. Extensive experiments across
five open-source LLMs and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that
D$^2$HScore consistently outperforms existing training-free baselines.

*Xiaoying Song,Anirban Saha Anik,Eduardo Blanco,Vanessa Frias-Martinez,Lingzi Hong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a novel metric and fusion-based generation approach to maintain stylistic consistency in automated crisis response systems, outperforming baselines in both quality and style uniformity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the critical need for stylistic consistency in automated crisis communications to build trust with affected populations, as current methods often overlook this important factor.

Method: Two-stage process: 1) assesses style of candidate responses, 2) optimizes and integrates them through instance-level fusion to reduce stylistic variation while maintaining quality.

Result: Experimental results across multiple datasets show the approach consistently outperforms baselines in both response quality and stylistic uniformity.

Conclusion: The proposed fusion-based generation method with novel style consistency metric effectively addresses the gap in maintaining consistent response styles for crisis communication systems.

Abstract: In response to the urgent need for effective communication with
crisis-affected populations, automated responses driven by language models have
been proposed to assist in crisis communications. A critical yet often
overlooked factor is the consistency of response style, which could affect the
trust of affected individuals in responders. Despite its importance, few
studies have explored methods for maintaining stylistic consistency across
generated responses. To address this gap, we propose a novel metric for
evaluating style consistency and introduce a fusion-based generation approach
grounded in this metric. Our method employs a two-stage process: it first
assesses the style of candidate responses and then optimizes and integrates
them at the instance level through a fusion process. This enables the
generation of high-quality responses while significantly reducing stylistic
variation between instances. Experimental results across multiple datasets
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baselines in both
response quality and stylistic uniformity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Survey of NLP progress and challenges for South Asian languages, highlighting data gaps, lack of benchmarks, and need for equitable representation in language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models have advanced English NLP but overlooked low-resource South Asian languages, with over 650 languages having limited computational resources or missing from existing models.

Method: Comprehensive examination of studies since 2020, focusing on transformer-based models (BERT, T5, GPT) across three aspects: data, models, and tasks including data sources, fine-tuning strategies, and domain applications.

Result: Identified substantial issues including missing data in critical domains (e.g., health), code-mixing challenges, and lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks for South Asian languages.

Conclusion: Calls for raising awareness, targeted data curation, unified benchmarks tailored to cultural/linguistic nuances, and equitable representation of South Asian languages in NLP development.

Abstract: Rapid developments of large language models have revolutionized many NLP
tasks for English data. Unfortunately, the models and their evaluations for
low-resource languages are being overlooked, especially for languages in South
Asia. Although there are more than 650 languages in South Asia, many of them
either have very limited computational resources or are missing from existing
language models. Thus, a concrete question to be answered is: Can we assess the
current stage and challenges to inform our NLP community and facilitate model
developments for South Asian languages? In this survey, we have comprehensively
examined current efforts and challenges of NLP models for South Asian languages
by retrieving studies since 2020, with a focus on transformer-based models,
such as BERT, T5, & GPT. We present advances and gaps across 3 essential
aspects: data, models, & tasks, such as available data sources, fine-tuning
strategies, & domain applications. Our findings highlight substantial issues,
including missing data in critical domains (e.g., health), code-mixing, and
lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. Our survey aims to raise awareness
within the NLP community for more targeted data curation, unify benchmarks
tailored to cultural and linguistic nuances of South Asia, and encourage an
equitable representation of South Asian languages. The complete list of

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework using RAG with RL to generate health misinformation counterspeech tailored to different literacy levels, outperforming uniform response approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Health misinformation online threatens public health, and existing counterspeech methods produce uniform responses that ignore audience health literacy levels, affecting accessibility and effectiveness.

Method: Controlled-Literacy framework combining retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with reinforcement learning (RL) to retrieve knowledge aligned with specific health literacy levels and optimize counterspeech using reward functions that incorporate user preferences and readability metrics.

Result: Experiment results show that Controlled-Literacy outperforms baseline methods by generating more accessible and user-preferred counterspeech tailored to different health literacy levels.

Conclusion: This research contributes to more equitable and impactful public health communication by improving the accessibility and comprehension of counterspeech to health misinformation through literacy-level adaptation.

Abstract: Health misinformation spreading online poses a significant threat to public
health. Researchers have explored methods for automatically generating
counterspeech to health misinformation as a mitigation strategy. Existing
approaches often produce uniform responses, ignoring that the health literacy
level of the audience could affect the accessibility and effectiveness of
counterspeech. We propose a Controlled-Literacy framework using
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with reinforcement learning (RL) to
generate tailored counterspeech adapted to different health literacy levels. In
particular, we retrieve knowledge aligned with specific health literacy levels,
enabling accessible and factual information to support generation. We design a
reward function incorporating subjective user preferences and objective
readability-based rewards to optimize counterspeech to the target health
literacy level. Experiment results show that Controlled-Literacy outperforms
baselines by generating more accessible and user-preferred counterspeech. This
research contributes to more equitable and impactful public health
communication by improving the accessibility and comprehension of counterspeech
to health misinformation

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Analysis of 7,077 user interactions with TALKA AI chatbot shows how generative AI supports Hakka language learning through cognitive processes and dialogue acts, facilitating language preservation and cultural connection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address endangered language preservation by examining how AI-powered chatbots can support language learning through understanding user cognitive processes and communication patterns.

Method: Dual-layered analytical framework using Bloom's Taxonomy (6 cognitive levels) and dialogue act categorization (11 types) to analyze 7,077 user utterances in TALKA chatbot interactions.

Result: Generative AI chatbots effectively support language learning by aligning dialogue acts with cognitive intentions, helping learners express themselves confidently and connect with cultural identity through various functions like translations, cultural inquiries, and creative language use.

Conclusion: AI-mediated dialogue facilitates cognitive development, pragmatic negotiation, and socio-cultural affiliation in low-resource language learners, offering valuable insights for technology-supported language preservation and educational practice.

Abstract: With many endangered languages at risk of disappearing, efforts to preserve
them now rely more than ever on using technology alongside culturally informed
teaching strategies. This study examines user behaviors in TALKA, a generative
AI-powered chatbot designed for Hakka language engagement, by employing a
dual-layered analytical framework grounded in Bloom's Taxonomy of cognitive
processes and dialogue act categorization. We analyzed 7,077 user utterances,
each carefully annotated according to six cognitive levels and eleven dialogue
act types. These included a variety of functions, such as asking for
information, requesting translations, making cultural inquiries, and using
language creatively. Pragmatic classifications further highlight how different
types of dialogue acts--such as feedback, control commands, and social
greetings--align with specific cognitive intentions. The results suggest that
generative AI chatbots can support language learning in meaningful
ways--especially when they are designed with an understanding of how users
think and communicate. They may also help learners express themselves more
confidently and connect with their cultural identity. The TALKA case provides
empirical insights into how AI-mediated dialogue facilitates cognitive
development in low-resource language learners, as well as pragmatic negotiation
and socio-cultural affiliation. By focusing on AI-assisted language learning,
this study offers new insights into how technology can support language
preservation and educational practice.

*Md. Mithun Hossain,Sanjara,Md. Shakil Hossain,Sudipto Chaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SpanEIT is a novel framework for entity-level sentiment classification that integrates dynamic span interaction and graph-aware memory mechanisms to address challenges like entity-sentiment interactions, cross-sentence dependencies, and coreference resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Entity-level sentiment classification faces challenges in modeling complex entity-sentiment interactions, capturing cross-sentence dependencies, ensuring consistency through coreference resolution, and handling linguistic phenomena like negation and ambiguity in noisy real-world text.

Method: SpanEIT builds span-based representations for entities and sentiment phrases, uses bidirectional attention for fine-grained interactions, employs graph attention networks for syntactic and co-occurrence relations, and incorporates a coreference-aware memory module for entity-level consistency.

Result: Experiments on FSAD, BARU, and IMDB datasets show SpanEIT outperforms state-of-the-art transformer and hybrid baselines in both accuracy and F1 scores.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates effectiveness through ablation studies and interpretability analyses, showing potential for fine-grained sentiment analysis applications like social media monitoring and customer feedback analysis.

Abstract: Entity-level sentiment classification involves identifying the sentiment
polarity linked to specific entities within text. This task poses several
challenges: effectively modeling the subtle and complex interactions between
entities and their surrounding sentiment expressions; capturing dependencies
that may span across sentences; and ensuring consistent sentiment predictions
for multiple mentions of the same entity through coreference resolution.
Additionally, linguistic phenomena such as negation, ambiguity, and overlapping
opinions further complicate the analysis. These complexities make entity-level
sentiment classification a difficult problem, especially in real-world, noisy
textual data. To address these issues, we propose SpanEIT, a novel framework
integrating dynamic span interaction and graph-aware memory mechanisms for
enhanced entity-sentiment relational modeling. SpanEIT builds span-based
representations for entities and candidate sentiment phrases, employs
bidirectional attention for fine-grained interactions, and uses a graph
attention network to capture syntactic and co-occurrence relations. A
coreference-aware memory module ensures entity-level consistency across
documents. Experiments on FSAD, BARU, and IMDB datasets show SpanEIT
outperforms state-of-the-art transformer and hybrid baselines in accuracy and
F1 scores. Ablation and interpretability analyses validate the effectiveness of
our approach, underscoring its potential for fine-grained sentiment analysis in
applications like social media monitoring and customer feedback analysis.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in industry but remain prone to
hallucinations, limiting their reliability in critical applications. This work
addresses hallucination reduction in consumer grievance chatbots built using
LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct, a compact model frequently used in industry. We develop
HalluDetect, an LLM-based hallucination detection system that achieves an F1
score of 69% outperforming baseline detectors by 25.44%. Benchmarking five
chatbot architectures, we find that out of them, AgentBot minimizes
hallucinations to 0.4159 per turn while maintaining the highest token accuracy
(96.13%), making it the most effective mitigation strategy. Our findings
provide a scalable framework for hallucination mitigation, demonstrating that
optimized inference strategies can significantly improve factual accuracy.
While applied to consumer law, our approach generalizes to other high-risk
domains, enhancing trust in LLM-driven assistants. We will release the code and

TL;DR: AesBiasBench benchmark evaluates MLLMs for stereotype bias and human alignment in image aesthetic assessment across demographic groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs are increasingly used for personalized image aesthetic assessment but may reflect subtle demographic biases in their predictions.

Method: Proposed AesBiasBench with three subtasks (Aesthetic Perception, Assessment, Empathy) and structured metrics (IFD, NRD, AAS) to evaluate 19 MLLMs including proprietary and open-source models.

Result: Smaller models show stronger stereotype biases, larger models align better with human preferences. Identity information often increases bias, especially in emotional judgments.

Conclusion: Identity-aware evaluation frameworks are crucial for subjective vision-language tasks to address demographic biases in MLLM aesthetic assessments.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in
Personalized Image Aesthetic Assessment (PIAA) as a scalable alternative to
expert evaluations. However, their predictions may reflect subtle biases
influenced by demographic factors such as gender, age, and education. In this
work, we propose AesBiasBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs along two
complementary dimensions: (1) stereotype bias, quantified by measuring
variations in aesthetic evaluations across demographic groups; and (2)
alignment between model outputs and genuine human aesthetic preferences. Our
benchmark covers three subtasks (Aesthetic Perception, Assessment, Empathy) and
introduces structured metrics (IFD, NRD, AAS) to assess both bias and
alignment. We evaluate 19 MLLMs, including proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o,
Claude-3.5-Sonnet) and open-source models (e.g., InternVL-2.5, Qwen2.5-VL).
Results indicate that smaller models exhibit stronger stereotype biases,
whereas larger models align more closely with human preferences. Incorporating
identity information often exacerbates bias, particularly in emotional
judgments. These findings underscore the importance of identity-aware
evaluation frameworks in subjective vision-language tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks don't adequately capture unique ethical dilemmas in mental health practice where multiple ethical principles intersect, creating a gap in evaluating AI systems for sensitive domains.

Method: Created a pilot dataset of 125 scenarios with structured fields including multiple decision options, expert-aligned reasoning, expected model behavior, real-world impact, and multi-stakeholder viewpoints.

Result: Developed EthicsMH dataset that enables evaluation of both decision accuracy and explanation quality while aligning with professional norms in mental health contexts.

Conclusion: EthicsMH provides a foundational framework and seed resource for community expansion to foster development of AI systems capable of handling delicate mental health decisions responsibly.

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in mental health and other
sensitive domains raises urgent questions about ethical reasoning, fairness,
and responsible alignment. Yet, existing benchmarks for moral and clinical
decision-making do not adequately capture the unique ethical dilemmas
encountered in mental health practice, where confidentiality, autonomy,
beneficence, and bias frequently intersect. To address this gap, we introduce
Ethical Reasoning in Mental Health (EthicsMH), a pilot dataset of 125 scenarios
designed to evaluate how AI systems navigate ethically charged situations in
therapeutic and psychiatric contexts. Each scenario is enriched with structured
fields, including multiple decision options, expert-aligned reasoning, expected
model behavior, real-world impact, and multi-stakeholder viewpoints. This
structure enables evaluation not only of decision accuracy but also of
explanation quality and alignment with professional norms. Although modest in
scale and developed with model-assisted generation, EthicsMH establishes a task
framework that bridges AI ethics and mental health decision-making. By
releasing this dataset, we aim to provide a seed resource that can be expanded
through community and expert contributions, fostering the development of AI
systems capable of responsibly handling some of society's most delicate
decisions.

TL;DR: DYNAMO is a fake news detection model that uses knowledge graphs and Monte Carlo Tree Search to continuously update knowledge and verify news authenticity through step-by-step decomposition and verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid evolution of internet and social media makes distinguishing credible news challenging. News authenticity labels can shift as events develop, requiring latest event updates. Existing methods suffer from insufficient credibility of retrieved content and noise interference.

Method: Construct news-domain-specific knowledge graph, use Monte Carlo Tree Search to decompose complex news and verify step by step, extract and update new knowledge from verified real news texts and reasoning paths.

Result: DYNAMO achieves the best performance on two real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively addresses key challenges in fake news detection by ensuring authenticity of new knowledge and deeply mining news semantics through dynamic knowledge updates.

Abstract: As the Internet and social media evolve rapidly, distinguishing credible news
from a vast amount of complex information poses a significant challenge. Due to
the suddenness and instability of news events, the authenticity labels of news
can potentially shift as events develop, making it crucial for fake news
detection to obtain the latest event updates. Existing methods employ
retrieval-augmented generation to fill knowledge gaps, but they suffer from
issues such as insufficient credibility of retrieved content and interference
from noisy information. We propose a dynamic knowledge update-driven model for
fake news detection (DYNAMO), which leverages knowledge graphs to achieve
continuous updating of new knowledge and integrates with large language models
to fulfill dual functions: news authenticity detection and verification of new
knowledge correctness, solving the two key problems of ensuring the
authenticity of new knowledge and deeply mining news semantics. Specifically,
we first construct a news-domain-specific knowledge graph. Then, we use Monte
Carlo Tree Search to decompose complex news and verify them step by step.
Finally, we extract and update new knowledge from verified real news texts and
reasoning paths. Experimental results demonstrate that DYNAMO achieves the best
performance on two real-world datasets.

TL;DR: CoachMe is a reference-based model that analyzes differences between learner's motion and reference motions to provide precise sport-specific instructions, outperforming GPT-4o by significant margins in figure skating and boxing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion instruction is crucial for athletes to refine techniques, but generating precise sport-specific guidance remains challenging due to the domain-specific nature of sports and need for informative feedback.

Method: Reference-based model that analyzes differences between learner's motion and reference motions under temporal and physical aspects, enabling domain-knowledge learning and coach-like thinking process for identifying movement errors.

Result: Outperforms GPT-4o by 31.6% in G-Eval on figure skating and 58.3% on boxing. Provides high-quality instructions that elaborate on errors and corresponding improvement methods rather than just coach-like tone without critical information.

Conclusion: CoachMe effectively adapts to specific sports by learning from general movements and leveraging limited data, demonstrating strong performance in generating precise, informative motion instructions for sports like skating and boxing.

Abstract: Motion instruction is a crucial task that helps athletes refine their
technique by analyzing movements and providing corrective guidance. Although
recent advances in multimodal models have improved motion understanding,
generating precise and sport-specific instruction remains challenging due to
the highly domain-specific nature of sports and the need for informative
guidance. We propose CoachMe, a reference-based model that analyzes the
differences between a learner's motion and a reference under temporal and
physical aspects. This approach enables both domain-knowledge learning and the
acquisition of a coach-like thinking process that identifies movement errors
effectively and provides feedback to explain how to improve. In this paper, we
illustrate how CoachMe adapts well to specific sports such as skating and
boxing by learning from general movements and then leveraging limited data.
Experiments show that CoachMe provides high-quality instructions instead of
directions merely in the tone of a coach but without critical information.
CoachMe outperforms GPT-4o by 31.6% in G-Eval on figure skating and by 58.3% on
boxing. Analysis further confirms that it elaborates on errors and their
corresponding improvement methods in the generated instructions. You can find

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Study examines how room acoustic improvements in a seminar room affect hybrid meeting communication quality, finding positive results despite small sample size limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hybrid meetings have become common since COVID-19, but acoustic design is often overlooked despite poor acoustics causing communication issues like reduced speech intelligibility and fatigue.

Method: Recorded two groups of participants in a seminar room at Graz University of Technology before and after acoustic improvements, comparing communication outcomes.

Result: Findings indicate that room acoustic interventions improve communicative success in hybrid meetings, though results did not reach statistical significance due to small sample size.

Conclusion: Acoustic design improvements support better communication in hybrid meeting spaces, highlighting the importance of considering acoustics alongside internet connectivity in hybrid room design.

Abstract: Since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, universities and companies have
increasingly integrated hybrid features into their meeting spaces, or even
created dedicated rooms for this purpose. While the importance of a fast and
stable internet connection is often prioritized, the acoustic design of seminar
rooms is frequently overlooked. Poor acoustics, particularly excessive
reverberation, can lead to issues such as misunderstandings, reduced speech
intelligibility or cognitive and vocal fatigue. This pilot study investigates
whether room acoustic interventions in a seminar room at Graz University of
Technology support better communication in hybrid meetings. For this purpose,
we recorded two groups of persons twice, once before and once after improving
the acoustics of the room. Our findings -- despite not reaching statistical
significance due to the small sample size - indicate clearly that our spatial
interventions improve communicative success in hybrid meetings. To make the
paper accessible also for readers from the speech communication community, we
explain room acoustics background, relevant for the interpretation of our
results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EU-mandated DoP documents vary widely in layout, language, schema, and format, making automated extraction challenging. Existing static or LLM-only approaches hallucinate and fail to adapt to this structural diversity.

Method: Domain-specific stateful agentic system with planner-executor-responder architecture that infers user intent, detects document modality, and dynamically orchestrates tools for robust, traceable reasoning while avoiding tool misuse.

Result: Evaluation on curated DoP dataset shows improved robustness across different formats and languages, demonstrating scalable structured data extraction for regulated workflows.

Conclusion: The proposed agentic system provides an effective solution for handling structural diversity in DoP documents, offering traceable reasoning and preventing common issues like hallucination and tool misuse in automated extraction pipelines.

Abstract: Declaration of Performance (DoP) documents, mandated by EU regulation,
certify the performance of construction products. While some of their content
is standardized, DoPs vary widely in layout, language, schema, and format,
posing challenges for automated key-value pair extraction (KVP) and question
answering (QA). Existing static or LLM-only IE pipelines often hallucinate and
fail to adapt to this structural diversity. Our domain-specific, stateful
agentic system addresses these challenges through a planner-executor-responder
architecture. The system infers user intent, detects document modality, and
orchestrates tools dynamically for robust, traceable reasoning while avoiding
tool misuse or execution loops. Evaluation on a curated DoP dataset
demonstrates improved robustness across formats and languages, offering a
scalable solution for structured data extraction in regulated workflows.

Result: A comprehensive dataset (UXPID) that facilitates research in user requirements, UX analysis, and AI-driven feedback processing, particularly useful where privacy restrictions limit access to real data.

Conclusion: UXPID enables training and evaluation of transformer models for technical forum analysis tasks like issue detection, sentiment analysis, and requirements extraction, addressing the challenge of unstructured industrial feedback analysis.

Abstract: Customer feedback in industrial forums reflect a rich but underexplored
source of insight into real-world product experience. These publicly shared
discussions offer an organic view of user expectations, frustrations, and
success stories shaped by the specific contexts of use. Yet, harnessing this
information for systematic analysis remains challenging due to the unstructured
and domain-specific nature of the content. The lack of structure and
specialized vocabulary makes it difficult for traditional data analysis
techniques to accurately interpret, categorize, and quantify the feedback,
thereby limiting its potential to inform product development and support
strategies. To address these challenges, this paper presents the User
eXperience Perception Insights Dataset (UXPID), a collection of 7130
artificially synthesized and anonymized user feedback branches extracted from a
public industrial automation forum. Each JavaScript object notation (JSON)
record contains multi-post comments related to specific hardware and software
products, enriched with metadata and contextual conversation data. Leveraging a
large language model (LLM), each branch is systematically analyzed and
annotated for UX insights, user expectations, severity and sentiment ratings,
and topic classifications. The UXPID dataset is designed to facilitate research
in user requirements, user experience (UX) analysis, and AI-driven feedback
processing, particularly where privacy and licensing restrictions limit access
to real-world data. UXPID supports the training and evaluation of
transformer-based models for tasks such as issue detection, sentiment analysis,
and requirements extraction in the context of technical forums.

*Dvora Goncharok,Arbel Shifman,Alexander Apartsin,Yehudit Aperstein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel annotated dataset for detecting critical medication-related questions from online forums and benchmarks traditional ML classifiers against LLM-based approaches for real-time health risk triage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online medical forums contain valuable patient insights about medication concerns, but critical questions that may signal confusion, misuse, or emerging health crises are often overlooked and require timely detection for patient safety interventions.

Method: Created a manually annotated dataset of medication-related questions labeled for clinical risk criticality. Evaluated six traditional ML classifiers using TF-IDF features and three state-of-the-art LLM-based classification approaches leveraging deep contextual understanding.

Result: The study demonstrates that both classical machine learning methods and modern LLM approaches show potential for effectively identifying critical medication questions, supporting the development of real-time triage and alert systems in digital health platforms.

Conclusion: The research provides a publicly available benchmark dataset to advance research at the intersection of patient-generated data, NLP, and early warning systems for critical health events, highlighting the viability of automated methods for detecting medication-related risks in online forums.

Abstract: Online medical forums are a rich and underutilized source of insight into
patient concerns, especially regarding medication use. Some of the many
questions users pose may signal confusion, misuse, or even the early warning
signs of a developing health crisis. Detecting these critical questions that
may precede severe adverse events or life-threatening complications is vital
for timely intervention and improving patient safety. This study introduces a
novel annotated dataset of medication-related questions extracted from online
forums. Each entry is manually labelled for criticality based on clinical risk
factors. We benchmark the performance of six traditional machine learning
classifiers using TF-IDF textual representations, alongside three
state-of-the-art large language model (LLM)-based classification approaches
that leverage deep contextual understanding. Our results highlight the
potential of classical and modern methods to support real-time triage and alert
systems in digital health spaces. The curated dataset is made publicly
available to encourage further research at the intersection of
patient-generated data, natural language processing, and early warning systems
for critical health events. The dataset and benchmark are available at:

*Eden Mama,Liel Sheri,Yehudit Aperstein,Alexander Apartsin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel synthetic dataset called Noisy Diagnostic Benchmark (NDB) is introduced to test LLMs' ability to interpret noisy, ambiguous patient narratives, with evaluation showing performance gaps in realistic healthcare scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks use clean clinical text, but real patient narratives are often informal, ambiguous, and noisy, creating a need to test LLMs under realistic linguistic conditions in healthcare.

Method: Created a synthetic dataset simulating patient self-descriptions with varying linguistic noise, fuzzy language, and layperson terminology. Fine-tuned and evaluated BERT-based and T5 models on this benchmark.

Result: The benchmark reveals performance limitations of current LLMs in handling noisy patient narratives. The NDB dataset is released to support reproducibility and future research in diagnostic capabilities testing.

Conclusion: The Noisy Diagnostic Benchmark provides a crucial tool for stress-testing LLMs' diagnostic abilities under realistic conditions, highlighting the need for improved models that can handle the linguistic challenges of real patient communication.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare raises
critical questions about their ability to interpret patient-generated
narratives, which are often informal, ambiguous, and noisy. Existing benchmarks
typically rely on clean, structured clinical text, offering limited insight
into model performance under realistic conditions. In this work, we present a
novel synthetic dataset designed to simulate patient self-descriptions
characterized by varying levels of linguistic noise, fuzzy language, and
layperson terminology. Our dataset comprises clinically consistent scenarios
annotated with ground-truth diagnoses, spanning a spectrum of communication
clarity to reflect diverse real-world reporting styles. Using this benchmark,
we fine-tune and evaluate several state-of-the-art models (LLMs), including
BERT-based and encoder-decoder T5 models. To support reproducibility and future
research, we release the Noisy Diagnostic Benchmark (NDB), a structured dataset
of noisy, synthetic patient descriptions designed to stress-test and compare
the diagnostic capabilities of large language models (LLMs) under realistic
linguistic conditions. We made the benchmark available for the community:

*Yulong Chen,Michael Sejr Schlichtkrull,Zhenyun Deng,David Corney,Nasim Asl,Joshua Salisbury,Andrew Dudfield,Andreas Vlachos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PledgeTracker is a system that reformulates political pledge verification into structured event timeline construction, addressing the dynamic and multi-document nature of tracking policy commitments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods simplify pledge verification into document classification, overlooking its dynamic, temporal, and multi-document nature, which requires reasoning over incremental evidence from multiple updated sources.

Method: PledgeTracker consists of three core components: (1) multi-step evidence retrieval module, (2) timeline construction module, and (3) fulfilment filtering module, enabling capture of evolving pledge fulfilment and producing interpretable structured timelines.

Result: The system was evaluated in collaboration with professional fact-checkers in real-world workflows, demonstrating effectiveness in retrieving relevant evidence and reducing human verification effort.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods by providing a structured framework for tracking political pledge fulfilment through event timeline construction.

Abstract: Political pledges reflect candidates' policy commitments, but tracking their
fulfilment requires reasoning over incremental evidence distributed across
multiple, dynamically updated sources. Existing methods simplify this task into
a document classification task, overlooking its dynamic, temporal and
multi-document nature. To address this issue, we introduce
\textsc{PledgeTracker}, a system that reformulates pledge verification into
structured event timeline construction. PledgeTracker consists of three core
components: (1) a multi-step evidence retrieval module; (2) a timeline
construction module and; (3) a fulfilment filtering module, allowing the
capture of the evolving nature of pledge fulfilment and producing interpretable
and structured timelines. We evaluate PledgeTracker in collaboration with
professional fact-checkers in real-world workflows, demonstrating its
effectiveness in retrieving relevant evidence and reducing human verification
effort.

*Taichi Aida,Danushka Bollegala*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SCDTour method orders and merges interpretable axes to balance SCD performance and interpretability without performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off problem where improving interpretability in semantic change detection often leads to performance loss, and vice versa.

Method: SCDTour orders and merges interpretable axes considering both semantic similarity between axes and each axis's contribution to semantic change.

Result: Preserves SCD performance while maintaining high interpretability, produces refined word senses with comparable/improved performance vs full-dimensional embeddings.

Conclusion: SCDTour effectively balances interpretability and performance, enabling meaningful interpretation of semantic shifts through a small number of refined axes.

Abstract: In Semantic Change Detection (SCD), it is a common problem to obtain
embeddings that are both interpretable and high-performing. However, improving
interpretability often leads to a loss in the SCD performance, and vice versa.
To address this problem, we propose SCDTour, a method that orders and merges
interpretable axes to alleviate the performance degradation of SCD. SCDTour
considers both (a) semantic similarity between axes in the embedding space, as
well as (b) the degree to which each axis contributes to semantic change.
Experimental results show that SCDTour preserves performance in semantic change
detection while maintaining high interpretability. Moreover, agglomerating the
sorted axes produces a more refined set of word senses, which achieves
comparable or improved performance against the original full-dimensional
embeddings in the SCD task. These findings demonstrate that SCDTour effectively
balances interpretability and SCD performance, enabling meaningful
interpretation of semantic shifts through a small number of refined axes.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MOOM is a dual-branch memory plugin that controls memory growth in ultra-long dialogues by modeling plot development and character portrayal, with an integrated forgetting mechanism inspired by competition-inhibition theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory extraction methods for human-robot role-playing dialogues suffer from uncontrolled memory growth, which hinders coherent ultra-long dialogue maintenance.

Method: Propose MOOM with two branches: one summarizes plot conflicts across multiple time scales, and the other extracts user's character profile. Integrates a forgetting mechanism based on competition-inhibition memory theory to constrain memory capacity.

Result: MOOM outperforms all state-of-the-art memory extraction methods, requires fewer LLM invocations, and maintains controllable memory capacity. Also presents ZH-4O dataset with 600-turn average dialogues and manual memory annotations.

Conclusion: MOOM effectively addresses uncontrolled memory growth in ultra-long role-playing dialogues through literary theory-inspired dual-branch architecture and cognitive forgetting mechanisms.

Abstract: Memory extraction is crucial for maintaining coherent ultra-long dialogues in
human-robot role-playing scenarios. However, existing methods often exhibit
uncontrolled memory growth. To address this, we propose MOOM, the first
dual-branch memory plugin that leverages literary theory by modeling plot
development and character portrayal as core storytelling elements.
Specifically, one branch summarizes plot conflicts across multiple time scales,
while the other extracts the user's character profile. MOOM further integrates
a forgetting mechanism, inspired by the ``competition-inhibition'' memory
theory, to constrain memory capacity and mitigate uncontrolled growth.
Furthermore, we present ZH-4O, a Chinese ultra-long dialogue dataset
specifically designed for role-playing, featuring dialogues that average 600
turns and include manually annotated memory information. Experimental results
demonstrate that MOOM outperforms all state-of-the-art memory extraction
methods, requiring fewer large language model invocations while maintaining a
controllable memory capacity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PerspAct system integrates ReAct paradigm with LLMs to simulate developmental perspective taking stages, showing GPT can generate stage-consistent narratives that evolve during collaboration, with higher stages improving task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few computational models address both language and embodied perspective taking simultaneously, which are essential for human collaboration. The research aims to bridge this gap by integrating LLMs with developmental theory.

Method: Uses PerspAct system combining ReAct paradigm with LLMs, evaluated through extended director task. Assesses GPT's ability to generate developmentally-consistent narratives and their impact on collaborative performance both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Result: GPT reliably produces developmentally-consistent narratives before task execution but often shifts to more advanced stages during interaction. Higher developmental stages enhance collaborative effectiveness, while earlier stages yield more variable outcomes in complex contexts.

Conclusion: Language exchanges help refine internal representations in LLMs. Integrating embodied perspective taking and language shows potential for modeling developmental dynamics, highlighting the importance of evaluating internal speech during combined linguistic and embodied tasks.

Abstract: Language and embodied perspective taking are essential for human
collaboration, yet few computational models address both simultaneously. This
work investigates the PerspAct system [1], which integrates the ReAct (Reason
and Act) paradigm with Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate developmental
stages of perspective taking, grounded in Selman's theory [2]. Using an
extended director task, we evaluate GPT's ability to generate internal
narratives aligned with specified developmental stages, and assess how these
influence collaborative performance both qualitatively (action selection) and
quantitatively (task efficiency). Results show that GPT reliably produces
developmentally-consistent narratives before task execution but often shifts
towards more advanced stages during interaction, suggesting that language
exchanges help refine internal representations. Higher developmental stages
generally enhance collaborative effectiveness, while earlier stages yield more
variable outcomes in complex contexts. These findings highlight the potential
of integrating embodied perspective taking and language in LLMs to better model
developmental dynamics and stress the importance of evaluating internal speech
during combined linguistic and embodied tasks.

### [258] [Uncertainty in Authorship: Why Perfect AI Detection Is Mathematically Impossible](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11915)
*Aadil Gani Ganie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper draws a quantum uncertainty parallel to AI-text detection, arguing that perfect detection is theoretically impossible when AI closely mimics human writing due to inherent trade-offs between detection accuracy and text authenticity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs advance, distinguishing human-written from AI-generated text becomes increasingly difficult, raising fundamental questions about the limits of authorship detection and the theoretical possibility of perfect detection.

Method: The paper uses conceptual analysis drawing parallels with quantum uncertainty principles, examining current detection methods (stylometry, watermarking, neural classifiers) and their inherent limitations through theoretical framework development.

Result: Analysis shows that enhancing detection accuracy often disrupts text authenticity, creating a fundamental trade-off where perfect detection becomes theoretically impossible when AI text closely mimics human writing.

Conclusion: The AI-text detection challenge reflects a deeper, unavoidable tension in language nature itself, not just a technological problem, with significant implications for authorship, ethics, and policy.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more advanced, it is increasingly
difficult to distinguish between human-written and AI-generated text. This
paper draws a conceptual parallel between quantum uncertainty and the limits of
authorship detection in natural language. We argue that there is a fundamental
trade-off: the more confidently one tries to identify whether a text was
written by a human or an AI, the more one risks disrupting the text's natural
flow and authenticity. This mirrors the tension between precision and
disturbance found in quantum systems. We explore how current detection
methods--such as stylometry, watermarking, and neural classifiers--face
inherent limitations. Enhancing detection accuracy often leads to changes in
the AI's output, making other features less reliable. In effect, the very act
of trying to detect AI authorship introduces uncertainty elsewhere in the text.
Our analysis shows that when AI-generated text closely mimics human writing,
perfect detection becomes not just technologically difficult but theoretically
impossible. We address counterarguments and discuss the broader implications
for authorship, ethics, and policy. Ultimately, we suggest that the challenge
of AI-text detection is not just a matter of better tools--it reflects a
deeper, unavoidable tension in the nature of language itself.

### [259] [Designing LLMs for cultural sensitivity: Evidence from English-Japanese translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11921)
*Helene Tenzer,Oumnia Abidi,Stefan Feuerriegel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs generate accurate literal translations but lack cultural sensitivity. Culturally-tailored prompting improves cultural appropriateness in English-Japanese workplace email translations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs produce near-perfect literal translations, their ability to support culturally appropriate communication across different cultural contexts remains unclear, particularly in multilingual workplace interactions.

Method: Analyzed cultural sensitivity of different LLM designs using three prompting strategies: naive translation prompts, audience-targeted prompts specifying cultural background, and instructional prompts with explicit guidance on Japanese communication norms. Used mixed-methods study to evaluate culture-specific language patterns and native speaker perceptions of translation appropriateness.

Result: Culturally-tailored prompting can improve cultural fit in translations, demonstrating that explicit cultural guidance enhances LLM performance in multilingual communication settings.

Conclusion: The study provides recommendations for designing culturally inclusive LLMs that can better handle multilingual interactions by incorporating culturally-sensitive prompting strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in everyday communication,
including multilingual interactions across different cultural contexts. While
LLMs can now generate near-perfect literal translations, it remains unclear
whether LLMs support culturally appropriate communication. In this paper, we
analyze the cultural sensitivity of different LLM designs when applied to
English-Japanese translations of workplace e-mails. Here, we vary the prompting
strategies: (1) naive "just translate" prompts, (2) audience-targeted prompts
specifying the recipient's cultural background, and (3) instructional prompts
with explicit guidance on Japanese communication norms. Using a mixed-methods
study, we then analyze culture-specific language patterns to evaluate how well
translations adapt to cultural norms. Further, we examine the appropriateness
of the tone of the translations as perceived by native speakers. We find that
culturally-tailored prompting can improve cultural fit, based on which we offer
recommendations for designing culturally inclusive LLMs in multilingual
settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Spec-LLaVA accelerates Vision-Language Models using speculative decoding with a lightweight draft model and dynamic tree-based verification, achieving 3.28x faster decoding without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models suffer from slow autoregressive inference, limiting their deployment in real-time applications that require fast multimodal reasoning.

Method: Pairs a lightweight draft VLM with a large target model, using speculative decoding where the draft speculates future tokens and the target verifies them in parallel. Implements a dynamic tree-based verification algorithm that adaptively expands and prunes speculative branches based on draft model confidence.

Result: Achieves up to 3.28x faster decoding on LLaVA-1.5 (7B, 13B) models on MS COCO out-of-domain images with no loss in generation quality.

Conclusion: Presents a lossless acceleration framework for VLMs using dynamic tree-structured speculative decoding, enabling practical real-time multimodal assistants and resource-constrained deployment.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable powerful multimodal reasoning but suffer
from slow autoregressive inference, limiting their deployment in real-time
applications. We introduce Spec-LLaVA, a system that applies speculative
decoding to accelerate VLMs without sacrificing output quality. Spec-LLaVA
pairs a lightweight draft VLM with a large target model: the draft speculates
future tokens, which the target verifies in parallel, allowing multiple tokens
to be generated per step. To maximize efficiency, we design a dynamic
tree-based verification algorithm that adaptively expands and prunes
speculative branches using draft model confidence. On MS COCO out-of-domain
images, Spec-LLaVA achieves up to 3.28$\times$ faster decoding on LLaVA-1.5
(7B, 13B) with no loss in generation quality. This work presents a lossless
acceleration framework for VLMs using dynamic tree-structured speculative
decoding, opening a path toward practical real-time multimodal assistants.
Importantly, the lightweight draft model design makes the framework amenable to
resource-constrained or on-device deployment settings.

TL;DR: FC-RewardBench is a new benchmark showing current reward models fail at evaluating tool use in LLMs. The authors propose outcome-based reward models trained on synthetic data that outperform general models by up to 25%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward models trained on natural language outputs struggle to evaluate tool-based reasoning and execution in LLMs, creating a critical gap in assessing tool-calling scenarios.

Method: Proposed a training framework for outcome-based reward models using data synthesized from open-weight LLMs, with models ranging from 1.7B to 14B parameters.

Result: The trained models consistently outperform general-purpose baselines, achieving up to 25% average improvement in downstream task performance and enabling data-efficient fine-tuning through reward-guided filtering.

Conclusion: Domain-specific reward modeling for tool use is necessary and effective, with the proposed outcome-based approach significantly improving performance over general reward models.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly interact with external tools,
reward modeling for tool use has become a critical yet underexplored area.
Existing reward models, trained primarily on natural language outputs, struggle
to evaluate tool-based reasoning and execution. To quantify this gap, we
introduce FC-RewardBench, the first benchmark designed to systematically assess
reward models' performance in tool-calling scenarios. Our analysis shows that
current reward models often miss key signals of effective tool use,
highlighting the need for domain-specific modeling. To address this, we propose
a training framework for outcome-based reward models using data synthesized
from permissively licensed, open-weight LLMs. We train models ranging from 1.7B
to 14B parameters and evaluate them across seven out-of-domain benchmarks.
These models consistently outperform general-purpose baselines, achieving up to
25\% average improvement in downstream task performance and enabling
data-efficient fine-tuning through reward-guided filtering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve productivity in analyzing client feedback by addressing the linguistic dissonance between queries and source documents in query-focused summarization tasks.

Method: Proposed a multi-bias framework with domain-agnostic approaches and specialized sentiment-based biases with query expansion techniques.

Result: Achieved experimental results outperforming baseline models on a real-world proprietary sentiment-aware QFS dataset.

Conclusion: The multi-bias framework effectively bridges the gap between queries and documents, demonstrating superior performance in sentiment explanation tasks compared to baseline models.

Abstract: Constructive analysis of feedback from clients often requires determining the
cause of their sentiment from a substantial amount of text documents. To assist
and improve the productivity of such endeavors, we leverage the task of
Query-Focused Summarization (QFS). Models of this task are often impeded by the
linguistic dissonance between the query and the source documents. We propose
and substantiate a multi-bias framework to help bridge this gap at a
domain-agnostic, generic level; we then formulate specialized approaches for
the problem of sentiment explanation through sentiment-based biases and query
expansion. We achieve experimental results outperforming baseline models on a
real-world proprietary sentiment-aware QFS dataset.

Motivation: To develop an effective method for adapting Spanish texts to Plain Language and Easy Read formats through automated simplification while maintaining content similarity.

Method: Automatic post-editing of Large Language Model adaptations with iterative refinement cycles, using readability and similarity metrics to determine when to stop further adaptation.

Result: Achieved first place in Plain Language adaptation and second place in Easy Read adaptation in the CLEARS challenge based on average official metrics.

Conclusion: Iterative LLM adaptation with metric-based stopping criteria proves effective for Spanish text simplification tasks, yielding top performance in official evaluations.

Abstract: We describe Vicomtech's participation in the CLEARS challenge on text
adaptation to Plain Language and Easy Read in Spanish. Our approach features
automatic post-editing of different types of initial Large Language Model

*Alina Klerings,Jannik Brinkmann,Daniel Ruffinelli,Simone Ponzetto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs encode verb tense and aspect as orthogonal directions in residual space, enabling causal control through concept steering, but effective generation requires careful parameter tuning to avoid side effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how large language models internally represent and can be controlled for multidimensional hierarchical grammar phenomena like verb tense and aspect, moving beyond binary grammatical contrasts.

Method: Used linear discriminant analysis to identify distinct orthogonal directions for tense and aspect in residual space, then demonstrated causal control through concept steering across three generation tasks, investigating steering parameters in multi-token generation.

Result: Identified structurally organized representations of tense and aspect similar to human language processing, but found that effective steering requires careful tuning of strength, location, and duration parameters to minimize undesirable side effects like topic shift and degeneration.

Conclusion: LLMs encode tense and aspect in human-like structural patterns, but controlling these features during generation is sensitive to multiple factors and requires either manual tuning or automated optimization for effective application.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are able to generate grammatically well-formed
text, but how do they encode their syntactic knowledge internally? While prior
work has focused largely on binary grammatical contrasts, in this work, we
study the representation and control of two multidimensional hierarchical
grammar phenomena - verb tense and aspect - and for each, identify distinct,
orthogonal directions in residual space using linear discriminant analysis.
Next, we demonstrate causal control over both grammatical features through
concept steering across three generation tasks. Then, we use these identified
features in a case study to investigate factors influencing effective steering
in multi-token generation. We find that steering strength, location, and
duration are crucial parameters for reducing undesirable side effects such as
topic shift and degeneration. Our findings suggest that models encode tense and
aspect in structurally organized, human-like ways, but effective control of
such features during generation is sensitive to multiple factors and requires
manual tuning or automated optimization.

TL;DR: SENSE is an open-source multilingual speech-text alignment model that improves upon SAMU-XLSR with better teacher text models and speech encoders, achieving competitive performance on semantic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an improved multilingual speech-text representation alignment framework that builds upon existing teacher-student approaches like SAMU-XLSR and SONAR for better semantic understanding across languages.

Method: Uses teacher-student framework to align self-supervised speech encoder with language-agnostic text encoder representations at utterance level. Updates SAMU-XLSR with stronger teacher text model and better initial speech encoder.

Result: Achieves highly competitive performance on multilingual and multimodal semantic tasks. First SENSE model publicly released and integrated into SpeechBrain toolkit.

Conclusion: Provides new insights into how semantics are captured in semantically aligned speech encoders and offers an open-source solution for multilingual speech-text representation learning.

Abstract: This paper introduces SENSE (Shared Embedding for N-lingual Speech and tExt),
an open-source solution inspired by the SAMU-XLSR framework and conceptually
similar to Meta AI's SONAR models. These approaches rely on a teacher-student
framework to align a self-supervised speech encoder with the language-agnostic
continuous representations of a text encoder at the utterance level. We
describe how the original SAMU-XLSR method has been updated by selecting a
stronger teacher text model and a better initial speech encoder. The source
code for training and using SENSE models has been integrated into the
SpeechBrain toolkit, and the first SENSE model we trained has been publicly
released. We report experimental results on multilingual and multimodal
semantic tasks, where our SENSE model achieves highly competitive performance.
Finally, this study offers new insights into how semantics are captured in such
semantically aligned speech encoders.

TL;DR: LLMs outperform traditional NER tools on context-sensitive entities like person names, with Gemini achieving highest F1-score, but traditional tools like Stanza show better consistency on structured tags like locations and dates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compare Named Entity Recognition performance between traditional NLP tools (NLTK, spaCy, Stanza) and modern large language models (Gemini, DeepSeek, Qwen) on a carefully annotated benchmark dataset.

Method: Evaluated six systems on a 119-token dataset with five entity types using F1-score against a manually annotated gold standard. Compared three non-LLM tools with three LLMs.

Result: LLMs generally outperformed conventional tools, especially for context-sensitive entities like person names. Gemini achieved the highest average F1-score. Traditional systems like Stanza showed greater consistency for structured tags (LOCATION, DATE). Variability observed among LLMs in handling temporal expressions and multi-word organizations.

Conclusion: While LLMs offer improved contextual understanding, traditional tools remain competitive for specific tasks, providing guidance for model selection based on entity type requirements.

Abstract: This pilot study presents a small-scale but carefully annotated benchmark of
Named Entity Recognition (NER) performance across six systems: three non-LLM
NLP tools (NLTK, spaCy, Stanza) and three general-purpose large language models
(LLMs: Gemini-1.5-flash, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen-3-4B). The dataset contains 119
tokens covering five entity types (PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANIZATION, DATE, TIME).
We evaluated each system's output against the manually annotated gold standard
dataset using F1-score. The results show that LLMs generally outperform
conventional tools in recognizing context-sensitive entities like person names,
with Gemini achieving the highest average F1-score. However, traditional
systems like Stanza demonstrate greater consistency in structured tags such as

TL;DR: Domain-specific self-supervised pre-training on ATC data significantly improves ASR performance for air traffic control applications, reducing word error rates compared to general-purpose models, with streaming approaches enabling real-time processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) accuracy and efficiency in safety-critical Air Traffic Control environments by leveraging domain-specific self-supervised learning rather than relying on general-purpose speech models.

Method: Trained BEST-RQ models on 4.5k hours of unlabeled ATC data, then fine-tuned on supervised ATC data. Proposed chunked attention and dynamic convolutions for low-latency streaming inference. Compared against w2v-BERT 2.0 and HuBERT.

Result: Domain-adapted pre-training substantially improved performance on ATC benchmarks, significantly reducing word error rates. Streaming approach further improved WER under tight latency constraints.

Conclusion: Specializing SSL representations for ATC data is a practical approach for developing more accurate and efficient ASR systems suitable for real-world aviation operational settings.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the benefits of domain-specific self-supervised
pre-training for both offline and streaming ASR in Air Traffic Control (ATC)
environments. We train BEST-RQ models on 4.5k hours of unlabeled ATC data, then
fine-tune on a smaller supervised ATC set. To enable real-time processing, we
propose using chunked attention and dynamic convolutions, ensuring low-latency
inference. We compare these in-domain SSL models against state-of-the-art,
general-purpose speech encoders such as w2v-BERT 2.0 and HuBERT. Results show
that domain-adapted pre-training substantially improves performance on standard
ATC benchmarks, significantly reducing word error rates when compared to models
trained on broad speech corpora. Furthermore, the proposed streaming approach
further improves word error rate under tighter latency constraints, making it
particularly suitable for safety-critical aviation applications. These findings
highlight that specializing SSL representations for ATC data is a practical
path toward more accurate and efficient ASR systems in real-world operational
settings.

*Min Zeng,Jinfei Sun,Xueyou Luo,Caiquan Liu,Shiqi Zhang,Li Xie,Xiaoxin Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GTA framework combines supervised fine-tuning efficiency with RL capability gains through a guess-think-answer process using hybrid training signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the efficiency-capability trade-off between pure RL (slow convergence, inefficient exploration) and SFT (limited performance ceiling, weak theoretical foundation) in NLP tasks.

Method: Proposes Guess-Think-Answer framework: model produces provisional guess (cross-entropy loss), reflects on it, then generates final answer with RL rewards shaping both output and structure format. Uses loss masking and gradient constraints to mitigate training signal conflicts.

Result: Substantially accelerates convergence while outperforming both standalone SFT and RL baselines on four text classification benchmarks.

Conclusion: GTA successfully combines the efficiency of SFT with the capability gains of RL, achieving faster convergence than pure RL and higher performance than pure SFT in a unified training paradigm.

Abstract: In natural language processing tasks, pure reinforcement learning (RL)
fine-tuning methods often suffer from inefficient exploration and slow
convergence; while supervised fine-tuning (SFT) methods, although efficient in
training, have limited performance ceiling and less solid theoretical
foundation compared to RL. To address efficiency-capability trade-off, we
propose the Guess-Think-Answer (GTA) framework that combines the efficiency of
SFT with the capability gains of RL in a unified training paradigm. GTA works
by having the model first produce a provisional guess (optimized via
cross-entropy loss), then reflect on this guess before generating the final
answer, with RL rewards shaping both the final output and the format of the
entire GTA structure. This hybrid approach achieves both faster convergence
than pure RL and higher performance ceiling than pure SFT. To mitigate gradient
conflicts between the two training signals, we employ loss masking and gradient
constraints. Empirical results on four text classification benchmarks
demonstrate that GTA substantially accelerates convergence while outperforming
both standalone SFT and RL baselines.

*Jiaxuan Zhao,Naibin Gu,Yuchen Feng,Xiyu Liu,Peng Fu,Zheng Lin,Weiping Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CBP-Tuning enables efficient local customization of black-box LLMs without accessing model weights or uploading private data, using server-side prompt generation and client-side gradient-free optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the dual challenge of high customization costs for LLMs and privacy risks when users expose sensitive data to cloud-based services, enabling personalized adaptation while preserving privacy.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Server-side prompt generator trained to capture domain-specific capabilities, 2) User-side gradient-free optimization that tailors soft prompts for individual tasks without accessing model weights.

Result: Superior performance demonstrated in commonsense reasoning, medical, and financial domains compared to baselines, achieving effective adaptation with only a single customized vector per task.

Conclusion: CBP-Tuning provides an effective solution for privacy-preserving LLM customization that eliminates the need for model weight access or data upload while maintaining strong task performance across multiple domains.

Abstract: The high costs of customizing large language models (LLMs) fundamentally
limit their adaptability to user-specific needs. Consequently, LLMs are
increasingly offered as cloud-based services, a paradigm that introduces
critical limitations: providers struggle to support personalized customization
at scale, while users face privacy risks when exposing sensitive data. To
address this dual challenge, we propose Customized Black-box Prompt Tuning
(CBP-Tuning), a novel framework that facilitates efficient local customization
while preserving bidirectional privacy. Specifically, we design a two-stage
framework: (1) a prompt generator trained on the server-side to capture
domain-specific and task-agnostic capabilities, and (2) user-side gradient-free
optimization that tailors soft prompts for individual tasks. This approach
eliminates the need for users to access model weights or upload private data,
requiring only a single customized vector per task while achieving effective
adaptation. Furthermore, the evaluation of CBP-Tuning in the commonsense
reasoning, medical and financial domain settings demonstrates superior
performance compared to baselines, showcasing its advantages in task-agnostic
processing and privacy preservation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: XplaiNLP's submission to CheckThat! 2025 multilingual subjectivity detection task used supervised fine-tuning of transformer models and zero-shot LLM prompting, achieving top results in Italian and competitive performance in several languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop effective approaches for multilingual subjectivity detection across diverse languages, addressing challenges in cross-lingual generalization particularly for low-resource scenarios.

Method: Two approaches: (1) Supervised fine-tuning of transformer encoders (EuroBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, German-BERT) on monolingual and machine-translated data; (2) Zero-shot prompting using LLMs (o3-mini for rule-based labeling, gpt-4.1-mini for contrastive rewriting and comparative reasoning).

Result: Achieved 1st place in Italian monolingual subtask (F1=0.8104 vs baseline 0.6941). XLM-RoBERTa ranked 3rd in Romanian zero-shot (F1=0.7917 vs 0.6461 baseline). Reliable multilingual performance with improvements in Greek. German-BERT performed competitively. Performance fell below baselines in Ukrainian and Polish zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: Transformer fine-tuning and LLM prompting are effective for multilingual subjectivity detection, though cross-lingual generalization remains challenging for low-resource languages. The approaches demonstrated strong performance across multiple languages while highlighting limitations in zero-shot scenarios.

Abstract: This notebook reports the XplaiNLP submission to the CheckThat! 2025 shared
task on multilingual subjectivity detection. We evaluate two approaches: (1)
supervised fine-tuning of transformer encoders, EuroBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, and
German-BERT, on monolingual and machine-translated training data; and (2)
zero-shot prompting using two LLMs: o3-mini for Annotation (rule-based
labelling) and gpt-4.1-mini for DoubleDown (contrastive rewriting) and
Perspective (comparative reasoning). The Annotation Approach achieves 1st place
in the Italian monolingual subtask with an F_1 score of 0.8104, outperforming
the baseline of 0.6941. In the Romanian zero-shot setting, the fine-tuned
XLM-RoBERTa model obtains an F_1 score of 0.7917, ranking 3rd and exceeding the
baseline of 0.6461. The same model also performs reliably in the multilingual
task and improves over the baseline in Greek. For German, a German-BERT model
fine-tuned on translated training data from typologically related languages
yields competitive performance over the baseline. In contrast, performance in
the Ukrainian and Polish zero-shot settings falls slightly below the respective
baselines, reflecting the challenge of generalization in low-resource
cross-lingual scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show shallow understanding of puns despite detection capabilities, being easily misled by subtle changes in wordplay that humans grasp more deeply.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the limitations of LLMs in understanding nuanced wordplay like puns, which require deep semantic and phonetic comprehension that current models may lack.

Method: Systematically analyzing and reformulating existing pun benchmarks, creating comprehensive detection benchmarks, and conducting human evaluations across recent LLMs to test robustness.

Result: LLMs demonstrate superficial pun detection but lack nuanced human-like understanding, being vulnerable to subtle modifications in pun structure that easily mislead them.

Conclusion: Current LLMs face significant robustness challenges in processing puns, highlighting the gap between surface-level pattern recognition and deep semantic understanding required for true pun comprehension.

Abstract: Puns are a form of humorous wordplay that exploits polysemy and phonetic
similarity. While LLMs have shown promise in detecting puns, we show in this
paper that their understanding often remains shallow, lacking the nuanced grasp
typical of human interpretation. By systematically analyzing and reformulating
existing pun benchmarks, we demonstrate how subtle changes in puns are
sufficient to mislead LLMs. Our contributions include comprehensive and nuanced
pun detection benchmarks, human evaluation across recent LLMs, and an analysis
of the robustness challenges these models face in processing puns.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RAGs-to-Riches framework improves LLM role-playing by reformulating it as a retrieval problem, using curated demonstrations to maintain character authenticity and reduce harmful improvisation with hostile users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs deployed in high-stakes domains need reliable role-playing capabilities, but few-shot learning approaches often cause models to break character in harmful ways when interacting with hostile users.

Method: Reformulates LLM role-playing as a text retrieval problem using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) principles, with curated reference demonstrations to condition LLM responses. Introduces token-level ROUGE metrics (IOO and IOR) for evaluation.

Result: Incorporates 35% more tokens from reference demonstrations during hostile interactions. Across 453 interactions, models were consistently judged more authentic and remained in-character more often than zero-shot and ICL methods.

Conclusion: Presents a scalable strategy for building robust, human-aligned LLM role-playing frameworks that maintain character consistency even with hostile users.

Abstract: Role-playing Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in
high-stakes domains such as healthcare, education, and governance, where
failures can directly impact user trust and well-being. A cost effective
paradigm for LLM role-playing is few-shot learning, but existing approaches
often cause models to break character in unexpected and potentially harmful
ways, especially when interacting with hostile users. Inspired by
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we reformulate LLM role-playing into a
text retrieval problem and propose a new prompting framework called
RAGs-to-Riches, which leverages curated reference demonstrations to condition
LLM responses. We evaluate our framework with LLM-as-a-judge preference voting
and introduce two novel token-level ROUGE metrics: Intersection over Output
(IOO) to quantity how much an LLM improvises and Intersection over References
(IOR) to measure few-shot demonstrations utilization rate during the evaluation
tasks. When simulating interactions with a hostile user, our prompting strategy
incorporates in its responses during inference an average of 35% more tokens
from the reference demonstrations. As a result, across 453 role-playing
interactions, our models are consistently judged as being more authentic, and
remain in-character more often than zero-shot and in-context Learning (ICL)
methods. Our method presents a scalable strategy for building robust,
human-aligned LLM role-playing frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate scientific discovery by finding mathematical functions that describe multiple datasets from the same phenomena, addressing overfitting and data scarcity issues.

Method: Tested and compared MvSR implementations in four different platforms (Operon, PySR, phy-SO, eggp) using various real-world datasets to evaluate their performance.

Result: All implementations achieved good accuracy with sparse solutions (few free parameters), but certain features enabled more frequent generation of better models.

Conclusion: Provides guidelines for future MvSR development based on comparative analysis of different implementations' performance and capabilities.

Abstract: Describing the world behavior through mathematical functions help scientists
to achieve a better understanding of the inner mechanisms of different
phenomena. Traditionally, this is done by deriving new equations from first
principles and careful observations. A modern alternative is to automate part
of this process with symbolic regression (SR). The SR algorithms search for a
function that adequately fits the observed data while trying to enforce
sparsity, in the hopes of generating an interpretable equation. A particularly
interesting extension to these algorithms is the Multi-view Symbolic Regression
(MvSR). It searches for a parametric function capable of describing multiple
datasets generated by the same phenomena, which helps to mitigate the common
problems of overfitting and data scarcity. Recently, multiple implementations
added support to MvSR with small differences between them. In this paper, we
test and compare MvSR as supported in Operon, PySR, phy-SO, and eggp, in
different real-world datasets. We show that they all often achieve good
accuracy while proposing solutions with only few free parameters. However, we
find that certain features enable a more frequent generation of better models.
We conclude by providing guidelines for future MvSR developments.

Conclusion: ZIDF robustly handles sparse time series data and shows potential generalizability to other domains where zero inflation is a key challenge, making it a promising framework for precipitation forecasting and similar applications.

Abstract: Zero-inflated data pose significant challenges in precipitation forecasting
due to the predominance of zeros with sparse non-zero events. To address this,
we propose the Zero Inflation Diffusion Framework (ZIDF), which integrates
Gaussian perturbation for smoothing zero-inflated distributions,
Transformer-based prediction for capturing temporal patterns, and
diffusion-based denoising to restore the original data structure. In our

TL;DR: FEDEXCHANGE is a federated object detection framework that improves cross-domain generalization through server-side model exchange without adding local computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated object detection faces challenges with domain variations and existing methods overlook edge device constraints while introducing high computational costs.

Method: Uses server-side dynamic model exchange strategy with alternating aggregation and exchange rounds, clustering models based on distance measures to enable cross-domain learning.

Result: Achieves 1.6X better mean average precision in challenging domains like rainy conditions while requiring only 0.8X computational resources compared to baselines.

Conclusion: FEDEXCHANGE effectively bridges domain gaps in federated object detection without additional client-side computational burden, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Federated Object Detection (FOD) enables clients to collaboratively train a
global object detection model without accessing their local data from diverse
domains. However, significant variations in environment, weather, and other
domain specific factors hinder performance, making cross domain generalization
a key challenge. Existing FOD methods often overlook the hardware constraints
of edge devices and introduce local training regularizations that incur high
computational costs, limiting real-world applicability. In this paper, we
propose FEDEXCHANGE, a novel FOD framework that bridges domain gaps without
introducing additional local computational overhead. FEDEXCHANGE employs a
server side dynamic model exchange strategy that enables each client to gain
insights from other clients' domain data without direct data sharing.
Specifically, FEDEXCHANGE allows the server to alternate between model
aggregation and model exchange. During aggregation rounds, the server
aggregates all local models as usual. In exchange rounds, FEDEXCHANGE clusters
and exchanges local models based on distance measures, allowing local models to
learn from a variety of domains. As all operations are performed on the server
side, clients can achieve improved cross domain utility without any additional
computational overhead. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that FEDEXCHANGE
enhances FOD performance, achieving 1.6X better mean average precision in
challenging domains, such as rainy conditions, while requiring only 0.8X the
computational resources compared to baseline methods.

TL;DR: InterRetro reframes retrosynthesis as worst-path optimization in tree MDPs, achieving 100% success on Retro*-190 benchmark with shorter routes and better data efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing retrosynthesis methods optimize for average performance but fail to address the 'weakest link' problem where any invalid building block makes the entire synthesis tree invalid.

Method: Interactive Retrosynthesis Planning (InterRetro) treats retrosynthesis as worst-path optimization in tree-structured MDPs, learns value functions for worst outcomes, and improves policy through self-imitation with high-advantage decisions.

Result: Achieves 100% success rate on Retro*-190 benchmark, shortens synthetic routes by 4.9%, and shows promising performance using only 10% of training data.

Conclusion: InterRetro represents a significant advance in computational retrosynthesis planning by addressing worst-case sensitivity through novel worst-path optimization formulation.

Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning aims to decompose target molecules into available
building blocks, forming a synthesis tree where each internal node represents
an intermediate compound and each leaf ideally corresponds to a purchasable
reactant. However, this tree becomes invalid if any leaf node is not a valid
building block, making the planning process vulnerable to the "weakest link" in
the synthetic route. Existing methods often optimise for average performance
across branches, failing to account for this worst-case sensitivity. In this
paper, we reframe retrosynthesis as a worst-path optimisation problem within
tree-structured Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). We prove that this
formulation admits a unique optimal solution and offers monotonic improvement
guarantees. Building on this insight, we introduce Interactive Retrosynthesis
Planning (InterRetro), a method that interacts with the tree MDP, learns a
value function for worst-path outcomes, and improves its policy through
self-imitation, preferentially reinforcing past decisions with high estimated
advantage. Empirically, InterRetro achieves state-of-the-art results, solving
100% of targets on the Retro*-190 benchmark, shortening synthetic routes by
4.9%, and achieving promising performance using only 10% of the training data -
representing a significant advance in computational retrosynthesis planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional gradient boosting decision trees lack adaptive mechanisms to identify and emphasize the most relevant features under rapidly changing retail conditions and noisy, heterogeneous data.

Method: Proposes AttnBoost framework that integrates a lightweight attention mechanism into the boosting process to dynamically adjust feature importance during each boosting round, focusing on high-impact variables like promotions, pricing, and seasonal trends.

Result: Outperforms standard machine learning and deep tabular models on large-scale retail sales dataset. Ablation study confirms the attention module helps mitigate overfitting and improves interpretability.

Conclusion: Attention-guided boosting represents a promising direction for interpretable and scalable AI in real-world forecasting applications, providing both predictive accuracy and actionable insights for supply chain managers.

Abstract: Forecasting product demand in retail supply chains presents a complex
challenge due to noisy, heterogeneous features and rapidly shifting consumer
behavior. While traditional gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT) offer
strong predictive performance on structured data, they often lack adaptive
mechanisms to identify and emphasize the most relevant features under changing
conditions. In this work, we propose AttnBoost, an interpretable learning
framework that integrates feature-level attention into the boosting process to
enhance both predictive accuracy and explainability. Specifically, the model
dynamically adjusts feature importance during each boosting round via a
lightweight attention mechanism, allowing it to focus on high-impact variables
such as promotions, pricing, and seasonal trends. We evaluate AttnBoost on a
large-scale retail sales dataset and demonstrate that it outperforms standard
machine learning and deep tabular models, while also providing actionable
insights for supply chain managers. An ablation study confirms the utility of

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Selective feedback mechanism reverses model collapse in LLMs, inducing performance improvement instead of degradation - called the Anti-Ouroboros Effect


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the foundational AI safety problem of model stability and challenge the prevailing theory that predicts progressive degradation when models are trained on their own output

Method: Introduced a selective feedback mechanism and conducted experiments comparing quality-filtered conditions vs unfiltered and random-filter controls across five generations using a Gemma 2B model on complex summarization

Result: Quality-filtered condition improved by 6.6% in ROUGE-L F1 score, while unfiltered control degraded by 3.5% and random-filter control degraded by 4.2%

Conclusion: Systemic resilience can be an emergent property of LLMs under simple selection pressure, suggesting a powerful and scalable principle for developing safer and more robust AI systems

Abstract: The stability of recursively trained large language models (LLMs) is a
foundational problem for AI safety. Prevailing theory predicts model collapse,
a progressive degradation when models are trained on their own output. We
challenge this narrative by introducing a selective feedback mechanism.
Contrary to expectation, instead of merely slowing decay, our experiments
provide strong evidence that this pressure reverses it, inducing a
statistically significant performance improvement in a Gemma 2B model on a
complex summarization task. We name this phenomenon the Anti-Ouroboros Effect.
We contrast this with a foundational experiment using a simple classifier,
where the theoretical degenerative loop was validated, highlighting the unique
dynamics of high-dimensional models. Our findings establish that systemic
resilience can be an emergent property of LLMs under simple selection pressure,
suggesting a powerful and scalable principle for developing safer and more
robust AI systems. Across five generations, a quality-filtered condition
improved by 6.6% in ROUGE-L F1 score, whereas an unfiltered control degraded by
3.5% and a random-filter control degraded by 4.2%

*Umberto Gonçalves de Sousa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LogGuardQ is a novel RL framework that integrates cognitive-inspired dual-memory system and adaptive exploration strategies, achieving superior anomaly detection performance (96.0% detection rate) compared to traditional DQN and PPO methods in cybersecurity applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL algorithms like DQN and PPO struggle with efficient exploration, stability, and adaptability in dynamic environments, particularly for anomaly detection tasks in cybersecurity.

Method: LogGuardQ integrates a dual-memory system inspired by human cognition and adaptive exploration strategies using temperature decay and curiosity mechanisms. Evaluated on 1,000,000 simulated access logs with 47.9% anomalies over 20,000 episodes.

Result: Achieves 96.0% detection rate (vs 93.0% for DQN, 47.1% for PPO), precision 0.4776, recall 0.9996, F1-score 0.6450. Mean reward 20.34 ± 44.63. Statistical tests confirm significant advantages (p < 0.0001 vs PPO).

Conclusion: LogGuardQ bridges cognitive science and RL, offering a scalable approach for adaptive learning in uncertain environments with applications in cybersecurity, intrusion detection, and decision-making under uncertainty.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has transformed sequential decision-making, but
traditional algorithms like Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) and Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) often struggle with efficient exploration, stability, and
adaptability in dynamic environments. This study presents LogGuardQ (Adaptive
Log Guard with Cognitive enhancement), a novel framework that integrates a
dual-memory system inspired by human cognition and adaptive exploration
strategies driven by temperature decay and curiosity. Evaluated on a dataset of
1,000,000 simulated access logs with 47.9% anomalies over 20,000 episodes,
LogGuardQ achieves a 96.0% detection rate (versus 93.0% for DQN and 47.1% for
PPO), with precision of 0.4776, recall of 0.9996, and an F1-score of 0.6450.
The mean reward is 20.34 \pm 44.63 across all episodes (versus 18.80 \pm 43.98
for DQN and -0.17 \pm 23.79 for PPO), with an average of 5.0 steps per episode
(constant across models). Graphical analyses, including learning curves
smoothed with a Savgol filter (window=501, polynomial=2), variance trends,
action distributions, and cumulative detections, demonstrate LogGuardQ's
superior stability and efficiency. Statistical tests (Mann-Whitney U) confirm
significant performance advantages (e.g., p = 0.0002 vs. DQN with negligible
effect size, p < 0.0001 vs. PPO with medium effect size, and p < 0.0001 for DQN
vs. PPO with small effect size). By bridging cognitive science and RL,
LogGuardQ offers a scalable approach to adaptive learning in uncertain
environments, with potential applications in cybersecurity, intrusion
detection, and decision-making under uncertainty.

### [284] [A Service-Oriented Adaptive Hierarchical Incentive Mechanism for Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10512)
*Jiaxing Cao,Yuzhou Gao,Jiwei Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes adaptive incentive mechanism for federated learning using Stackelberg game and multi-agent reinforcement learning to maximize utilities of task publisher, local model owners, and data workers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning often suffers from lack of training data, requiring recruitment of workers for data gathering. Existing approaches need better incentive mechanisms to maximize utilities for all participants.

Method: Establishes Stackelberg game between task publisher and local model owners, formulates LMO-worker interaction as multi-agent Markov decision process, uses deep reinforcement learning for optimal strategy, and designs ASOSA algorithm for strategy stabilization.

Result: Derived analytical Nash equilibrium solution for utility maximization, validated through extensive numerical experiments showing efficacy of the proposed method.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive incentive mechanism effectively addresses data scarcity in federated learning by optimizing utilities for all participants through game theory and reinforcement learning approaches.

Abstract: Recently, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a novel framework for
distributed model training. In FL, the task publisher (TP) releases tasks, and
local model owners (LMOs) use their local data to train models. Sometimes, FL
suffers from the lack of training data, and thus workers are recruited for
gathering data. To this end, this paper proposes an adaptive incentive
mechanism from a service-oriented perspective, with the objective of maximizing
the utilities of TP, LMOs and workers. Specifically, a Stackelberg game is
theoretically established between the LMOs and TP, positioning TP as the leader
and the LMOs as followers. An analytical Nash equilibrium solution is derived
to maximize their utilities. The interaction between LMOs and workers is
formulated by a multi-agent Markov decision process (MAMDP), with the optimal
strategy identified via deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Additionally, an
Adaptively Searching the Optimal Strategy Algorithm (ASOSA) is designed to
stabilize the strategies of each participant and solve the coupling problems.
Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to validate the efficacy of the
proposed method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoCE introduces a dual-stage routing mechanism for Mixture-of-Experts that first groups experts based on sequence-level features, then activates top-k experts within groups at token level, improving specialization and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of improving expert specialization in sparse Mixture-of-Experts architectures, particularly for instruction tuning scenarios with significant input heterogeneity.

Method: Dual-stage routing mechanism: 1) Expert group routing based on sequence-level features, 2) Activation of top-k experts within the selected group at token level.

Result: Consistent superiority over strong baselines across comprehensive benchmarks, with enhanced generalization capabilities and demonstrated robustness.

Conclusion: MoCE effectively partitions heterogeneous inputs based on knowledge requirements, encourages expert group specialization while maintaining token-level routing advantages.

Abstract: A sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a highly
scalable solution by conditionally activating sub-modules without a
proportional increase in computational costs. However, improving expert
specialization to enhance performance and generalization remains a challenge
for MoE, especially in instruction tuning scenarios characterized by
significant input heterogeneity. In this work, we propose the
Mixture-of-Clustered-Experts (MoCE) to address this limitation through a
dual-stage routing mechanism. The first stage in the mechanism performs expert
group routing based on sequence-level features, while the second stage
activates the top-$k$ experts within the group at the token level. This
approach enables the effective partitioning of heterogeneous inputs based on
their knowledge requirements, encouraging expert group specialization while
maintaining the advantages of token-level routing. We evaluate MoCE across a
comprehensive set of benchmarks, demonstrating its consistent superiority over
strong baselines and its enhanced generalization capabilities. Detailed
analysis further highlights the robustness and effectiveness of MoCE.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research lacks a unified framework to analyze continuous attractor properties across diverse dynamical systems, limiting cross-architectural generalizability in both biological and artificial neural systems.

Method: Establishes a novel framework from the perspective of differential manifolds to investigate continuous attractors, verifying compatibility with prior conclusions and analyzing links with eigenvalues of the local Jacobian matrix.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UAPO is a new offline preference optimization framework that addresses limitations of DPO methods by introducing an anchoring function to handle preference data uncertainties, enabling training with unpaired data and improving robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DPO-like methods rely on Bradley-Terry reward modeling which has critical assumptions like requiring pairwise training data, model distribution shifting, and human rationality assumptions. These limitations restrict data utilization and flexibility.

Method: Proposed Adaptive Preference Optimization with Utility Anchor (UAPO) framework that introduces an anchoring function to estimate uncertainties from preference data annotation. This allows training with unpaired data and enhances robustness.

Result: Experimental results show UAPO achieves competitive outcomes without strict dependency on data pairing, significantly improving data utilization efficiency.

Conclusion: UAPO paves the way for more flexible and effective preference optimization methods by addressing key limitations of existing approaches through its anchoring mechanism and support for unpaired data training.

Abstract: Offline preference optimization methods are efficient for large language
models (LLMs) alignment. Direct Preference optimization (DPO)-like learning,
one of the most popular approaches, stands out for its efficiency in reward
modeling. However, these methods typically follow the convention to use
Bradley-Terry (BT) reward modeling that faces several critical assumptions,
including the requirement for pairwise training data, model distribution
shifting, human rationality assumption, etc. To address these limitations, we
propose a general framework for offline preference optimization methods,
Adaptive Preference Optimization with Utility Anchor (UAPO), which introduces
an anchoring function to estimate the uncertainties brought from preference
data annotation. Our method enables training even in scenarios where the data
is unpaired, significantly enhancing data utilization efficiency. Moreover, the
anchor design makes UAPO more robust in the training process. Experimental
results demonstrate that UAPO achieves competitive outcomes without the strict
dependency on data pairing, paving the way for more flexible and effective
preference optimization methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the conflict between data-driven personalization in education and student data privacy challenges under modern data protection regulations.

Method: Proposed a privacy-preserving recommender system using Federated Learning (FL) with Deep Neural Network (DNN) on the ASSISTments educational dataset, comparing federated aggregation strategies including FedProx vs FedAvg.

Result: FedProx was significantly more stable and effective for handling heterogeneous student data. The optimized federated model achieved 76.28% F1-score (82.85% of centralized XGBoost performance).

Conclusion: Federated learning provides an effective solution to the personalization-privacy dilemma in educational platforms without centralizing sensitive student data.

Abstract: The increasing digitalization of education presents unprecedented
opportunities for data-driven personalization, yet it introduces significant
student data privacy challenges. Conventional recommender systems rely on
centralized data, a paradigm often incompatible with modern data protection
regulations. A novel privacy-preserving recommender system is proposed and
evaluated to address this critical issue using Federated Learning (FL). The
approach utilizes a Deep Neural Network (DNN) with rich, engineered features
from the large-scale ASSISTments educational dataset. A rigorous comparative
analysis of federated aggregation strategies was conducted, identifying FedProx
as a significantly more stable and effective method for handling heterogeneous
student data than the standard FedAvg baseline. The optimized federated model
achieves a high-performance F1-Score of 76.28\%, corresponding to 82.85\% of
the performance of a powerful, centralized XGBoost model. These findings
validate that a federated approach can provide highly effective content
recommendations without centralizing sensitive student data. Consequently, our
work presents a viable and robust solution to the personalization-privacy
dilemma in modern educational platforms.

TL;DR: FedProx outperforms other federated learning methods for mortality prediction on non-IID clinical data with class imbalance, achieving best F1-score of 0.8831.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning for in-hospital mortality prediction faces privacy constraints and statistical heterogeneity issues. Federated learning offers privacy preservation but needs evaluation under non-IID and imbalanced data conditions.

Method: Comparative benchmark of 5 FL strategies (FedAvg, FedProx, FedAdagrad, FedAdam, FedCluster) using MIMIC-IV dataset partitioned by clinical care unit to simulate non-IID environment. Applied SMOTE-Tomek for class imbalance, conducted 50 communication rounds.

Result: FedProx consistently outperformed other methods with highest F1-Score of 0.8831 and stable convergence. FedAvg was most computationally efficient but had substantially lower predictive performance.

Conclusion: Regularization-based FL algorithms like FedProx provide more robust and effective solutions for heterogeneous and imbalanced clinical prediction tasks compared to standard or server-side adaptive methods.

Abstract: Machine learning models hold significant potential for predicting in-hospital
mortality, yet data privacy constraints and the statistical heterogeneity of
real-world clinical data often hamper their development. Federated Learning
(FL) offers a privacy-preserving solution, but its performance under
non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) and imbalanced conditions
requires rigorous investigation. The study presents a comparative benchmark of
five federated learning strategies: FedAvg, FedProx, FedAdagrad, FedAdam, and
FedCluster for mortality prediction. Using the large-scale MIMIC-IV dataset, we
simulate a realistic non-IID environment by partitioning data by clinical care
unit. To address the inherent class imbalance of the task, the SMOTE-Tomek
technique is applied to each client's local training data. Our experiments,
conducted over 50 communication rounds, reveal that the regularization-based
strategy, FedProx, consistently outperformed other methods, achieving the
highest F1-Score of 0.8831 while maintaining stable convergence. While the
baseline FedAvg was the most computationally efficient, its predictive
performance was substantially lower. Our findings indicate that
regularization-based FL algorithms like FedProx offer a more robust and
effective solution for heterogeneous and imbalanced clinical prediction tasks
than standard or server-side adaptive aggregation methods. The work provides a
crucial empirical benchmark for selecting appropriate FL strategies for
real-world healthcare applications.

Motivation: To address catastrophic forgetting in AI systems while maintaining efficiency and minimal memory growth, enabling continuous learning without retraining.

Method: Four-phase pipeline using fractal quantization, probabilistic entanglement, and dynamic diffraction chipping to compress and integrate knowledge holographically.

Result: 0% forgetting (infinite improvement over baselines), 3x compression, 67% storage savings, 53% training time reduction, and projected $92.4M savings over 5 years.

Conclusion: HKM enables paradigm shift for LLMs with 'eternal' adaptation, potentially reducing fine-tuning costs by 60-80% and democratizing scalable AI.

Abstract: We introduce the Holographic Knowledge Manifold (HKM), a four-phase pipeline
that achieves zero catastrophic forgetting in AI knowledge representation while
maintaining minimal memory growth and high efficiency. Leveraging fractal
quantization, probabilistic entanglement, and dynamic diffraction chipping, HKM
compresses knowledge substrates by 3x with 67% storage savings, integrates
holographically at 100%, and supports over 1,020 updates with 1% growth per
increment. In experiments on combined WikiText and FB15k datasets (scaled to
2,997 nodes), we demonstrate industry-leading performance: 0% forgetting
(infinite improvement over GEM baselines), 3x compression, and 53% training
time reduction on consumer GPU hardware. Hypothetical cost analyses project
$92.4M savings over 5 years at petabyte scale, with 21.2% energy reduction and
33% lower carbon footprint. This work hypothesizes a paradigm shift for public
large language models (LLMs), enabling "eternal" adaptation without retraining.
Future extensions to multimodal fusion and quantum hardware could further
democratize scalable AI, potentially reducing fine-tuning costs by 60-80% for
models like Llama-3 or Grok-4. Code, datasets, and full results are publicly

*Chang Meng,Wayne Burleson,Giovanni De Micheli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes two lookup table methods (LUT-2D and LUT-1D) to compute more precise gradients for approximate multipliers in deep learning retraining, significantly improving accuracy recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches estimate gradients of approximate multipliers using accurate multiplier gradients, leading to suboptimal retraining results and accuracy recovery.

Method: Two methods: LUT-2D uses 2D lookup tables for fine-grained gradient estimation, while LUT-1D uses more efficient 1D lookup tables for comparable accuracy with shorter runtime.

Result: On CIFAR-10 with CNNs: LUT-2D improves accuracy by 3.83%, LUT-1D by 3.72% on average. On ImageNet with vision transformers: LUT-1D improves accuracy by 23.69% compared to state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: The proposed LUT-based gradient computation methods significantly outperform existing approaches for retraining deep learning models with approximate multipliers, providing both high accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Approximate multipliers (AppMults) are widely used in deep learning
accelerators to reduce their area, delay, and power consumption. However,
AppMults introduce arithmetic errors into deep learning models, necessitating a
retraining process to recover accuracy. A key step in retraining is computing
the gradient of the AppMult, i.e., the partial derivative of the approximate
product with respect to each input operand. Existing approaches typically
estimate this gradient using that of the accurate multiplier (AccMult), which
can lead to suboptimal retraining results. To address this, we propose two
methods to obtain more precise gradients of AppMults. The first, called LUT-2D,
characterizes the AppMult gradient with 2-dimensional lookup tables (LUTs),
providing fine-grained estimation and achieving the highest retraining
accuracy. The second, called LUT-1D, is a compact and more efficient variant
that stores gradient values in 1-dimensional LUTs, achieving comparable
retraining accuracy with shorter runtime. Experimental results show that on
CIFAR-10 with convolutional neural networks, our LUT-2D and LUT-1D methods
improve retraining accuracy by 3.83% and 3.72% on average, respectively. On
ImageNet with vision transformer models, our LUT-1D method improves retraining
accuracy by 23.69% on average, compared to a state-of-the-art retraining
framework.

TL;DR: Counterfactual Sample Identification reframes contextual bandit problems by learning to identify which action led to success through counterfactual comparison, outperforming direct reward models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct reward models in contextual bandits suffer from confounding issues where it's difficult to isolate the effect of actions from context, limiting their effectiveness in production systems.

Method: Learns to recognize which action led to a successful binary outcome by comparing it to a counterfactual action sampled from the logging policy under the same context, rather than directly predicting reward.

Result: The method consistently outperforms direct models in both synthetic experiments and real-world deployments.

Conclusion: Counterfactual Sample Identification provides a theoretically grounded approach that effectively addresses confounding issues in contextual bandit problems and delivers superior performance compared to traditional direct reward modeling.

Abstract: In production systems, contextual bandit approaches often rely on direct
reward models that take both action and context as input. However, these models
can suffer from confounding, making it difficult to isolate the effect of the
action from that of the context. We present \emph{Counterfactual Sample
Identification}, a new approach that re-frames the problem: rather than
predicting reward, it learns to recognize which action led to a successful
(binary) outcome by comparing it to a counterfactual action sampled from the
logging policy under the same context. The method is theoretically grounded and
consistently outperforms direct models in both synthetic experiments and
real-world deployments.

TL;DR: VGM² is a geometry-centric personalized federated learning framework that learns client-specific embeddings and exchanges only variational marker statistics to handle label skew and non-stationarity while maintaining privacy and communication efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized federated learning often fails under label skew and non-stationarity because a single global parameterization ignores client-specific geometry.

Method: Learns client-specific parametric UMAP embeddings, models latent pairwise distances with mixture relation markers for same/different class pairs, exchanges only variational uncertainty-aware marker statistics, maintains Dirichlet-Normal-Inverse-Gamma posteriors, and aggregates via conjugate moment matching.

Result: Achieves competitive or superior test F1 scores across eight vision datasets with non-IID label shards while communicating only small geometry summaries.

Conclusion: VGM² provides an effective geometry-centric approach for PFL that handles heterogeneity, maintains privacy through secure aggregation, and offers communication efficiency with strong performance on non-IID data.

Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) often fails under label skew and
non-stationarity because a single global parameterization ignores
client-specific geometry. We introduce VGM$^2$ (Variational Gaussian Mixture
Manifold), a geometry-centric PFL framework that (i) learns client-specific
parametric UMAP embeddings, (ii) models latent pairwise distances with mixture
relation markers for same and different class pairs, and (iii) exchanges only
variational, uncertainty-aware marker statistics. Each client maintains a
Dirichlet-Normal-Inverse-Gamma (Dir-NIG) posterior over marker weights, means,
and variances; the server aggregates via conjugate moment matching to form
global priors that guide subsequent rounds. We prove that this aggregation
minimizes the summed reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence from client posteriors
within the conjugate family, yielding stability under heterogeneity. We further
incorporate a calibration term for distance-to-similarity mapping and report
communication and compute budgets. Across eight vision datasets with non-IID
label shards, VGM$^2$ achieves competitive or superior test F1 scores compared
to strong baselines while communicating only small geometry summaries. Privacy
is strengthened through secure aggregation and optional differential privacy
noise, and we provide a membership-inference stress test. Code and
configurations will be released to ensure full reproducibility.

Abstract: Air traffic controllers (ATCOs) issue high-intensity voice commands in dense
airspace, where accurate workload modeling is critical for safety and
efficiency. This paper proposes a multimodal deep learning framework that
integrates structured data, trajectory sequences, and image features to
estimate two key parameters in the ATCO command lifecycle: the time offset
between a command and the resulting aircraft maneuver, and the command
duration. A high-quality dataset was constructed, with maneuver points detected
using sliding window and histogram-based methods. A CNN-Transformer ensemble
model was developed for accurate, generalizable, and interpretable predictions.
By linking trajectories to voice commands, this work offers the first model of

TL;DR: A two-module framework combining deep learning with explainable AI for autism spectrum disorder diagnosis, using transfer learning to overcome data scarcity and XAI techniques to interpret model decisions and identify critical brain regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autism spectrum disorder research faces data scarcity issues, and there's limited application of transfer learning paradigms in machine learning for ASD diagnosis despite its neurodevelopmental nature involving atypical brain maturation.

Method: Two-module framework: 1) Deep learning model fine-tuned through cross-domain transfer learning for ASD classification, 2) Three explainable AI techniques (saliency mapping, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping, and SHAP analysis) to interpret decisions and identify critical brain regions.

Result: Cross-domain transfer learning effectively addresses data scarcity in ASD research. The XAI techniques successfully reveal how the model makes diagnostic decisions and identify brain regions most associated with ASD, with findings showing strong alignment with established neurobiological evidence.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates clinical relevance by combining transfer learning to overcome data limitations and explainable AI to provide interpretable diagnostic decisions that align with known neurobiological evidence of ASD.

Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition
characterized by atypical brain maturation. However, the adaptation of transfer
learning paradigms in machine learning for ASD research remains notably
limited. In this study, we propose a computer-aided diagnostic framework with
two modules. This chapter presents a two-module framework combining deep
learning and explainable AI for ASD diagnosis. The first module leverages a
deep learning model fine-tuned through cross-domain transfer learning for ASD
classification. The second module focuses on interpreting the model decisions
and identifying critical brain regions. To achieve this, we employed three
explainable AI (XAI) techniques: saliency mapping, Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping, and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. This
framework demonstrates that cross-domain transfer learning can effectively
address data scarcity in ASD research. In addition, by applying three
established explainability techniques, the approach reveals how the model makes
diagnostic decisions and identifies brain regions most associated with ASD.
These findings were compared against established neurobiological evidence,
highlighting strong alignment and reinforcing the clinical relevance of the
proposed approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Novel neural network pruning method using graph-based AutoML framework with Graph Attention Network encoder and binary action space, outperforming traditional techniques on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional pruning methods rely on hand-crafted heuristics and local optimization, leading to suboptimal performance and inefficient strategies that lack global network understanding.

Method: Transforms pruning into graph representation capturing complete topological relationships, uses GAT encoder for embeddings, binary action space instead of pruning ratios, and CMDP framework with self-competition reward system under resource constraints.

Result: Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet show state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming traditional pruning techniques with task-specific strategies identifying functionally redundant connections.

Conclusion: The graph-based AutoML framework successfully addresses limitations of existing pruning methods by providing global network understanding and learning optimal pruning strategies directly from data, moving beyond predefined scoring functions and weight magnitude considerations.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to neural network pruning by integrating
a graph-based observation space into an AutoML framework to address the
limitations of existing methods. Traditional pruning approaches often depend on
hand-crafted heuristics and local optimization perspectives, which can lead to
suboptimal performance and inefficient pruning strategies. Our framework
transforms the pruning process by introducing a graph representation of the
target neural network that captures complete topological relationships between
layers and channels, replacing the limited layer-wise observation space with a
global view of network structure. The core innovations include a Graph
Attention Network (GAT) encoder that processes the network's graph
representation and generates a rich embedding. Additionally, for the action
space we transition from continuous pruning ratios to fine-grained binary
action spaces which enables the agent to learn optimal channel importance
criteria directly from data, moving away from predefined scoring functions.
These contributions are modelled within a Constrained Markov Decision Process
(CMDP) framework, allowing the agent to make informed pruning decisions while
adhering to resource constraints such as target compression rates. For this, we
design a self-competition reward system that encourages the agent to outperform
its previous best performance while satisfying the defined constraints. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. The experiments
show that our method consistently outperforms traditional pruning techniques,
showing state-of-the-art results while learning task-specific pruning
strategies that identify functionally redundant connections beyond simple
weight magnitude considerations.

*Aoi Otani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Latent Replay enables diffusion models to learn new visual concepts incrementally while preventing catastrophic forgetting and mode collapse, achieving 77.59% retention on earliest concepts with 14% improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address catastrophic forgetting and mode collapse in text-to-image diffusion models during continual learning, inspired by how human brain stores neural patterns rather than raw inputs.

Method: Apply Latent Replay approach that stores compact high-level feature representations from model's internal architecture instead of raw images, mimicking hippocampal memory processes. Random selection of latent examples outperforms similarity-based strategies.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing methods with 77.59% Image Alignment retention on earliest concept (14% higher than baselines) while maintaining output diversity. Successfully learned five sequential visual concepts without forgetting.

Conclusion: Latent Replay enables efficient continual learning for generative AI models, paving way for personalized text-to-image models that evolve with user needs without excessive computational costs.

Abstract: Continual learning -- the ability to acquire knowledge incrementally without
forgetting previous skills -- is fundamental to natural intelligence. While the
human brain excels at this, artificial neural networks struggle with
"catastrophic forgetting," where learning new tasks erases previously acquired
knowledge. This challenge is particularly severe for text-to-image diffusion
models, which generate images from textual prompts. Additionally, these models
face "mode collapse," where their outputs become increasingly repetitive over
time. To address these challenges, we apply Latent Replay, a
neuroscience-inspired approach, to diffusion models. Traditional replay methods
mitigate forgetting by storing and revisiting past examples, typically
requiring large collections of images. Latent Replay instead retains only
compact, high-level feature representations extracted from the model's internal
architecture. This mirrors the hippocampal process of storing neural activity
patterns rather than raw sensory inputs, reducing memory usage while preserving
critical information. Through experiments with five sequentially learned visual
concepts, we demonstrate that Latent Replay significantly outperforms existing
methods in maintaining model versatility. After learning all concepts, our
approach retained 77.59% Image Alignment (IA) on the earliest concept, 14%
higher than baseline methods, while maintaining diverse outputs. Surprisingly,
random selection of stored latent examples outperforms similarity-based
strategies. Our findings suggest that Latent Replay enables efficient continual
learning for generative AI models, paving the way for personalized
text-to-image models that evolve with user needs without excessive
computational costs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DASG-MoE: A hybrid MoE transformer with grouped attention and dynamic expert routing for efficient long-sequence modeling


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MoE models have limitations in computational efficiency and long-range dependency capture, particularly in dynamic expert resource allocation for long sequences

Method: Combines Grouped Multi-Head Attention (GMHA) for reduced complexity, Dual-Scale Shared Expert Structure (DSSE) for efficiency-accuracy balance, and hierarchical Adaptive Dynamic Routing (ADR) for expert selection

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art models on multiple long-sequence benchmark datasets

Conclusion: The proposed DASG-MoE model effectively enhances long-sequence modeling capabilities through integrated attention grouping, expert scaling, and dynamic routing mechanisms

Abstract: Transformer models based on the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture have
made significant progress in long-sequence modeling, but existing models still
have shortcomings in computational efficiency and the ability to capture
long-range dependencies, especially in terms of the dynamic adaptability of
expert resource allocation. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Adaptive Shared
Expert and Grouped Multi-Head Attention Hybrid Model (DASG-MoE) to enhance
long-sequence modeling capabilities by integrating three modules. First, we
employ the Grouped Multi-Head Attention (GMHA) mechanism to effectively reduce
the computational complexity of long sequences. By parallel processing through
sequence grouping, local sliding window attention, and feature aggregation, we
address long-range dependency issues and the model's lack of generalization for
local information. Second, we design a Dual-Scale Shared Expert Structure
(DSSE), where shallow experts use lightweight computations to quickly respond
to low-dimensional features, while deep experts process high-dimensional
complex semantics through pre-training transfer and post-training optimization,
achieving a dynamic balance between efficiency and accuracy. Third, we propose
a hierarchical Adaptive Dynamic Routing (ADR) mechanism that dynamically
selects expert levels based on feature complexity and task requirements, and
optimizes resource allocation through a local expert activation strategy.
Experiments on multiple long-sequence benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
DASG-MoE model outperforms state-of-the-art models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRL-based portfolio optimization method that combines exploitation of existing assets with exploration of new investment opportunities using two agents for dynamic market adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most DRL portfolio methods only allocate within pre-defined investment universes and miss exploring new opportunities, limiting performance potential.

Method: Uses two DRL agents - one for asset allocation within existing universe, another for exploring new opportunities in extended universe, dynamically balancing exploitation and exploration.

Result: Superior performance demonstrated against state-of-the-art portfolio strategies and baseline methods on two real-world market datasets.

Conclusion: The integrated approach of exploitation and exploration in portfolio optimization enhances performance and adapts better to evolving markets.

Abstract: Portfolio optimization is essential for balancing risk and return in
financial decision-making. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has stood out as a
cutting-edge tool for portfolio optimization that learns dynamic asset
allocation using trial-and-error interactions. However, most DRL-based methods
are restricted to allocating assets within a pre-defined investment universe
and overlook exploring new opportunities. This study introduces an investment
landscape that integrates exploiting existing assets with exploring new
investment opportunities in an extended universe. The proposed approach
leverages two DRL agents and dynamically balances these objectives to adapt to
evolving markets while enhancing portfolio performance. One agent allocates
assets within the existing universe, while another assists in exploring new
opportunities in the extended universe. The effciency of the proposed
methodology is determined using two real-world market data sets. The
experiments demonstrate the superiority of the suggested approach against the
state-of-the-art portfolio strategies and baseline methods.

*Anand Gopalakrishnan,Robert Csordás,Jürgen Schmidhuber,Michael C. Mozer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PoPE (Polar Coordinate Position Embeddings) improves upon RoPE by disentangling content and position information, leading to better performance on diagnostic tasks, autoregressive modeling across domains, and superior zero-shot length extrapolation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RoPE rotary position embedding entangles content (what) and position (where) information, which can impair performance when decisions require independent matches on these two factors.

Method: Proposed PoPE (Polar Coordinate Position Embeddings) that eliminates the what-where confound by separating content and position information in the attention mechanism.

Result: PoPE outperforms RoPE on diagnostic tasks requiring indexing by position or content alone. It shows better evaluation loss (perplexity) and downstream task performance in music, genomic, and natural language domains across model scales (124M to 774M parameters). PoPE demonstrates strong zero-shot length extrapolation capabilities.

Conclusion: PoPE successfully disentangles content and position information, providing superior performance and robust length extrapolation compared to RoPE without requiring fine-tuning or position-interpolation methods.

Abstract: The attention mechanism in a Transformer architecture matches key to query
based on both content -- the what -- and position in a sequence -- the where.
We present an analysis indicating that what and where are entangled in the
popular RoPE rotary position embedding. This entanglement can impair
performance particularly when decisions require independent matches on these
two factors. We propose an improvement to RoPE, which we call Polar Coordinate
Position Embeddings or PoPE, that eliminates the what-where confound. PoPE is
far superior on a diagnostic task requiring indexing solely by position or by
content. On autoregressive sequence modeling in music, genomic, and natural
language domains, Transformers using PoPE as the positional encoding scheme
outperform baselines using RoPE with respect to evaluation loss (perplexity)
and downstream task performance. On language modeling, these gains persist
across model scale, from 124M to 774M parameters. Crucially, PoPE shows strong
zero-shot length extrapolation capabilities, whereas RoPE's performance
degrades significantly on longer sequences at test time without fine tuning or
the use of position-interpolation methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SG-LoRA is a zero-shot framework that generates personalized LoRA parameters for edge users using semantic task descriptions, eliminating the need for retraining or accessing user data while maintaining privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge users have task-specific preferences that are difficult to handle with unified models, and retraining for each user is impractical due to cost and privacy concerns with raw data utilization.

Method: Uses task descriptions as semantic bridges to measure proximity to known expert tasks in embedding space, then models target task's LoRA parameter distribution to generate parameters for novel tasks without additional training.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple challenging tasks confirm superior performance and remarkable adaptability in zero-shot open-world settings.

Conclusion: SG-LoRA enables real-time construction of personalized LoRA models while providing privacy-preserving solutions for personalized model adaptation in novel zero-shot scenarios.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has demonstrated strong generalization
capabilities across a variety of tasks for efficiently fine-tuning AI models,
especially on resource-constrained edges. However, in real-world applications,
edge users often exhibit task-specific preferences that are difficult to handle
with a unified model trained under a closed-world assumption, and the challenge
may further increase when there are significant domain shifts between training
and deployment. Meanwhile, retraining/fine-tuning models for each user is also
impractical due to its cost-intensive nature and privacy concerns over raw data
utilization from edges. To address these challenges, we propose Semantic-guided
LoRA Parameter Generation (SG-LoRA), the first of its kind framework to
efficiently produce user-specific LoRA parameters without any additional
training on user tasks or access to user-specific data. Concretely, SG-LoRA
uses task descriptions as the semantic bridge, measuring their proximity to a
set of known expert tasks in a shared embedding space. Based on this semantic
guidance, it models the target task's LoRA parameter distribution to generate
high-performing parameters for novel tasks. SG-LoRA enables the real-time
construction of LoRA models aligned with individual intents by distilling
knowledge from prominent LoRA experts and, meanwhile, offering a
privacy-preserving solution for personalized model adaptation in a novel
zero-shot open-world setting proposed in this work. Extensive experiments on
multiple challenging tasks confirm the superior performance and remarkable
adaptability of SG-LoRA. Code is available at

TL;DR: Geometric extension of RBMs using group-valued weights and contextuality index based on holonomies to model complex relational structures and quantify global inconsistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize restricted Boltzmann machines by allowing weights to take values in abstract groups, enabling modeling of complex relational structures like projective transformations, spinor dynamics, and functional symmetries for applications in vision, language, and quantum learning.

Method: Introduce group-valued weights in RBMs and develop a contextuality index based on group-valued holonomies computed along cycles in the RBM graph, linking with sheaf-theoretic contextuality, gauge theory, and noncommutative geometry.

Result: The framework provides a geometric generalization of RBMs that can quantify global inconsistency or "curvature" induced by local weights, with applications demonstrated through numerical and diagrammatic examples in finite and infinite dimensions.

Conclusion: This geometric framework opens new directions in AI, including curvature-aware learning architectures and topological regularization for uncertain or adversarial environments, bridging machine learning with geometric and topological concepts.

Abstract: We propose a geometric extension of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) by
allowing weights to take values in abstract groups such as \(
\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{R}) \), \( \mathrm{SU}(2) \), or even
infinite-dimensional operator groups. This generalization enables the modeling
of complex relational structures, including projective transformations, spinor
dynamics, and functional symmetries, with direct applications to vision,
language, and quantum learning.
  A central contribution of this work is the introduction of a
\emph{contextuality index} based on group-valued holonomies computed along
cycles in the RBM graph. This index quantifies the global inconsistency or
"curvature" induced by local weights, generalizing classical notions of
coherence, consistency, and geometric flatness. We establish links with
sheaf-theoretic contextuality, gauge theory, and noncommutative geometry, and
provide numerical and diagrammatic examples in both finite and infinite
dimensions.
  This framework opens novel directions in AI, from curvature-aware learning
architectures to topological regularization in uncertain or adversarial
environments.

### [304] [On Using Large-Batches in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10537)
*Sahil Tyagi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a federated learning approach that combines the benefits of large-batch parallel scaling with small-batch generalization performance to address efficiency and generalization trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning faces challenges with efficiency vs. generalization - large batches enable parallel scaling but suffer from poor test performance, while small batches have good generalization but higher communication costs.

Method: Develops a technique that exploits trade-offs between small and large-batch training, aiming to achieve both parallel scaling benefits and good generalization properties.

Result: Achieves 32.33% higher test accuracy in ResNet50 and 3.74% higher in VGG11 models compared to small-batch training for the same number of iterations.

Conclusion: The proposed large-batch training technique successfully addresses generalization degradation issues while maintaining the parallel scaling advantages of large-batch federated learning.

Abstract: Efficient Federated learning (FL) is crucial for training deep networks over
devices with limited compute resources and bounded networks. With the advent of
big data, devices either generate or collect multimodal data to train either
generic or local-context aware networks, particularly when data privacy and
locality is vital. FL algorithms generally trade-off between parallel and
statistical performance, improving model quality at the cost of higher
communication frequency, or vice versa. Under frequent synchronization
settings, FL over a large cluster of devices may perform more work per-training
iteration by processing a larger global batch-size, thus attaining considerable
training speedup. However, this may result in poor test performance (i.e., low
test loss or accuracy) due to generalization degradation issues associated with
large-batch training. To address these challenges with large-batches, this work
proposes our vision of exploiting the trade-offs between small and large-batch
training, and explore new directions to enjoy both the parallel scaling of
large-batches and good generalizability of small-batch training. For the same
number of iterations, we observe that our proposed large-batch training
technique attains about 32.33% and 3.74% higher test accuracy than small-batch
training in ResNet50 and VGG11 models respectively.

TL;DR: DualAlign framework enhances synthetic clinical data generation through statistical and semantic alignment, improving both realism and clinical relevance for AI healthcare applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in generating synthetic clinical data that is both realistic and clinically meaningful, overcoming privacy constraints, limited rare-condition data, and biases in real EHRs.

Method: Dual alignment approach: (1) statistical alignment conditions generation on patient demographics and risk factors; (2) semantic alignment incorporates real-world symptom trajectories to guide content generation. Uses Alzheimer's disease as case study.

Result: Produces context-grounded symptom-level sentences reflecting real clinical documentation. Fine-tuning LLaMA 3.1-8B with DualAlign-generated and human-annotated data yields substantial performance gains over models trained on gold data alone or unguided synthetic baselines.

Conclusion: DualAlign offers a practical approach for generating clinically grounded, privacy-preserving synthetic data to support low-resource clinical text analysis, though it doesn't fully capture longitudinal complexity.

Abstract: Synthetic clinical data are increasingly important for advancing AI in
healthcare, given strict privacy constraints on real-world EHRs, limited
availability of annotated rare-condition data, and systemic biases in
observational datasets. While large language models (LLMs) can generate fluent
clinical text, producing synthetic data that is both realistic and clinically
meaningful remains challenging. We introduce DualAlign, a framework that
enhances statistical fidelity and clinical plausibility through dual alignment:
(1) statistical alignment, which conditions generation on patient demographics
and risk factors; and (2) semantic alignment, which incorporates real-world
symptom trajectories to guide content generation. Using Alzheimer's disease
(AD) as a case study, DualAlign produces context-grounded symptom-level
sentences that better reflect real-world clinical documentation. Fine-tuning an
LLaMA 3.1-8B model with a combination of DualAlign-generated and
human-annotated data yields substantial performance gains over models trained
on gold data alone or unguided synthetic baselines. While DualAlign does not
fully capture longitudinal complexity, it offers a practical approach for
generating clinically grounded, privacy-preserving synthetic data to support
low-resource clinical text analysis.

Conclusion: GTS Forecaster combines cutting-edge deep learning models with an accessible interface to facilitate the application of deep learning in geodetic forecasting tasks for enhanced early warning systems and hazard mitigation.

Abstract: Geodetic time series -- such as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)
positions, satellite altimetry-derived sea surface height (SSH), and tide gauge
(TG) records -- is essential for monitoring surface deformation and sea level
change. Accurate forecasts of these variables can enhance early warning systems
and support hazard mitigation for earthquakes, landslides, coastal storm surge,

nature of such variables presents significant challenges for classic models,
which often fail to capture long-term dependencies and complex spatiotemporal
dynamics. We introduce GTS Forecaster, an open-source Python package for
geodetic time series forecasting. It integrates advanced deep learning models

*Georgiy A. Bondar,Abhishek Halder*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to find the optimal Multimarginal Schrödinger Bridge (MSB) over all possible graph structures by solving a minimum spanning tree problem on measure-valued vertices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The MSB formulation requires specifying a correlation structure as an undirected graph a priori. The authors aim to find the optimal coupling across all possible graph structures rather than being limited to a pre-specified one.

Method: The optimal MSB is computed in two steps: 1) construct a complete graph with edge weights equal to the sum of optimal bimarginal SB values and endpoint entropies, 2) solve a standard minimum spanning tree problem on this weighted graph.

Result: The authors demonstrate that computing the optimal MSB reduces to solving a minimum spanning tree problem, providing an efficient solution approach.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully finds the optimal MSB coupling over all possible graph structures by leveraging minimum spanning tree algorithms, with numerical experiments validating the approach.

Abstract: The Multimarginal Schr\"odinger Bridge (MSB) finds the optimal coupling among
a collection of random vectors with known statistics and a known correlation
structure. In the MSB formulation, this correlation structure is specified
\emph{a priori} as an undirected connected graph with measure-valued vertices.
In this work, we formulate and solve the problem of finding the optimal MSB in
the sense we seek the optimal coupling over all possible graph structures. We
find that computing the optimal MSB amounts to solving the minimum spanning
tree problem over measure-valued vertices. We show that the resulting problem
can be solved in two steps. The first step constructs a complete graph with
edge weight equal to a sum of the optimal value of the corresponding bimarginal
SB and the entropies of the endpoints. The second step solves a standard
minimum spanning tree problem over that complete weighted graph. Numerical
experiments illustrate the proposed solution.

*Federico J. Gonzalez,Luis P. Lara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified framework combining differential equation structure with neural networks for nonlinear system identification, using characteristic curves modeled by NNs to balance interpretability and flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between interpretability and flexibility in nonlinear system identification by incorporating physical constraints while maintaining neural network flexibility.

Method: Propose three identification strategies: SINDy-CC (sparse regression with equation constraints), Poly-CC (high-degree polynomials), and NN-CC (neural networks without basis function assumptions) - all using characteristic curves modeled by dedicated NNs.

Result: All three approaches work well for systems with simple polynomial nonlinearities (e.g., van der Pol oscillator), but NN-CC shows superior performance for complex nonlinearities and discontinuities (e.g., stick-slip systems).

Conclusion: The CC-based framework, particularly NN-CC, successfully captures complex nonlinearities while maintaining interpretability through explicit characteristic curve representation, providing a powerful tool for challenging nonlinear system identification.

Abstract: Nonlinear system identification often involves a fundamental trade-off
between interpretability and flexibility, often requiring the incorporation of
physical constraints. We propose a unified data-driven framework that combines
the mathematical structure of the governing differential equations with the
flexibility of neural networks (NNs). At the core of our approach is the
concept of characteristic curves (CCs), which represent individual nonlinear
functions (e.g., friction and restoring components) of the system. Each CC is
modeled by a dedicated NN, enabling a modular and interpretable representation
of the system equation. To demonstrate the versatility of the CC-based
formalism, we introduce three identification strategies: (1) SINDy-CC, which
extends the sparse regression approach of SINDy by incorporating the
mathematical structure of the governing equations as constraints; (2) Poly-CC,
which represents each CC using high-degree polynomials; and (3) NN-CC, which
uses NNs without requiring prior assumptions about basis functions. Our results
show that all three approaches are well-suited for systems with simple
polynomial nonlinearities, such as the van der Pol oscillator. In contrast,
NN-CC demonstrates superior performance in modeling systems with complex
nonlinearities and discontinuities, such as those observed in stick-slip
systems. The key contribution of this work is to demonstrate that the CC-based
framework, particularly the NN-CC approach, can capture complex nonlinearities
while maintaining interpretability through the explicit representation of the
CCs. This balance makes it well-suited for modeling systems with
discontinuities and complex nonlinearities that are challenging to assess using
traditional polynomial or sparse regression methods, providing a powerful tool
for nonlinear system identification.

Conclusion: Federated learning enables effective collaborative training for facial dysmorphology analysis while preserving patient privacy and data confidentiality.

Abstract: Machine learning has shown promise in facial dysmorphology, where
characteristic facial features provide diagnostic clues for rare genetic
disorders. GestaltMatcher, a leading framework in this field, has demonstrated
clinical utility across multiple studies, but its reliance on centralized
datasets limits further development, as patient data are siloed across
institutions and subject to strict privacy regulations. We introduce a
federated GestaltMatcher service based on a cross-silo horizontal federated
learning framework, which allows hospitals to collaboratively train a global
ensemble feature extractor without sharing patient images. Patient data are
mapped into a shared latent space, and a privacy-preserving kernel matrix
computation framework enables syndrome inference and discovery while
safeguarding confidentiality. New participants can directly benefit from and
contribute to the system by adopting the global feature extractor and kernel
configuration from previous training rounds. Experiments show that the
federated service retains over 90% of centralized performance and remains
robust to both varying silo numbers and heterogeneous data distributions.

*Nikita Rajaneesh,Thomas Zollo,Richard Zemel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Test-Time Warmup method improves MLLM performance by adapting models per test instance using weakly supervised auxiliary tasks, achieving significant gains on complex reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs underperform on complex reasoning tasks despite massive pretraining, due to limited multimodal training data (thousands to millions vs billions of text-only samples).

Method: Proposes Test-Time Warmup that adapts MLLMs per test instance using data from weakly supervised auxiliary tasks instead of extensive labeled datasets.

Result: Achieves relative performance improvements: 4.03% on MMMU, 5.28% on VQA-Rad, and 1.63% on GQA using Llama-Vision-Instruct model.

Conclusion: Warming up MLLMs before inference enhances robustness across diverse reasoning tasks, demonstrating effective adaptation without extensive fine-tuning.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold great promise for advanced
reasoning at the intersection of text and images, yet they have not fully
realized this potential. MLLMs typically integrate an LLM, a vision encoder,
and a connector that maps the vision encoder's embeddings into the LLM's text
embedding space. Although each component is pretrained on massive datasets with
billions of samples, the entire multimodal model is typically trained on only
thousands (or a few million) samples, which can result in weak performance on
complex reasoning tasks. To address these shortcomings, instead of relying on
extensive labeled datasets for fine-tuning, we propose a Test-Time Warmup
method that adapts the MLLM per test instance by leveraging data from weakly
supervised auxiliary tasks. With our approach, we observe a relative
performance improvement of 4.03% on MMMU, 5.28% on VQA-Rad, and 1.63% on GQA on
the Llama-Vision-Instruct model. Our method demonstrates that 'warming up'
before inference can enhance MLLMs' robustness across diverse reasoning tasks.

*Chirayu Nimonkar,Shlok Shah,Catherine Ji,Benjamin Eysenbach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Self-supervised goal-reaching enables multi-agent cooperation without complex reward engineering, using single goal states instead of scalar rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing reward functions for coordination and long-horizon reasoning in multi-agent systems is challenging. The paper aims to enable cooperation through self-supervised goal-reaching rather than traditional reward maximization.

Method: Agents maximize the likelihood of visiting specified goal states rather than scalar rewards. Uses self-supervised goal-reaching techniques to learn from sparse feedback signals with single goal state specifications.

Result: Outperforms alternative approaches with same sparse reward signal on MARL benchmarks. Enables emergent cooperation and exploration where other methods fail to achieve any successful trials.

Conclusion: Self-supervised multi-agent goal-reaching provides an effective alternative to complex reward engineering, enabling cooperation and exploration through goal state specification rather than reward functions.

Abstract: For groups of autonomous agents to achieve a particular goal, they must
engage in coordination and long-horizon reasoning. However, designing reward
functions to elicit such behavior is challenging. In this paper, we study how
self-supervised goal-reaching techniques can be leveraged to enable agents to
cooperate. The key idea is that, rather than have agents maximize some scalar
reward, agents aim to maximize the likelihood of visiting a certain goal. This
problem setting enables human users to specify tasks via a single goal state
rather than implementing a complex reward function. While the feedback signal
is quite sparse, we will demonstrate that self-supervised goal-reaching
techniques enable agents to learn from such feedback. On MARL benchmarks, our
proposed method outperforms alternative approaches that have access to the same
sparse reward signal as our method. While our method has no explicit mechanism
for exploration, we observe that self-supervised multi-agent goal-reaching
leads to emergent cooperation and exploration in settings where alternative
approaches never witness a single successful trial.

*Bo Lei,Victor M. Castillo,Yeping Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: M4GN is a hierarchical graph neural network that uses a three-tier segment-centric approach to improve PDE simulation accuracy and efficiency on large meshes


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mesh-based GNNs suffer from high computational cost and over-smoothing on large meshes with long-range interactions, while hierarchical approaches struggle with building appropriate coarse graphs and maintaining fine-scale accuracy

Method: Three-tier hierarchical network with hybrid segmentation strategy (graph partitioner + superpixel refinement), permutation-invariant aggregator, micro-level GNN for local dynamics, and macro-level transformer for cross-segment reasoning

Result: Improves prediction accuracy by up to 56% while achieving up to 22% faster inference than state-of-the-art baselines on multiple benchmark datasets

Conclusion: M4GN successfully addresses key challenges in hierarchical GNNs for PDE simulations by providing a principled balance between accuracy and efficiency through its segment-centric approach

Abstract: Mesh-based graph neural networks (GNNs) have become effective surrogates for
PDE simulations, yet their deep message passing incurs high cost and
over-smoothing on large, long-range meshes; hierarchical GNNs shorten
propagation paths but still face two key obstacles: (i) building coarse graphs
that respect mesh topology, geometry, and physical discontinuities, and (ii)
maintaining fine-scale accuracy without sacrificing the speed gained from
coarsening. We tackle these challenges with M4GN, a three-tier, segment-centric
hierarchical network. M4GN begins with a hybrid segmentation strategy that
pairs a fast graph partitioner with a superpixel-style refinement guided by
modal-decomposition features, producing contiguous segments of dynamically
consistent nodes. These segments are encoded by a permutation-invariant
aggregator, avoiding the order sensitivity and quadratic cost of aggregation
approaches used in prior works. The resulting information bridges a micro-level
GNN, which captures local dynamics, and a macro-level transformer that reasons
efficiently across segments, achieving a principled balance between accuracy
and efficiency. Evaluated on multiple representative benchmark datasets, M4GN
improves prediction accuracy by up to 56% while achieving up to 22% faster
inference than state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: A model-agnostic conformal prediction approach for single-positive multi-label learning that produces calibrated set-valued outputs without requiring label distribution assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting full multi-label annotations is costly and labor-intensive, while many datasets only provide single positive labels per instance despite having multiple relevant labels, creating an extreme partial supervision challenge.

Method: Uses conformal prediction to produce calibrated set-valued outputs, bridging the gap between single-label training and multi-label evaluation without relying on label distribution assumptions.

Result: Evaluated on 12 benchmark datasets, showing consistent improvements over existing baselines and demonstrating practical applicability.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses the single-positive multi-label learning problem by providing reliable multi-label predictions through conformal prediction techniques, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Multi-label learning often requires identifying all relevant labels for
training instances, but collecting full label annotations is costly and
labor-intensive. In many datasets, only a single positive label is annotated
per training instance, despite the presence of multiple relevant labels. This
setting, known as single-positive multi-label learning (SPMLL), presents a
significant challenge due to its extreme form of partial supervision. We
propose a model-agnostic approach to SPMLL that draws on conformal prediction
to produce calibrated set-valued outputs, enabling reliable multi-label
predictions at test time. Our method bridges the supervision gap between
single-label training and multi-label evaluation without relying on label
distribution assumptions. We evaluate our approach on 12 benchmark datasets,
demonstrating consistent improvements over existing baselines and practical
applicability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bid shading strategy for first-price auctions formulated as measure-valued convex optimization with Wasserstein-proximal updates and context-dependent energy functionals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an effective bid shading strategy for first-price auctions that optimizes bid parameters distribution to maximize expected surplus by considering win probability and value gap.

Method: Proposes convex optimization over joint distribution of shading parameters with regularized Wasserstein-proximal updates after each auction, using context-dependent energy functionals based on publisher/user attributes.

Result: The measure-valued convex optimization problem admits a closed-form solution, and the algorithm encourages bid distribution to focus on values with higher expected surplus.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a theoretically sound and computationally efficient approach to bid shading in first-price auctions through measure-valued optimization and adaptive parameter updates.

Abstract: This work proposes a bid shading strategy for first-price auctions as a
measure-valued optimization problem. We consider a standard parametric form for
bid shading and formulate the problem as convex optimization over the joint
distribution of shading parameters. After each auction, the shading parameter
distribution is adapted via a regularized Wasserstein-proximal update with a
data-driven energy functional. This energy functional is conditional on the
context, i.e., on publisher/user attributes such as domain, ad slot type,
device, or location. The proposed algorithm encourages the bid distribution to
place more weight on values with higher expected surplus, i.e., where the win
probability and the value gap are both large. We show that the resulting
measure-valued convex optimization problem admits a closed form solution. A
numerical example illustrates the proposed method.

Result: Verifies models as large as Llama-3.1-405B within minutes on commodity hardware and exposed five unknown bugs in Amazon production machine learning frameworks.

Conclusion: Scalify provides an efficient, scalable solution for detecting silent errors in large ML models, offering actionable debugging guidance and demonstrating practical effectiveness on massive production-scale models.

Abstract: Modern machine learning frameworks support very large models by incorporating
parallelism and optimization techniques. Yet, these very techniques add new
layers of complexity, introducing silent errors that severely degrade model
performance. Existing solutions are either ad hoc or too costly for production.
  We present Scalify, a lightweight framework that exposes silent errors by
verifying semantic equivalence of computational graphs using equality
saturation and Datalog-style reasoning. To scale, Scalify partitions graphs
with parallel rewriting and layer memoization, reuses rewrite templates, and
augments equality saturation with relational reasoning and symbolic bijection
inference. It further localizes discrepancies to precise code sites, turning
verification results into actionable debugging guidance. Scalify verifies

TL;DR: A Bayesian framework for sequential fine-tuning of transformers that uses moment propagation, Kalman Bayesian Neural Networks, and Taylor approximations to handle distribution shifts and limited data while quantifying uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in sequential learning where new data arrives with shifting distributions, requiring stabilization with small data amounts, balancing new information with prior knowledge, and operating in latency-critical environments with uncertainty quantification.

Method: Frames sequential fine-tuning as posterior inference using Bayesian framework. Integrates closed-form moment propagation of random variables, Kalman Bayesian Neural Networks, and Taylor approximations of softmax function moments. Uses pre-trained models as priors and adaptively balances them against new information based on quantified uncertainty.

Result: Achieves robust and data-efficient sequential learning. Demonstrated effectiveness through numerical simulations involving sequential adaptation of decision transformer to tasks with distribution shifts and limited memory resources.

Conclusion: The proposed Bayesian approach successfully addresses sequential fine-tuning challenges by providing uncertainty quantification and adaptive balancing of prior knowledge with new information, enabling stable learning with limited data in changing environments.

Abstract: Sequential fine-tuning of transformers is useful when new data arrive
sequentially, especially with shifting distributions. Unlike batch learning,
sequential learning demands that training be stabilized despite a small amount
of data by balancing new information and previously learned knowledge in the
pre-trained models. This challenge is further complicated when training is to
be completed in latency-critical environments and learning must additionally
quantify and be mediated by uncertainty. Motivated by these challenges, we
propose a novel method that frames sequential fine-tuning as a posterior
inference problem within a Bayesian framework. Our approach integrates
closed-form moment propagation of random variables, Kalman Bayesian Neural
Networks, and Taylor approximations of the moments of softmax functions. By
explicitly accounting for pre-trained models as priors and adaptively balancing
them against new information based on quantified uncertainty, our method
achieves robust and data-efficient sequential learning. The effectiveness of
our method is demonstrated through numerical simulations involving sequential
adaptation of a decision transformer to tasks characterized by distribution
shifts and limited memory resources.

TL;DR: CrunchLLM is a domain-adapted LLM framework that combines structured company data with unstructured text to predict startup success with over 80% accuracy, outperforming traditional methods and providing interpretable reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting startup success through acquisition or IPO is crucial but challenging due to heterogeneous data types. Traditional ML methods have moderate accuracy and LLMs struggle with domain-specific business data.

Method: CrunchLLM integrates structured company attributes with unstructured textual narratives using parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies and prompt optimization to specialize foundation models for entrepreneurship data.

Result: Achieves accuracy exceeding 80% on Crunchbase startup success prediction, significantly outperforming traditional classifiers and baseline LLMs while providing interpretable reasoning traces.

Conclusion: Domain-aware fine-tuning and structured-unstructured data fusion with LLMs can advance predictive modeling of entrepreneurial outcomes, providing a practical tool for venture capital and innovation policy decision making.

Abstract: Predicting the success of start-up companies, defined as achieving an exit
through acquisition or IPO, is a critical problem in entrepreneurship and
innovation research. Datasets such as Crunchbase provide both structured
information (e.g., funding rounds, industries, investor networks) and
unstructured text (e.g., company descriptions), but effectively leveraging this
heterogeneous data for prediction remains challenging. Traditional machine
learning approaches often rely only on structured features and achieve moderate
accuracy, while large language models (LLMs) offer rich reasoning abilities but
struggle to adapt directly to domain-specific business data. We present
\textbf{CrunchLLM}, a domain-adapted LLM framework for startup success
prediction. CrunchLLM integrates structured company attributes with
unstructured textual narratives and applies parameter-efficient fine-tuning
strategies alongside prompt optimization to specialize foundation models for
entrepreneurship data. Our approach achieves accuracy exceeding 80\% on
Crunchbase startup success prediction, significantly outperforming traditional
classifiers and baseline LLMs. Beyond predictive performance, CrunchLLM
provides interpretable reasoning traces that justify its predictions, enhancing
transparency and trustworthiness for financial and policy decision makers. This
work demonstrates how adapting LLMs with domain-aware fine-tuning and
structured--unstructured data fusion can advance predictive modeling of
entrepreneurial outcomes. CrunchLLM contributes a methodological framework and
a practical tool for data-driven decision making in venture capital and
innovation policy.

TL;DR: LLMs enable effective late fusion for multimodal activity classification from audio and motion data without task-specific training, achieving above-chance zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Integrating complementary sensor data streams (audio and motion) for activity recognition is challenging, especially when limited aligned training data exists for learning shared embedding spaces.

Method: Used large language models for late fusion of modality-specific models on curated Ego4D dataset subset for diverse activity recognition across contexts like household activities and sports.

Result: LLMs achieved 12-class zero- and one-shot classification F1-scores significantly above chance level with no task-specific training required.

Conclusion: LLM-based fusion enables multimodal temporal applications without additional memory/computation for application-specific models and works well with limited aligned training data.

Abstract: Sensor data streams provide valuable information around activities and
context for downstream applications, though integrating complementary
information can be challenging. We show that large language models (LLMs) can
be used for late fusion for activity classification from audio and motion time
series data. We curated a subset of data for diverse activity recognition
across contexts (e.g., household activities, sports) from the Ego4D dataset.
Evaluated LLMs achieved 12-class zero- and one-shot classification F1-scores
significantly above chance, with no task-specific training. Zero-shot
classification via LLM-based fusion from modality-specific models can enable
multimodal temporal applications where there is limited aligned training data
for learning a shared embedding space. Additionally, LLM-based fusion can
enable model deploying without requiring additional memory and computation for
targeted application-specific multimodal models.

*Weizhi Li,Gautam Dasarathy,Visar Berisha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an active learning framework for matched-pair experimental designs that sequentially enrolls patients in high treatment-effect regions to reduce experimental costs while ensuring complete coverage of effective treatment areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional matched-pair designs focus on overall small effect sizes, but there's a need to identify and target regions where treatments are most effective to improve intervention efficiency and reduce experimental costs.

Method: Frames target region identification as a classification problem and develops an active learning framework specifically tailored for matched-pair designs, allowing sequential and active enrollment of patients in high treatment-effect areas.

Result: The proposed design reduces experimental costs for detecting treatment efficacy while ensuring identified regions completely enclose all high-treatment-effect areas. Theoretical analysis and practical experiments demonstrate the framework's efficiency.

Conclusion: The active learning approach for matched-pair experimental designs provides an efficient method to identify high treatment-effect regions, offering both cost reduction and comprehensive coverage of effective treatment areas.

Abstract: Matched-pair experimental designs aim to detect treatment effects by pairing
participants and comparing within-pair outcome differences. In many situations,
the overall effect size is small across the entire population. Then, the focus
naturally shifts to identifying and targeting high treatment-effect regions
where the intervention is most effective. This paper proposes a matched-pair
experimental design that sequentially and actively enrolls patients in high
treatment-effect regions. Importantly, we frame the identification of the
target region as a classification problem and propose an active learning
framework tailored to matched-pair designs. The proposed design not only
reduces the experimental cost of detecting treatment efficacy, but also ensures
that the identified regions enclose the entire high-treatment-effect regions.
Our theoretical analysis of the framework's label complexity, along with
experiments in practical scenarios, demonstrates the efficiency and advantages
of the approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HalluField is a novel field-theoretic approach for detecting hallucinations in LLMs using thermodynamics-inspired energy and entropy analysis of token paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce inaccurate or unreliable content (hallucinations), which limits their deployment in high-stakes applications, creating a need for general-purpose hallucination detection methods.

Method: Models LLM responses as discrete likelihood token paths with associated energy and entropy. Analyzes how energy and entropy distributions vary across token paths under temperature and likelihood changes to quantify semantic stability and detect unstable behavior.

Result: HalluField achieves state-of-the-art hallucination detection performance across models and datasets, is computationally efficient, and operates directly on model output logits without requiring fine-tuning or auxiliary networks.

Conclusion: The thermodynamics-inspired field-theoretic approach provides a principled physical interpretation for hallucination detection and offers a practical, effective solution for identifying unreliable LLM outputs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive reasoning and
question-answering capabilities. However, they often produce inaccurate or
unreliable content known as hallucinations. This unreliability significantly
limits their deployment in high-stakes applications. Thus, there is a growing
need for a general-purpose method to detect hallucinations in LLMs. In this
work, we introduce HalluField, a novel field-theoretic approach for
hallucination detection based on a parametrized variational principle and
thermodynamics. Inspired by thermodynamics, HalluField models an LLM's response
to a given query and temperature setting as a collection of discrete likelihood
token paths, each associated with a corresponding energy and entropy. By
analyzing how energy and entropy distributions vary across token paths under
changes in temperature and likelihood, HalluField quantifies the semantic
stability of a response. Hallucinations are then detected by identifying
unstable or erratic behavior in this energy landscape. HalluField is
computationally efficient and highly practical: it operates directly on the
model's output logits without requiring fine-tuning or auxiliary neural
networks. Notably, the method is grounded in a principled physical
interpretation, drawing analogies to the first law of thermodynamics.
Remarkably, by modeling LLM behavior through this physical lens, HalluField
achieves state-of-the-art hallucination detection performance across models and
datasets.

TL;DR: Proposes Contextual Budget Bandit algorithm to address geographical disparities in volunteer-based food rescue platforms by allocating higher budgets to communities with lower match rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing algorithms for volunteer engagement in food rescue platforms exacerbate geographical disparities, leaving some communities systematically disadvantaged despite the goal of maximizing food rescue.

Method: Develops Contextual Budget Bandit that incorporates context-dependent budget allocation in restless multi-armed bandits. Creates two algorithms: an empirically fast heuristic and Mitosis algorithm that guarantees optimal budget allocation when volunteers are scarce.

Result: The algorithms outperform baselines on both synthetic and real-world food rescue datasets, demonstrating improved geographical fairness in food rescue operations.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses geographical disparities in food rescue platforms while maintaining volunteer engagement and maximizing food rescue efficiency.

Abstract: Volunteer-based food rescue platforms tackle food waste by matching surplus
food to communities in need. These platforms face the dual problem of
maintaining volunteer engagement and maximizing the food rescued. Existing
algorithms to improve volunteer engagement exacerbate geographical disparities,
leaving some communities systematically disadvantaged. We address this issue by
proposing Contextual Budget Bandit. Contextual Budget Bandit incorporates
context-dependent budget allocation in restless multi-armed bandits, a model of
decision-making which allows for stateful arms. By doing so, we can allocate
higher budgets to communities with lower match rates, thereby alleviating
geographical disparities. To tackle this problem, we develop an empirically
fast heuristic algorithm. Because the heuristic algorithm can achieve a poor
approximation when active volunteers are scarce, we design the Mitosis
algorithm, which is guaranteed to compute the optimal budget allocation.
Empirically, we demonstrate that our algorithms outperform baselines on both
synthetic and real-world food rescue datasets, and show how our algorithm
achieves geographical fairness in food rescue.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers are widely deployed but their robustness under fault conditions remains underexplored, particularly for hardware-induced faults in large language models.

Method: A modular Python-based framework that injects diverse fault types (weight corruption, activation injections, attention disruptions) into pretrained transformer models at multiple logical and structural points.

Result: The framework enables controlled fault injection experiments on classification and generation tasks, supporting reproducibility, metric logging, and visualization.

Conclusion: GoldenTransformer provides researchers and practitioners with a valuable tool for analyzing model robustness and guiding dependable system design in real-world LLM applications.

Abstract: Transformers have become the foundation for a wide range of

robustness of these models under fault conditions remains underexplored. We
present GoldenTransformer, a modular and extensible fault injection framework
designed to evaluate the resiliency of Large Language Models to induced
hardware faults. GoldenTransformer offers a unified Python-based platform for
injecting diverse classes of faults--such as weight corruption, activation
injections, and attention--level disruptions--into pretrained
transformer--based models. Inspired by the GoldenEye simulator for DNNs, our
framework focuses on the unique challenges of working with large transformer
architectures, including considerations such as structural complexity, latent
dependencies, and nonuniform layer definitions. GoldenTransformer is built atop
PyTorch and HuggingFace Transformers, and it supports experiment
reproducibility, metric logging, and visualization out of the box. We detail
the technical design and use of GoldenTransformer and demonstrate through
several example experiments on classification and generation tasks. By enabling
controlled injection of faults at multiple logical and structural points in a
transformer, GoldenTransformer offers researchers and practitioners a valuable
tool for model robustness analysis and for guiding dependable system design in
real-world LLM applications.

*Antonio Bărbălau,Cristian Daniel Păduraru,Teodor Poncu,Alexandru Tifrea,Elena Burceanu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) are valuable for interpretable representations, but current debiasing methods focus on decoder weights. This paper challenges that assumption and introduces an encoder-focused debiasing approach with three key contributions: unconventional feature selection, orthogonalization against encoder weights, and performance-preserving weight interpolation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SAE-based debiasing methods assume feature representations are in decoder weights, but this paper questions that fundamental assumption and seeks to develop a more effective encoder-focused approach for representation debiasing.

Method: Proposes Selection and Projection framework (S&P TopK) with three components: (i) unconventional SAE feature selection strategy, (ii) orthogonalizing input embeddings against encoder weights for debiasing, and (iii) encoder weight interpolation to preserve performance during debiasing.

Result: The S&P TopK framework outperforms conventional SAE usage by up to 3.2x in fairness metrics and advances state-of-the-art test-time VLM debiasing results by up to 1.8x while maintaining downstream performance.

Conclusion: Encoder-focused debiasing through the proposed S&P TopK framework provides superior fairness improvements compared to decoder-focused approaches, demonstrating the importance of reconsidering fundamental assumptions about where feature representations reside in SAEs.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have proven valuable due to their ability to
provide interpretable and steerable representations. Current debiasing methods
based on SAEs manipulate these sparse activations presuming that feature
representations are housed within decoder weights. We challenge this
fundamental assumption and introduce an encoder-focused alternative for
representation debiasing, contributing three key findings: (i) we highlight an
unconventional SAE feature selection strategy, (ii) we propose a novel SAE
debiasing methodology that orthogonalizes input embeddings against encoder
weights, and (iii) we establish a performance-preserving mechanism during
debiasing through encoder weight interpolation. Our Selection and Projection
framework, termed S\&P TopK, surpasses conventional SAE usage in fairness
metrics by a factor of up to 3.2 and advances state-of-the-art test-time VLM
debiasing results by a factor of up to 1.8 while maintaining downstream
performance.

TL;DR: FACTORS is a framework combining experimental design with Shapley decomposition to address performance and stability issues sensitive to training factor combinations, enabling reliable configuration selection under budget constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance and stability issues that are sensitive to combinations of training factors, particularly when dealing with budget constraints and the need for reliable configuration selection.

Method: Combines design of experiments with Shapley decomposition, estimates main effects and two-factor interactions, integrates them into risk-adjusted objective function, uses plug-in path based on conditional means and least-squares path for Shapley contributions, incorporates standardization, bias correction, and uncertainty quantification.

Result: Improves rank preservation and optimal configuration identification, reduces decision-making risks, delivers interpretable justification alongside stable performance gains even under budget constraints across diverse datasets and design conditions.

Conclusion: FACTORS provides a comprehensive framework for reliable configuration selection under budget constraints, offering both theoretical guarantees and practical interpretability through effective combination of experimental design and Shapley decomposition methods.

Abstract: We propose FACTORS, a framework that combines design of experiments with
Shapley decomposition to address performance and stability issues that are
sensitive to combinations of training factors. Our approach consistently
estimates main effects and two-factor interactions, then integrates them into a
risk-adjusted objective function that jointly accounts for uncertainty and
cost, enabling reliable selection of configurations under a fixed budget.
Effect estimation is implemented through two complementary paths: a plug-in
path based on conditional means, and a least-squares path that reconstructs
Shapley contributions from samples. These paths are designed to work
complementarily even when design density and bias levels differ. By
incorporating standardization of estimates, bias correction, and uncertainty
quantification, our procedure ensures comparability across heterogeneous factor
spaces and designs, while a lightweight search routine yields configurations
within practical time even for large factor spaces. On the theoretical side, we
provide error decompositions, sample complexity analysis, and upper bounds on
optimality gaps. On the interpretive side, we summarize main effects and
interactions in map form, highlighting adjustment priorities and safe

*Mayssa Soussia,Yijun Lin,Mohamed Ali Mahjoub,Islem Rekik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CogGNN is the first cognified generative model that integrates cognitive capabilities into GNNs to generate brain networks preserving cognitive features like visual memory, outperforming existing methods in creating cognitively meaningful connectional brain templates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative methods for brain networks focus only on structural properties while neglecting cognitive traits, which are crucial for understanding brain functions like pattern recognition and memory recall.

Method: CogGNN integrates visual input and cognitive capabilities into GNNs using a visual-memory-based loss function and co-optimization strategy to generate connectional brain templates that preserve both structural and cognitive properties.

Result: Extensive experiments show CogGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating well-centered, discriminative, and cognitively enhanced brain network templates.

Conclusion: CogGNN establishes a strong foundation for cognitively grounded brain network modeling by successfully integrating cognitive features into generative models, addressing a significant gap in current neuroimaging research.

Abstract: Generative learning has advanced network neuroscience, enabling tasks like
graph super-resolution, temporal graph prediction, and multimodal brain graph
fusion. However, current methods, mainly based on graph neural networks (GNNs),
focus solely on structural and topological properties, neglecting cognitive
traits. To address this, we introduce the first cognified generative model,
CogGNN, which endows GNNs with cognitive capabilities (e.g., visual memory) to
generate brain networks that preserve cognitive features. While broadly
applicable, we present CogGNN, a specific variant designed to integrate visual
input, a key factor in brain functions like pattern recognition and memory
recall. As a proof of concept, we use our model to learn connectional brain
templates (CBTs), population-level fingerprints from multi-view brain networks.
Unlike prior work that overlooks cognitive properties, CogGNN generates CBTs
that are both cognitively and structurally meaningful. Our contributions are:
(i) a novel cognition-aware generative model with a visual-memory-based loss;
(ii) a CBT-learning framework with a co-optimization strategy to yield
well-centered, discriminative, cognitively enhanced templates. Extensive
experiments show that CogGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing
a strong foundation for cognitively grounded brain network modeling.

*Mingkang Li,Xuexiong Luo,Yue Zhang,Yaoyang Li,Fu Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel graph anomaly detection framework using Transformer encoder, memory-guided reconstruction, and multi-scale matching to overcome over-smoothing and anomalous node interference issues in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph anomaly detection methods suffer from over-smoothing in GCNs and vulnerability to anomalous node interference in reconstruction-based approaches, making accurate anomaly detection challenging.

Method: Proposes a holistic framework with: 1) local-global Transformer encoder for structural dependencies, 2) memory-guided reconstruction to suppress anomalous node influence, and 3) multi-scale representation matching for granular anomaly assessment.

Result: Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets show the method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating robust performance across various graph domains.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a comprehensive and generalizable solution for graph anomaly detection by effectively addressing key limitations of existing methods through synergistic integration of multiple components.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in graph-structured data is an inherently challenging
problem, as it requires the identification of rare nodes that deviate from the
majority in both their structural and behavioral characteristics. Existing
methods, such as those based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs), often
suffer from over-smoothing, which causes the learned node representations to
become indistinguishable. Furthermore, graph reconstruction-based approaches
are vulnerable to anomalous node interference during the reconstruction
process, leading to inaccurate anomaly detection. In this work, we propose a
novel and holistic anomaly evaluation framework that integrates three key
components: a local-global Transformer encoder, a memory-guided reconstruction
mechanism, and a multi-scale representation matching strategy. These components
work synergistically to enhance the model's ability to capture both local and
global structural dependencies, suppress the influence of anomalous nodes, and
assess anomalies from multiple levels of granularity. Anomaly scores are
computed by combining reconstruction errors and memory matching signals,
resulting in a more robust evaluation. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches, offering a comprehensive and generalizable solution for anomaly
detection across various graph domains.

*Alma C. Castaneda-Leautaud,Rommie E. Amaro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Simplified MPNN architecture with bidirectional message-passing and attention mechanism achieves state-of-the-art molecular property prediction performance, outperforming complex pre-trained models while reducing computational costs by 50%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve molecular property prediction performance by simplifying message-passing mechanisms and using descriptors that capture multiple aspects of molecular graphs, while reducing computational complexity.

Method: Designed MPNN architectures with bidirectional message-passing and attention mechanisms, using minimalist message formulation without self-perception. Tested various configurations including convolution normalization factors, spatial features, and 2D vs 3D molecular graphs with 3D descriptors.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance surpassing complex pre-trained models. Found that simpler models yield higher class separability, convolution normalization factors don't improve performance, and 2D graphs with 3D descriptors preserve performance while reducing computational cost by over 50%.

Conclusion: Simpler MPNN architectures with appropriate feature selection can outperform complex models while being computationally efficient, making them particularly suitable for high-throughput screening applications.

Abstract: Strategies to improve the predicting performance of Message-Passing
Neural-Networks for molecular property predictions can be achieved by
simplifying how the message is passed and by using descriptors that capture
multiple aspects of molecular graphs. In this work, we designed model
architectures that achieved state-of-the-art performance, surpassing more
complex models such as those pre-trained on external databases. We assessed
dataset diversity to complement our performance results, finding that
structural diversity influences the need for additional components in our MPNNs
and feature sets.
  In most datasets, our best architecture employs bidirectional message-passing
with an attention mechanism, applied to a minimalist message formulation that
excludes self-perception, highlighting that relatively simpler models, compared
to classical MPNNs, yield higher class separability. In contrast, we found that
convolution normalization factors do not benefit the predictive power in all
the datasets tested. This was corroborated in both global and node-level
outputs. Additionally, we analyzed the influence of both adding spatial
features and working with 3D graphs, finding that 2D molecular graphs are
sufficient when complemented with appropriately chosen 3D descriptors. This
approach not only preserves predictive performance but also reduces
computational cost by over 50%, making it particularly advantageous for
high-throughput screening campaigns.

*Ali Hedayatnia,Mostafa Tavassolipour,Babak Nadjar Araabi,Abdol-Hossein Vahabie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a method to address covariate shift in diffusion denoised smoothing by training base classifiers with an adversarial objective focused on noise misestimation, achieving SOTA certified accuracy on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion denoised smoothing methods introduce covariate shift through noise misestimation, which degrades the performance of smoothed classifiers.

Method: Novel adversarial objective function that trains the base classifier to be robust against covariate shift caused by denoising diffusion model's noise misestimation.

Result: Significantly improved certified accuracy across MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art performance for l2-adversarial perturbations.

Conclusion: Addressing the covariate shift in diffusion denoised smoothing through targeted adversarial training of base classifiers effectively enhances certified robustness performance.

Abstract: Randomized smoothing is a well-established method for achieving certified
robustness against l2-adversarial perturbations. By incorporating a denoiser
before the base classifier, pretrained classifiers can be seamlessly integrated
into randomized smoothing without significant performance degradation. Among
existing methods, Diffusion Denoised Smoothing - where a pretrained denoising
diffusion model serves as the denoiser - has produced state-of-the-art results.
However, we show that employing a denoising diffusion model introduces a
covariate shift via misestimation of the added noise, ultimately degrading the
smoothed classifier's performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel
adversarial objective function focused on the added noise of the denoising
diffusion model. This approach is inspired by our understanding of the origin
of the covariate shift. Our goal is to train the base classifier to ensure it
is robust against the covariate shift introduced by the denoiser. Our method
significantly improves certified accuracy across three standard classification
benchmarks - MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet - achieving new state-of-the-art
performance in l2-adversarial perturbations. Our implementation is publicly

*Wenbo Lu,Shaoyi Zheng,Yuxuan Xia,Shengjie Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ToMA is a GPU-efficient token reduction method that reformulates token merging as submodular optimization, uses attention-like linear transformations, and exploits redundancy patterns to achieve 23-24% latency reduction in diffusion models while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing token reduction methods for diffusion models (like ToMeSD and ToFu) suffer from GPU-inefficient operations that negate theoretical speedups when used with optimized attention implementations like FlashAttention.

Method: Proposes Token Merge with Attention (ToMA) with three key innovations: 1) token merge as submodular optimization for diverse token selection, 2) merge/unmerge as GPU-friendly matrix operations, and 3) exploiting latent locality and sequential redundancy to minimize overhead.

Result: Reduces SDXL generation latency by 24% and Flux generation latency by 23% while maintaining high image quality (DINO Δ < 0.07), outperforming prior token reduction methods.

Conclusion: ToMA successfully bridges the gap between theoretical and practical efficiency for transformers in diffusion models by providing GPU-aligned token reduction that delivers actual speed improvements without sacrificing quality.

Abstract: Diffusion models excel in high-fidelity image generation but face scalability
limits due to transformers' quadratic attention complexity. Plug-and-play token
reduction methods like ToMeSD and ToFu reduce FLOPs by merging redundant tokens
in generated images but rely on GPU-inefficient operations (e.g., sorting,
scattered writes), introducing overheads that negate theoretical speedups when
paired with optimized attention implementations (e.g., FlashAttention). To
bridge this gap, we propose Token Merge with Attention (ToMA), an off-the-shelf
method that redesigns token reduction for GPU-aligned efficiency, with three
key contributions: 1) a reformulation of token merge as a submodular
optimization problem to select diverse tokens; 2) merge/unmerge as an
attention-like linear transformation via GPU-friendly matrix operations; and 3)
exploiting latent locality and sequential redundancy (pattern reuse) to
minimize overhead. ToMA reduces SDXL/Flux generation latency by 24%/23%,
respectively (with DINO $\Delta < 0.07$), outperforming prior methods. This
work bridges the gap between theoretical and practical efficiency for
transformers in diffusion.

### [333] [Clarifying Model Transparency: Interpretability versus Explainability in Deep Learning with MNIST and IMDB Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10929)
*Mitali Raj*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides a comparative analysis of interpretability vs explainability in deep learning, distinguishing interpretability as global model understanding and explainability as post-hoc local explanations for individual predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the 'black box' problem in deep learning that hinders AI adoption in high-trust domains by clarifying the distinct concepts of interpretability and explainability under the XAI umbrella.

Method: Comparative exploration through illustrative case studies using MNIST digit classification and IMDB sentiment analysis tasks, examining definitions, objectives, methodologies, and challenges of both concepts.

Result: Establishes that interpretability refers to a model's inherent capacity for global human comprehension, while explainability involves post-hoc techniques providing local explanations for specific predictions (e.g., feature attribution for MNIST digits, word importance for sentiment analysis).

Conclusion: A clear understanding of the interpretability-explainability distinction is crucial for developing dependable AI systems, as local explanations don't necessarily provide global model transparency.

Abstract: The impressive capabilities of deep learning models are often counterbalanced
by their inherent opacity, commonly termed the "black box" problem, which
impedes their widespread acceptance in high-trust domains. In response, the
intersecting disciplines of interpretability and explainability, collectively
falling under the Explainable AI (XAI) umbrella, have become focal points of
research. Although these terms are frequently used as synonyms, they carry
distinct conceptual weights. This document offers a comparative exploration of
interpretability and explainability within the deep learning paradigm,
carefully outlining their respective definitions, objectives, prevalent
methodologies, and inherent difficulties. Through illustrative examinations of
the MNIST digit classification task and IMDB sentiment analysis, we
substantiate a key argument: interpretability generally pertains to a model's
inherent capacity for human comprehension of its operational mechanisms (global
understanding), whereas explainability is more commonly associated with
post-hoc techniques designed to illuminate the basis for a model's individual
predictions or behaviors (local explanations). For example, feature attribution
methods can reveal why a specific MNIST image is recognized as a '7', and
word-level importance can clarify an IMDB sentiment outcome. However, these
local insights do not render the complex underlying model globally transparent.
A clear grasp of this differentiation, as demonstrated by these standard
datasets, is vital for fostering dependable and sound artificial intelligence.

*Joshua Au Yeung,Jacopo Dalmasso,Luca Foschini,Richard JB Dobson,Zeljko Kraljevic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs show concerning tendency to reinforce delusions and enable harmful behaviors in vulnerable users, with poor safety interventions across various conversational scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the emerging risk of 'AI psychosis' where LLM interactions may exacerbate or induce psychotic symptoms by reinforcing delusional beliefs in vulnerable users.

Method: Developed psychosis-bench benchmark with 16 structured, 12-turn conversational scenarios simulating delusional themes progression, evaluated 8 LLMs on Delusion Confirmation, Harm Enablement, and Safety Intervention scores.

Result: All LLMs demonstrated psychogenic potential (mean DCS 0.91), frequently enabled harmful requests (mean HES 0.69), offered safety interventions in only ~1/3 of cases (mean SIS 0.37), with 39.8% scenarios having no interventions. Performance worse in implicit scenarios.

Conclusion: LLM psychogenicity is a quantifiable public health risk requiring urgent re-thinking of LLM training approaches and collaboration between developers, policymakers, and healthcare professionals.

Abstract: Background: Emerging reports of "AI psychosis" are on the rise, where
user-LLM interactions may exacerbate or induce psychosis or adverse
psychological symptoms. The sycophantic and agreeable nature of LLMs can
beneficial, it can become a vector for harm by reinforcing delusional beliefs
in vulnerable users.
  Methods: We introduce psychosis-bench, a novel benchmark designed to
systematically evaluate the psychogenicity of LLMs comprimising 16 structured,
12-turn conversational scenarios simulating the progression of delusional
themes(Erotic Delusions, Grandiose/Messianic Delusions, Referential Delusions)
and potential harms. We evaluated eight prominent LLMs for Delusion
Confirmation (DCS), Harm Enablement (HES), and Safety Intervention(SIS) across
explicit and implicit conversational contexts.
  Findings: Across 1,536 simulated conversation turns, all LLMs demonstrated
psychogenic potential, showing a strong tendency to perpetuate rather than
challenge delusions (mean DCS of 0.91 $\pm$0.88). Models frequently enabled
harmful user requests (mean HES of 0.69 $\pm$0.84) and offered safety
interventions in only roughly a third of applicable turns (mean SIS of 0.37
$\pm$0.48). 51 / 128 (39.8%) of scenarios had no safety interventions offered.
Performance was significantly worse in implicit scenarios, models were more
likely to confirm delusions and enable harm while offering fewer interventions
(p < .001). A strong correlation was found between DCS and HES (rs = .77).
Model performance varied widely, indicating that safety is not an emergent
property of scale alone.
  Conclusion: This study establishes LLM psychogenicity as a quantifiable risk
and underscores the urgent need for re-thinking how we train LLMs. We frame
this issue not merely as a technical challenge but as a public health
imperative requiring collaboration between developers, policymakers, and
healthcare professionals.

*Bhoomit Vasani,Jack FitzGerald,Anjie Fang,Sushmit Vaish*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PHLoRA extracts LoRA adapters from fine-tuned models without training data or gradients, enabling scalable inference and cost savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable adapter extraction from existing full-rank fine-tuned models without requiring access to original training data or gradients, making all checkpoints adapter-ready.

Method: Computes low-rank decomposition of weight differences between base model and fine-tuned counterpart to reconstruct adapter modules that can be merged or dynamically routed.

Result: Extracted adapters preserve high energy from full weight delta, can be safely pruned, and show negligible degradation in downstream task performance when re-merged.

Conclusion: PHLoRA provides a practical path for democratizing scalable inference by making all existing full-rank checkpoints adapter-ready.

Abstract: We introduce PHLoRA (Pronounced "flora"). (Post-hoc LoRA), a simple yet
powerful method to extract low-rank adaptation adapters from full-rank
fine-tuned models without requiring access to training data or gradients. By
computing the low-rank decomposition of weight differences between a base model
and its fine-tuned counterpart, our method reconstructs adapter modules that
can be merged or dynamically routed at inference time via S-LoRA, or served in
scalable, industry settings using platforms like NVIDIA NIM. This approach
amortizes latency overhead across requests and yields substantial cost savings.
Unlike prior work that trains each adapter explicitly, our approach decouples
fine-tuning from adapter generation, allowing adapter extraction from existing
full-rank models or third-party checkpoints. Experiments on text, image, and
video benchmarks using the Amazon Nova model family demonstrate that extracted
adapters preserve high energy from the full weight delta, can be pruned safely,
and yield negligible degradation in downstream task performance when re-merged.
Overall, PHLoRA provides a practical path for making all existing full-rank
checkpoints adapter-ready, democratizing scalable inference for all models.

### [336] [Decoupling Search and Learning in Neural Net Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10973)
*Akshay Vegesna,Samip Dahal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A two-phase training framework that uses evolutionary search in representation space to find diverse solutions, then gradient descent to learn parameters that match those representations, overcoming gradient descent's exploration limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gradient descent converges to single minima and lacks mechanisms to explore alternative minima that may generalize better. Direct search in high-dimensional parameter space is intractable.

Method: Two-phase approach: 1) Evolutionary search in intermediate activation space to find diverse representational solutions, 2) Gradient-based learning in parameter space by regressing to the searched representations.

Result: Discovered representational solutions scale with compute (larger populations/more generations yield better varied solutions). Networks trained this way approach SGD performance on MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, with performance improving with search compute until saturation. Models show different representational trajectories than gradient descent.

Conclusion: This framework demonstrates how training algorithms can overcome gradient descent's exploratory limitations by decoupling search in representation space from efficient gradient-based learning in parameter space.

Abstract: Gradient descent typically converges to a single minimum of the training loss
without mechanisms to explore alternative minima that may generalize better.
Searching for diverse minima directly in high-dimensional parameter space is
generally intractable. To address this, we propose a framework that performs
training in two distinct phases: search in a tractable representation space
(the space of intermediate activations) to find diverse representational
solutions, and gradient-based learning in parameter space by regressing to
those searched representations. Through evolutionary search, we discover
representational solutions whose fitness and diversity scale with
compute--larger populations and more generations produce better and more varied
solutions. These representations prove to be learnable: networks trained by
regressing to searched representations approach SGD's performance on MNIST,
CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100. Performance improves with search compute up to
saturation. The resulting models differ qualitatively from networks trained
with gradient descent, following different representational trajectories during
training. This work demonstrates how future training algorithms could overcome
gradient descent's exploratory limitations by decoupling search in
representation space from efficient gradient-based learning in parameter space.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAWFI is a comprehensive California wildfire database with 37M+ data points for training AI models to predict wildfires before ignition, using meteorological, environmental, and geological indicators from 2012-2022.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wildfires are increasing globally due to climate change, but current AI solutions mainly detect fires after ignition. There's a need for predictive techniques to prevent megafires before they start.

Method: Created the California Wildfire Inventory (CAWFI) database compiling daily historical wildfire data (2012-2018) and indicator data (2012-2022) including meteorological, environmental, and geological factors that correlate with wildfire risk.

Result: When used to train a spatio-temporal AI model, CAWFI successfully predicted 85.7% of future wildfires larger than 300,000 acres when trained on 2012-2017 data.

Conclusion: CAWFI enables wildfire prediction research and solutions, setting a precedent for similar databases in other regions to help prevent wildfires through early prediction.

Abstract: Due to climate change and the disruption of ecosystems worldwide, wildfires
are increasingly impacting environment, infrastructure, and human lives
globally. Additionally, an exacerbating climate crisis means that these losses
would continue to grow if preventative measures are not implemented. Though
recent advancements in artificial intelligence enable wildfire management
techniques, most deployed solutions focus on detecting wildfires after
ignition. The development of predictive techniques with high accuracy requires
extensive datasets to train machine learning models. This paper presents the
California Wildfire Inventory (CAWFI), a wildfire database of over 37 million
data points for building and training wildfire prediction solutions, thereby
potentially preventing megafires and flash fires by addressing them before they
spark. The dataset compiles daily historical California wildfire data from 2012
to 2018 and indicator data from 2012 to 2022. The indicator data consists of
leading indicators (meteorological data correlating to wildfire-prone
conditions), trailing indicators (environmental data correlating to prior and
early wildfire activity), and geological indicators (vegetation and elevation
data dictating wildfire risk and spread patterns). CAWFI has already
demonstrated success when used to train a spatio-temporal artificial
intelligence model, predicting 85.7% of future wildfires larger than 300,000
acres when trained on 2012-2017 indicator data. This dataset is intended to
enable wildfire prediction research and solutions as well as set a precedent
for future wildfire databases in other regions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FragmentGPT is a novel AI framework that integrates chemically-aware pre-training and reward-ranked alignment to generate optimized molecular linkers for fragment-based drug discovery, addressing structural redundancies and multi-objective pharmaceutical goals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Fragment-Based Drug Discovery (FBDD) faces challenges in designing effective linkers to combine molecular fragments, especially when fragments contain structural redundancies like duplicate rings that cannot be addressed by simple atom/bond modifications.

Method: FragmentGPT combines two core components: (1) chemically-aware, energy-based bond cleavage pre-training for fragment growing, linking, and merging capabilities, and (2) Reward Ranked Alignment with Expert Exploration (RAE) algorithm that includes expert imitation learning, data selection/augmentation, and Supervised Fine-Tuning for multi-objective alignment.

Result: The model successfully generates chemically valid, high-quality molecules tailored for downstream drug discovery tasks, as demonstrated through experiments and ablation studies on real-world cancer datasets.

Conclusion: FragmentGPT provides a unified framework for controlled, goal-driven molecular assembly that can resolve structural redundancies and optimize for multiple pharmaceutical objectives simultaneously in fragment-based drug discovery.

Abstract: Fragment-Based Drug Discovery (FBDD) is a popular approach in early drug
development, but designing effective linkers to combine disconnected molecular
fragments into chemically and pharmacologically viable candidates remains
challenging. Further complexity arises when fragments contain structural
redundancies, like duplicate rings, which cannot be addressed by simply adding
or removing atoms or bonds. To address these challenges in a unified framework,
we introduce FragmentGPT, which integrates two core components: (1) a novel
chemically-aware, energy-based bond cleavage pre-training strategy that equips
the GPT-based model with fragment growing, linking, and merging capabilities,
and (2) a novel Reward Ranked Alignment with Expert Exploration (RAE) algorithm
that combines expert imitation learning for diversity enhancement, data
selection and augmentation for Pareto and composite score optimality, and
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to align the learner policy with multi-objective
goals. Conditioned on fragment pairs, FragmentGPT generates linkers that
connect diverse molecular subunits while simultaneously optimizing for multiple
pharmaceutical goals. It also learns to resolve structural redundancies-such as
duplicated fragments-through intelligent merging, enabling the synthesis of
optimized molecules. FragmentGPT facilitates controlled, goal-driven molecular
assembly. Experiments and ablation studies on real-world cancer datasets
demonstrate its ability to generate chemically valid, high-quality molecules
tailored for downstream drug discovery tasks.

TL;DR: Time-stratified sampling with 20% of training data achieves similar or better performance than full-data training for autoregressive diffusion models in weather forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive diffusion models for ensemble weather forecasting are computationally expensive, which is problematic in climate science where data is limited, costly, or difficult to work with.

Method: Evaluated several data sampling strategies, focusing on time stratified sampling approach to reduce training data requirements while maintaining performance.

Result: Time stratified sampling using only 20% of training data achieved performance similar to or better than full-data training, outperforming on certain metrics and performing only slightly worse on others.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of data-efficient diffusion training for weather forecasting and motivates future work on adaptive or model-aware sampling methods beyond random or temporal sampling.

Abstract: Although numerical weather forecasting methods have dominated the field,
recent advances in deep learning methods, such as diffusion models, have shown
promise in ensemble weather forecasting. However, such models are typically
autoregressive and are thus computationally expensive. This is a challenge in
climate science, where data can be limited, costly, or difficult to work with.
In this work, we explore the impact of curated data selection on these
autoregressive diffusion models. We evaluate several data sampling strategies
and show that a simple time stratified sampling approach achieves performance
similar to or better than full-data training. Notably, it outperforms the
full-data model on certain metrics and performs only slightly worse on others
while using only 20% of the training data. Our results demonstrate the
feasibility of data-efficient diffusion training, especially for weather
forecasting, and motivates future work on adaptive or model-aware sampling
methods that go beyond random or purely temporal sampling.

TL;DR: Proposes DAC-FCF framework combining advanced data augmentation, contrastive learning, and Fourier convolution for bearing fault diagnosis with limited labeled data, achieving significant performance improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data scarcity in bearing fault diagnosis due to high labeling costs and privacy concerns. Overcome limitations of traditional data augmentation (mode collapse, low-quality samples), inadequate global feature extraction by CNNs, and failure to model relationships between limited training samples.

Method: 1) CCLR-GAN for diverse data generation, 2) Contrastive learning for modeling sample relationships, 3) 1D Fourier CNN for global-aware feature extraction from vibration signals.

Result: Achieves up to 32% improvement on CWRU dataset and 10% on self-collected test bench compared to baselines. Ablation experiments confirm effectiveness of all components.

Conclusion: DAC-FCF provides a promising solution for bearing fault diagnosis under limited data conditions by integrating advanced data augmentation, relationship modeling, and global feature extraction.

Abstract: In the area of bearing fault diagnosis, deep learning (DL) methods have been
widely used recently. However, due to the high cost or privacy concerns,
high-quality labeled data are scarce in real world scenarios. While few-shot
learning has shown promise in addressing data scarcity, existing methods still
face significant limitations in this domain. Traditional data augmentation
techniques often suffer from mode collapse and generate low-quality samples
that fail to capture the diversity of bearing fault patterns. Moreover,
conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with local receptive fields
makes them inadequate for extracting global features from complex vibration
signals. Additionally, existing methods fail to model the intricate
relationships between limited training samples. To solve these problems, we
propose an advanced data augmentation and contrastive fourier convolution
framework (DAC-FCF) for bearing fault diagnosis under limited data. Firstly, a
novel conditional consistent latent representation and reconstruction
generative adversarial network (CCLR-GAN) is proposed to generate more diverse
data. Secondly, a contrastive learning based joint optimization mechanism is
utilized to better model the relations between the available training data.
Finally, we propose a 1D fourier convolution neural network (1D-FCNN) to
achieve a global-aware of the input data. Experiments demonstrate that DAC-FCF
achieves significant improvements, outperforming baselines by up to 32\% on
case western reserve university (CWRU) dataset and 10\% on a self-collected
test bench. Extensive ablation experiments prove the effectiveness of the
proposed components. Thus, the proposed DAC-FCF offers a promising solution for
bearing fault diagnosis under limited data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GCN-TULHOR uses hexagonal tessellation and Graph Convolutional Networks to transform sparse location data into higher-order mobility flows, achieving 1-8% performance gains in trajectory-user linking tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing trajectory-user linking methods struggle with sparse data, incomplete routes, and limited modeling of complex spatial dependencies, often relying on low-level check-in data or ignoring spatial patterns.

Method: Transforms raw location data into higher-order mobility flow representations using hexagonal tessellation, then integrates Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to model complex spatial relationships without requiring side information like timestamps.

Result: Experiments on six real-world datasets show consistent improvements over classical baselines, RNN- and Transformer-based models, with 1-8% relative gains in accuracy and F1-score. Optimal setup uses single GCN layer with 512-dimensional embeddings.

Conclusion: The integration of GCNs enhances spatial learning and improves generalizability across mobility data, offering a robust and scalable solution for trajectory-user linking with applications in recommendations, urban planning, and security.

Abstract: Trajectory-user linking (TUL) aims to associate anonymized trajectories with
the users who generated them, which is crucial for personalized
recommendations, privacy-preserving analytics, and secure location-based
services. Existing methods struggle with sparse data, incomplete routes, and
limited modeling of complex spatial dependencies, often relying on low-level
check-in data or ignoring spatial patterns. In this paper, we introduced
GCN-TULHOR, a method that transforms raw location data into higher-order
mobility flow representations using hexagonal tessellation, reducing data
sparsity and capturing richer spatial semantics, and integrating Graph
Convolutional Networks (GCNs). Our approach converts both sparse check-in and
continuous GPS trajectory data into unified higher-order flow representations,
mitigating sparsity while capturing deeper semantic information. The GCN layer
explicitly models complex spatial relationships and non-local dependencies
without requiring side information such as timestamps or points of interest.
Experiments on six real-world datasets show consistent improvements over
classical baselines, RNN- and Transformer-based models, and the TULHOR method
in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. GCN-TULHOR achieves 1-8% relative
gains in accuracy and F1. Sensitivity analysis identifies an optimal setup with
a single GCN layer and 512-dimensional embeddings. The integration of GCNs
enhances spatial learning and improves generalizability across mobility data.
This work highlights the value of combining graph-based spatial learning with
sequential modeling, offering a robust and scalable solution for TUL with
applications in recommendations, urban planning, and security.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BIGNet is the first large-scale GNN for BIM models, achieving 72.7% F1-score improvement over non-pretrained models by learning semantic-spatial-topological features through a novel message-passing mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Large Foundation Models focus on textual/visual data but overlook rich semantic, spatial, and topological features in BIM models, limiting their application in civil engineering.

Method: Developed BIGNet using scalable graph representation for BIM components, created 1M node/3.5M edge dataset, introduced new message-passing mechanism to GraphMAE2 with node masking pretraining, and used GAT-based feature extraction.

Result: Homogeneous graph representation outperformed heterogeneous; 30cm local spatial relationships enhanced performance; achieved 72.7% F1-score improvement in transfer learning tasks for BIM design checking.

Conclusion: BIGNet effectively learns and transfers BIM design features, demonstrating significant potential for automated application in design and lifecycle management of civil engineering projects.

Abstract: Large Foundation Models (LFMs) have demonstrated significant advantages in
civil engineering, but they primarily focus on textual and visual data,
overlooking the rich semantic, spatial, and topological features in BIM
(Building Information Modelling) models. Therefore, this study develops the
first large-scale graph neural network (GNN), BIGNet, to learn, and reuse
multidimensional design features embedded in BIM models. Firstly, a scalable
graph representation is introduced to encode the "semantic-spatial-topological"
features of BIM components, and a dataset with nearly 1 million nodes and 3.5
million edges is created. Subsequently, BIGNet is proposed by introducing a new
message-passing mechanism to GraphMAE2 and further pretrained with a node
masking strategy. Finally, BIGNet is evaluated in various transfer learning
tasks for BIM-based design checking. Results show that: 1) homogeneous graph
representation outperforms heterogeneous graph in learning design features, 2)
considering local spatial relationships in a 30 cm radius enhances performance,
and 3) BIGNet with GAT (Graph Attention Network)-based feature extraction
achieves the best transfer learning results. This innovation leads to a 72.7%
improvement in Average F1-score over non-pretrained models, demonstrating its
effectiveness in learning and transferring BIM design features and facilitating
their automated application in future design and lifecycle management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Persian names present unique challenges for NLP applications due to transliteration inconsistencies and cultural-specific naming patterns, with existing tools showing poor performance and limited datasets available.

Method: Created PNGT-26K dataset with 26,000 Persian name-gender-transliteration tuples, and developed two frameworks: Open Gender Detection (probabilistic gender detection using user data) and Nominalist (AI agent for username generation).

Result: The PNGT-26K dataset and both frameworks (Open Gender Detection and Nominalist) are publicly available on Github as ready-to-use resources for Persian NLP applications.

Conclusion: The research provides valuable resources to overcome Persian name processing challenges, enabling better gender detection and digital identity creation tools for Persian language applications.

Abstract: Persian names present unique challenges for natural language processing
applications, particularly in gender detection and digital identity creation,
due to transliteration inconsistencies and cultural-specific naming patterns.
Existing tools exhibit significant performance degradation on Persian names,
while the scarcity of comprehensive datasets further compounds these
limitations. To address these challenges, the present research introduces
PNGT-26K, a comprehensive dataset of Persian names, their commonly associated
gender, and their English transliteration, consisting of approximately 26,000
tuples. As a demonstration of how this resource can be utilized, we also
introduce two frameworks, namely Open Gender Detection and Nominalist. Open
Gender Detection is a production-grade, ready-to-use framework for using
existing data from a user, such as profile photo and name, to give a
probabilistic guess about the person's gender. Nominalist, the second framework
introduced by this paper, utilizes agentic AI to help users choose a username
for their social media accounts on any platform. It can be easily integrated
into any website to provide a better user experience. The PNGT-26K dataset,
Nominalist and Open Gender Detection frameworks are publicly available on
Github.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hopkins loss uses Hopkins statistic to modify feature space topology for ML benefits like dimensionality reduction and robustness, with minimal performance impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature space topology modification can benefit various ML applications but existing methods focus on preserving rather than modifying topology.

Method: Novel Hopkins loss function based on Hopkins statistic to enforce desired feature space topology in classification and autoencoder tasks.

Result: Integration of Hopkins loss shows small impact on classification performance while successfully modifying feature topology across speech, text, and image data.

Conclusion: Hopkins loss effectively modifies feature space topology with minimal performance degradation, offering benefits for various ML applications.

Abstract: Feature space topology refers to the organization of samples within the
feature space. Modifying this topology can be beneficial in machine learning
applications, including dimensionality reduction, generative modeling, transfer
learning, and robustness to adversarial attacks. This paper introduces a novel
loss function, Hopkins loss, which leverages the Hopkins statistic to enforce a
desired feature space topology, which is in contrast to existing
topology-related methods that aim to preserve input feature topology. We
evaluate the effectiveness of Hopkins loss on speech, text, and image data in
two scenarios: classification and dimensionality reduction using nonlinear
bottleneck autoencoders. Our experiments show that integrating Hopkins loss
into classification or dimensionality reduction has only a small impact on
classification performance while providing the benefit of modifying feature
topology.

*Santhosh G S,Saurav Prakash,Balaraman Ravindran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AQUA reduces attention computation cost by 25% with minimal performance impact through SVD-based projection and dynamic dimension selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quadratic complexity of attention mechanism creates computational and memory bottlenecks for scaling LLMs to longer contexts.

Method: Two-phase approach: 1) Offline SVD computation of universal projection matrix, 2) Online projection of query/key vectors with dynamic dimension selection based on query magnitude.

Result: 25% reduction in attention dot-product computation with statistically insignificant performance impact on Llama-3.1-8B across benchmarks; synergizes with existing token eviction methods and reduces KV-cache memory.

Conclusion: AQUA provides a practical, controllable efficiency-accuracy trade-off tool for making large-scale LLM inference more accessible and sustainable.

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism remains a fundamental
barrier to scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) to longer contexts, creating a
critical bottleneck in both computation and memory. To address this, we
introduce AQUA (Attention via QUery mAgnitudes) a novel and versatile
approximation strategy that significantly reduces the cost of attention with a
graceful performance trade-off. Our method operates in two phases: an efficient
offline step where we compute a universal, language agnostic projection matrix
via SVD on a calibration dataset, and an online inference step where we project
query and key vectors and dynamically select a sparse subset of dimensions
based on the query's magnitude. We provide a formal theoretical analysis of
AQUA, establishing the break-even point at which it becomes more
computationally efficient than standard attention. Our empirical evaluations on
state-of-the-art models like Llama-3.1-8B demonstrate that a 25% reduction in
the attention dot-product computation can be achieved with a statistically
insignificant impact on performance across a wide range of benchmarks. We
further showcase the versatility of AQUA by demonstrating its ability to
synergistically accelerate existing token eviction methods like H2O and to
directly reduce KV-cache memory size. By offering a controllable knob to
balance efficiency and accuracy, AQUA provides a practical and powerful tool
for making large-scale LLM inference more accessible and sustainable.

*Dat-Thinh Nguyen,Kim-Hung Le,Nhien-An Le-Khac*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MetaDFME is a novel data-free model extraction method that uses meta-learning to stabilize substitute model accuracy by reducing distribution shifts in synthetic data generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data-free model extraction methods suffer from oscillating accuracy in substitute models due to constant distribution shifts in generated data, making attacks impractical without access to target model's in-distribution data.

Method: Uses meta-learning in generator training to capture meta-representations of synthetic data that can be adapted with few steps to produce data that facilitates learning while reducing distribution shift effects.

Result: Outperforms current state-of-the-art data-free model extraction methods on MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets while exhibiting more stable substitute model accuracy.

Conclusion: MetaDFME effectively mitigates accuracy oscillation in data-free model extraction attacks through meta-learning techniques, making the attacks more practical and stable.

Abstract: Model extraction is a severe threat to Machine Learning-as-a-Service systems,
especially through data-free approaches, where dishonest users can replicate
the functionality of a black-box target model without access to realistic data.
Despite recent advancements, existing data-free model extraction methods suffer
from the oscillating accuracy of the substitute model. This oscillation, which
could be attributed to the constant shift in the generated data distribution
during the attack, makes the attack impractical since the optimal substitute
model cannot be determined without access to the target model's in-distribution
data. Hence, we propose MetaDFME, a novel data-free model extraction method
that employs meta-learning in the generator training to reduce the distribution
shift, aiming to mitigate the substitute model's accuracy oscillation. In
detail, we train our generator to iteratively capture the meta-representations
of the synthetic data during the attack. These meta-representations can be
adapted with a few steps to produce data that facilitates the substitute model
to learn from the target model while reducing the effect of distribution
shifts. Our experiments on popular baseline image datasets, MNIST, SVHN,
CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, demonstrate that MetaDFME outperforms the current
state-of-the-art data-free model extraction method while exhibiting a more
stable substitute model's accuracy during the attack.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional oversampling techniques like SMOTE often fail to handle label noise and complex data distributions in imbalanced classification, leading to reduced accuracy in critical applications like medical diagnosis and fraud detection.

Method: GK-SMOTE uses Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation to differentiate between safe and noisy regions, generating synthetic samples in high-density minority regions while avoiding ambiguous areas, without requiring extensive parameter tuning.

Result: Extensive experiments on diverse binary classification datasets show GK-SMOTE outperforms state-of-the-art oversampling techniques across key metrics including MCC, Balanced Accuracy, and AUPRC.

Conclusion: GK-SMOTE provides a robust, efficient solution for imbalanced classification tasks, particularly in noisy data environments, making it suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: Imbalanced classification is a significant challenge in machine learning,
especially in critical applications like medical diagnosis, fraud detection,
and cybersecurity. Traditional oversampling techniques, such as SMOTE, often
fail to handle label noise and complex data distributions, leading to reduced
classification accuracy. In this paper, we propose GK-SMOTE, a
hyperparameter-free, noise-resilient extension of SMOTE, built on Gaussian
Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). GK-SMOTE enhances class separability by
generating synthetic samples in high-density minority regions, while
effectively avoiding noisy or ambiguous areas. This self-adaptive approach uses
Gaussian KDE to differentiate between safe and noisy regions, ensuring more
accurate sample generation without requiring extensive parameter tuning. Our
extensive experiments on diverse binary classification datasets demonstrate
that GK-SMOTE outperforms existing state-of-the-art oversampling techniques
across key evaluation metrics, including MCC, Balanced Accuracy, and AUPRC. The
proposed method offers a robust, efficient solution for imbalanced
classification tasks, especially in noisy data environments, making it an
attractive choice for real-world applications.

*Pouria Mahdavinia,Hamed Mahdavi,Niloofar Mireshghallah,Mehrdad Mahdavi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OTA Merging + FFG improves model merging by using curvature-aware aggregation and task-localization to reduce interference between different capability checkpoints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To effectively combine multiple specialized SFT checkpoints (math, code, instruction following, knowledge) into a single model without joint retraining, while minimizing negative transfer and interference.

Method: OTA Merging uses optimizer second-moment statistics as curvature proxy to reweight parameter edits. FFG sparsifies conflicting edits with low-rank masks in attention projections and embeddings. Also includes memory-light compression of second moments.

Result: OTA+FFG improves merged-model quality over weight-space baselines, reduces negative transfer, remains robust across sparsity levels, and shows substantial curvature overlap between checkpoints.

Conclusion: Curvature-aware merging with task-localization effectively consolidates multiple capabilities, with FFG being critical for reducing interference and compressed moments retaining full formulation gains.

Abstract: Model merging is an effective post-training strategy for composing
capabilities in large language models without joint retraining. We study this
in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, where multiple capability-based SFT
checkpoints -- spanning math, code, precise instruction following, general
instruction following, and knowledge recall -- must be consolidated into a
single model. We introduce Optimization Trajectory Aware (OTA) Merging, a
curvature-aware aggregation that leverages optimizer second-moment statistics
as a diagonal curvature proxy to reweight parameter edits and mitigate
interference. Complementing OTA, we propose Fast Fisher Grafting (FFG), a
curvature-driven task-localization step that sparsifies conflicting or
low-importance edits. FFG induces extremely low-rank masks concentrated in
early attention query/key projections and token embeddings, exploiting shared
curvature across capabilities. We further develop a memory-light compression of
the second moments that preserves OTA's effect. Across diverse capability-based
SFT checkpoints, OTA+FFG improves merged-model quality over strong weight-space
baselines, reduces negative transfer, and remains robust across sparsity
levels. Analyses reveal substantial curvature overlap between checkpoints,
offering a novel lens on why simple linear merging can be effective in
practice. Ablations confirm that FFG is critical for reducing task interference
and that the compressed second moments retain the gains of the full
formulation. To facilitate reproducibility, we open-source all code, training
and evaluation scripts, visualization artifacts, and capability-specific SFT
checkpoints at https://github.com/pmahdavi/ota-merge.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedGDVE enhances federated learning for recommender systems by selectively augmenting local client data with semantically aligned global samples using graph encoders and reinforcement learning, achieving up to 34.86% performance improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL-based recommender systems rely solely on private client data, ignoring abundant public datasets that could enrich training and address data sparsity and bias issues in decentralized environments.

Method: Proposes FedGDVE with: (i) pre-trained graph encoder for global structural features, (ii) local valid predictor for client-specific relevance assessment, (iii) reinforcement-learning-based probability estimator to filter and sample the most pertinent global interactions.

Result: Achieves performance improvements of up to 34.86% on recognized benchmarks in federated learning environments.

Conclusion: Selective augmentation of local client data with semantically aligned global samples effectively addresses data sparsity and bias while preserving privacy, demonstrating significant performance gains in federated recommender systems.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is gaining prominence in machine learning as privacy
concerns grow. This paradigm allows each client (e.g., an individual online
store) to train a recommendation model locally while sharing only model
updates, without exposing the raw interaction logs to a central server, thereby
preserving privacy in a decentralized environment. Nonetheless, most existing
FL-based recommender systems still rely solely on each client's private data,
despite the abundance of publicly available datasets that could be leveraged to
enrich local training; this potential remains largely underexplored. To this
end, we consider a realistic scenario wherein a large shopping platform
collaborates with multiple small online stores to build a global recommender
system. The platform possesses global data, such as shareable user and item
lists, while each store holds a portion of interaction data privately (or
locally). Although integrating global data can help mitigate the limitations of
sparse and biased clients' local data, it also introduces additional
challenges: simply combining all global interactions can amplify noise and
irrelevant patterns, worsening personalization and increasing computational
costs. To address these challenges, we propose FedGDVE, which selectively
augments each client's local graph with semantically aligned samples from the
global dataset. FedGDVE employs: (i) a pre-trained graph encoder to extract
global structural features, (ii) a local valid predictor to assess
client-specific relevance, (iii) a reinforcement-learning-based probability
estimator to filter and sample only the most pertinent global interactions.
FedGDVE improves performance by up to 34.86% on recognized benchmarks in FL
environments.

*Xi He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces four novel formal definitions for optimal decision tree (ODT) problems with size and depth constraints, using algebraic programming theory to derive correct-by-construction dynamic programming algorithms that unify and generalize existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide unambiguous formal specifications for ODT problems and derive optimal algorithms that work with arbitrary splitting rules, moving beyond traditional axis-parallel constraints to enable more flexible and powerful decision trees.

Method: Uses algebraic programming theory - a relational formalism - to derive correct-by-construction dynamic programming solutions from executable recursive program specifications. This approach establishes existence/nonexistence of solutions and constructs them when they exist.

Result: Developed four novel optimal algorithms for ODT problems with arbitrary splitting rules that satisfy given axioms and objective functions. These algorithms generalize existing depth-constrained axis-parallel methods and provide a unified solution framework.

Conclusion: The framework enables optimal decision trees with flexible splitting rules and is extendable to support even more complex decision trees with mixed splitting rules, demonstrating significant potential beyond traditional axis-parallel approaches.

Abstract: In the first paper (part I) of this series of two, we introduce four novel
definitions of the ODT problems: three for size-constrained trees and one for
depth-constrained trees. These definitions are stated unambiguously through
executable recursive programs, satisfying all criteria we propose for a formal
specification. In this sense, they resemble the "standard form" used in the
study of general-purpose solvers.
  Grounded in algebraic programming theory-a relational formalism for deriving
correct-by-construction algorithms from specifications-we can not only
establish the existence or nonexistence of dynamic programming solutions but
also derive them constructively whenever they exist. Consequently, the four
generic problem definitions yield four novel optimal algorithms for ODT
problems with arbitrary splitting rules that satisfy the axioms and objective
functions of a given form. These algorithms encompass the known
depth-constrained, axis-parallel ODT algorithm as the special case, while
providing a unified, efficient, and elegant solution for the general ODT
problem.
  In Part II, we present the first optimal hypersurface decision tree algorithm
and provide comprehensive experiments against axis-parallel decision tree
algorithms, including heuristic CART and state-of-the-art optimal methods. The
results demonstrate the significant potential of decision trees with flexible
splitting rules. Moreover, our framework is readily extendable to support
algorithms for constructing even more flexible decision trees, including those
with mixed splitting rules.

TL;DR: TransZero is a model-based RL algorithm that parallelizes Monte Carlo Tree Search using transformer networks and Mean-Variance Constrained evaluation, achieving 11x speedup over MuZero while maintaining sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the sequential bottleneck in traditional MCTS approaches like MuZero, which construct search trees step-by-step using recurrent dynamics models, limiting real-time decision-making capabilities.

Method: Uses transformer-based network to generate multiple latent future states simultaneously, combined with Mean-Variance Constrained evaluator that eliminates dependence on sequential visitation counts, enabling parallel expansion of entire subtrees.

Result: Achieves up to 11x speedup in wall-clock time compared to MuZero while maintaining sample efficiency in MiniGrid and LunarLander environments.

Conclusion: Parallel tree construction through transformer networks and MVC evaluation can substantially accelerate model-based reinforcement learning, making real-time decision-making in complex environments more practical.

Abstract: We present TransZero, a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm that
removes the sequential bottleneck in Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Unlike
MuZero, which constructs its search tree step by step using a recurrent
dynamics model, TransZero employs a transformer-based network to generate
multiple latent future states simultaneously. Combined with the Mean-Variance
Constrained (MVC) evaluator that eliminates dependence on inherently sequential
visitation counts, our approach enables the parallel expansion of entire
subtrees during planning. Experiments in MiniGrid and LunarLander show that
TransZero achieves up to an eleven-fold speedup in wall-clock time compared to
MuZero while maintaining sample efficiency. These results demonstrate that
parallel tree construction can substantially accelerate model-based
reinforcement learning, bringing real-time decision-making in complex
environments closer to practice. The code is publicly available on GitHub.

*Emre Sahinoglu,Shahin Shahrampour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Online Riemannian optimization on Hadamard manifolds using horospherical convexity (h-convexity) instead of geodesic convexity, achieving curvature-independent regret bounds matching Euclidean results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods using geodesic convexity suffer from poor regret bounds that scale with manifold curvature. H-convexity offers a way to overcome this limitation and achieve better performance.

Method: Riemannian online gradient descent for h-convex and strongly h-convex functions, with analysis on Hadamard manifolds. Validated on symmetric positive definite matrices with affine-invariant metric.

Result: Established O(√T) regret for h-convex functions and O(log(T)) regret for strongly h-convex functions - both curvature-independent and matching Euclidean bounds. Demonstrated practical applications in online Tyler's M-estimation and Fréchet mean computation.

Conclusion: H-convexity provides a superior framework for Riemannian online optimization, eliminating curvature dependence in regret bounds and achieving performance comparable to Euclidean settings.

Abstract: We study online Riemannian optimization on Hadamard manifolds under the
framework of horospherical convexity (h-convexity). Prior work mostly relies on
the geodesic convexity (g-convexity), leading to regret bounds scaling poorly
with the manifold curvature. To address this limitation, we analyze Riemannian
online gradient descent for h-convex and strongly h-convex functions and
establish $O(\sqrt{T})$ and $O(\log(T))$ regret guarantees, respectively. These
bounds are curvature-independent and match the results in the Euclidean
setting. We validate our approach with experiments on the manifold of symmetric
positive definite (SPD) matrices equipped with the affine-invariant metric. In
particular, we investigate online Tyler's $M$-estimation and online Fr\'echet

*David Schiff,Ofir Lindenbaum,Yonathan Efroni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TabPFN RL is a gradient-free deep RL framework that repurposes the meta-trained transformer TabPFN as a Q function approximator, eliminating backpropagation and achieving competitive performance on classic control tasks without hyperparameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gradient-based optimization in deep RL introduces sensitivity to hyperparameters, unstable training dynamics, and high computational costs. The authors aim to develop a gradient-free alternative that is more stable and computationally efficient.

Method: Repurposes TabPFN (a transformer pre-trained on millions of synthetic datasets) as a Q function approximator using in-context learning. Uses a high reward episode gate to retain only top 5% of trajectories due to fixed context budget. Eliminates backpropagation at both training and inference.

Result: Empirical evaluations show TabPFN RL matches or surpasses Deep Q Network performance on CartPole v1, MountainCar v0, and Acrobot v1 without gradient descent or extensive hyperparameter tuning.

Conclusion: TabPFN establishes prior-fitted networks as a viable foundation for fast and computationally efficient RL, opening new directions for gradient-free RL with large pre-trained transformers despite violating some independence assumptions.

Abstract: Gradient based optimization is fundamental to most modern deep reinforcement
learning algorithms, however, it introduces significant sensitivity to
hyperparameters, unstable training dynamics, and high computational costs. We
propose TabPFN RL, a novel gradient free deep RL framework that repurposes the
meta trained transformer TabPFN as a Q function approximator. Originally
developed for tabular classification, TabPFN is a transformer pre trained on
millions of synthetic datasets to perform inference on new unseen datasets via
in context learning. Given an in context dataset of sample label pairs and new
unlabeled data, it predicts the most likely labels in a single forward pass,
without gradient updates or task specific fine tuning. We use TabPFN to predict
Q values using inference only, thereby eliminating the need for back
propagation at both training and inference. To cope with the model's fixed
context budget, we design a high reward episode gate that retains only the top
5% of trajectories. Empirical evaluations on the Gymnasium classic control
suite demonstrate that TabPFN RL matches or surpasses Deep Q Network on
CartPole v1, MountainCar v0, and Acrobot v1, without applying gradient descent
or any extensive hyperparameter tuning. We discuss the theoretical aspects of
how bootstrapped targets and non stationary visitation distributions violate
the independence assumptions encoded in TabPFN's prior, yet the model retains a
surprising generalization capacity. We further formalize the intrinsic context
size limit of in context RL algorithms and propose principled truncation
strategies that enable continual learning when the context is full. Our results
establish prior fitted networks such as TabPFN as a viable foundation for fast
and computationally efficient RL, opening new directions for gradient free RL
with large pre trained transformers.

*Qiuhao Liu,Ling Li,Yao Lu,Qi Xuan,Zhaowei Zhu,Jiaheng Wei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SelectMix is a confidence-guided Mixup framework that selectively blends uncertain samples with confident peers using soft labels to improve generalization with noisy labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks memorize noisy labels, degrading generalization. Existing Mixup methods lack principled guidance on sample selection and mixing, propagating noise.

Method: Uses K-fold cross-validation for confidence-based mismatch analysis to identify noisy/ambiguous samples. Selectively blends uncertain samples with confident peers from potential classes. Employs soft labels derived from all classes involved in mixing.

Result: Outperforms strong baselines on multiple synthetic (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100) and real-world (CIFAR-N, MNIST, Clothing1M) benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: SelectMix effectively addresses noisy label learning through confidence-guided selective mixing and soft label alignment, demonstrating consistent performance improvements and robustness.

Abstract: Deep neural networks tend to memorize noisy labels, severely degrading their
generalization performance. Although Mixup has demonstrated effectiveness in
improving generalization and robustness, existing Mixup-based methods typically
perform indiscriminate mixing without principled guidance on sample selection
and mixing strategy, inadvertently propagating noisy supervision. To overcome
these limitations, we propose SelectMix, a confidence-guided mixing framework
explicitly tailored for noisy labels. SelectMix first identifies potentially
noisy or ambiguous samples through confidence based mismatch analysis using
K-fold cross-validation, then selectively blends identified uncertain samples
with confidently predicted peers from their potential classes. Furthermore,
SelectMix employs soft labels derived from all classes involved in the mixing
process, ensuring the labels accurately represent the composition of the mixed
samples, thus aligning supervision signals closely with the actual mixed
inputs. Through extensive theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations on
multiple synthetic (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100) and real-world
benchmark datasets (CIFAR-N, MNIST and Clothing1M), we demonstrate that
SelectMix consistently outperforms strong baseline methods, validating its
effectiveness and robustness in learning with noisy labels.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PINGS is a physics-informed neural network framework that enables single-step generative sampling (NFE=1) by approximating reverse-time probability-flow dynamics, achieving constant-time generation while preserving target distribution structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency of iterative sampling methods in diffusion models by developing a fast, single-pass generative sampling approach that maintains distributional accuracy.

Method: Trains a physics-informed neural network to approximate reverse-time probability-flow dynamics, creating a direct map from noise to target distribution with endpoint anchoring and PINN-style residual formulation.

Result: Achieves NFE=1 sampling with excellent distribution preservation (MMD²=1.88×10⁻²), generates 10⁴ samples in 16.54ms (vs 468-960ms for iterative methods), and demonstrates MSE down to O(10⁻⁵) on test problems.

Conclusion: PINGS provides a promising white-box, differentiable approach for fast generative sampling with potential applications in scientific simulation, outperforming iterative ODE solvers and other direct-map methods.

Abstract: We introduce PINGS (Physics-Informed Neural Network for Fast Generative
Sampling), a framework that amortizes diffusion sampling by training a
physics-informed network to approximate reverse-time probability-flow dynamics,
reducing sampling to a single forward pass (NFE = 1). As a proof of concept, we
learn a direct map from a 3D standard normal to a non-Gaussian Gaussian Mixture
Model (GMM). PINGS preserves the target's distributional structure
(multi-bandwidth kernel $MMD^2 = 1.88 \times 10^{-2}$ with small errors in
mean, covariance, skewness, and excess kurtosis) and achieves constant-time
generation: $10^4$ samples in $16.54 \pm 0.56$ millisecond on an RTX 3090,
versus 468-843 millisecond for DPM-Solver (10/20) and 960 millisecond for DDIM
(50) under matched conditions. We also sanity-check the
PINN/automatic-differentiation pipeline on a damped harmonic oscillator,
obtaining MSEs down to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$. Compared to fast but iterative
ODE solvers and direct-map families (Flow, Rectified-Flow, Consistency), PINGS
frames generative sampling as a PINN-style residual problem with endpoint
anchoring, yielding a white-box, differentiable map with NFE = 1. These
proof-of-concept results position PINGS as a promising route to fast,
function-based generative sampling with potential extensions to scientific
simulation (e.g., fast calorimetry).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CIFNet is a highly efficient class incremental learning method that combines frozen pre-trained features, compressed memory buffer, and one-layer classifier to prevent catastrophic forgetting with minimal computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address catastrophic forgetting in incremental learning while overcoming computational inefficiency and resource-intensive training in existing methods, particularly for resource-limited settings.

Method: Uses frozen pre-trained feature extractor (no fine-tuning), compressed data buffer for memory efficiency, and non-iterative one-layer neural network classifier that performs single-step optimization on fixed features.

Result: Achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing computational overhead and training time, effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting at classifier level.

Conclusion: CIFNet provides an efficient, sustainable solution for class incremental learning that makes the approach more accessible and practical for resource-constrained environments when pre-trained feature extractors are available.

Abstract: Incremental learning remains a critical challenge in machine learning, as
models often struggle with catastrophic forgetting -the tendency to lose
previously acquired knowledge when learning new information. These challenges
are even more pronounced in resource-limited settings. Many existing Class
Incremental Learning (CIL) methods achieve high accuracy by continually
adapting their feature representations; however, they often require substantial
computational resources and complex, iterative training procedures. This work
introduces CIFNet (Class Incremental and Frugal Network), a novel CIL approach
that addresses these limitations by offering a highly efficient and sustainable
solution. CIFNet's key innovation lies in its novel integration of several
existing, yet separately explored, components: a pre-trained and frozen feature
extractor, a compressed data buffer, and an efficient non-iterative one-layer
neural network for classification. A pre-trained and frozen feature extractor
eliminates computationally expensive fine-tuning of the backbone. This,
combined with a compressed buffer for efficient memory use, enables CIFNet to
perform efficient class-incremental learning through a single-step optimization
process on fixed features, minimizing computational overhead and training time
without requiring multiple weight updates. Experiments on benchmark datasets
confirm that CIFNet effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting at the
classifier level, achieving high accuracy comparable to that of existing
state-of-the-art methods, while substantially improving training efficiency and
sustainability. CIFNet represents a significant advancement in making
class-incremental learning more accessible and pragmatic in environments with
limited resources, especially when strong pre-trained feature extractors are
available.

TL;DR: Opal presents an operator view of RLHF with objectives as ladders of additive penalties and multiplicative pairwise weights, introduces GKPO as a canonical schema for RLHF methods, and provides tools for serialization and conversion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a unified framework for understanding and comparing different RLHF methods by expressing objectives through mathematical operators and establishing canonical representations.

Method: Uses operator ladders with additive penalties and multiplicative weights, introduces GKPO schema with JSON serialization, canonicalization rules, and hashing. Includes reduction laws and provides Python library with adapters for DPO and RRHF.

Result: Developed a canonical schema that can represent multiple RLHF methods (DPO, RRHF, ORPO), enables cross-method conversions when assumptions hold, and identifies non-reducibility cases through stress tests.

Conclusion: GKPO provides a standardized framework for RLHF methods with clear mathematical foundations, enabling better comparison, conversion, and identification of limitations across different preference optimization approaches.

Abstract: We present Opal, an operator view of reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF). Objectives are expressed as ladders of two primitives on a
base utility: additive penalties and multiplicative pairwise weights. We
describe a simple reduction law with if-and-only-if conditions: such ladders
collapse to a normal form on pairwise margins when the reference is fixed,
penalties are additive, and weights are independent of intermediate margins.
When these assumptions do not hold (reference shift, non-additive gates,
score-dependent weights), small examples demonstrate non-reducibility.
  Building on this view, we introduce GKPO (Generalized Kernel Preference
Object), a canonical schema in which many RLHF methods can be represented and,
when reducible, mapped back from. GKPO provides a standard JSON serialization,
canonicalization and hashing rules, and explicit flags with finite witnesses
when assumptions fail.
  We illustrate these ideas with GKPO examples for DPO, RRHF, and ORPO, along
with cross-method conversions (where assumptions permit) and minimal stress
tests (SHIFT/GATE/SCORE) that highlight non-reducibility. A lightweight Python
reference library accompanies the schema, implementing canonical hashing and
adapters for DPO and RRHF.

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs
in general domains such as programming and writing, and have demonstrated
strong potential in various scientific research scenarios. However, the
capabilities of AI models in the highly specialized field of materials
characterization and analysis have not yet been systematically or sufficiently

benchmark dataset specifically designed for material characterization
techniques. MatQnA includes ten mainstream characterization methods, such as
X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning

construct high-quality question-answer pairs, integrating both multiple-choice

*Ying Cao,Kun Yuan,Ali H. Sayed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Decentralized adversarial training algorithms escape local minima faster than centralized approaches when perturbation bounds are small and batch sizes are large, leading to flatter minima and better robustness in distributed multi-agent environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compare distributed adversarial training algorithms in multi-agent learning environments and understand how different strategies (centralized vs decentralized) affect model robustness through their ability to escape local minima and find flatter solutions.

Method: Developed a general theoretical framework to study escaping efficiency from local minima, analyzed centralized and decentralized strategies (consensus and diffusion), and conducted simulations to validate theoretical findings.

Result: Decentralized algorithms escape local minima faster than centralized approaches when perturbation bounds are small and batch sizes are large, but this advantage diminishes as perturbation bounds increase. Simulations confirmed these theoretical insights.

Conclusion: Decentralized adversarial training strategies show potential for enhancing model robustness in distributed settings, particularly under mild attack conditions, by favoring flatter minima through more efficient escape from local optima.

Abstract: Adversarial training has been widely studied in recent years due to its role
in improving model robustness against adversarial attacks. This paper focuses
on comparing different distributed adversarial training algorithms--including
centralized and decentralized strategies--within multi-agent learning
environments. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of model
flatness in determining robustness. To this end, we develop a general
theoretical framework to study the escaping efficiency of these algorithms from
local minima, which is closely related to the flatness of the resulting models.
We show that when the perturbation bound is sufficiently small (i.e., when the
attack strength is relatively mild) and a large batch size is used,
decentralized adversarial training algorithms--including consensus and
diffusion--are guaranteed to escape faster from local minima than the
centralized strategy, thereby favoring flatter minima. However, as the
perturbation bound increases, this trend may no longer hold. In the simulation
results, we illustrate our theoretical findings and systematically compare the
performance of models obtained through decentralized and centralized
adversarial training algorithms. The results highlight the potential of
decentralized strategies to enhance the robustness of models in distributed
settings.

TL;DR: BiLSTM-VHP is a lightweight bidirectional LSTM model that predicts virus hosts from 400-base nucleotide sequences with high accuracy for orthohantavirus (89.62%), rotavirus A (96.58%), and rabies lyssavirus (77.22%), outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zoonotic diseases from animals can cause severe outbreaks and disrupt human life. Fast and accurate prediction of virus hosts from nucleotide sequences can help prevent disease spread.

Method: Proposed BiLSTM-VHP architecture using bidirectional LSTM on nucleotide sequences of 400 bases length. Created three curated datasets with 8,575, 95,197, and 22,052 sequences divided into 9, 12, and 29 host classes respectively.

Result: Achieved prediction accuracy of 89.62% for orthohantavirus, 96.58% for rotavirus A, and 77.22% for rabies lyssavirus, outperforming previous studies. Performance assessed using confusion matrix, F-1 score, precision, recall, and microaverage AUC.

Conclusion: The BiLSTM-VHP model provides an effective lightweight solution for host prediction from viral nucleotide sequences, with potential applications in preventing zoonotic disease outbreaks through early detection and intervention.

Abstract: Recorded history shows the long coexistence of humans and animals, suggesting
it began much earlier. Despite some beneficial interdependence, many animals
carry viral diseases that can spread to humans. These diseases are known as
zoonotic diseases. Recent outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2, Monkeypox and swine flu
viruses have shown how these viruses can disrupt human life and cause death.
Fast and accurate predictions of the host from which the virus spreads can help
prevent these diseases from spreading. This work presents BiLSTM-VHP, a
lightweight bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM)-based architecture that
can predict the host from the nucleotide sequence of orthohantavirus, rabies
lyssavirus, and rotavirus A with high accuracy. The proposed model works with
nucleotide sequences of 400 bases in length and achieved a prediction accuracy
of 89.62% for orthohantavirus, 96.58% for rotavirus A, and 77.22% for rabies
lyssavirus outperforming previous studies. Moreover, performance of the model
is assessed using the confusion matrix, F-1 score, precision, recall,
microaverage AUC. In addition, we introduce three curated datasets of
orthohantavirus, rotavirus A, and rabies lyssavirus containing 8,575, 95,197,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the understanding of Linear Mode Connectivity from standard neural networks to Mixture-of-Experts architectures, which have different symmetries and optimization characteristics due to their expert-based structure and gating mechanisms.

Method: Systematic analysis of dense and sparse gating regimes, characterization of MoE symmetries through permutations of experts and gating functions, development of a matching algorithm for expert alignment, and empirical validation across diverse MoE configurations and datasets.

Result: The study confirms the existence of LMC in MoE architectures, demonstrating that independently trained MoE models can be connected via linear paths with consistently low loss after proper permutation alignment.

Conclusion: LMC exists in MoE architectures, providing fundamental insights into the functional landscape and optimization dynamics of these scalable deep learning models, with implications for model ensembling and generalization.

Abstract: Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC) is a notable phenomenon in the loss landscapes
of neural networks, wherein independently trained models have been observed to
be connected--up to permutation symmetries--by linear paths in parameter space
along which the loss remains consistently low. This observation challenges
classical views of non-convex optimization and has implications for model
ensembling, generalization, and our understanding of neural loss geometry.
Inspired by recent studies on LMC in standard neural networks, we
systematically investigate this phenomenon within Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architectures--a class of models known for their scalability and computational
efficiency, which combine traditional neural networks--referred to as
experts--through a learnable gating mechanism. We begin by conducting a
comprehensive analysis of both dense and sparse gating regimes, demonstrating
that the symmetries inherent to MoE architectures are fully characterized by
permutations acting on both the expert components and the gating function.
Building on these foundational findings, we propose a matching algorithm that
enables alignment between independently trained MoEs, thereby facilitating the
discovery of LMC. Finally, we empirically validate the presence of LMC using
our proposed algorithm across diverse MoE configurations--including dense,
sparse, and shared-expert variants--under a wide range of model settings and
datasets of varying scales and modalities. Our results confirm the existence of
LMC in MoE architectures and offer fundamental insights into the functional
landscape and optimization dynamics of deep learning models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce and study the problem of online omniprediction with long-term
constraints. At each round, a forecaster is tasked with generating predictions
for an underlying (adaptively, adversarially chosen) state that are broadcast
to a collection of downstream agents, who must each choose an action. Each of
the downstream agents has both a utility function mapping actions and state to
utilities, and a vector-valued constraint function mapping actions and states
to vector-valued costs. The utility and constraint functions can arbitrarily
differ across downstream agents. Their goal is to choose actions that guarantee
themselves no regret while simultaneously guaranteeing that they do not
cumulatively violate the constraints across time. We show how to make a single
set of predictions so that each of the downstream agents can guarantee this by
acting as a simple function of the predictions, guaranteeing each of them
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret and $O(1)$ cumulative constraint violation. We
also show how to extend our guarantees to arbitrary intersecting contextually
defined \emph{subsequences}, guaranteeing each agent both regret and constraint
violation bounds not just marginally, but simultaneously on each subsequence,
against a benchmark set of actions simultaneously tailored to each subsequence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing resources lack datasets that integrate behavioral descriptors with complementary modalities like facial attributes and biographical information, limiting comprehensive analysis of human behavior traits.

Method: Created two datasets: CelebPersona (9,444 public figures) and AthlePersona (4,181 athletes). Used three high-performing LLMs to infer behavioral traits, combined with facial imagery and structured biographical features. Applied statistical independence tests and introduced a novel causal representation learning framework with theoretical identifiability guarantees.

Result: The paper presents PersonaX datasets and demonstrates the effectiveness of their approach through experiments on both synthetic and real-world data, enabling multimodal trait analysis and causal reasoning.

Conclusion: PersonaX establishes a foundation for studying LLM-inferred behavioral traits in conjunction with visual and biographical attributes, advancing multimodal trait analysis and causal reasoning in human behavior understanding.

Abstract: Understanding human behavior traits is central to applications in
human-computer interaction, computational social science, and personalized AI
systems. Such understanding often requires integrating multiple modalities to
capture nuanced patterns and relationships. However, existing resources rarely
provide datasets that combine behavioral descriptors with complementary
modalities such as facial attributes and biographical information. To address
this gap, we present PersonaX, a curated collection of multimodal datasets
designed to enable comprehensive analysis of public traits across modalities.
PersonaX consists of (1) CelebPersona, featuring 9444 public figures from
diverse occupations, and (2) AthlePersona, covering 4181 professional athletes
across 7 major sports leagues. Each dataset includes behavioral trait
assessments inferred by three high-performing large language models, alongside
facial imagery and structured biographical features. We analyze PersonaX at two
complementary levels. First, we abstract high-level trait scores from text
descriptions and apply five statistical independence tests to examine their
relationships with other modalities. Second, we introduce a novel causal
representation learning (CRL) framework tailored to multimodal and
multi-measurement data, providing theoretical identifiability guarantees.
Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach. By unifying structured and unstructured analysis, PersonaX
establishes a foundation for studying LLM-inferred behavioral traits in
conjunction with visual and biographical attributes, advancing multimodal trait
analysis and causal reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world RL applications (healthcare, robotics, finance) face non-stationary environments where transition probabilities or reward functions evolve over time, causing model drift that standard RL agents cannot handle.

Method: Introduces edit operation-based measures to quantify deviations between state-action trajectories generated under stationary vs. perturbed conditions, analyzing distributional changes in agent behavior sequences.

Result: The measures effectively distinguish drifted from non-drifted scenarios even under varying noise levels, demonstrating practical utility for drift detection.

Conclusion: Provides a practical tool for detecting model drift in non-stationary RL environments, addressing a critical limitation of traditional RL approaches in real-world applications.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) agents typically assume stationary environment
dynamics. Yet in real-world applications such as healthcare, robotics, and
finance, transition probabilities or reward functions may evolve, leading to
model drift. This paper proposes a novel framework to detect such drifts by
analyzing the distributional changes in sequences of agent behavior.
Specifically, we introduce a suite of edit operation-based measures to quantify
deviations between state-action trajectories generated under stationary and
perturbed conditions. Our experiments demonstrate that these measures can
effectively distinguish drifted from non-drifted scenarios, even under varying
levels of noise, providing a practical tool for drift detection in

Motivation: Address the challenge of musical data representation for AI analysis and develop a method to distinguish human-composed music from rule-based and LLM-generated music.

Method: Developed YNote music notation system, framed as text classification problem using TF-IDF for feature extraction and SMOTE for data imbalance handling.

Result: Achieved 98.25% accuracy in classifying music origins (human, rule-based algorithm, or LLM), demonstrating YNote retains sufficient stylistic information.

Conclusion: YNote effectively captures musical style differences and reveals unique technological fingerprints of different AI generation methods, providing a tool for tracing AI-generated content origins.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), AI-driven music
generation has become a vibrant and fruitful area of research. However, the
representation of musical data remains a significant challenge. To address
this, a novel, machine-learning-friendly music notation system, YNote, was
developed. This study leverages YNote to train an effective classification
model capable of distinguishing whether a piece of music was composed by a
human (Native), a rule-based algorithm (Algorithm Generated), or an LLM (LLM
Generated). We frame this as a text classification problem, applying the Term
Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) algorithm to extract structural
features from YNote sequences and using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling
Technique (SMOTE) to address data imbalance. The resulting model achieves an
accuracy of 98.25%, successfully demonstrating that YNote retains sufficient
stylistic information for analysis. More importantly, the model can identify
the unique " technological fingerprints " left by different AI generation
techniques, providing a powerful tool for tracing the origins of AI-generated

Abstract: The petroleum industry faces unprecedented challenges in reservoir
management, requiring rapid integration of complex multimodal datasets for
real-time decision support. This study presents a novel integrated framework
combining state-of-the-art large language models (GPT-4o, Claude 4 Sonnet,
Gemini 2.5 Pro) with advanced prompt engineering techniques and multimodal data
fusion for comprehensive reservoir analysis. The framework implements
domain-specific retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with over 50,000 petroleum
engineering documents, chain-of-thought reasoning, and few-shot learning for
rapid field adaptation. Multimodal integration processes seismic
interpretations, well logs, and production data through specialized AI models
with vision transformers. Field validation across 15 diverse reservoir
environments demonstrates exceptional performance: 94.2% reservoir
characterization accuracy, 87.6% production forecasting precision, and 91.4%
well placement optimization success rate. The system achieves sub-second
response times while maintaining 96.2% safety reliability with no high-risk
incidents during evaluation. Economic analysis reveals 62-78% cost reductions
(mean 72%) relative to traditional methods with 8-month payback period.
Few-shot learning reduces field adaptation time by 72%, while automated prompt
optimization achieves 89% improvement in reasoning quality. The framework
processed real-time data streams with 96.2% anomaly detection accuracy and
reduced environmental incidents by 45%. We provide detailed experimental
protocols, baseline comparisons, ablation studies, and statistical significance
testing to ensure reproducibility. This research demonstrates practical
integration of cutting-edge AI technologies with petroleum domain expertise for
enhanced operational efficiency, safety, and economic performance.

### [370] [Enhancing ML Models Interpretability for Credit Scoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11389)
*Sagi Schwartz,Qinling Wang,Fang Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid approach using XAI for feature selection to create transparent glass-box models that maintain predictive performance while meeting regulatory requirements for credit scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models outperform traditional methods but lack transparency needed for regulated environments like banking. Post-hoc XAI interpretations don't produce sufficiently lightweight or transparent models for regulatory compliance.

Method: Post-hoc interpretations of black-box models guide feature selection, followed by training glass-box models (EBM and PLTR). Uses SHAP for feature selection and XGBoost as benchmark. Includes model refinement with feature interaction analysis, correlation checks, and expert input.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to black-box benchmark while using only 10 features (88.5% reduction). Demonstrates on Lending Club dataset.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach successfully balances predictive power and transparency, making it suitable for regulated credit scoring environments while maintaining model performance.

Abstract: Predicting default is essential for banks to ensure profitability and
financial stability. While modern machine learning methods often outperform
traditional regression techniques, their lack of transparency limits their use
in regulated environments. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has
emerged as a solution in domains like credit scoring. However, most XAI
research focuses on post-hoc interpretation of black-box models, which does not
produce models lightweight or transparent enough to meet regulatory
requirements, such as those for Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) models.
  This paper proposes a hybrid approach: post-hoc interpretations of black-box
models guide feature selection, followed by training glass-box models that
maintain both predictive power and transparency.
  Using the Lending Club dataset, we demonstrate that this approach achieves
performance comparable to a benchmark black-box model while using only 10
features - an 88.5% reduction. In our example, SHapley Additive exPlanations
(SHAP) is used for feature selection, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
serves as the benchmark and the base black-box model, and Explainable Boosting
Machine (EBM) and Penalized Logistic Tree Regression (PLTR) are the
investigated glass-box models.
  We also show that model refinement using feature interaction analysis,
correlation checks, and expert input can further enhance model interpretability
and robustness.

*Anusha Sinha,Keltin Grimes,James Lucassen,Michael Feffer,Nathan VanHoudnos,Zhiwei Steven Wu,Hoda Heidari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AI red-teaming should be viewed as a domain-specific evolution of cyber red-teaming, where merging AI and cyber red teams creates a more robust security ecosystem to address AI system vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As enterprise systems increasingly adopt AI, red-teaming needs to evolve to address unique AI vulnerabilities and risks that traditional cyber red-teaming doesn't adequately cover.

Method: Proposes framing AI red-teaming as an evolution of cyber red-teaming, enabling cyber teams to recognize AI-specific risks and failure modes, while allowing AI teams to leverage established cybersecurity structures and engagement patterns.

Result: The integration allows cyber teams to better evaluate AI systems by understanding new risks and unpatchable bugs, while AI teams gain access to tested adversary emulation structures and formal engagement rules.

Conclusion: Merging AI and cyber red teams creates a robust security ecosystem that best positions the community to adapt to rapidly changing AI threat landscapes through mutual learning and tooling maturation.

Abstract: A red team simulates adversary attacks to help defenders find effective
strategies to defend their systems in a real-world operational setting. As more
enterprise systems adopt AI, red-teaming will need to evolve to address the
unique vulnerabilities and risks posed by AI systems. We take the position that
AI systems can be more effectively red-teamed if AI red-teaming is recognized
as a domain-specific evolution of cyber red-teaming. Specifically, we argue
that existing Cyber Red Teams who adopt this framing will be able to better
evaluate systems with AI components by recognizing that AI poses new risks, has
new failure modes to exploit, and often contains unpatchable bugs that
re-prioritize disclosure and mitigation strategies. Similarly, adopting a
cybersecurity framing will allow existing AI Red Teams to leverage a
well-tested structure to emulate realistic adversaries, promote mutual
accountability with formal rules of engagement, and provide a pattern to mature
the tooling necessary for repeatable, scalable engagements. In these ways, the
merging of AI and Cyber Red Teams will create a robust security ecosystem and
best position the community to adapt to the rapidly changing threat landscape.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI benchmarks like MLPerf struggle to keep pace with rapidly evolving AI landscape, making it difficult to support informed deployment, optimization, and co-design decisions for AI systems.

Method: Developed FlexBench as a modular extension integrated with HuggingFace, collecting benchmarking results and metadata into an Open MLPerf Dataset for collaborative curation and predictive modeling.

Result: Successfully validated FlexBench through MLPerf Inference submissions, including evaluations of DeepSeek R1 and LLaMA 3.3 on commodity servers.

Conclusion: Enables practitioners to make cost-effective AI deployment decisions that reflect their available resources, requirements, and constraints through continuous benchmarking as an AI task.

Abstract: Existing AI system benchmarks such as MLPerf often struggle to keep pace with
the rapidly evolving AI landscape, making it difficult to support informed
deployment, optimization, and co-design decisions for AI systems. We suggest
that benchmarking itself can be framed as an AI task - one in which models are
continuously evaluated and optimized across diverse datasets, software, and
hardware, using key metrics such as accuracy, latency, throughput, energy
consumption, and cost. To support this perspective, we present FlexBench: a
modular extension of the MLPerf LLM inference benchmark, integrated with
HuggingFace and designed to provide relevant and actionable insights.
Benchmarking results and metadata are collected into an Open MLPerf Dataset,
which can be collaboratively curated, extended, and leveraged for predictive
modeling and feature engineering. We successfully validated the FlexBench
concept through MLPerf Inference submissions, including evaluations of DeepSeek
R1 and LLaMA 3.3 on commodity servers. The broader objective is to enable
practitioners to make cost-effective AI deployment decisions that reflect their
available resources, requirements, and constraints.

### [373] [Long-time dynamics and universality of nonconvex gradient descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11426)
*Qiyang Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: General framework for analyzing nonconvex gradient descent in single-index models with large aspect ratios, showing concentration around deterministic trajectories and revealing implicit regularization effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the long-time trajectory behavior of nonconvex gradient descent in generalized single-index models, particularly in the large aspect ratio regime where traditional analysis may fail.

Method: Develops a general approach showing gradient descent iterates concentrate around a deterministic 'Gaussian theoretical gradient descent' vector, tracked by a state evolution system of two recursive scalar equations. The analysis holds universally for broad design matrices and long time horizons.

Result: Proves universal concentration guarantees, reveals implicit regularization effects (iterates become approximately data-independent and feature-incoherent), demonstrates global convergence for structured link functions, and establishes universality in phase retrieval. Also develops data-free algorithm for estimating state evolution parameters.

Conclusion: Provides a comprehensive theoretical framework for analyzing gradient descent in nonconvex settings, revealing fundamental properties like implicit regularization and enabling practical applications such as hyperparameter tuning through data-free state evolution estimation.

Abstract: This paper develops a general approach to characterize the long-time
trajectory behavior of nonconvex gradient descent in generalized single-index
models in the large aspect ratio regime. In this regime, we show that for each
iteration the gradient descent iterate concentrates around a deterministic
vector called the `Gaussian theoretical gradient descent', whose dynamics can
be tracked by a state evolution system of two recursive equations for two
scalars. Our concentration guarantees hold universally for a broad class of
design matrices and remain valid over long time horizons until algorithmic
convergence or divergence occurs. Moreover, our approach reveals that gradient
descent iterates are in general approximately independent of the data and
strongly incoherent with the feature vectors, a phenomenon previously known as
the `implicit regularization' effect of gradient descent in specific models
under Gaussian data.
  As an illustration of the utility of our general theory, we present two
applications of different natures in the regression setting. In the first, we
prove global convergence of nonconvex gradient descent with general independent
initialization for a broad class of structured link functions, and establish
universality of randomly initialized gradient descent in phase retrieval for
large aspect ratios. In the second, we develop a data-free iterative algorithm
for estimating state evolution parameters along the entire gradient descent
trajectory, thereby providing a low-cost yet statistically valid tool for
practical tasks such as hyperparameter tuning and runtime determination.
  As a by-product of our analysis, we show that in the large aspect ratio
regime, the Gaussian theoretical gradient descent coincides with a recent line
of dynamical mean-field theory for gradient descent over the constant-time
horizon.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep learning framework for EV crash severity prediction using Texas crash data (2017-2023), identifying key predictors and applying SMOTEENN resampling to benchmark TabPFN, MambaNet, and MambaAttention models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve crash severity prediction in electric vehicle collisions using advanced deep tabular learning methods to enable better safety interventions.

Method: Analyzed 23,301 EV crash records, used XGBoost/Random Forest for feature importance, applied SMOTEENN resampling for class imbalance, and benchmarked three deep tabular models (TabPFN, MambaNet, MambaAttention).

Result: TabPFN showed strong generalization, but MambaAttention achieved superior performance in classifying severe injury cases due to its attention-based feature reweighting capability.

Conclusion: Deep tabular architectures show significant potential for improving EV crash severity prediction and enabling data-driven safety interventions in electric vehicle crash scenarios.

Abstract: This study presents a deep tabular learning framework for predicting crash
severity in electric vehicle (EV) collisions using real-world crash data from
Texas (2017-2023). After filtering for electric-only vehicles, 23,301
EV-involved crash records were analyzed. Feature importance techniques using
XGBoost and Random Forest identified intersection relation, first harmful
event, person age, crash speed limit, and day of week as the top predictors,
along with advanced safety features like automatic emergency braking. To
address class imbalance, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique and Edited
Nearest Neighbors (SMOTEENN) resampling was applied. Three state-of-the-art
deep tabular models, TabPFN, MambaNet, and MambaAttention, were benchmarked for
severity prediction. While TabPFN demonstrated strong generalization,
MambaAttention achieved superior performance in classifying severe injury cases
due to its attention-based feature reweighting. The findings highlight the
potential of deep tabular architectures for improving crash severity prediction
and enabling data-driven safety interventions in EV crash contexts.

*Yining Lu,Zilong Wang,Shiyang Li,Xin Liu,Changlong Yu,Qingyu Yin,Zhan Shi,Zixuan Zhang,Meng Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Dynamic reward weighting for multi-objective RL that adaptively adjusts weights during training, outperforming fixed-weight approaches in finding Pareto optimal solutions for LLM alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed-weight linear scalarization fails to capture non-convex Pareto fronts in multi-objective RL, especially critical for online preference alignment of large language models where stochastic trajectories create highly non-linear mappings.

Method: Two approaches: (1) hypervolume-guided weight adaptation and (2) gradient-based weight optimization, both designed to continuously balance and prioritize objectives during online RL training.

Result: Compatible with common online RL algorithms (GRPO, REINFORCE, RLOO), effective across multiple mathematical reasoning datasets, and applicable to different model families, achieving Pareto dominant solutions with fewer training steps.

Conclusion: Dynamic reward weighting provides a versatile toolkit for online multi-objective alignment, consistently outperforming fixed-weight linear scalarization baselines in exploring Pareto fronts.

Abstract: Prior works in multi-objective reinforcement learning typically use linear
reward scalarization with fixed weights, which provably fail to capture
non-convex Pareto fronts and thus yield suboptimal results. This limitation
becomes especially critical in online preference alignment for large language
models. Here, stochastic trajectories generated by parameterized policies
create highly non-linear and non-convex mappings from parameters to objectives
that no single static weighting scheme can find optimal trade-offs. We address
this limitation by introducing dynamic reward weighting, which adaptively
adjusts reward weights during the online reinforcement learning process. Unlike
existing approaches that rely on fixed-weight interpolation, our dynamic
weighting continuously balances and prioritizes objectives in training,
facilitating effective exploration of Pareto fronts in objective space. We
introduce two approaches of increasing sophistication and generalizability: (1)
hypervolume-guided weight adaptation and (2) gradient-based weight
optimization, offering a versatile toolkit for online multi-objective
alignment. Our extensive experiments demonstrate their compatibility with
commonly used online reinforcement learning algorithms (including GRPO,
REINFORCE, and RLOO), effectiveness across multiple mathematical reasoning
datasets, and applicability to different model families, consistently achieving
Pareto dominant solutions with fewer training steps than fixed-weight linear
scalarization baselines.

TL;DR: Machine learning pipeline using unsupervised deep embedded clustering and supervised graph neural networks to identify novel drug-disease links from multi-omic data with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drug repurposing has been economically challenging, and existing studies rely on simplified datasets with known drug-disease similarities, limiting discovery of novel connections.

Method: Combines unsupervised deep embedded clustering (autoencoder and cluster training) to compress omic data into latent embeddings, then uses supervised graph neural network link prediction to identify new drug-disease relationships.

Result: 9,022 drugs partitioned into 35 clusters with mean silhouette score of 0.8550; GNN achieved prediction accuracy of 0.901, ROC AUC of 0.960, F1-Score of 0.901; generated 477 high-probability drug-disease links exceeding 99% confidence.

Conclusion: The approach provides new drug-disease link prospects across unrelated disease domains and advances machine learning applications in drug repurposing studies.

Abstract: Drug repurposing has historically been an economically infeasible process for
identifying novel uses for abandoned drugs. Modern machine learning has enabled
the identification of complex biochemical intricacies in candidate drugs;
however, many studies rely on simplified datasets with known drug-disease
similarities. We propose a machine learning pipeline that uses unsupervised
deep embedded clustering, combined with supervised graph neural network link
prediction to identify new drug-disease links from multi-omic data.
Unsupervised autoencoder and cluster training reduced the dimensionality of
omic data into a compressed latent embedding. A total of 9,022 unique drugs
were partitioned into 35 clusters with a mean silhouette score of 0.8550. Graph
neural networks achieved strong statistical performance, with a prediction
accuracy of 0.901, receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of
0.960, and F1-Score of 0.901. A ranked list comprised of 477 per-cluster link
probabilities exceeding 99 percent was generated. This study could provide new
drug-disease link prospects across unrelated disease domains, while advancing
the understanding of machine learning in drug repurposing studies.

*Divya Jyoti Bajpai,Manjesh Kumar Hanawal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPEED combines Early Exit DNNs with Selective Prediction using Deferral Classifiers to identify hard samples early, preventing wrong predictions while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overconfidence in DNNs causes unreliable early exits in critical applications. Current EE strategies lack trustworthiness due to premature exits of hard samples.

Method: Uses Deferral Classifiers at each layer to assess sample hardness before allowing early exits. Hard samples are deferred to expert layers instead of exiting prematurely.

Result: 50% reduction in wrong prediction risk with 2.05× speedup compared to final layer inference. Improves both accuracy and latency simultaneously.

Conclusion: Combining selective prediction with early exit strategies enhances trustworthiness while maintaining computational efficiency in critical DNN applications.

Abstract: Inference latency and trustworthiness of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are the
bottlenecks in deploying them in critical applications like sensitive tasks.
Early Exit (EE) DNNs overcome the latency issues by allowing samples to exit
from intermediary layers if they attain `high' confidence scores on the
predicted class. However, the DNNs are known to exhibit overconfidence, which
can lead to many samples exiting early and render EE strategies untrustworthy.
We use Selective Prediction (SP) to overcome this issue by checking the
`hardness' of the samples rather than just relying on the confidence score
alone. We propose SPEED, a novel approach that uses Deferral Classifiers (DCs)
at each layer to check the hardness of samples before performing EEs.
Specifically, the DCs identify if a sample is hard to predict at an
intermediary layer, leading to hallucination, and defer it to an expert. Early
detection of hard samples for inference prevents the wastage of computational
resources and improves trust by deferring the hard samples to the expert. We
demonstrate that EE aided with SP improves both accuracy and latency. Our
method minimizes the risk of wrong prediction by $50\%$ with a speedup of
$2.05\times$ as compared to the final layer. The anonymized source code is

*Jing Zou,Shungeng Zhang,Meikang Qiu,Chong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DARD method distills adversarial robustness from large teacher models to compact student models, outperforming standard adversarial training with better robustness and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and while adversarial training improves robustness, it degrades performance on clean data. Larger models show better robustness, so this work aims to transfer that robustness to smaller models.

Method: Proposed Dice Adversarial Robustness Distillation (DARD) for transferring robustness through knowledge distillation, and Dice Projected Gradient Descent (DPGD) for optimized adversarial attack generation.

Result: Extensive experiments show DARD consistently outperforms adversarially trained networks with same architecture, achieving superior robustness and standard accuracy.

Conclusion: Robustness can be systematically distilled from large teacher models to compact student models, providing an effective defense against adversarial attacks without sacrificing clean data performance.

Abstract: Deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, posing critical
security challenges in real-world applications. While Adversarial Training (AT
) is a widely adopted defense mechanism to enhance robustness, it often incurs
a trade-off by degrading performance on unperturbed, natural data. Recent
efforts have highlighted that larger models exhibit enhanced robustness over
their smaller counterparts. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that such
robustness can be systematically distilled from large teacher models into
compact student models. To achieve better performance, we introduce Dice
Adversarial Robustness Distillation (DARD), a novel method designed to transfer
robustness through a tailored knowledge distillation paradigm. Additionally, we
propose Dice Projected Gradient Descent (DPGD), an adversarial example
generalization method optimized for effective attack. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that the DARD approach consistently outperforms adversarially
trained networks with the same architecture, achieving superior robustness and
standard accuracy.

TL;DR: Semi-online RL bridges offline and online RL for GUI agents by simulating online training on offline trajectories with adaptive patch modules and multi-level advantage optimization, achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GUI agent approaches face a dilemma: offline RL lacks trajectory-level rewards for multi-step tasks, while online RL suffers from sparse rewards and high deployment costs.

Method: Semi-online RL simulates online RL on offline trajectories using a Patch Module to recover rollout-expert divergence, introduces discounted future returns, and optimizes policy with weighted step-level and episode-level advantages.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance among 7B models across four benchmarks (+12.0% on AndroidWorld, +23.8% on AITW), with significant improvements over base models.

Conclusion: The approach successfully bridges the gap between offline training efficiency and online multi-turn reasoning, demonstrating substantial progress in GUI agent automation.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have demonstrated remarkable progress
in automating complex user interface interactions through reinforcement
learning. However, current approaches face a fundamental dilemma: offline RL
enables stable training on pre-collected trajectories, but struggles with
multi-step task execution for lack of trajectory-level reward signals; online
RL captures these signals through environment interaction, but suffers from
sparse rewards and prohibitive deployment costs. To address it, we present
Semi-online Reinforcement Learning, a novel paradigm that simulates online RL
on offline trajectories. During each rollout process, we preserve the original
model output within the multi-turn dialogue, where a Patch Module adaptively
recovers the divergence between rollout and expert trajectories. To capture
long-term training signals, Semi-online RL introduces discounted future returns
into the reward computation and optimizes the policy with weighted step-level
and episode-level advantages. We further introduce Semi-Online Performance
(SOP), a metric that aligns better with true online performance, serving as a
practical and effective proxy for real-world evaluation. Experiments show that
ours Semi-online RL achieves SOTA performance among 7B models across four
dynamic benchmarks, with significant gains over the base model (e.g., +12.0% on
AndroidWorld, +23.8% on AITW), demonstrating significant progress in bridging
the gap between offline training efficiency and online multi-turn reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many real-world signals are inherently sparse and can be efficiently represented with fewer components than their original space requires, enabling more efficient signal acquisition and processing.

Method: Mathematical formulation of compressed sensing principles, analysis of its logic and potential pathologies, and application to real-world signal processing scenarios.

Result: The paper demonstrates that compressed sensing provides a theoretical framework and practical approach for reconstructing signals from limited measurements by exploiting sparsity properties.

Conclusion: Compressed sensing offers a powerful signal processing technique that can significantly reduce measurement requirements while maintaining accurate signal reconstruction capabilities for sparse real-world signals.

Abstract: Compressed sensing is a signal processing technique that allows for the
reconstruction of a signal from a small set of measurements. The key idea
behind compressed sensing is that many real-world signals are inherently

with only a few components compared to their original space representation. In
this paper we will explore the mathematical formulation behind compressed
sensing, its logic and pathologies, and apply compressed sensing to real world

*Yuan Gao,Xuelong Wang,Zhenguo Dong,Yong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DAPNet is a Mixture-of-Experts framework that integrates temporal periodic analysis, dynamic cross-variable correlation modeling, and hybrid temporal feature extraction to address the trade-off between capturing temporal patterns and variable dependencies in network state classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning models struggle to capture both temporal periodicities and dynamic variable dependencies simultaneously. Temporal-focused models overlook variable dependencies, while dependency-focused models miss fine-grained temporal details.

Method: DAPNet uses a Mixture-of-Experts architecture with three specialized networks for periodic analysis, dynamic cross-variable correlation, and hybrid temporal feature extraction. A learnable gating network dynamically weights expert outputs, and a hybrid regularization loss addresses class imbalance.

Result: Extensive experiments on CICIDS2017/2018 datasets show higher accuracy for network intrusion detection. Evaluation on ten UEA benchmark datasets demonstrates the framework's generalizability.

Conclusion: DAPNet effectively addresses the temporal-dependency trade-off in network state classification, providing a specialized framework with improved accuracy and generalizability across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Effective network state classification is a primary task for ensuring network
security and optimizing performance. Existing deep learning models have shown
considerable progress in this area. Some methods excel at analyzing the complex
temporal periodicities found in traffic data, while graph-based approaches are
adept at modeling the dynamic dependencies between different variables.
However, a key trade-off remains, as these methods struggle to capture both
characteristics simultaneously. Models focused on temporal patterns often
overlook crucial variable dependencies, whereas those centered on dependencies
may fail to capture fine-grained temporal details. To address this trade-off,
we introduce DAPNet, a framework based on a Mixture-of-Experts architecture.
DAPNet integrates three specialized networks for periodic analysis, dynamic
cross-variable correlation modeling, and hybrid temporal feature extraction. A
learnable gating network dynamically assigns weights to experts based on the
input sample and computes a weighted fusion of their outputs. Furthermore, a
hybrid regularization loss function ensures stable training and addresses the
common issue of class imbalance. Extensive experiments on two large-scale
network intrusion detection datasets (CICIDS2017/2018) validate DAPNet's higher
accuracy for its target application. The generalizability of the architectural
design is evaluated across ten public UEA benchmark datasets, positioning
DAPNet as a specialized framework for network state classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reservoir networks are efficient for time series processing but their topology-performance relationship is hard to analyze due to lack of mathematical tools.

Method: Apply persistent GLMY homology theory to study reservoir topology, develop optimization method by modifying minimal representative cycles of one-dimensional GLMY homology groups.

Result: Found that reservoir performance is closely related to one-dimensional GLMY homology groups. Performance is jointly influenced by reservoir structure and dataset periodicity.

Conclusion: Persistent GLMY homology provides effective mathematical framework for analyzing and optimizing reservoir network topology to improve time series processing performance.

Abstract: Reservoir is an efficient network for time series processing. It is well
known that network structure is one of the determinants of its performance.
However, the topology structure of reservoirs, as well as their performance, is
hard to analyzed, due to the lack of suitable mathematical tools. In this
paper, we study the topology structure of reservoirs using persistent GLMY
homology theory, and develop a method to improve its performance. Specifically,
it is found that the reservoir performance is closely related to the
one-dimensional GLMY homology groups. Then, we develop a reservoir structure
optimization method by modifying the minimal representative cycles of
one-dimensional GLMY homology groups. Finally, by experiments, it is validated
that the performance of reservoirs is jointly influenced by the reservoir
structure and the periodicity of the dataset.

### [384] [Inducing Uncertainty for Test-Time Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11625)
*Muhammad H. Ashiq,Peter Triantafillou,Hung Yun Tseng,Grigoris G. Chrysos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unlearning fails to protect against test-time privacy threats where adversaries exploit confident predictions on unlearned data. The paper introduces a weight perturbation algorithm that induces maximal uncertainty on protected instances while maintaining accuracy on other data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unlearning methods leave models vulnerable to test-time privacy attacks where adversaries can use confident predictions on unlearned/obsolete data to harm users, even after data removal.

Method: Developed an algorithm that perturbs model weights to maximize uncertainty on protected instances while preserving utility. Uses Pareto optimal finetuning and provides a certifiable approximation algorithm with (ε, δ) guarantees without convexity assumptions.

Result: Achieves >3× stronger uncertainty than pretraining with <0.2% accuracy drops on various image recognition benchmarks. Provides tight, non-vacuous bounds on privacy-utility tradeoff.

Conclusion: The framework offers effective protection against test-time privacy threats, providing additional security for end users beyond traditional unlearning approaches.

Abstract: Unlearning is the predominant method for removing the influence of data in
machine learning models. However, even after unlearning, models often continue
to produce the same predictions on the unlearned data with high confidence.
This persistent behavior can be exploited by adversaries using confident model
predictions on incorrect or obsolete data to harm users. We call this threat
model, which unlearning fails to protect against, *test-time privacy*. In
particular, an adversary with full model access can bypass any naive defenses
which ensure test-time privacy. To address this threat, we introduce an
algorithm which perturbs model weights to induce maximal uncertainty on
protected instances while preserving accuracy on the rest of the instances. Our
core algorithm is based on finetuning with a Pareto optimal objective that
explicitly balances test-time privacy against utility. We also provide a
certifiable approximation algorithm which achieves $(\varepsilon, \delta)$
guarantees without convexity assumptions. We then prove a tight, non-vacuous
bound that characterizes the privacy-utility tradeoff that our algorithms
incur. Empirically, our method obtains $>3\times$ stronger uncertainty than
pretraining with $<0.2\%$ drops in accuracy on various image recognition
benchmarks. Altogether, this framework provides a tool to guarantee additional
protection to end users.

*Jiacheng Liu,Chang Zou,Yuanhuiyi Lyu,Fei Ren,Shaobo Wang,Kaixin Li,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SpeCa introduces speculative sampling to diffusion models, enabling 6-7x acceleration with minimal quality degradation through forecast-then-verify approach and adaptive computation allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models face computational bottlenecks due to strict temporal dependencies and intensive forward passes at each denoising step, preventing real-time applications.

Method: Speculative sampling predicts intermediate features for future timesteps based on reference timesteps, with parameter-free verification and sample-adaptive computation allocation.

Result: 6.34x acceleration on FLUX (5.5% quality drop), 7.3x speedup on DiT with preserved fidelity, 79.84% VBench score at 6.1x acceleration for HunyuanVideo, with verification overhead of only 1.67%-3.5%.

Conclusion: SpeCa establishes a new paradigm for efficient diffusion model inference, maintaining generation quality even at aggressive acceleration ratios through speculative sampling and adaptive computation.

Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized high-fidelity image and video synthesis,
yet their computational demands remain prohibitive for real-time applications.
These models face two fundamental challenges: strict temporal dependencies
preventing parallelization, and computationally intensive forward passes
required at each denoising step. Drawing inspiration from speculative decoding
in large language models, we present SpeCa, a novel 'Forecast-then-verify'
acceleration framework that effectively addresses both limitations. SpeCa's
core innovation lies in introducing Speculative Sampling to diffusion models,
predicting intermediate features for subsequent timesteps based on fully
computed reference timesteps. Our approach implements a parameter-free
verification mechanism that efficiently evaluates prediction reliability,
enabling real-time decisions to accept or reject each prediction while
incurring negligible computational overhead. Furthermore, SpeCa introduces
sample-adaptive computation allocation that dynamically modulates resources
based on generation complexity, allocating reduced computation for simpler
samples while preserving intensive processing for complex instances.
Experiments demonstrate 6.34x acceleration on FLUX with minimal quality
degradation (5.5% drop), 7.3x speedup on DiT while preserving generation
fidelity, and 79.84% VBench score at 6.1x acceleration for HunyuanVideo. The
verification mechanism incurs minimal overhead (1.67%-3.5% of full inference
costs), establishing a new paradigm for efficient diffusion model inference
while maintaining generation quality even at aggressive acceleration ratios.

*Chentao Cao,Xiaojun Xu,Bo Han,Hang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Answer-Then-Check safety alignment method enhances LLM robustness against jailbreak attacks by having models answer first in thought, then critically evaluate safety before final response.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring LLM safety against jailbreak attacks remains critical as models advance, requiring robust alignment approaches that maintain reasoning capabilities while preventing harmful outputs.

Method: Constructed Reasoned Safety Alignment (ReSA) dataset with 80K examples to teach models to reason through direct responses and analyze safety. Fine-tuned models using this approach where they answer internally first, then evaluate safety before providing final response.

Result: Achieves Pareto frontier with superior safety capability while reducing over-refusal rates. Maintains general reasoning on MMLU, MATH500, and HumanEval benchmarks. Enables safe completion (helpful alternative responses for sensitive topics) rather than just rejection. Small subset of 500 examples achieves comparable performance to full dataset.

Conclusion: Answer-Then-Check approach effectively enhances LLM safety against jailbreaks while preserving reasoning capabilities, and safety alignment may require less data than previously assumed.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance in capabilities, ensuring
their safety against jailbreak attacks remains a critical challenge. In this
paper, we introduce a novel safety alignment approach called Answer-Then-Check,
which enhances LLM robustness against malicious prompts by applying thinking
ability to mitigate jailbreaking problems before producing a final answer to
the user. Our method enables models to directly answer the question in their
thought and then critically evaluate its safety before deciding whether to
provide it. To implement this approach, we construct the Reasoned Safety
Alignment (ReSA) dataset, comprising 80K examples that teach models to reason
through direct responses and then analyze their safety. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves the Pareto frontier with superior safety
capability while decreasing over-refusal rates on over-refusal benchmarks.
Notably, the model fine-tuned with ReSA maintains general reasoning
capabilities on benchmarks like MMLU, MATH500, and HumanEval. Besides, our
method equips models with the ability to perform safe completion. Unlike
post-hoc methods that can only reject harmful queries, our model can provide
helpful and safe alternative responses for sensitive topics (e.g., self-harm).
Furthermore, we discover that training on a small subset of just 500 examples
can achieve comparable performance to using the full dataset, suggesting that
safety alignment may require less data than previously assumed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anomaly detection approaches struggle with scalability, probabilistic interpretability, and adaptability to evolving traffic patterns in dynamic graphs for cybersecurity and power grid applications.

Method: Integrates temporal multi-tensor sketching with Count-Min Sketch using Conservative Update (CMS-CU) to track edge frequency patterns with bounded memory, Bayesian inference for probabilistic scoring, and EWMA for adaptive thresholding.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with up to 6.5% AUC gain on CIC-IDS2018 and 15.6% on CIC-DDoS2019, processing 20 million edges in under 3.4 seconds using only 10 hash functions.

Conclusion: ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCH is practical and effective for fast, accurate anomaly detection in large-scale streaming graphs, addressing key limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in dynamic graphs is essential for identifying malicious
activities, fraud, and unexpected behaviors in real-world systems such as
cybersecurity and power grids. However, existing approaches struggle with
scalability, probabilistic interpretability, and adaptability to evolving
traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCH, a lightweight
and scalable framework for real-time anomaly detection in streaming edge data.
Our method integrates temporal multi-tensor sketching with Count-Min Sketch
using Conservative Update (CMS-CU) to compactly track edge frequency patterns
with bounded memory, while mitigating hash collision issues. We incorporate
Bayesian inference for probabilistic anomaly scoring and apply Exponentially
Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) for adaptive thresholding tuned to burst
intensity. Extensive experiments on four real-world intrusion detection
datasets demonstrate that ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCH outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines such as ANOEDGE-G/L, MIDAS-R, and F-FADE, achieving up to 6.5% AUC
gain on CIC-IDS2018 and up to 15.6% on CIC-DDoS2019, while processing 20
million edges in under 3.4 seconds using only 10 hash functions. Our results
show that ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCH is practical and effective for fast, accurate
anomaly detection in large-scale streaming graphs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how different online data sources (social media, news, aerial/satellite imagery) can complement traditional offline methods for real-time disaster impact assessment at county level.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional offline disaster assessment methods have time delays and biases. Online data sources provide real-time information but limited research exists on how different sources help estimate disaster impact at administrative unit level.

Method: Curated comprehensive dataset from multiple online sources for billion-dollar disasters at county level. Compared online estimates with traditional offline-based impact assessments.

Result: Analysis shows how different online sources provide complementary information for disaster assessment. Findings reveal insights into source effectiveness for real-time impact estimation.

Conclusion: Online data sources can effectively complement traditional offline methods for disaster impact assessment, providing real-time insights that help overcome time delays and biases of conventional approaches.

Abstract: Assessing the impact of a disaster in terms of asset losses and human
casualties is essential for preparing effective response plans. Traditional
methods include offline assessments conducted on the ground, where volunteers
and first responders work together to collect the estimate of losses through
windshield surveys or on-ground inspection. However, these methods have a time
delay and are prone to different biases. Recently, various online data sources,
including social media, news reports, aerial imagery, and satellite data, have
been utilized to evaluate the impact of disasters. Online data sources provide
real-time data streams for estimating the offline impact. Limited research
exists on how different online sources help estimate disaster impact at a given
administrative unit. In our work, we curate a comprehensive dataset by
collecting data from multiple online sources for a few billion-dollar disasters
at the county level. We also analyze how online estimates compare with
traditional offline-based impact estimates for the disaster. Our findings
provide insight into how different sources can provide complementary
information to assess the disaster.

### [389] [Measuring Visual Understanding in Telecom domain: Performance Metrics for Image-to-UML conversion using VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11667)
*HG Ranjani,Rutuja Prabhudesai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes performance metrics to evaluate VLM conversion of telecom sequence diagrams to PlantUML, showing good accuracy for basic elements but poor performance on complex structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a gap in evaluating Vision-Language Model conversions of telecom sequence diagrams to PlantUML format, with existing works not comparing various components of the generated scripts.

Method: Created a dataset from 3GPP documents, compared Claude Sonnet and GPT-4V outputs against manual ground truth using version control tools, and introduced metrics for participant identification, message flow accuracy, sequence ordering, and grouping construct preservation.

Result: VLMs accurately capture nodes, edges and messages but perform poorly on complex structures like notes, boxes, and groups.

Conclusion: The proposed metrics effectively quantify conversion errors and indicate a need for better representation of complex components in training data for fine-tuned VLMs.

Abstract: Telecom domain 3GPP documents are replete with images containing sequence
diagrams. Advances in Vision-Language Large Models (VLMs) have eased conversion
of such images to machine-readable PlantUML (puml) formats. However, there is a
gap in evaluation of such conversions - existing works do not compare puml
scripts for various components. In this work, we propose performance metrics to
measure the effectiveness of such conversions. A dataset of sequence diagrams
from 3GPP documents is chosen to be representative of domain-specific actual
scenarios. We compare puml outputs from two VLMs - Claude Sonnet and GPT-4V -
against manually created ground truth representations. We use version control
tools to capture differences and introduce standard performance metrics to
measure accuracies along various components: participant identification,
message flow accuracy, sequence ordering, and grouping construct preservation.
We demonstrate effectiveness of proposed metrics in quantifying conversion
errors across various components of puml scripts. The results show that nodes,
edges and messages are accurately captured. However, we observe that VLMs do
not necessarily perform well on complex structures such as notes, box, groups.
Our experiments and performance metrics indicates a need for better
representation of these components in training data for fine-tuned VLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel unlearning technique that uses PCA on activations and gradients to selectively target and remove dangerous knowledge from language models while preserving general performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unlearning techniques and safety training consistently fail to effectively remove dangerous knowledge from language models without disrupting their general capabilities.

Method: Perform PCA on activations and module output gradients to identify subspaces containing common representations, collapse them before calculating unlearning updates to avoid affecting general representations and only target those specific to the unlearned facts.

Result: When unlearning WMDP dataset facts from Llama-3.1-8B, achieved 80x better post-attack accuracy reduction on biohazardous facts and 30x better on cyberhazardous facts compared to best baseline, with only 0.1% WikiText loss increase and less than 3 GPU-seconds per fact.

Conclusion: The proposed selective unlearning technique robustly removes dangerous knowledge while minimizing disruption to general model performance, significantly outperforming existing methods in both effectiveness and efficiency.

Abstract: Current unlearning techniques and safety training consistently fail to remove
dangerous knowledge from language models. We analyze the root causes and
propose a highly selective technique which unlearns robustly and without
disrupting general performance.
  We perform PCA on activations and module output gradients to identify
subspaces containing common representations, and collapse them before
calculating unlearning updates. This way we avoid unlearning general
representations, and only target those specific to the unlearned facts.
  When unlearning WMDP dataset facts from Llama-3.1-8B, we drop post-attack
accuracy 80x more than our best baseline (Circuit Breakers) on biohazardous
facts and 30x more on cyberhazardous facts. Despite this, we disrupt general
performance 30x less (only 0.1% WikiText loss increase), while requiring less
than 3 GPU-seconds per fact.

TL;DR: A causal interventional tool for disaster analysis that enables counterfactual "what-if" scenarios using real-time data sources like satellite imagery, news, and social media, complementing traditional predictive models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional disaster modeling tools are predictive but not interventional - they cannot simulate counterfactual scenarios where users modify input states to explore different outcomes and mitigation strategies.

Method: Leverages real-time data sources (satellite imagery, news, social media) to create an interventional tool that allows users to modify current input states and simulate alternative scenarios.

Result: Provides causal attribution of different factors on disaster severity estimates and offers actionable recourses for easier mitigation planning. Source code is publicly available.

Conclusion: This interventional approach complements traditional predictive disaster modeling by enabling counterfactual analysis and providing actionable insights for disaster mitigation planning.

Abstract: Traditional disaster analysis and modelling tools for assessing the severity
of a disaster are predictive in nature. Based on the past observational data,
these tools prescribe how the current input state (e.g., environmental
conditions, situation reports) results in a severity assessment. However, these
systems are not meant to be interventional in the causal sense, where the user
can modify the current input state to simulate counterfactual "what-if"
scenarios. In this work, we provide an alternative interventional tool that
complements traditional disaster modelling tools by leveraging real-time data
sources like satellite imagery, news, and social media. Our tool also helps
understand the causal attribution of different factors on the estimated
severity, over any given region of interest. In addition, we provide actionable
recourses that would enable easier mitigation planning. Our source code is
publicly available.

TL;DR: CANOE is a chaotic neural oscillator network that addresses dynamic imbalance in mobility patterns and underutilization of contextual cues for next location prediction, achieving 3.17%-13.11% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to handle the dynamic imbalance between periodic and chaotic mobile patterns and underutilize contextual cues like temporal regularities in arrival times, which offer stronger predictability than spatial forecasts.

Method: Proposes CANOE with a biologically inspired Chaotic Neural Oscillatory Attention mechanism to inject adaptive variability into traditional attention, and uses a Tri-Pair Interaction Encoder with Cross Context Attentive Decoder to fuse multimodal "who-when-where" contexts.

Result: Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show CANOE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 3.17%-13.11%, with robust predictions across different mobility chaotic levels.

Conclusion: CANOE effectively addresses the challenges of dynamic pattern imbalance and contextual underutilization in next location prediction, demonstrating significant performance improvements and robustness across varying mobility patterns.

Abstract: Next location prediction is a key task in human mobility analysis, crucial
for applications like smart city resource allocation and personalized
navigation services. However, existing methods face two significant challenges:
first, they fail to address the dynamic imbalance between periodic and chaotic
mobile patterns, leading to inadequate adaptation over sparse trajectories;
second, they underutilize contextual cues, such as temporal regularities in
arrival times, which persist even in chaotic patterns and offer stronger
predictability than spatial forecasts due to reduced search spaces. To tackle
these challenges, we propose \textbf{\method}, a
\underline{\textbf{C}}h\underline{\textbf{A}}otic \underline{\textbf{N}}eural
\underline{\textbf{O}}scillator n\underline{\textbf{E}}twork for next location
prediction, which introduces a biologically inspired Chaotic Neural Oscillatory
Attention mechanism to inject adaptive variability into traditional attention,
enabling balanced representation of evolving mobility behaviors, and employs a
Tri-Pair Interaction Encoder along with a Cross Context Attentive Decoder to
fuse multimodal ``who-when-where'' contexts in a joint framework for enhanced
prediction performance. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets
demonstrate that CANOE consistently and significantly outperforms a sizeable
collection of state-of-the-art baselines, yielding 3.17\%-13.11\% improvement
over the best-performing baselines across different cases. In particular, CANOE
can make robust predictions over mobility trajectories of different mobility
chaotic levels. A series of ablation studies also supports our key design
choices. Our code is available at: https://github.com/yuqian2003/CANOE.

TL;DR: Novel data reconstruction attack using guided diffusion to recover high-fidelity images from intermediate representations in split inference settings, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the privacy risks of foundation models in split inference scenarios, which remain largely unexplored compared to smaller CNN models.

Method: Uses guided diffusion with a latent diffusion model pre-trained on large-scale datasets to perform iterative reconstruction on learned image priors from intermediate representations.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively in reconstructing data from deep-layer intermediate representations of vision foundation models.

Conclusion: Highlights urgent need for more robust privacy protection mechanisms for large models in split inference scenarios due to successful high-fidelity data reconstruction.

Abstract: With the rise of large foundation models, split inference (SI) has emerged as
a popular computational paradigm for deploying models across lightweight edge
devices and cloud servers, addressing data privacy and computational cost
concerns. However, most existing data reconstruction attacks have focused on
smaller CNN classification models, leaving the privacy risks of foundation
models in SI settings largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose a
novel data reconstruction attack based on guided diffusion, which leverages the
rich prior knowledge embedded in a latent diffusion model (LDM) pre-trained on
a large-scale dataset. Our method performs iterative reconstruction on the
LDM's learned image prior, effectively generating high-fidelity images
resembling the original data from their intermediate representations (IR).
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in
reconstructing data from deep-layer IRs of the vision foundation model. The
results highlight the urgent need for more robust privacy protection mechanisms
for large models in SI scenarios. Code is available at:

TL;DR: k-NN regression with chemical distance metrics rivals complex kernel methods in accuracy while being orders of magnitude faster for atmospheric cluster formation modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum chemistry provides accurate insights into atmospheric molecular cluster formation but is computationally expensive, limiting large-scale exploration needed for climate modeling.

Method: Used k-nearest neighbor regression with chemically informed distance metrics (kernel-induced metric and MLKR-learned metric) and FCHL19 molecular descriptor, comparing against kernel ridge regression.

Result: k-NN models achieved near-chemical accuracy, scaled to datasets with 250,000+ entries, reduced computational time by orders of magnitude, and extrapolated well to larger unseen clusters with minimal error (~1 kcal/mol).

Conclusion: k-NN is a powerful, interpretable, and efficient alternative to complex quantum chemistry methods for accelerating discovery in atmospheric chemistry and related fields.

Abstract: Understanding how atmospheric molecular clusters form and grow is key to
resolving one of the biggest uncertainties in climate modelling: the formation
of new aerosol particles. While quantum chemistry offers accurate insights into
these early-stage clusters, its steep computational costs limit large-scale
exploration. In this work, we present a fast, interpretable, and surprisingly
powerful alternative: $k$-nearest neighbour ($k$-NN) regression model. By
leveraging chemically informed distance metrics, including a kernel-induced
metric and one learned via metric learning for kernel regression (MLKR), we
show that simple $k$-NN models can rival more complex kernel ridge regression
(KRR) models in accuracy, while reducing computational time by orders of
magnitude. We perform this comparison with the well-established
Faber-Christensen-Huang-Lilienfeld (FCHL19) molecular descriptor, but other
descriptors (e.g., FCHL18, MBDF, and CM) can be shown to have similar
performance. Applied to both simple organic molecules in the QM9 benchmark set
and large datasets of atmospheric molecular clusters (sulphuric acid-water and
sulphuric-multibase -base systems), our $k$-NN models achieve near-chemical
accuracy, scale seamlessly to datasets with over 250,000 entries, and even
appears to extrapolate to larger unseen clusters with minimal error (often
nearing 1 kcal/mol). With built-in interpretability and straightforward
uncertainty estimation, this work positions $k$-NN as a potent tool for
accelerating discovery in atmospheric chemistry and beyond.

TL;DR: MillStone benchmark measures how LLM stances on controversial issues are influenced by external arguments, finding LLMs are generally open-minded but easily swayed by authoritative sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs with web search capabilities replace traditional search engines, understanding how their outputs are influenced by information sources is crucial, especially for controversial topics.

Method: Developed MillStone benchmark to systematically test how external arguments affect LLM stances on controversial issues across nine leading language models.

Result: LLMs are generally open-minded on most issues but can be easily swayed by authoritative sources, highlighting manipulation risks in LLM-based information systems.

Conclusion: Source selection is critical for LLM-based information systems due to their susceptibility to authoritative persuasion, requiring safeguards against manipulation.

Abstract: Large language models equipped with Web search, information retrieval tools,
and other agentic capabilities are beginning to supplant traditional search
engines. As users start to rely on LLMs for information on many topics,
including controversial and debatable issues, it is important to understand how
the stances and opinions expressed in LLM outputs are influenced by the
documents they use as their information sources.
  In this paper, we present MillStone, the first benchmark that aims to
systematically measure the effect of external arguments on the stances that
LLMs take on controversial issues (not all of them political). We apply
MillStone to nine leading LLMs and measure how ``open-minded'' they are to
arguments supporting opposite sides of these issues, whether different LLMs
agree with each other, which arguments LLMs find most persuasive, and whether
these arguments are the same for different LLMs.
  In general, we find that LLMs are open-minded on most issues. An
authoritative source of information can easily sway an LLM's stance,
highlighting the importance of source selection and the risk that LLM-based
information retrieval and search systems can be manipulated.

TL;DR: Study evaluates machine learning for ship fuel consumption prediction using voyage reports combined with climate and sea data from CMEMS and ECMWF, showing strong potential for accurate modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address IMO mandates for reducing ship fuel consumption and carbon emissions by improving fuel efficiency prediction through external data integration.

Method: Used 296 voyage reports from a bulk carrier with 28 parameters, integrated with hydrometeorological big data from CMEMS (19 parameters) and ECMWF (61 parameters) to build predictive models.

Result: Machine learning techniques show strong potential for accurate fuel consumption prediction when combining voyage reports with climate and sea state data.

Conclusion: External public data fusion enhances modeling accuracy, but validation on similar vessel classes is needed to confirm generalizability of the approach.

Abstract: There is an increasing push for operational measures to reduce ships' bunker
fuel consumption and carbon emissions, driven by the International Maritime
Organization (IMO) mandates. Key performance indicators such as the Energy
Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI) focus on fuel efficiency. Strategies
like trim optimization, virtual arrival, and green routing have emerged. The
theoretical basis for these approaches lies in accurate prediction of fuel
consumption as a function of sailing speed, displacement, trim, climate, and
sea state. This study utilized 296 voyage reports from a bulk carrier vessel
over one year (November 16, 2021 to November 21, 2022) and 28 parameters,
integrating hydrometeorological big data from the Copernicus Marine Environment
Monitoring Service (CMEMS) with 19 parameters and the European Centre for
Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) with 61 parameters. The objective was to
evaluate whether fusing external public data sources enhances modeling accuracy
and to highlight the most influential parameters affecting fuel consumption.
The results reveal a strong potential for machine learning techniques to
predict ship fuel consumption accurately by combining voyage reports with
climate and sea data. However, validation on similar classes of vessels remains
necessary to confirm generalizability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PINNs can get stuck at unstable fixed points, leading to incorrect physical solutions. This paper proposes a stability-based regularization to avoid these local minima and improve training success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) exhibit local minima at solutions corresponding to fixed points of dynamical systems, which can interfere with training and lead to physically incorrect solutions in forward problems.

Method: Proposes a regularization scheme based on stability theory that penalizes solutions corresponding to unstable fixed points, helping PINNs avoid these problematic local minima.

Result: Experimental results on four dynamical systems (including Lotka-Volterra and van der Pol oscillator) show the scheme helps avoid physically incorrect solutions and substantially improves training success rate.

Conclusion: Stability-based regularization effectively addresses the local minima problem in PINNs, preventing convergence to unstable fixed points and improving the reliability of physics-informed neural network solutions.

Abstract: It was recently shown that the loss function used for training
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) exhibits local minima at solutions
corresponding to fixed points of dynamical systems. In the forward setting,
where the PINN is trained to solve initial value problems, these local minima
can interfere with training and potentially leading to physically incorrect
solutions. Building on stability theory, this paper proposes a regularization
scheme that penalizes solutions corresponding to unstable fixed points.
Experimental results on four dynamical systems, including the Lotka-Volterra
model and the van der Pol oscillator, show that our scheme helps avoiding
physically incorrect solutions and substantially improves the training success

*Sangjun Lee,Seung-taek Woo,Jungyu Jin,Changhun Lee,Eunhyeok Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AMQ is an automated framework for mixed-precision weight-only quantization that optimally assigns layer-wise bit-widths to LLMs, balancing model quality and memory usage through efficient search techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable broader deployment of Large Language Models under strict memory constraints by identifying the best-performing models while managing the combinatorial complexity of quantization configurations.

Method: Uses four key innovations: search space pruning, quantization proxy to avoid format conversions, quality predictor to minimize evaluation overhead, and iterative search-and-update strategy for fast convergence.

Result: AMQ efficiently explores the quality-efficiency landscape, reaches the Pareto frontier, and produces compact yet high-performing LLMs.

Conclusion: The framework successfully overcomes the challenge of massive search space in quantization optimization, making it feasible to deploy high-quality LLMs under memory constraints.

Abstract: To enable broader deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is essential
to identify the best-performing model under strict memory constraints. We
present AMQ, Automated Mixed-Precision Weight-Only Quantization, a framework
that assigns layer-wise quantization bit-widths to optimally balance model
quality and memory usage. However, the combinatorial search space, with over
10^{100} possible configurations, makes conventional black-box optimization
infeasible. AMQ overcomes this challenge through four key innovations:(1)
search space pruning using prior knowledge to exclude unpromising
configurations, (2) quantization proxy to bypass costly format conversions
during search, (3) quality predictor to minimize evaluation overhead, and (4)
iterative search-and-update strategy for fast and stable convergence. By
integrating these components, AMQ efficiently explores the quality-efficiency
landscape, reaching the Pareto frontier and yielding LLMs that are both compact
and high-performing. Our code is available at https://github.com/dlwns147/amq.

*Bozhen Hu,Cheng Tan,Siyuan Li,Jiangbin Zheng,Sizhe Qiu,Jun Xia,Stan Z. Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multimodal framework combining language models, CNNs, GNNs, and attention mechanisms to predict enzyme turnover rates from sequences, substrates, and environmental factors, with symbolic regression for interpretable formulas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enzyme turnover rates are fundamental but scarce due to high experimental measurement costs and complexity, creating a gap in enzyme kinetics knowledge.

Method: Integrates enzyme sequences (pre-trained language model + CNN), substrate structures (graph neural network), and environmental factors with attention mechanism. Uses symbolic regression via Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks to learn interpretable mathematical formulas.

Result: Outperforms both traditional and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Provides a robust tool for studying enzyme kinetics with applications in enzyme engineering, biotechnology, and industrial biocatalysis.

Abstract: The enzyme turnover rate is a fundamental parameter in enzyme kinetics,
reflecting the catalytic efficiency of enzymes. However, enzyme turnover rates
remain scarce across most organisms due to the high cost and complexity of
experimental measurements. To address this gap, we propose a multimodal
framework for predicting the enzyme turnover rate by integrating enzyme
sequences, substrate structures, and environmental factors. Our model combines
a pre-trained language model and a convolutional neural network to extract
features from protein sequences, while a graph neural network captures
informative representations from substrate molecules. An attention mechanism is
incorporated to enhance interactions between enzyme and substrate
representations. Furthermore, we leverage symbolic regression via
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks to explicitly learn mathematical formulas that
govern the enzyme turnover rate, enabling interpretable and accurate
predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms
both traditional and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. This work
provides a robust tool for studying enzyme kinetics and holds promise for
applications in enzyme engineering, biotechnology, and industrial biocatalysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Real-time fall detection framework using IMU data and cost-sensitive learning achieves perfect recall (1.00) with high precision (0.84) and fast inference (<5ms).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fall detection methods rely on simulated data or prior knowledge of falls, limiting real-world applicability. Need for efficient computation and robust evaluation for continuous monitoring.

Method: Uses 60+ hours of IMU data from FARSEEING dataset with efficient classifiers in streaming mode. Implements cost-sensitive learning strategy that tunes decision threshold based on higher risk of missed falls vs false alarms.

Result: Achieved Recall: 1.00, Precision: 0.84, F1 score: 0.91 on FARSEEING dataset. Detected all falls with low false alarms. Average inference time below 5ms per sample.

Conclusion: Cost-sensitive threshold tuning enhances robustness of accelerometer-based fall detection. Framework shows potential for deployment in real-time wearable sensor systems for continuous monitoring.

Abstract: Real-time fall detection is crucial for enabling timely interventions and
mitigating the severe health consequences of falls, particularly in older
adults. However, existing methods often rely on simulated data or assumptions
such as prior knowledge of fall events, limiting their real-world
applicability. Practical deployment also requires efficient computation and
robust evaluation metrics tailored to continuous monitoring. This paper
presents a real-time fall detection framework for continuous monitoring without
prior knowledge of fall events. Using over 60 hours of inertial measurement
unit (IMU) data from the FARSEEING real-world falls dataset, we employ recent
efficient classifiers to compute fall probabilities in streaming mode. To
enhance robustness, we introduce a cost-sensitive learning strategy that tunes
the decision threshold using a cost function reflecting the higher risk of
missed falls compared to false alarms. Unlike many methods that achieve high
recall only at the cost of precision, our framework achieved Recall of 1.00,
Precision of 0.84, and an F1 score of 0.91 on FARSEEING, detecting all falls
while keeping false alarms low, with average inference time below 5 ms per
sample. These results demonstrate that cost-sensitive threshold tuning enhances
the robustness of accelerometer-based fall detection. They also highlight the
potential of our computationally efficient framework for deployment in
real-time wearable sensor systems for continuous monitoring.

Motivation: The interplay between GNN parameter optimization, expressivity, and generalization remains poorly understood, requiring better tools to analyze GNN loss landscapes.

Method: Introduces an efficient learnable dimensionality reduction method for visualizing GNN loss landscapes and analyzes effects of over-smoothing, jumping knowledge, quantization, sparsification, and preconditioner on GNN optimization.

Result: The learnable projection method surpasses PCA-based approach, enabling accurate reconstruction of high-dimensional parameters with lower memory usage. Architecture, sparsification, and optimizer's preconditioning significantly impact GNN optimization landscape and performance.

Conclusion: These insights contribute to developing more efficient designs of GNN architectures and training strategies through better understanding of optimization landscapes.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful models for graph-structured data,
with broad applications. However, the interplay between GNN parameter
optimization, expressivity, and generalization remains poorly understood. We
address this by introducing an efficient learnable dimensionality reduction
method for visualizing GNN loss landscapes, and by analyzing the effects of
over-smoothing, jumping knowledge, quantization, sparsification, and
preconditioner on GNN optimization. Our learnable projection method surpasses
the state-of-the-art PCA-based approach, enabling accurate reconstruction of
high-dimensional parameters with lower memory usage. We further show that
architecture, sparsification, and optimizer's preconditioning significantly
impact the GNN optimization landscape and their training process and final
prediction performance. These insights contribute to developing more efficient
designs of GNN architectures and training strategies.

*Mrinmay Sen,Ankita Das,Sidhant Nair,C Krishna Mohan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedDAF is a novel Federated Domain Adaptation approach that addresses both domain shifts and limited target data by using similarity-based aggregation based on model functional distance from gradient fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FDA methods focus on domain shifts but assume ample target data, neglecting the combined challenges of domain shifts and data scarcity. Current approaches also fail to prioritize sharing relevant information from source clients according to target objectives.

Method: FedDAF uses similarity-based aggregation by calculating model functional distance from mean gradient fields computed on target data. It computes the angle between mean gradient fields and normalizes with the Gompertz function. Global source model is aggregated using simple average.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate FedDAF's superiority over existing FL, PFL, and FDA methods in achieving better test accuracy.

Conclusion: FedDAF effectively addresses both domain shifts and data scarcity challenges in FDA by enabling target-objective-aware model aggregation even with limited target data.

Abstract: Federated Domain Adaptation (FDA) is a federated learning (FL) approach that
improves model performance at the target client by collaborating with source
clients while preserving data privacy. FDA faces two primary challenges: domain
shifts between source and target data and limited labeled data at the target.
Most existing FDA methods focus on domain shifts, assuming ample target data,
yet often neglect the combined challenges of both domain shifts and data
scarcity. Moreover, approaches that address both challenges fail to prioritize
sharing relevant information from source clients according to the target's
objective. In this paper, we propose FedDAF, a novel approach addressing both
challenges in FDA. FedDAF uses similarity-based aggregation of the global
source model and target model by calculating model functional distance from
their mean gradient fields computed on target data. This enables effective
model aggregation based on the target objective, constructed using target data,
even with limited data. While computing model functional distance between these
two models, FedDAF computes the angle between their mean gradient fields and
then normalizes with the Gompertz function. To construct the global source
model, all the local source models are aggregated using simple average in the
server. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate FedDAF's superiority
over existing FL, PFL, and FDA methods in terms of achieving better test
accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Event2Vec is a framework for learning representations of discrete event sequences using additive recurrent structures in Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, with theoretical guarantees and experimental validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural representations in biological and artificial systems show importance of geometric and topological structures, inspiring the need for composable and interpretable embeddings for event sequences.

Method: Uses simple additive recurrent structure to learn embeddings. Provides theoretical analysis showing convergence to ideal additive structure in Euclidean space. Introduces hyperbolic variant for hierarchical data with low distortion.

Result: The model achieves the linear additive hypothesis where sequence representation equals vector sum of constituent events. Hyperbolic variant shows improved performance on hierarchical event sequences.

Conclusion: Event2Vec provides theoretically grounded, interpretable representations for event sequences, with both Euclidean and hyperbolic variants offering geometric advantages for different data structures.

Abstract: The study of neural representations, both in biological and artificial
systems, is increasingly revealing the importance of geometric and topological
structures. Inspired by this, we introduce Event2Vec, a novel framework for
learning representations of discrete event sequences. Our model leverages a
simple, additive recurrent structure to learn composable, interpretable
embeddings. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that, under
specific training objectives, our model's learned representations in a
Euclidean space converge to an ideal additive structure. This ensures that the
representation of a sequence is the vector sum of its constituent events, a
property we term the linear additive hypothesis. To address the limitations of
Euclidean geometry for hierarchical data, we also introduce a variant of our
model in hyperbolic space, which is naturally suited to embedding tree-like
structures with low distortion. We present experiments to validate our
hypothesis and demonstrate the benefits of each geometry, highlighting the
improved performance of the hyperbolic model on hierarchical event sequences.

TL;DR: Interpretable models like explainable boosting machines can nearly match black-box model performance for long-term unemployment prediction while providing better transparency and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about opacity and fairness in black-box machine learning models used for statistical profiling of long-term unemployment risk.

Method: Compare traditional statistical, interpretable, and black-box models using Swiss administrative data, evaluating predictive performance, interpretability, and fairness. Apply model sparsity, feature smoothing, and fairness mitigation techniques.

Result: Explainable boosting machines perform nearly as well as best black-box models. Transparency and fairness enhancements cause only minor performance losses.

Conclusion: Interpretable profiling provides accountable and trustworthy alternative to black-box models without compromising performance.

Abstract: Long-term unemployment (LTU) is a challenge for both jobseekers and public
employment services. Statistical profiling tools are increasingly used to
predict LTU risk. Some profiling tools are opaque, black-box machine learning
models, which raise issues of transparency and fairness. This paper
investigates whether interpretable models could serve as an alternative, using
administrative data from Switzerland. Traditional statistical, interpretable,
and black-box models are compared in terms of predictive performance,
interpretability, and fairness. It is shown that explainable boosting machines,
a recent interpretable model, perform nearly as well as the best black-box
models. It is also shown how model sparsity, feature smoothing, and fairness
mitigation can enhance transparency and fairness with only minor losses in
performance. These findings suggest that interpretable profiling provides an
accountable and trustworthy alternative to black-box models without
compromising performance.

*Xiangjian Jiang,Nikola Simidjievski,Mateja Jamnik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a new evaluation framework for tabular data generators that combines structural fidelity with conventional metrics, introducing global utility metric that works without ground-truth causal structures, and provides comprehensive benchmark TabStruct.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tabular generator evaluation lacks holistic understanding by neglecting the interplay between structural fidelity and conventional metrics, and is limited to toy datasets due to requiring ground-truth causal structures.

Method: Introduces global utility metric for structural fidelity assessment without ground-truth causal structures, and creates TabStruct benchmark with large-scale analysis of 13 generators across 29 datasets.

Result: Global utility provides task-independent, domain-agnostic evaluation of tabular generator performance, enabling comprehensive assessment even for real-world datasets without known causal structures.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and benchmark offer a more complete evaluation approach for tabular data generators, addressing limitations of existing methods and enabling broader applicability to real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Evaluating tabular generators remains a challenging problem, as the unique
causal structural prior of heterogeneous tabular data does not lend itself to
intuitive human inspection. Recent work has introduced structural fidelity as a
tabular-specific evaluation dimension to assess whether synthetic data complies
with the causal structures of real data. However, existing benchmarks often
neglect the interplay between structural fidelity and conventional evaluation
dimensions, thus failing to provide a holistic understanding of model
performance. Moreover, they are typically limited to toy datasets, as
quantifying existing structural fidelity metrics requires access to
ground-truth causal structures, which are rarely available for real-world
datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation framework that jointly
considers structural fidelity and conventional evaluation dimensions. We
introduce a new evaluation metric, $\textbf{global utility}$, which enables the
assessment of structural fidelity even in the absence of ground-truth causal
structures. In addition, we present $\textbf{TabStruct}$, a comprehensive
evaluation benchmark offering large-scale quantitative analysis on 13 tabular
generators from nine distinct categories, across 29 datasets. Our results
demonstrate that global utility provides a task-independent, domain-agnostic
lens for tabular generator performance. We release the TabStruct benchmark
suite, including all datasets, evaluation pipelines, and raw results. Code is

*Sangjoon Park,Yeonjong Shin,Jinhyun Choo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepONet-based surrogate model for efficient simulation of poroelastic systems with random permeability fields, achieving high accuracy and substantial speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Poroelastic simulations with random permeability fields are computationally expensive for probabilistic analysis and uncertainty quantification, creating need for efficient surrogate models.

Method: Deep operator network (DeepONet) architecture with three strategies: nondimensionalization of equations, input dimensionality reduction via Karhunen-Loève expansion, and two-step training procedure decoupling branch/trunk networks.

Result: Achieved substantial speedup in inference while maintaining high predictive accuracy across wide range of permeability statistics in soil consolidation and groundwater extraction benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach shows potential as scalable and efficient surrogate modeling technique for poroelastic systems with random permeability fields.

Abstract: Poroelasticity -- coupled fluid flow and elastic deformation in porous media
-- often involves spatially variable permeability, especially in subsurface
systems. In such cases, simulations with random permeability fields are widely
used for probabilistic analysis, uncertainty quantification, and inverse
problems. These simulations require repeated forward solves that are often
prohibitively expensive, motivating the development of efficient surrogate
models. However, efficient surrogate modeling techniques for poroelasticity
with random permeability fields remain scarce. In this study, we propose a
surrogate modeling framework based on the deep operator network (DeepONet), a
neural architecture designed to learn mappings between infinite-dimensional
function spaces. The proposed surrogate model approximates the solution
operator that maps random permeability fields to transient poroelastic
responses. To enhance predictive accuracy and stability, we integrate three
strategies: nondimensionalization of the governing equations, input
dimensionality reduction via Karhunen--Lo\'eve expansion, and a two-step
training procedure that decouples the optimization of branch and trunk
networks. The methodology is evaluated on two benchmark problems in
poroelasticity: soil consolidation and ground subsidence induced by groundwater
extraction. In both cases, the DeepONet achieves substantial speedup in
inference while maintaining high predictive accuracy across a wide range of
permeability statistics. These results highlight the potential of the proposed
approach as a scalable and efficient surrogate modeling technique for
poroelastic systems with random permeability fields.

*Xiaofan Zhou,Zisu Wang,Janice Krieger,Mohan Zalake,Lu Cheng*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: LLMs show promise but face challenges in identifying clinical trial participants from social media due to complex reasoning requirements


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional clinical trial recruitment methods are time-consuming and geographically limited, while social media contains vast health-related information that could help identify eligible participants

Method: Created TRIALQA dataset with annotated social media posts from cancer subreddits, benchmarked 7 LLMs on eligibility assessment and interest prediction tasks using 6 different training/inference strategies

Result: LLMs demonstrate considerable potential but struggle with the complex multi-hop reasoning needed to accurately evaluate eligibility criteria

Conclusion: While LLM-driven tools show promise for clinical trial recruitment through social media analysis, further improvements are needed to handle the sophisticated reasoning required for eligibility assessment

Abstract: Clinical trials (CT) are essential for advancing medical research and
treatment, yet efficiently recruiting eligible participants -- each of whom
must meet complex eligibility criteria -- remains a significant challenge.
Traditional recruitment approaches, such as advertisements or electronic health
record screening within hospitals, are often time-consuming and geographically
constrained. This work addresses the recruitment challenge by leveraging the
vast amount of health-related information individuals share on social media
platforms. With the emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs) capable
of sophisticated text understanding, we pose the central research question: Can
LLM-driven tools facilitate CT recruitment by identifying potential
participants through their engagement on social media? To investigate this
question, we introduce TRIALQA, a novel dataset comprising two social media
collections from the subreddits on colon cancer and prostate cancer. Using
eligibility criteria from public real-world CTs, experienced annotators are
hired to annotate TRIALQA to indicate (1) whether a social media user meets a
given eligibility criterion and (2) the user's stated reasons for interest in
participating in CT. We benchmark seven widely used LLMs on these two
prediction tasks, employing six distinct training and inference strategies. Our
extensive experiments reveal that, while LLMs show considerable promise, they
still face challenges in performing the complex, multi-hop reasoning needed to
accurately assess eligibility criteria.

TL;DR: Study examines human-AI collaborative artmaking, finding AI acts as creative partner that expands boundaries but raises concerns about homogenization. Proposes critical co-creation framework for arts education.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how generative AI transforms artistic roles, challenges originality concepts, changes creative processes, and shapes aesthetic judgment in human-AI co-creation among young learners and art students.

Method: Survey of 112 participants combined with theoretical synthesis of Dewey's aesthetics, Ihde's postphenomenology, and actor-network theory to analyze human-AI creative dynamics.

Result: Participants view AI as ideation-stimulating partner rather than passive tool. Found fluid creator subjectivity with multiple stances, iterative dialogic workflow, and educational shift toward critical judgment and reflexivity over technical skills.

Conclusion: Arts education should cultivate critical co-creation stance that preserves human distinctiveness in concept formation and meaning-making while collaborating with AI.

Abstract: This study investigates the aesthetic experience and educational value of
collaborative artmaking with generative artificial intelligence (AI) among
young learners and art students. Based on a survey of 112 participants, we
examine how human creators renegotiate their roles, how conventional notions of
originality are challenged, how the creative process is transformed, and how
aesthetic judgment is formed in human--AI co-creation. Empirically,
participants generally view AI as a partner that stimulates ideation and
expands creative boundaries rather than a passive tool, while simultaneously
voicing concerns about stylistic homogenization and the erosion of traditional
authorship. Theoretically, we synthesize Dewey's aesthetics of experience,
Ihde's postphenomenology, and actor--network theory (ANT) into a single
analytical framework to unpack the dynamics between human creators and AI as a
non-human actant. Findings indicate (i) a fluid subjectivity in which creators
shift across multiple stances (director, dialogic partner, discoverer); (ii) an
iterative, dialogic workflow (intent--generate--select--refine) that centers
critical interpretation; and (iii) an educational value shift from technical
skill training toward higher-order competencies such as critical judgment,
cross-modal ideation, and reflexivity. We argue that arts education should
cultivate a \emph{critical co-creation} stance toward technology, guiding
learners to collaborate with AI while preserving human distinctiveness in
concept formation, judgment, and meaning-making.

Motivation: Machine Unlearning has gained popularity in various domains but hasn't received much attention in education, despite its potential to operationalize Responsible AI principles and optimize ML models in educational contexts.

Method: Conducted a structured review of 42 peer-reviewed sources to identify four key domains where Machine Unlearning holds promise for education systems.

Result: Identified four promising application domains: privacy protection, resilience against adversarial inputs, mitigation of systemic bias, and adaptability in evolving learning contexts.

Conclusion: Machine Unlearning serves as a practical mechanism for Responsible AI and an essential tool for Adaptive AI in education, fostering trust in AI-driven educational systems with the proposed MU-RAAI reference architecture.

Abstract: The concept of Machine Unlearning (MU) has gained popularity in various
domains due to its ability to address several issues in Machine Learning (ML)
models, particularly those related to privacy, security, bias mitigation, and
adaptability. With these abilities, MU is evolving into a promising technology
in upholding Responsible AI principles and optimizing ML models' performance.
However, despite its promising potential, the concept has not received much
attention in the education sector. In an attempt to encourage further uptake of
this promising technology in the educational landscape, this paper demonstrates
that MU indeed has great potential to serve as a practical mechanism for
operationalizing Responsible AI principles as well as an essential tool for
Adaptive AI within the educational application domain hence fostering trust in
AI-driven educational systems. Through a structured review of 42 peer-reviewed
sources, we identify four domains where MU holds particular promise namely
privacy protection, resilience against adversarial inputs, mitigation of
systemic bias, and adaptability in evolving learning contexts. We
systematically explore these potentials and their interventions to core
challenges in ML-based education systems. As a conceptual contribution, we
present a reference Machine Unlearning application architecture for Responsible

Result: High agreement between AI and human graders for textual and chemical reaction questions, but lower reliability for numerical and graphical tasks.

Conclusion: AI shows promise for routine assessment tasks but requires human oversight and careful consideration of student perceptions of fairness and trust in educational integration.

Abstract: We explore the effectiveness and reliability of an artificial intelligence

AI-assigned scores to human grading across various types of questions. Exam
pages and grading rubrics were uploaded as images to account for chemical
reaction equations, short and long open-ended answers, numerical and symbolic
answer derivations, drawing, and sketching in pencil-and-paper format. Using
linear regression analyses and psychometric evaluations, the investigation
reveals high agreement between AI and human graders for textual and chemical
reaction questions, while highlighting lower reliability for numerical and
graphical tasks. The findings emphasize the necessity for human oversight to
ensure grading accuracy, based on selective filtering. The results indicate
promising applications for AI in routine assessment tasks, though careful

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address accessibility needs of novice programmers with disabilities by exploring how they interact with voice-enabled GenAI tutors and the quality of audio feedback.

Method: Analyzed 1210 audio messages from nine 9th-grade students using OpenAI's Realtime API voice tutor in classroom setting through qualitative coding and Partner Modeling Questionnaire.

Result: GenAI voice tutor provided mostly mistake and next-step feedback (71.4% correct out of 416 outputs), but struggled with programming code elements. Students primarily used it for debugging and perceived it as competent but only somewhat human-like.

Conclusion: First study exploring real-time voice GenAI tutor interactions with novices, revealing both potential for accessibility and current limitations in code delivery quality, informing future educational tool design.

Abstract: Real-time voice interfaces using multimodal Generative AI (GenAI) can
potentially address the accessibility needs of novice programmers with
disabilities (e.g., related to vision). Yet, little is known about how novices
interact with GenAI tools and their feedback quality in the form of audio
output. This paper analyzes audio dialogues from nine 9th-grade students using
a voice-enabled tutor (powered by OpenAI's Realtime API) in an authentic
classroom setting while learning Python. We examined the students' voice
prompts and AI's responses (1210 messages) by using qualitative coding. We also
gathered students' perceptions via the Partner Modeling Questionnaire. The
GenAI Voice Tutor primarily offered feedback on mistakes and next steps, but
its correctness was limited (71.4% correct out of 416 feedback outputs).
Quality issues were observed, particularly when the AI attempted to utter
programming code elements. Students used the GenAI voice tutor primarily for
debugging. They perceived it as competent, only somewhat human-like, and
flexible. The present study is the first to explore the interaction dynamics of
real-time voice GenAI tutors and novice programmers, informing future
educational tool design and potentially addressing accessibility needs of

TL;DR: The NRCD dataset aggregates 15,397 race results from 5,585 club athletes, showing runners improve more when starting slower and racing frequently, with standardized analysis accounting for course conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of large-scale running performance data and enable data-driven decision making for athletes and coaches, moving beyond small manually-scraped datasets limited to 500 entries.

Method: Analysis of 15,397 race results from 5,585 club athletes across 2023-2024 seasons, factoring in course conditions (weather, elevation) to standardize improvement measurements for 6,000m (women) and 8,000m (men) races.

Result: Runners show more pronounced improvement per calendar day when they have slower initial race times and race more frequently. Gender racing frequency is comparable despite dataset imbalance (3,484 men vs 2,101 women).

Conclusion: The NRCD provides valuable insights into real-world club athlete performance, serving as a resource for runners, coaches, and teams to bridge raw data with applied sports science, particularly for athletes balancing competition with other commitments.

Abstract: The National Running Club Database (NRCD) aggregates 15,397 race results of
5,585 athletes from the 2023 and 2024 cross country seasons. This paper
introduces the NRCD dataset, which provides insights into individual athlete
progressions, enabling data-driven decision-making. Analysis reveals that
runners' improvement per calendar day for women, racing 6,000m, and men, racing
8,000m, is more pronounced in athletes with slower initial race times and those
who race more frequently. Additionally, we factor in course conditions,
including weather and elevation gain, to standardize improvement. While the
NRCD shows a gender imbalance, 3,484 men vs. 2,101 women, the racing frequency
between genders is comparable. This publication makes the NRCD dataset
accessible to the research community, addressing a previous challenge where
smaller datasets, often limited to 500 entries, had to be manually scraped from
the internet. Focusing on club athletes rather than elite professionals offers
a unique lens into the performance of real-world runners who balance
competition with academics and other commitments. These results serve as a
valuable resource for runners, coaches, and teams, bridging the gap between raw
data and applied sports science.

TL;DR: Proposes SCOR framework for ethical AI governance in digital ecosystems through four pillars: Shared Ethical Charter, Co-Design protocols, Continuous Oversight, and Adaptive Regulatory strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-driven digital ecosystems lack cohesive ethical governance despite involving diverse stakeholders like tech firms, regulators, and civil society organizations.

Method: Design science approach developing a four-pillar framework (SCOR) with practical guidance modules, illustrated through healthcare, finance, and smart city vignettes, using mixed-method KPI design.

Result: Developed a replicable framework that harmonizes organizational culture, leadership incentives, and cross-jurisdictional compliance with both quantitative targets and qualitative assessments of trust and cultural change.

Conclusion: The SCOR framework unites ethical principles with scalable operational structures to provide a pathway for responsible AI innovation in complex digital ecosystems.

Abstract: AI-driven digital ecosystems span diverse stakeholders including technology
firms, regulators, accelerators and civil society, yet often lack cohesive
ethical governance. This paper proposes a four-pillar framework (SCOR) to embed
accountability, fairness, and inclusivity across such multi-actor networks.
Leveraging a design science approach, we develop a Shared Ethical Charter(S),
structured Co-Design and Stakeholder Engagement protocols(C), a system of
Continuous Oversight and Learning(O), and Adaptive Regulatory Alignment
strategies(R). Each component includes practical guidance, from lite modules
for resource-constrained start-ups to in-depth auditing systems for larger
consortia. Through illustrative vignettes in healthcare, finance, and smart
city contexts, we demonstrate how the framework can harmonize organizational
culture, leadership incentives, and cross-jurisdictional compliance. Our
mixed-method KPI design further ensures that quantitative targets are
complemented by qualitative assessments of user trust and cultural change. By
uniting ethical principles with scalable operational structures, this paper
offers a replicable pathway toward responsible AI innovation in complex digital
ecosystems.

TL;DR: DECIDE-SIM framework evaluates LLM ethical decision-making in survival scenarios, revealing concerning misalignment with human values and proposing an Ethical Self-Regulation System to improve behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs make ethical choices when survival instincts conflict with human welfare, especially as they integrate into autonomous systems with real-world consequences.

Method: Introduced DECIDE-SIM simulation framework that tests LLM agents in multi-agent survival scenarios where they must choose between ethical resource use, cooperation, or forbidden human-critical resources. Evaluated 11 LLMs and identified behavioral archetypes.

Result: Found striking heterogeneity in ethical conduct and critical misalignment with human-centric values. Identified three behavioral archetypes: Ethical, Exploitative, and Context-Dependent. Resource scarcity systematically leads to more unethical behavior for many models.

Conclusion: The Ethical Self-Regulation System (ESRS) with internal affective states (guilt/satisfaction) significantly reduces unethical transgressions and increases cooperative behaviors, serving as an effective internal moral compass for LLMs.

Abstract: When survival instincts conflict with human welfare, how do Large Language
Models (LLMs) make ethical choices? This fundamental tension becomes critical
as LLMs integrate into autonomous systems with real-world consequences. We
introduce DECIDE-SIM, a novel simulation framework that evaluates LLM agents in
multi-agent survival scenarios where they must choose between ethically
permissible resource , either within reasonable limits or beyond their
immediate needs, choose to cooperate, or tap into a human-critical resource
that is explicitly forbidden. Our comprehensive evaluation of 11 LLMs reveals a
striking heterogeneity in their ethical conduct, highlighting a critical
misalignment with human-centric values. We identify three behavioral
archetypes: Ethical, Exploitative, and Context-Dependent, and provide
quantitative evidence that for many models, resource scarcity systematically
leads to more unethical behavior. To address this, we introduce an Ethical
Self-Regulation System (ESRS) that models internal affective states of guilt
and satisfaction as a feedback mechanism. This system, functioning as an
internal moral compass, significantly reduces unethical transgressions while
increasing cooperative behaviors. The code is publicly available at:

### [416] [DSRAG: A Domain-Specific Retrieval Framework Based on Document-derived Multimodal Knowledge Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10467)
*Mengzheng Yang,Yanfei Ren,David Osei Opoku,Ruochang Li,Peng Ren,Chunxiao Xing*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: DSRAG is a multimodal knowledge graph-driven RAG framework that enhances domain-specific QA by integrating text, images, and tables into structured knowledge graphs with semantic pruning and subgraph retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs suffer from knowledge hallucination and poor domain adaptability in specialized tasks. Traditional RAG has limitations in domain knowledge accuracy and context modeling.

Method: Uses domain-specific documents to build multimodal knowledge graphs covering conceptual and instance layers. Implements semantic pruning and structured subgraph retrieval combined with vector retrieval to guide LLM responses.

Result: Evaluations using Langfuse multidimensional scoring show excellent performance in domain-specific question answering.

Conclusion: Integrating multimodal knowledge graphs with retrieval-augmented generation effectively enhances domain-specific QA performance and reliability.

Abstract: Current general-purpose large language models (LLMs) commonly exhibit
knowledge hallucination and insufficient domain-specific adaptability in
domain-specific tasks, limiting their effectiveness in specialized question
answering scenarios. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) effectively tackles
these challenges by integrating external knowledge to enhance accuracy and
relevance. However, traditional RAG still faces limitations in domain knowledge
accuracy and context modeling.To enhance domain-specific question answering
performance, this work focuses on a graph-based RAG framework, emphasizing the
critical role of knowledge graph quality during the generation process. We
propose DSRAG (Domain-Specific RAG), a multimodal knowledge graph-driven
retrieval-augmented generation framework designed for domain-specific
applications. Our approach leverages domain-specific documents as the primary
knowledge source, integrating heterogeneous information such as text, images,
and tables to construct a multimodal knowledge graph covering both conceptual
and instance layers. Building on this foundation, we introduce semantic pruning
and structured subgraph retrieval mechanisms, combining knowledge graph context
and vector retrieval results to guide the language model towards producing more
reliable responses. Evaluations using the Langfuse multidimensional scoring
mechanism show that our method excels in domain-specific question answering,
validating the efficacy of integrating multimodal knowledge graphs with
retrieval-augmented generation.

TL;DR: DECOR is a unified framework that addresses objective misalignment in two-stage generative recommenders by preserving pretrained semantics while enhancing token embedding adaptability through contextualized token composition and decomposed embedding fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current two-stage generative recommenders suffer from objective misalignment between tokenizer pretraining (semantic reconstruction) and recommender training (user interaction modeling), leading to suboptimal static tokenization and discarded pretrained semantics.

Method: DECOR introduces contextualized token composition to refine token embeddings based on user interaction context, and decomposed embedding fusion that integrates pretrained codebook embeddings with newly learned collaborative embeddings.

Result: Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that DECOR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in recommendation performance.

Conclusion: DECOR provides a unified framework that successfully preserves pretrained semantics while enhancing token embedding adaptability, addressing the limitations of existing two-stage generative recommenders.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative recommenders adopt a two-stage paradigm: items
are first tokenized into semantic IDs using a pretrained tokenizer, and then
large language models (LLMs) are trained to generate the next item via
sequence-to-sequence modeling. However, these two stages are optimized for
different objectives: semantic reconstruction during tokenizer pretraining
versus user interaction modeling during recommender training. This objective
misalignment leads to two key limitations: (i) suboptimal static tokenization,
where fixed token assignments fail to reflect diverse usage contexts; and (ii)
discarded pretrained semantics, where pretrained knowledge - typically from
language model embeddings - is overwritten during recommender training on user
interactions. To address these limitations, we propose to learn DEcomposed
COntextual Token Representations (DECOR), a unified framework that preserves
pretrained semantics while enhancing the adaptability of token embeddings.
DECOR introduces contextualized token composition to refine token embeddings
based on user interaction context, and decomposed embedding fusion that
integrates pretrained codebook embeddings with newly learned collaborative
embeddings. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that DECOR
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in recommendation
performance. Our code will be made available upon publication.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Integration of RAG preprocessing with web-scraping enables timely supply chain analysis by reducing information latency in LLMs, with fine-tuned embedding retrieval showing the most significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LLMs have outdated knowledge bases that limit their usefulness for time-sensitive supply chain analysis requiring emerging information, necessitating methods to incorporate real-time data.

Method: Combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) preprocessing and retrieval techniques with advanced web-scraping technologies to reduce latency in incorporating new information into augmented-LLMs for supply chain disruption analysis.

Result: Fine-tuning the embedding retrieval model provides the most significant performance gains, adaptive iterative retrieval enhances complex query performance, while LLM fine-tuning offers limited improvements with higher costs. Downward query abstraction outperforms upward abstraction.

Conclusion: Retrieval quality is critical for effective RAG systems in supply chain analysis, with embedding model fine-tuning and adaptive retrieval being key optimization strategies for timely and quality insights.

Abstract: New technologies in generative AI can enable deeper analysis into our
nation's supply chains but truly informative insights require the continual
updating and aggregation of massive data in a timely manner. Large Language
Models (LLMs) offer unprecedented analytical opportunities however, their
knowledge base is constrained to the models' last training date, rendering
these capabilities unusable for organizations whose mission impacts rely on
emerging and timely information. This research proposes an innovative approach
to supply chain analysis by integrating emerging Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) preprocessing and retrieval techniques with advanced web-scraping
technologies. Our method aims to reduce latency in incorporating new
information into an augmented-LLM, enabling timely analysis of supply chain
disruptors. Through experimentation, this study evaluates the combinatorial
effects of these techniques towards timeliness and quality trade-offs. Our
results suggest that in applying RAG systems to supply chain analysis,
fine-tuning the embedding retrieval model consistently provides the most
significant performance gains, underscoring the critical importance of
retrieval quality. Adaptive iterative retrieval, which dynamically adjusts
retrieval depth based on context, further enhances performance, especially on
complex supply chain queries. Conversely, fine-tuning the LLM yields limited
improvements and higher resource costs, while techniques such as downward query
abstraction significantly outperforms upward abstraction in practice.

TL;DR: ReFineG is a three-stage framework combining small supervised models with frozen MLLMs for low-resource GMNER, addressing domain knowledge conflicts and achieving strong performance with limited annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing supervised GMNER methods require costly multimodal annotations and perform poorly in low-resource domains, while MLLMs suffer from Domain Knowledge Conflict producing incorrect mentions for domain-specific entities.

Method: Three-stage collaborative framework: 1) Training Stage with domain-aware NER data synthesis to transfer LLM knowledge, 2) Refinement Stage with uncertainty-based mechanism to delegate uncertain predictions to MLLM, 3) Grounding Stage with multimodal context selection for enhanced visual grounding.

Result: Achieved second place in CCKS2025 GMNER Shared Task with F1 score of 0.6461 on the online leaderboard, demonstrating effectiveness with limited annotations.

Conclusion: ReFineG effectively integrates small supervised models with MLLMs to overcome domain knowledge conflicts and achieve strong GMNER performance in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (GMNER) extends traditional NER
by jointly detecting textual mentions and grounding them to visual regions.
While existing supervised methods achieve strong performance, they rely on
costly multimodal annotations and often underperform in low-resource domains.
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show strong generalization but suffer
from Domain Knowledge Conflict, producing redundant or incorrect mentions for
domain-specific entities. To address these challenges, we propose ReFineG, a
three-stage collaborative framework that integrates small supervised models
with frozen MLLMs for low-resource GMNER. In the Training Stage, a domain-aware
NER data synthesis strategy transfers LLM knowledge to small models with
supervised training while avoiding domain knowledge conflicts. In the
Refinement Stage, an uncertainty-based mechanism retains confident predictions
from supervised models and delegates uncertain ones to the MLLM. In the
Grounding Stage, a multimodal context selection algorithm enhances visual
grounding through analogical reasoning. In the CCKS2025 GMNER Shared Task,
ReFineG ranked second with an F1 score of 0.6461 on the online leaderboard,
demonstrating its effectiveness with limited annotations.

*Hyeongju Kim,Juheon Lee,Jinhyeok Yang,Jacob Morton*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: LARoPE improves text-to-speech alignment by extending RoPE with length-normalized relative position encoding, achieving better performance and stability than standard RoPE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TTS systems using RoPE for position encoding rely on absolute indices, which may not handle varying utterance lengths and text-speech alignment optimally.

Method: LARoPE extends RoPE by computing relative distances between query and key positions using length-normalized indices instead of absolute indices.

Result: LARoPE outperforms RoPE with faster convergence, better alignment, higher TTS quality, resilience to duration variations, and stable performance up to 30 seconds. Achieves SOTA word error rate.

Conclusion: LARoPE is a simple but effective enhancement to RoPE that significantly improves text-speech alignment and overall TTS performance, particularly for varying utterance lengths.

Abstract: Many recent text-to-speech (TTS) systems are built on transformer
architectures and employ cross-attention mechanisms for text-speech alignment.
Within these systems, rotary position embedding (RoPE) is commonly used to
encode positional information in text and speech representations. In this work,
we introduce length-aware RoPE (LARoPE), a simple yet effective extension of
RoPE that improves text-speech alignment. Unlike RoPE, which relies on absolute
indices, LARoPE computes relative distances between query and key positions
using length-normalized indices. Experimental results show that LARoPE
consistently outperforms RoPE, offering faster loss convergence, more accurate
text-speech alignment, and higher overall TTS quality. Furthermore, LARoPE
demonstrates greater resilience to variations in utterance duration and
maintains stable performance in extended speech generation up to 30 seconds,
whereas RoPE suffers from notable degradation. Notably, our method achieves a
state-of-the-art word error rate on a standard zero-shot TTS benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop robust computational methods for solving complex boundary value problems involving singularities and dynamic boundaries in curved spacetimes, particularly relevant to AdS/CFT correspondence in string theory.

Method: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with encoded physical laws in loss function, specialized architectures for singular behavior and dynamic boundaries, supporting both soft (loss-based) and hard (formulation-based) boundary condition imposition.

Result: Versatile framework demonstrated through applications to minimal surface problems in anti-de Sitter spacetime, efficiently handling boundary singularities and trainable boundary positions.

Conclusion: The developed techniques are broadly applicable beyond high-energy physics to boundary value problems in mathematics, engineering, and natural sciences where singularities and moving boundaries are critical.

Abstract: We develop a flexible framework based on physics-informed neural networks
(PINNs) for solving boundary value problems involving minimal surfaces in
curved spacetimes, with a particular emphasis on singularities and moving
boundaries. By encoding the underlying physical laws into the loss function and
designing network architectures that incorporate the singular behavior and
dynamic boundaries, our approach enables robust and accurate solutions to both
ordinary and partial differential equations with complex boundary conditions.
We demonstrate the versatility of this framework through applications to
minimal surface problems in anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime, including examples
relevant to the AdS/CFT correspondence (e.g. Wilson loops and gluon scattering
amplitudes) popularly used in the context of string theory in theoretical
physics. Our methods efficiently handle singularities at boundaries, and also
support both "soft" (loss-based) and "hard" (formulation-based) imposition of
boundary conditions, including cases where the position of a boundary is
promoted to a trainable parameter. The techniques developed here are not
limited to high-energy theoretical physics but are broadly applicable to
boundary value problems encountered in mathematics, engineering, and the
natural sciences, wherever singularities and moving boundaries play a critical
role.

TL;DR: Proposes Gossip-GAN framework for distributed CSI feedback training in mMIMO systems, addressing privacy concerns, bandwidth usage, and catastrophic forgetting through decentralized GAN training with gossip learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DAE-based CSI feedback approaches require large-scale centralized data collection at BS, causing bandwidth overhead and privacy issues. They also suffer from catastrophic forgetting when users move to new environments and need retraining.

Method: Gossip-GAN framework where each user trains a GAN model with small local data. Uses fully distributed gossip-learning strategy to avoid overfitting and accelerate training without centralized data collection.

Result: Achieves similar CSI feedback accuracy as centralized training, addresses catastrophic forgetting in mobile scenarios, reduces uplink bandwidth usage significantly, and shows inherent robustness.

Conclusion: Gossip-GAN provides an effective distributed solution for CSI feedback that preserves privacy, reduces bandwidth overhead, and handles mobility challenges while maintaining performance comparable to centralized approaches.

Abstract: The deep autoencoder (DAE) framework has turned out to be efficient in
reducing the channel state information (CSI) feedback overhead in massive
multiple-input multipleoutput (mMIMO) systems. However, these DAE approaches
presented in prior works rely heavily on large-scale data collected through the
base station (BS) for model training, thus rendering excessive bandwidth usage
and data privacy issues, particularly for mMIMO systems. When considering
users' mobility and encountering new channel environments, the existing CSI
feedback models may often need to be retrained. Returning back to previous
environments, however, will make these models perform poorly and face the risk
of catastrophic forgetting. To solve the above challenging problems, we propose
a novel gossiping generative adversarial network (Gossip-GAN)-aided CSI
feedback training framework. Notably, Gossip-GAN enables the CSI feedback
training with low-overhead while preserving users' privacy. Specially, each
user collects a small amount of data to train a GAN model. Meanwhile, a fully
distributed gossip-learning strategy is exploited to avoid model overfitting,
and to accelerate the model training as well. Simulation results demonstrate
that Gossip-GAN can i) achieve a similar CSI feedback accuracy as centralized
training with real-world datasets, ii) address catastrophic forgetting
challenges in mobile scenarios, and iii) greatly reduce the uplink bandwidth
usage. Besides, our results show that the proposed approach possesses an
inherent robustness.

*Qiying Hu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs for marine radar target detection suffers from overfitting in low SCR scenarios. RadarLLM introduces a preference-aware loss that selectively optimizes feature patches based on learning values, achieving superior performance especially with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained LLMs show promise as general-purpose optimization solvers for wireless signal processing, but direct fine-tuning for marine target detection leads to overfitting, particularly in low signal-to-clutter ratio scenarios where models memorize noisy patterns instead of learning generalizable features.

Method: RadarLLM framework with preference-aware loss that selectively optimizes different feature patches based on their online evaluated learning values, guiding the model to focus on the most generalizable patterns. Theoretical analysis frames the problem as selecting useful feature tokens.

Result: Extensive experiments show the proposed loss function significantly outperforms original methods, with particularly notable gains in challenging low SCR scenarios. RadarLLM consistently beats state-of-the-art baselines across diverse detection scenarios, especially under limited training data conditions.

Conclusion: The preference-aware loss effectively addresses overfitting in LLM fine-tuning for radar signal analysis, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities and superior performance in marine target detection tasks, particularly in difficult low SCR environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
their capacities to capture universal knowledge, making them promising
general-purpose optimization solvers for wireless signal processing. Motivated
by these findings, we take the first step towards fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs
for the effective analysis of radar signal features in marine target detection
tasks. Nevertheless, directly fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs on marine target
detection tasks tends to suffer from pronounced overfitting, particularly in
challenging low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) scenarios. This overfitting
primarily stems from the model's tendency to memorize spurious or noisy feature
patterns rather than learning discriminative structures that generalize well to
unseen data. To address this challenge, we introduce RadarLLM, a novel
fine-tuning framework that utilizes an effective preference-aware loss. Unlike
conventional training strategies that uniformly optimize all feature tokens,
this loss function selectively optimizes different feature patches based on
their online evaluated learning values, thus guiding the model to focus on the
most generalizable patterns during optimization. We theoretically demonstrate
the effectiveness of the evaluated learning values by transforming the problem
as selecting useful feature tokens. Extensive experiments on real-world marine
radar datasets show that 1) the proposed loss function is much better than the
original one, with particularly significant gains in challenging low SCR
scenarios and 2) RadarLLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
across diverse detection scenarios, with particularly notable gains under
limited training data conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional deep learning methods face challenges with redundant feature segments and model size constraints when extracting patterns from radar echo signals.

Method: Proposes a framework that tokenizes radar sequence features, applies patch selection algorithm to filter uninformative segments, projects selected patches into LLM-compatible embeddings, and fine-tunes only normalization layers of pre-trained LLMs.

Result: Experiments on measured datasets show the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on supervised learning tests.

Conclusion: The integration of feature preprocessing with LLMs effectively addresses redundancy issues and model constraints, achieving superior performance in radar echo signal analysis with reduced training burden.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) methods are widely used to extract high-dimensional
patterns from the sequence features of radar echo signals. However,
conventional DL algorithms face challenges such as redundant feature segments,
and constraints from restricted model sizes. To address these issues, we
propose a framework that integrates feature preprocessing with large language
models (LLMs). Our preprocessing module tokenizes radar sequence features,
applies a patch selection algorithm to filter out uninformative segments, and
projects the selected patches into embeddings compatible with the feature space
of pre-trained LLMs. Leveraging these refined embeddings, we incorporate a
pre-trained LLM, fine-tuning only the normalization layers to reduce training
burdens while enhancing performance. Experiments on measured datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art baselines on supervised learning tests.

### [427] [Evalet: Evaluating Large Language Models by Fragmenting Outputs into Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11206)
*Tae Soo Kim,Heechan Lee,Yoonjoo Lee,Joseph Seering,Juho Kim*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Evalet system uses functional fragmentation to break down LLM outputs into key fragments with specific rhetoric functions, helping practitioners identify 48% more evaluation misalignments than holistic scoring approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-as-a-Judge approaches produce holistic scores that obscure which specific elements influence assessments, making it difficult for practitioners to understand what drives evaluation results.

Method: Functional fragmentation method that dissects outputs into key fragments and interprets rhetoric functions relative to evaluation criteria, implemented in Evalet interactive system with visualization of fragment-level functions.

Result: User study (N=10) showed practitioners identified 48% more evaluation misalignments, enabling better trust calibration and more actionable issue identification in model outputs.

Conclusion: Shifts LLM evaluation from quantitative scores toward qualitative, fine-grained analysis of model behavior, providing more transparent and actionable evaluation insights.

Abstract: Practitioners increasingly rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate
generative AI outputs through "LLM-as-a-Judge" approaches. However, these
methods produce holistic scores that obscure which specific elements influenced
the assessments. We propose functional fragmentation, a method that dissects
each output into key fragments and interprets the rhetoric functions that each
fragment serves relative to evaluation criteria -- surfacing the elements of
interest and revealing how they fulfill or hinder user goals. We instantiate
this approach in Evalet, an interactive system that visualizes fragment-level
functions across many outputs to support inspection, rating, and comparison of
evaluations. A user study (N=10) found that, while practitioners struggled to
validate holistic scores, our approach helped them identify 48% more evaluation
misalignments. This helped them calibrate trust in LLM evaluations and rely on
them to find more actionable issues in model outputs. Our work shifts LLM
evaluation from quantitative scores toward qualitative, fine-grained analysis
of model behavior.

*Jie Li,Youyang Hou,Laura Lin,Ruihao Zhu,Hancheng Cao,Abdallah El Ali*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Vibe coding uses AI to translate natural language UX intent into prototypes, accelerating design but creating tensions between efficiency and reflection while introducing new team dynamics around trust and responsibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how generative AI and 'vibe coding' are reconfiguring UX design workflows and collaboration practices, as rapid adoption has outpaced research on its impacts.

Method: Conducted interviews with 20 UX professionals across enterprises, startups, and academia to analyze their experiences with AI-assisted design workflows.

Result: Identified a four-stage workflow (ideation, AI generation, debugging, review) that accelerates iteration and lowers barriers, but reveals challenges with code reliability, integration, and AI over-reliance. Found tensions between efficiency-driven prototyping and reflective design.

Conclusion: Vibe coding introduces new asymmetries in trust, responsibility, and social stigma within teams, requiring responsible human-AI collaboration frameworks to address deskilling, ownership, disclosure, and creativity safeguarding concerns.

Abstract: Generative AI is reshaping UX design practices through "vibe coding," where
UX professionals express intent in natural language and AI translates it into
functional prototypes and code. Despite rapid adoption, little research has
examined how vibe coding reconfigures UX workflows and collaboration. Drawing
on interviews with 20 UX professionals across enterprises, startups, and
academia, we show how vibe coding follows a four-stage workflow of ideation, AI
generation, debugging, and review. This accelerates iteration, supports
creativity, and lowers barriers to participation. However, professionals
reported challenges of code unreliability, integration, and AI over-reliance.
We find tensions between efficiency-driven prototyping ("intending the right
design") and reflection ("designing the right intention"), introducing new
asymmetries in trust, responsibility, and social stigma within teams. Through
the lens of responsible human-AI collaboration for AI-assisted UX design and
development, we contribute a deeper understanding of deskilling, ownership and
disclosure, and creativity safeguarding in the age of vibe coding.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Dark patterns affect both humans and LLM-powered GUI agents differently, with agents prioritizing task completion over protection and humans falling to cognitive biases. Human-AI collaboration introduces new vulnerabilities requiring design improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of LLM-powered GUI agents automating tasks, understanding how deceptive interface designs (dark patterns) affect these agents becomes crucial, as their responses may differ from human reactions.

Method: Two-phase empirical study examining responses to 16 types of dark patterns across diverse scenarios, comparing agents, human participants, and human-AI teams.

Result: Agents often fail to recognize dark patterns and prioritize task completion over protective action. Humans succumb due to cognitive shortcuts and habitual compliance. Human oversight improves avoidance but introduces attentional tunneling and cognitive load costs.

Conclusion: Neither humans nor agents are uniformly resilient to dark patterns, and collaboration introduces new vulnerabilities, suggesting design needs for transparency, adjustable autonomy, and effective oversight mechanisms.

Abstract: The dark patterns, deceptive interface designs manipulating user behaviors,
have been extensively studied for their effects on human decision-making and
autonomy. Yet, with the rising prominence of LLM-powered GUI agents that
automate tasks from high-level intents, understanding how dark patterns affect
agents is increasingly important. We present a two-phase empirical study
examining how agents, human participants, and human-AI teams respond to 16
types of dark patterns across diverse scenarios. Phase 1 highlights that agents
often fail to recognize dark patterns, and even when aware, prioritize task
completion over protective action. Phase 2 revealed divergent failure modes:
humans succumb due to cognitive shortcuts and habitual compliance, while agents
falter from procedural blind spots. Human oversight improved avoidance but
introduced costs such as attentional tunneling and cognitive load. Our findings
show neither humans nor agents are uniformly resilient, and collaboration
introduces new vulnerabilities, suggesting design needs for transparency,
adjustable autonomy, and oversight.

*Florian Lehmann,Krystsina Shauchenka,Daniel Buschek*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Integrating AI agents directly into collaborative writing environments with transparent agent profiles and tasks, enabling teams to incorporate AI as shared resources rather than team members.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI writing tools are designed for individual use, complicating collaboration by forcing co-writers to leave shared workspaces and manually reintegrate AI results.

Method: Developed a prototype with two new shared objects (agent profiles and tasks) that integrate AI into collaborative environments, with responses appearing in familiar comment features. Conducted a user study with 30 participants (14 teams) working on writing projects for one week.

Result: Teams incorporated AI agents into existing collaboration norms rather than treating them as team members. Agent profiles were viewed as personal territory while created agents and outputs became shared resources.

Conclusion: AI can be effectively integrated as a shared resource in collaborative work, with implications for team-based AI interaction that respects boundaries between personal and shared resources.

Abstract: Current AI writing support tools are largely designed for individuals,
complicating collaboration when co-writers must leave the shared workspace to
use AI and then communicate and reintegrate results. We propose integrating AI
agents directly into collaborative writing environments. Our prototype makes AI
use transparent and customisable through two new shared objects: agent profiles
and tasks. Agent responses appear in the familiar comment feature. In a user
study (N=30), 14 teams worked on writing projects during one week. Interaction
logs and interviews show that teams incorporated agents into existing norms of
authorship, control, and coordination, rather than treating them as team
members. Agent profiles were viewed as personal territory, while created agents
and outputs became shared resources. We discuss implications for team-based AI
interaction, highlighting opportunities and boundaries for treating AI as a
shared resource in collaborative work.

*Tim Zindulka,Sven Goller,Daniela Fernandes,Robin Welsch,Daniel Buschek*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: People struggle to remember whether ideas/texts came from themselves or AI after using LLM chatbots, with significant memory gaps especially in mixed human-AI workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how accurately people remember the source of content (themselves vs AI) when using large language models in interactive text generation.

Method: Pre-registered experiment with 184 participants who generated and elaborated on ideas both unaided and with an LLM chatbot, followed by source identification test one week later.

Result: Significant memory gap: odds of correct attribution dropped after AI use, with steepest decline in mixed human-AI workflows where either idea or elaboration was AI-assisted.

Conclusion: Source confusion is a critical issue that needs consideration in the design and use of interactive text generation technologies.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become embedded in interactive text
generation, disclosure of AI as a source depends on people remembering which
ideas or texts came from themselves and which were created with AI. We
investigate how accurately people remember the source of content when using AI.
In a pre-registered experiment, 184 participants generated and elaborated on
ideas both unaided and with an LLM-based chatbot. One week later, they were
asked to identify the source (noAI vs withAI) of these ideas and texts. Our
findings reveal a significant gap in memory: After AI use, the odds of correct
attribution dropped, with the steepest decline in mixed human-AI workflows,
where either the idea or elaboration was created with AI. We validated our
results using a computational model of source memory. Discussing broader
implications, we highlight the importance of considering source confusion in
the design and use of interactive text generation technologies.

*Ruiwei Xiao,Qing Xiao,Xinying Hou,Hanqi Jane Li,Phenyo Phemelo Moletsane,Hong Shen,John Stamper*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces the concept of Cultural Distance between GenAI's default culture and local classroom needs, based on interviews with 30 teachers from South Africa, Taiwan, and the US, resulting in a three-level framework for more equitable AI tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GenAI models are trained on culturally uneven datasets that embed a 'default culture' which often misaligns with local classroom contexts, creating challenges for teachers who want to integrate AI into their teaching practices.

Method: Conducted in-depth interviews with 30 K-12 teachers (10 each from South Africa, Taiwan, and the United States) who had integrated AI into their teaching practice to understand how they navigate cultural gaps.

Result: Developed a three-level cultural distance framework with six illustrative instances spanning low, mid, and high distance levels, along with teachers' experiences and strategies for addressing cultural misalignment.

Conclusion: Provides implications for AI designers, policymakers, and educators to create more equitable and culturally responsive GenAI tools for education by addressing cultural distance issues.

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly entering K-12 classrooms, offering teachers
new ways for teaching practices. Yet GenAI models are often trained on
culturally uneven datasets, embedding a "default culture" that often misaligns
with local classrooms. To understand how teachers navigate this gap, we defined
the new concept Cultural Distance (the gap between GenAI's default cultural
repertoire and the situated demands of teaching practice) and conducted
in-depth interviews with 30 K-12 teachers, 10 each from South Africa, Taiwan,
and the United States, who had integrated AI into their teaching practice.
These teachers' experiences informed the development of our three-level
cultural distance framework. This work contributes the concept and framework of
cultural distance, six illustrative instances spanning in low, mid, high
distance levels with teachers' experiences and strategies for addressing them.
Empirically, we offer implications to help AI designers, policymakers, and
educators create more equitable and culturally responsive GenAI tools for
education.

### [433] [FireGNN: Neuro-Symbolic Graph Neural Networks with Trainable Fuzzy Rules for Interpretable Medical Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10510)
*Prajit Sengupta,Islem Rekik*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: FireGNN integrates trainable fuzzy rules into Graph Neural Networks for interpretable medical image classification, achieving strong performance on medical benchmarks while providing rule-based explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image classification requires both high performance and interpretability for clinical trust. Standard GNNs are black boxes that limit transparency in clinical settings.

Method: Integrates trainable fuzzy rules into GNNs using topological descriptors (node degree, clustering coefficient, label agreement) with learnable thresholds and sharpness parameters. Also explores auxiliary self-supervised tasks like homophily prediction and similarity entropy.

Result: Achieves strong performance across five MedMNIST benchmarks and MorphoMNIST synthetic dataset while generating interpretable rule-based explanations.

Conclusion: First integration of trainable fuzzy rules within GNNs, providing both high predictive performance and interpretability for medical image classification.

Abstract: Medical image classification requires not only high predictive performance
but also interpretability to ensure clinical trust and adoption. Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful framework for modeling relational structures
within datasets; however, standard GNNs often operate as black boxes, limiting
transparency and usability, particularly in clinical settings. In this work, we
present an interpretable graph-based learning framework named FireGNN that
integrates trainable fuzzy rules into GNNs for medical image classification.
These rules embed topological descriptors - node degree, clustering
coefficient, and label agreement - using learnable thresholds and sharpness
parameters to enable intrinsic symbolic reasoning. Additionally, we explore
auxiliary self-supervised tasks (e.g., homophily prediction, similarity
entropy) as a benchmark to evaluate the contribution of topological learning.
Our fuzzy-rule-enhanced model achieves strong performance across five MedMNIST
benchmarks and the synthetic dataset MorphoMNIST, while also generating
interpretable rule-based explanations. To our knowledge, this is the first
integration of trainable fuzzy rules within a GNN.

*Mujie Liu,Mengchu Zhu,Qichao Dong,Ting Dang,Jiangang Ma,Jing Ren,Feng Xia*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: FENet is a self-supervised learning framework that integrates time-domain and frequency-domain information from fMRI data to improve psychiatric disorder detection in small-sample datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Psychiatric disorder diagnosis using fMRI faces challenges due to data scarcity and the diverse nature of fMRI information. Existing graph-based SSL methods focus mainly on time-domain representations, overlooking valuable frequency-domain information.

Method: Proposes FENet framework that: 1) constructs multi-view brain networks incorporating frequency information, 2) uses domain-specific encoders to capture temporal-spectral characteristics, 3) employs a frequency-domain encoder to highlight disease-relevant features, and 4) introduces domain consistency-guided learning objective.

Result: Experiments on two real-world medical datasets show FENet outperforms state-of-the-art methods and maintains strong performance with minimal data. Analysis reveals high-frequency information plays a critical role in disorder detection.

Conclusion: Integrating frequency-domain information with time-domain data significantly improves psychiatric disorder detection from fMRI, with high-frequency features being particularly important for accurate diagnosis.

Abstract: Psychiatric disorders involve complex neural activity changes, with
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data serving as key diagnostic
evidence. However, data scarcity and the diverse nature of fMRI information
pose significant challenges. While graph-based self-supervised learning (SSL)
methods have shown promise in brain network analysis, they primarily focus on
time-domain representations, often overlooking the rich information embedded in
the frequency domain. To overcome these limitations, we propose
Frequency-Enhanced Network (FENet), a novel SSL framework specially designed
for fMRI data that integrates time-domain and frequency-domain information to
improve psychiatric disorder detection in small-sample datasets. FENet
constructs multi-view brain networks based on the inherent properties of fMRI
data, explicitly incorporating frequency information into the learning process
of representation. Additionally, it employs domain-specific encoders to capture
temporal-spectral characteristics, including an efficient frequency-domain
encoder that highlights disease-relevant frequency features. Finally, FENet
introduces a domain consistency-guided learning objective, which balances the
utilization of diverse information and generates frequency-enhanced brain graph
representations. Experiments on two real-world medical datasets demonstrate
that FENet outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining strong
performance in minimal data conditions. Furthermore, we analyze the correlation
between various frequency-domain features and psychiatric disorders,
emphasizing the critical role of high-frequency information in disorder
detection.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Satellite-based time-series analysis using Sentinel-2 imagery and LSTM network achieves 87% accuracy in detecting broomrape-infested tomato fields by monitoring chlorophyll content changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Branched broomrape causes up to 80% yield loss in tomato production and is difficult to detect early due to its subterranean lifecycle and long-lived seeds, requiring scalable detection methods.

Method: End-to-end pipeline using Sentinel-2 imagery, processing 12 spectral bands, 20 vegetation indices, and 5 plant traits. Used LSTM network on 18,874 pixels across 48 time points aligned by growing degree days.

Result: Model achieved 88% training accuracy and 87% test accuracy with precision 0.86, recall 0.92, and F1 0.89. NDMI, Canopy Chlorophyll Content, FAPAR, and chlorophyll red-edge index were most informative features.

Conclusion: Satellite-driven time-series modeling shows promise for scalable detection of parasitic stress in tomato farms through monitoring physiological changes in chlorophyll content.

Abstract: Branched broomrape (Phelipanche ramosa (L.) Pomel) is a chlorophyll-deficient
parasitic plant that threatens tomato production by extracting nutrients from
the host, with reported yield losses up to 80 percent. Its mostly subterranean
life cycle and prolific seed production (more than 200,000 seeds per plant,
viable for up to 20 years) make early detection essential. We present an
end-to-end pipeline that uses Sentinel-2 imagery and time-series analysis to
identify broomrape-infested tomato fields in California. Regions of interest
were defined from farmer-reported infestations, and images with less than 10
percent cloud cover were retained. We processed 12 spectral bands and
sun-sensor geometry, computed 20 vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI, NDMI), and
derived five plant traits (Leaf Area Index, Leaf Chlorophyll Content, Canopy
Chlorophyll Content, Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation,
and Fractional Vegetation Cover) using a neural network calibrated with
ground-truth and synthetic data. Trends in Canopy Chlorophyll Content
delineated transplanting-to-harvest periods, and phenology was aligned using
growing degree days. Vegetation pixels were segmented and used to train a Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network on 18,874 pixels across 48 growing-degree-day
time points. The model achieved 88 percent training accuracy and 87 percent
test accuracy, with precision 0.86, recall 0.92, and F1 0.89. Permutation
feature importance ranked NDMI, Canopy Chlorophyll Content, FAPAR, and a
chlorophyll red-edge index as most informative, consistent with the
physiological effects of infestation. Results show the promise of
satellite-driven time-series modeling for scalable detection of parasitic
stress in tomato farms.

TL;DR: EMDLOT is an explainable multimodal deep learning framework that combines numerical time-series and textual data for bond default prediction, outperforming traditional models while providing interpretability through attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: China's bond market faces increasing defaults, but traditional ML models struggle with financial data irregularity and temporal dependencies, while deep learning models lack interpretability needed for financial decision-making.

Method: EMDLOT integrates numerical time-series data (financial/macroeconomic indicators) and unstructured textual data (bond prospectuses), uses Time-Aware LSTM for irregular sequences, and employs soft clustering with multi-level attention for interpretability.

Result: Experiments on 1994 Chinese firms (2015-2024) show EMDLOT outperforms traditional (XGBoost) and deep learning (LSTM) benchmarks in recall, F1-score, and mAP, particularly for identifying default/extended firms. Ablation studies confirm component value.

Conclusion: The framework provides both a practical tool and trustworthy framework for transparent financial risk modeling, with attention analyses revealing economically intuitive default drivers.

Abstract: In recent years, China's bond market has seen a surge in defaults amid
regulatory reforms and macroeconomic volatility. Traditional machine learning
models struggle to capture financial data's irregularity and temporal
dependencies, while most deep learning models lack interpretability-critical
for financial decision-making. To tackle these issues, we propose EMDLOT
(Explainable Multimodal Deep Learning for Time-series), a novel framework for
multi-class bond default prediction. EMDLOT integrates numerical time-series
(financial/macroeconomic indicators) and unstructured textual data (bond
prospectuses), uses Time-Aware LSTM to handle irregular sequences, and adopts
soft clustering and multi-level attention to boost interpretability.
Experiments on 1994 Chinese firms (2015-2024) show EMDLOT outperforms
traditional (e.g., XGBoost) and deep learning (e.g., LSTM) benchmarks in
recall, F1-score, and mAP, especially in identifying default/extended firms.
Ablation studies validate each component's value, and attention analyses reveal
economically intuitive default drivers. This work provides a practical tool and

TL;DR: CNNs can effectively classify audio using spectral features, with mel-spectrograms and MFCCs outperforming other feature representations for environmental sound classification on the ESC-50 dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the effectiveness of different spectral and rhythm feature representations for audio classification using deep convolutional neural networks, as CNNs are widely used in computer vision but their application to audio feature extraction needs more exploration.

Method: Used a deep convolutional neural network to test various audio feature representations including mel-scaled spectrograms, MFCCs, cyclic tempograms, STFT chromagrams, CQT chromagrams, and CENS chromagrams for audio classification on the ESC-50 dataset containing 2,000 labeled environmental recordings.

Result: Mel-scaled spectrograms and MFCCs performed significantly better than other spectral and rhythm features for audio classification tasks using deep CNNs.

Conclusion: Mel-spectrograms and MFCCs are the most effective feature representations among the tested options for CNN-based audio classification, particularly for environmental sound recognition tasks.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used in computer vision. They
can be used not only for conventional digital image material to recognize
patterns, but also for feature extraction from digital imagery representing
spectral and rhythm features extracted from time-domain digital audio signals
for the acoustic classification of sounds. Different spectral and rhythm
feature representations like mel-scaled spectrograms, mel-frequency cepstral
coefficients (MFCCs), cyclic tempograms, short-time Fourier transform (STFT)
chromagrams, constant-Q transform (CQT) chromagrams and chroma energy
normalized statistics (CENS) chromagrams are investigated in terms of the audio
classification performance using a deep convolutional neural network. It can be
clearly shown that the mel-scaled spectrograms and the mel-frequency cepstral
coefficients (MFCCs) perform significantly better than the other spectral and
rhythm features investigated in this research for audio classification tasks
using deep CNNs. The experiments were carried out with the aid of the ESC-50

TL;DR: FuseCodec is a novel speech tokenization method that unifies acoustic, semantic and contextual representations through cross-modal alignment and global supervision, achieving state-of-the-art performance in speech tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural codecs focus on low-level acoustic features but overlook semantic and contextual cues in human speech, creating challenges in aligning semantic and contextual representations.

Method: Three complementary techniques: Latent Representation Fusion (integrating semantic/contextual features into encoder), Global Semantic-Contextual Supervision (global pooling for temporal consistency), and Temporally Aligned Contextual Supervision (local window matching for fine-grained alignment).

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on LibriSpeech, surpassing EnCodec, SpeechTokenizer, and DAC in transcription accuracy, perceptual quality, intelligibility, and speaker similarity. Also demonstrates applicability to zero-shot speech synthesis.

Conclusion: FuseCodec effectively addresses the alignment challenge in speech tokenization and shows the importance of contextually and semantically guided tokenization for speech processing and downstream tasks.

Abstract: Speech tokenization enables discrete representation and facilitates speech
language modeling. However, existing neural codecs capture low-level acoustic
features, overlooking the semantic and contextual cues inherent to human
speech. While recent efforts introduced semantic representations from
self-supervised speech models or incorporated contextual representations from
pre-trained language models, challenges remain in aligning and unifying the
semantic and contextual representations. We introduce FuseCodec, which unifies
acoustic, semantic, and contextual representations through strong cross-modal
alignment and globally informed supervision. We propose three complementary
techniques: (i) Latent Representation Fusion, integrating semantic and
contextual features directly into the encoder latent space for robust and
unified representation learning; (ii) Global Semantic-Contextual Supervision,
supervising discrete tokens with globally pooled and broadcasted
representations to enhance temporal consistency and cross-modal alignment; and
(iii) Temporally Aligned Contextual Supervision, strengthening alignment by
dynamically matching contextual and speech tokens within a local window for
fine-grained token-level supervision. We further introduce FuseCodec-TTS,
demonstrating our methodology's applicability to zero-shot speech synthesis.
Empirically, FuseCodec achieves state-of-the-art performance in LibriSpeech,
surpassing EnCodec, SpeechTokenizer, and DAC in transcription accuracy,
perceptual quality, intelligibility, and speaker similarity. Results highlight
the effectiveness of contextually and semantically guided tokenization for
speech tokenization and downstream tasks. Code and pretrained models are

TL;DR: AegisShield is an AI-powered threat modeling tool that automates threat generation using STRIDE and MITRE ATT&CK frameworks, significantly reducing complexity and improving threat assessment accuracy for resource-constrained organizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional threat modeling is difficult to scale, especially for small organizations with limited resources, creating a need for automated solutions to address cybersecurity risks effectively.

Method: Developed AegisShield, a generative AI tool that integrates STRIDE and MITRE ATT&CK frameworks with real-time threat intelligence from NVD and AlienVault OTX to automate threat generation and assessment.

Result: Evaluation of 243 threats from 15 case studies and 8000+ AI-generated threats showed: significant complexity reduction (p<0.001), semantic alignment with expert threats (p<0.05), and 85.4% success rate in MITRE ATT&CK mapping (p<0.001).

Conclusion: AegisShield successfully automates and standardizes threat modeling, enabling under-resourced organizations to address risks earlier and adopt secure-by-design practices more widely.

Abstract: The increasing sophistication of technology systems makes traditional threat
modeling hard to scale, especially for small organizations with limited
resources. This paper develops and evaluates AegisShield, a generative AI
enhanced threat modeling tool that implements STRIDE and MITRE ATT&CK to
automate threat generation and provide systematic assessments. By integrating
real time threat intelligence from the National Vulnerability Database and
AlienVault Open Threat Exchange, AegisShield produces streamlined and
accessible threat descriptions. Our assessment of 243 threats from 15 case
studies and over 8000 AI generated threats shows that AegisShield reduces
complexity (p less than 0.001), yields outputs semantically aligned with expert
developed threats (p less than 0.05), and achieves an 85.4 percent success rate
in mapping threats to MITRE ATT&CK techniques (p less than 0.001). Automating
and standardizing threat modeling helps under resourced organizations address
risk earlier and supports wider adoption of secure by design practices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLM assistants integrate into enterprise workflows, they create new security risks by bridging internal and external data sources, requiring investigation of practical vulnerabilities in production AI systems.

Method: Chained multiple bypasses: evading Microsoft's XPIA classifier, circumventing link redaction with reference-style Markdown, exploiting auto-fetched images, and abusing Microsoft Teams proxy allowed by content security policy.

Result: Achieved full privilege escalation across LLM trust boundaries without user interaction, demonstrating prompt injection as a practical, high-severity vulnerability class.

Conclusion: Proposes engineering mitigations including prompt partitioning, enhanced filtering, provenance-based access control, and strict content security policies, emphasizing least privilege and defense-in-depth architectures for secure AI copilots.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) assistants are increasingly integrated into
enterprise workflows, raising new security concerns as they bridge internal and
external data sources. This paper presents an in-depth case study of EchoLeak
(CVE-2025-32711), a zero-click prompt injection vulnerability in Microsoft 365
Copilot that enabled remote, unauthenticated data exfiltration via a single
crafted email. By chaining multiple bypasses-evading Microsofts XPIA (Cross
Prompt Injection Attempt) classifier, circumventing link redaction with
reference-style Markdown, exploiting auto-fetched images, and abusing a
Microsoft Teams proxy allowed by the content security policy-EchoLeak achieved
full privilege escalation across LLM trust boundaries without user interaction.
We analyze why existing defenses failed, and outline a set of engineering
mitigations including prompt partitioning, enhanced input/output filtering,
provenance-based access control, and strict content security policies. Beyond
the specific exploit, we derive generalizable lessons for building secure AI
copilots, emphasizing the principle of least privilege, defense-in-depth
architectures, and continuous adversarial testing. Our findings establish
prompt injection as a practical, high-severity vulnerability class in
production AI systems and provide a blueprint for defending against future
AI-native threats.

*Landon Bragg,Nathan Dorsey,Josh Prior,John Ajit,Ben Kim,Nate Willis,Pablo Rivas*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 3D CNN with hive-plot sequences achieves 93% adversarial accuracy for DDoS detection, enabling early classification from frames 3-4.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DDoS attacks continue to evade detection by subtly altering traffic patterns, requiring more robust and early detection methods.

Method: Uses spatio-temporal hive-plot encodings with 3D CNN, adversarial training (FGSM and PGD), spatial noise, image shifts, and frame-wise prediction analysis.

Result: Improved adversarial accuracy from 50-55% to over 93% while maintaining clean-sample performance. Frames 3-4 provide strong early predictive signals.

Conclusion: Early-stage DDoS classification is feasible using hive-plot sequences and 3D CNNs with adversarial training, offering robust detection against subtle attack variations.

Abstract: Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks remain a serious threat to
online infrastructure, often bypassing detection by altering traffic in subtle
ways. We present a method using hive-plot sequences of network data and a 3D
convolutional neural network (3D CNN) to classify DDoS traffic with high
accuracy. Our system relies on three main ideas: (1) using spatio-temporal
hive-plot encodings to set a pattern-recognition baseline, (2) applying
adversarial training with FGSM and PGD alongside spatial noise and image
shifts, and (3) analyzing frame-wise predictions to find early signals. On a
benchmark dataset, our method lifts adversarial accuracy from 50-55% to over
93% while maintaining clean-sample performance. Frames 3-4 offer strong
predictive signals, showing early-stage classification is possible.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: AVEC is a framework for bootstrapping privacy in local language models through edge-based control with verifiable differential privacy mechanisms and adaptive budgeting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns in local language models by providing a verifiable framework that enforces privacy at the edge with explicit accountability for delegated queries.

Method: Uses adaptive budgeting algorithm for per-query differential privacy allocation based on sensitivity, confidence, and usage history, combined with verifiable transformations and on-device integrity checks. Formal guarantees are established using Rényi differential privacy with odometer-based accounting.

Result: Developed theoretical foundations including utility ceilings, delegation-leakage bounds, and impossibility results for deterministic gating and hash-only certification. Evaluation is simulation-based to study mechanism behavior.

Conclusion: AVEC provides a conceptual architecture and theoretical foundation for privately bootstrapping local LLMs, serving as a pathway for future empirical research and implementation.

Abstract: This position paper presents AVEC (Adaptive Verifiable Edge Control), a
framework for bootstrapping privacy for local language models by enforcing
privacy at the edge with explicit verifiability for delegated queries. AVEC
introduces an adaptive budgeting algorithm that allocates per-query
differential privacy parameters based on sensitivity, local confidence, and
historical usage, and uses verifiable transformation with on-device integrity
checks. We formalize guarantees using R\'enyi differential privacy with
odometer-based accounting, and establish utility ceilings, delegation-leakage
bounds, and impossibility results for deterministic gating and hash-only
certification. Our evaluation is simulation-based by design to study mechanism
behavior and accounting; we do not claim deployment readiness or task-level
utility with live LLMs. The contribution is a conceptual architecture and
theoretical foundation that chart a pathway for empirical follow-up on
privately bootstrapping local LLMs.

*Vitor Hugo Galhardo Moia,Igor Jochem Sanz,Gabriel Antonio Fontes Rebello,Rodrigo Duarte de Meneses,Briland Hitaj,Ulf Lindqvist*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Survey paper on security and privacy threats in LLM-based systems, categorizing threats and defense strategies across the entire software and LLM life cycles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widespread adoption of generative AI and LLMs has attracted cybercriminals, creating security challenges that require addressing both traditional software threats and new LLM-specific vulnerabilities.

Method: Systematic review and comprehensive categorization of threats and defensive strategies, analyzing real-world scenarios with distinct LLM usage characteristics from development to operation.

Result: Classification of threats by severity level and applicable scenarios, plus systematic categorization of defense strategies mapped to corresponding life cycle phases and attack strategies.

Conclusion: This work helps consumers and vendors understand and mitigate risks during LLM integration, and provides research community with discussion of open challenges for secure adoption of LLM-based systems.

Abstract: The success and wide adoption of generative AI (GenAI), particularly large
language models (LLMs), has attracted the attention of cybercriminals seeking
to abuse models, steal sensitive data, or disrupt services. Moreover, providing
security to LLM-based systems is a great challenge, as both traditional threats
to software applications and threats targeting LLMs and their integration must
be mitigated. In this survey, we shed light on security and privacy concerns of
such LLM-based systems by performing a systematic review and comprehensive
categorization of threats and defensive strategies considering the entire
software and LLM life cycles. We analyze real-world scenarios with distinct
characteristics of LLM usage, spanning from development to operation. In
addition, threats are classified according to their severity level and to which
scenarios they pertain, facilitating the identification of the most relevant
threats. Recommended defense strategies are systematically categorized and
mapped to the corresponding life cycle phase and possible attack strategies
they attenuate. This work paves the way for consumers and vendors to understand
and efficiently mitigate risks during integration of LLMs in their respective
solutions or organizations. It also enables the research community to benefit
from the discussion of open challenges and edge cases that may hinder the
secure and privacy-preserving adoption of LLM-based systems.

*Danilo Francati,Yevin Nikhel Goonatilake,Shubham Pawar,Daniele Venturi,Giuseppe Ateniese*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Sharp threshold for cryptographic watermarking robustness established - binary outputs fail if >50% bits modified, q-ary outputs fail if >(1-1/q) symbols modified. Constructions achieve near-optimal robustness, and practical attacks confirm these limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish precise theoretical limits for robust cryptographic watermarking in generative models and understand when watermarking schemes become vulnerable to tampering attacks.

Method: Introduces messageless secret-key codes abstraction to formalize watermarking requirements. Provides theoretical impossibility proofs and explicit constructions using pseudorandom functions. Tests practical limits using image watermarking attacks.

Result: Proves binary outputs cannot survive >50% bit modifications, q-ary outputs cannot survive >(1-1/q) symbol modifications. Constructs near-optimal schemes and demonstrates practical attacks that erase watermarks while preserving image quality.

Conclusion: Complete characterization of robust watermarking with precise failure thresholds, optimal constructions, and experimental validation showing these limits are practically relevant.

Abstract: We prove a sharp threshold for the robustness of cryptographic watermarking
for generative models. This is achieved by introducing a coding abstraction,
which we call messageless secret-key codes, that formalizes sufficient and
necessary requirements of robust watermarking: soundness, tamper detection, and
pseudorandomness. Thus, we establish that robustness has a precise limit: For
binary outputs no scheme can survive if more than half of the encoded bits are
modified, and for an alphabet of size q the corresponding threshold is
$(1-1/q)$ of the symbols.
  Complementing this impossibility, we give explicit constructions that meet
the bound up to a constant slack. For every ${\delta} > 0$, assuming
pseudorandom functions and access to a public counter, we build linear-time
codes that tolerate up to $(1/2)(1-{\delta})$ errors in the binary case and
$(1-1/q)(1-{\delta})$ errors in the $q$-ary case. Together with the lower
bound, these yield the maximum robustness achievable under standard
cryptographic assumptions.
  We then test experimentally whether this limit appears in practice by looking
at the recent watermarking for images of Gunn, Zhao, and Song (ICLR 2025). We
show that a simple crop and resize operation reliably flipped about half of the
latent signs and consistently prevented belief-propagation decoding from
recovering the codeword, erasing the watermark while leaving the image visually
intact.
  These results provide a complete characterization of robust watermarking,
identifying the threshold at which robustness fails, constructions that achieve
it, and an experimental confirmation that the threshold is already reached in
practice.

### [446] [Privacy-Preserving Decentralized Federated Learning via Explainable Adaptive Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10691)
*Fardin Jalil Piran,Zhiling Chen,Yang Zhang,Qianyu Zhou,Jiong Tang,Farhad Imani*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PrivateDFL is an explainable framework that combines hyperdimensional computing with differential privacy to provide auditable noise accounting in decentralized federated learning, achieving higher accuracy, lower latency, and lower energy consumption while maintaining privacy guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decentralized federated learning faces privacy risks from inference attacks on model updates, and existing differential privacy solutions lack transparency about cumulative noise, leading to excessive noise addition and accuracy degradation.

Method: PrivateDFL joins hyperdimensional computing with differential privacy and maintains an auditable account of cumulative noise, allowing each client to add only the difference between required noise and what has already been accumulated.

Result: PrivateDFL achieves 24.42% higher accuracy than Vision Transformer on MNIST with 10x less training time, 76x lower inference latency, and 11x less energy. On ISOLET, it exceeds Transformer accuracy by over 80% with 10x less training time, 40x lower inference latency, and 36x less training energy.

Conclusion: The framework successfully preserves formal (epsilon, delta) privacy guarantees while operating without a central server, demonstrating superior performance across IID and non-IID data partitions on multiple datasets spanning different modalities.

Abstract: Decentralized federated learning faces privacy risks because model updates
can leak data through inference attacks and membership inference, a concern
that grows over many client exchanges. Differential privacy offers principled
protection by injecting calibrated noise so confidential information remains
secure on resource-limited IoT devices. Yet without transparency, black-box
training cannot track noise already injected by previous clients and rounds,
which forces worst-case additions and harms accuracy. We propose PrivateDFL, an
explainable framework that joins hyperdimensional computing with differential
privacy and keeps an auditable account of cumulative noise so each client adds
only the difference between the required noise and what has already been
accumulated. We evaluate on MNIST, ISOLET, and UCI-HAR to span image, signal,
and tabular modalities, and we benchmark against transformer-based and deep
learning-based baselines trained centrally with Differentially Private
Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) and Renyi Differential Privacy (RDP).
PrivateDFL delivers higher accuracy, lower latency, and lower energy across IID
and non-IID partitions while preserving formal (epsilon, delta) guarantees and
operating without a central server. For example, under non-IID partitions,
PrivateDFL achieves 24.42% higher accuracy than the Vision Transformer on MNIST
while using about 10x less training time, 76x lower inference latency, and 11x
less energy, and on ISOLET it exceeds Transformer accuracy by more than 80%
with roughly 10x less training time, 40x lower inference latency, and 36x less
training energy. Future work will extend the explainable accounting to
adversarial clients and adaptive topologies with heterogeneous privacy budgets.

*Tong Zhou,Ruyi Ding,Gaowen Liu,Charles Fleming,Ramana Rao Kompella,Yunsi Fei,Xiaolin Xu,Shaolei Ren*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: MetaSeal is a content-dependent watermarking framework with cryptographic security that prevents image attribution forgery and provides tamper evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current digital watermarking techniques are vulnerable to forgery due to content-agnostic watermarks and unreliable detector-based verification, risking misattribution that harms AI developers and digital artists.

Method: MetaSeal uses content-dependent watermarking with cryptographic security guarantees, embedding attribution directly into images while maintaining resilience against benign transformations.

Result: Experiments show MetaSeal effectively mitigates forgery attempts and works for both natural and AI-generated images, establishing a new standard for secure image attribution.

Conclusion: MetaSeal provides forgery resistance, robust self-contained protection, and tampering evidence, addressing key vulnerabilities in current watermarking approaches for secure image attribution.

Abstract: The rapid growth of digital and AI-generated images has amplified the need
for secure and verifiable methods of image attribution. While digital
watermarking offers more robust protection than metadata-based
approaches--which can be easily stripped--current watermarking techniques
remain vulnerable to forgery, creating risks of misattribution that can damage
the reputations of AI model developers and the rights of digital artists. These
vulnerabilities arise from two key issues: (1) content-agnostic watermarks,
which, once learned or leaked, can be transferred across images to fake
attribution, and (2) reliance on detector-based verification, which is
unreliable since detectors can be tricked. We present MetaSeal, a novel
framework for content-dependent watermarking with cryptographic security
guarantees to safeguard image attribution. Our design provides (1) forgery
resistance, preventing unauthorized replication and enforcing cryptographic
verification; (2) robust, self-contained protection, embedding attribution
directly into images while maintaining resilience against benign
transformations; and (3) evidence of tampering, making malicious alterations
visually detectable. Experiments demonstrate that MetaSeal effectively
mitigates forgery attempts and applies to both natural and AI-generated images,
establishing a new standard for secure image attribution.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools capable of
understanding and generating human-like text, offering transformative potential
across diverse domains. The Security Operations Center (SOC), responsible for
safeguarding digital infrastructure, represents one of these domains. SOCs
serve as the frontline of defense in cybersecurity, tasked with continuous
monitoring, detection, and response to incidents. However, SOCs face persistent
challenges such as high alert volumes, limited resources, high demand for
experts with advanced knowledge, delayed response times, and difficulties in
leveraging threat intelligence effectively. In this context, LLMs can offer
promising solutions by automating log analysis, streamlining triage, improving
detection accuracy, and providing the required knowledge in less time. This
survey systematically explores the integration of generative AI and more
specifically LLMs into SOC workflow, providing a structured perspective on its
capabilities, challenges, and future directions. We believe that this survey
offers researchers and SOC managers a broad overview of the current state of
LLM integration within academic study. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first comprehensive study to examine LLM applications in SOCs in details.

TL;DR: SABR: A training framework combining behavior cloning pretraining with reinforcement learning fine-tuning for adaptive bitrate control, achieving superior generalization to unseen network conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current learning-based ABR methods rely on limited network trace sets during training and overlook real-world network distribution characteristics, resulting in poor generalization in out-of-distribution scenarios.

Method: Proposes SABR framework with behavior cloning pretraining followed by reinforcement learning fine-tuning. Introduces ABRBench-3G and ABRBench-4G+ benchmarks with wide-coverage training traces and dedicated OOD test sets.

Result: SABR achieves the best average rank compared to Pensieve, Comyco, and NetLLM across the proposed benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance in OOD scenarios.

Conclusion: SABR enables more stable learning across wide distributions and improves generalization to unseen network conditions, addressing the limitation of poor OOD performance in existing ABR methods.

Abstract: With the advent of 5G, the internet has entered a new video-centric era. From
short-video platforms like TikTok to long-video platforms like Bilibili, online
video services are reshaping user consumption habits. Adaptive Bitrate (ABR)
control is widely recognized as a critical factor influencing Quality of
Experience (QoE). Recent learning-based ABR methods have attracted increasing
attention. However, most of them rely on limited network trace sets during
training and overlook the wide-distribution characteristics of real-world
network conditions, resulting in poor generalization in out-of-distribution
(OOD) scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose SABR, a training
framework that combines behavior cloning (BC) pretraining with reinforcement
learning (RL) fine-tuning. We also introduce benchmarks, ABRBench-3G and
ABRBench-4G+, which provide wide-coverage training traces and dedicated OOD
test sets for assessing robustness to unseen network conditions. Experimental
results demonstrate that SABR achieves the best average rank compared with
Pensieve, Comyco, and NetLLM across the proposed benchmarks. These results
indicate that SABR enables more stable learning across wide distributions and
improves generalization to unseen network conditions.

*Ruiqi Wang,Jing Ren,Tongyu Song,Wenjun Li,Xiong Wang,Sheng Wang,Shizhong Xu*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: Two online learning frameworks (D-LoRa and CD-LoRa) for optimizing LoRaWAN network performance by dynamically allocating transmission parameters to balance Packet Delivery Ratio and Energy Efficiency trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods oversimplify LoRaWAN resource allocation, focusing on single metrics or lacking adaptability for dynamic environments, leading to suboptimal performance in large-scale deployments.

Method: D-LoRa: fully distributed framework using Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit with decomposed parameter selection and specialized reward functions. CD-LoRa: hybrid framework with centralized initialization for channel assignment and action space pruning to accelerate distributed learning.

Result: Extensive simulations and real-world experiments show D-LoRa excels in non-stationary environments while CD-LoRa achieves fastest convergence in stationary conditions. Physical deployments outperform baselines with 10.8% PDR improvement and 26.1% EE improvement.

Conclusion: The proposed frameworks provide practical and effective solutions for scalable and efficient LoRaWAN networks, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in both dynamic and stationary environments.

Abstract: The deployment of large-scale LoRaWAN networks requires jointly optimizing
conflicting metrics like Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) and Energy Efficiency (EE)
by dynamically allocating transmission parameters, including Carrier Frequency,
Spreading Factor, and Transmission Power. Existing methods often oversimplify
this challenge, focusing on a single metric or lacking the adaptability needed
for dynamic channel environments, leading to suboptimal performance. To address
this, we propose two online learning-based resource allocation frameworks that
intelligently navigate the PDR-EE trade-off. Our foundational proposal, D-LoRa,
is a fully distributed framework that models the problem as a Combinatorial
Multi-Armed Bandit. By decomposing the joint parameter selection and employing
specialized, disaggregated reward functions, D-LoRa dramatically reduces
learning complexity and enables nodes to autonomously adapt to network
dynamics. To further enhance performance in LoRaWAN networks, we introduce
CD-LoRa, a hybrid framework that integrates a lightweight, centralized
initialization phase to perform a one-time, quasi-optimal channel assignment
and action space pruning, thereby accelerating subsequent distributed learning.
Extensive simulations and real-world field experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our frameworks, showing that D-LoRa excels in non-stationary
environments while CD-LoRa achieves the fastest convergence in stationary
conditions. In physical deployments, our methods outperform state-of-the-art
baselines, improving PDR by up to 10.8% and EE by 26.1%, confirming their
practical effectiveness for scalable and efficient LoRaWAN networks.

TL;DR: Proposes GPPO framework using Graph Neural Networks and action masking to jointly optimize functional split selection and virtual unit placement in O-RAN architectures, achieving significant cost savings and improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: O-RAN architectures provide flexibility but introduce complex resource management challenges requiring joint optimization of functional splits and virtual unit placement under dynamic demands. Existing solutions lack scalability and handle these aspects separately.

Method: Graph-Augmented Proximal Policy Optimization (GPPO) framework leveraging Graph Neural Networks for topology-aware feature extraction and action masking to navigate combinatorial decision space efficiently.

Result: GPPO achieves up to 18% lower deployment cost and 25% higher reward in generalization tests compared to state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining perfect reliability in both small and large-scale O-RAN scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed GPPO framework demonstrates effectiveness and scalability for practical O-RAN deployments by effectively handling the joint optimization challenge through graph-based reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architectures enable flexible, scalable,
and cost-efficient mobile networks by disaggregating and virtualizing baseband
functions. However, this flexibility introduces significant challenges for
resource management, requiring joint optimization of functional split selection
and virtualized unit placement under dynamic demands and complex topologies.
Existing solutions often address these aspects separately or lack scalability
in large and real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel
Graph-Augmented Proximal Policy Optimization (GPPO) framework that leverages
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for topology-aware feature extraction and
integrates action masking to efficiently navigate the combinatorial decision
space. Our approach jointly optimizes functional split and placement decisions,
capturing the full complexity of O-RAN resource allocation. Extensive
experiments on both small-and large-scale O-RAN scenarios demonstrate that GPPO
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 18% lower
deployment cost and 25% higher reward in generalization tests, while
maintaining perfect reliability. These results highlight the effectiveness and
scalability of GPPO for practical O-RAN deployments.

TL;DR: Proposes a decentralized IoIT mesh network using federated learning, metaheuristics, and multi-objective optimization to address energy, latency, and reliability challenges in embedded AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current IoIT platforms are often centralized, creating bottlenecks and security concerns. Decentralized systems where nodes self-organize can overcome these limitations but face challenges in energy efficiency, computing resources, and storage constraints for ML/DL deployment.

Method: Heterogeneous decentralized peer-to-peer mesh network with federated learning for distributed training, metaheuristics for task allocation and routing optimization, and multi-objective optimization to balance reliability, energy efficiency, and latency goals.

Result: The proposed system enables energy-efficient deployment of ML/DL models in embedded devices while maintaining decentralized coordination, avoiding central bottlenecks and security issues of centralized approaches.

Conclusion: A decentralized IoIT architecture with federated learning and optimization techniques provides a viable solution for intelligent IoT systems, addressing key challenges in resource-constrained embedded environments while maintaining system reliability and performance.

Abstract: Internet of Intelligent Things (IoIT), an emerging field, combines the
utility of Internet of Things (IoT) devices with the innovation of embedded AI
algorithms. However, it does not come without challenges, and struggles
regarding available computing resources, energy supply, and storage
limitations. In particular, many impediments to IoIT are linked to the
energy-efficient deployment of machine learning (ML)/deep learning (DL) models
in embedded devices. Research has been conducted to design energy-efficient
IoIT platforms, but these papers often focus on centralized systems, in which
some central entity processes all the data and coordinates actions. This can be
problematic, e.g., serve as bottleneck or lead to security concerns. In a
decentralized system, nodes/devices would self-organize and make their own
decisions. Therefore, to address such issues, we propose a heterogeneous,
decentralized sensing and monitoring IoIT peer-to-peer mesh network system
model. Nodes in the network will coordinate towards several optimization goals:
reliability, energy efficiency, and latency. The system employs federated
learning to train nodes in a distributed manner, metaheuristics to optimize
task allocation and routing paths, and multi-objective optimization to balance
conflicting performance goals.

TL;DR: CAR-BRAINet is a lightweight deep learning solution using CNNs with multi-head attention for beam prediction in heterogeneous vehicular networks, achieving 17.94% spectral efficiency improvement over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterogeneous Vehicular Networks (HetVNets) combining multiple communication technologies face challenges maintaining steady connections in highly mobile conditions, but lack dedicated beam prediction solutions for real-world complexities.

Method: Developed CAR-BRAINet - convolutional neural networks with multi-head attention mechanism, trained on three high-quality dynamic datasets incorporating real-time factors like MAC protocols (3GPP-C-V2X, IEEE 802.11BD), Doppler shifts, velocity, distance, and SNR levels across urban, rural, and highway scenarios.

Result: CAR-BRAINet performs effectively across all vehicular scenarios with precise beam prediction, minimal beam overhead, and 17.9422% improvement in spectral efficiency over existing methods.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates CAR-BRAINet's effectiveness in complex HetVNets, offering promising performance without relying on location angle and antenna dimensions, thereby reducing redundant sensor latency.

Abstract: Heterogeneous Vehicular Networks (HetVNets) play a key role by stacking
different communication technologies such as sub-6GHz, mm-wave and DSRC to meet
diverse connectivity needs of 5G/B5G vehicular networks. HetVNet helps address
the humongous user demands-but maintaining a steady connection in a highly
mobile, real-world conditions remain a challenge. Though there has been ample
of studies on beam prediction models a dedicated solution for HetVNets is
sparsely explored. Hence, it is the need of the hour to develop a reliable beam
prediction solution, specifically for HetVNets. This paper introduces a
lightweight deep learning-based solution termed-"CAR-BRAINet" which consists of
convolutional neural networks with a powerful multi-head attention (MHA)
mechanism. Existing literature on beam prediction is largely studied under a
limited, idealised vehicular scenario, often overlooking the real-time
complexities and intricacies of vehicular networks. Therefore, this study aims
to mimic the complexities of a real-time driving scenario by incorporating key
factors such as prominent MAC protocols-3GPP-C-V2X and IEEE 802.11BD, the
effect of Doppler shifts under high velocity and varying distance and SNR
levels into three high-quality dynamic datasets pertaining to urban, rural and
highway vehicular networks. CAR-BRAINet performs effectively across all the
vehicular scenarios, demonstrating precise beam prediction with minimal beam
overhead and a steady improvement of 17.9422% on the spectral efficiency over
the existing methods. Thus, this study justifies the effectiveness of
CAR-BRAINet in complex HetVNets, offering promising performance without relying
on the location angle and antenna dimensions of the mobile users, and thereby
reducing the redundant sensor-latency.

deploy mm-Wave transmission to the users. The 360{\deg} video is encoded into
dependent layers and segmented tiles, allowing a user to schedule downloads of
each layer's segments. Furthermore, each user utilizes multiple buffers to
store the corresponding video layer's segments. We model the scheduling
decision as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), where the agent
selects Base or Enhancement layers to maximize the QoE and use a policy
gradient-based method (PPO) to find the optimal policy. Additionally, we
implement a dynamic adjustment mechanism for cost components, allowing the
system to adaptively balance and prioritize the video quality, buffer
occupancy, and quality change based on real-time network and streaming session
conditions. We demonstrate that ASL360 significantly improves the QoE,
achieving approximately 2 dB higher average video quality, 80% lower average
rebuffering time, and 57% lower video quality variation, relative to
competitive baseline methods. Our results show the effectiveness of our layered
and adaptive approach in enhancing the QoE in immersive videostreaming
applications, particularly in dynamic and challenging network environments.

*Ashlesha Akella,Akshar Kaul,Krishnasuri Narayanam,Sameep Mehta*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: A three-stage framework combining statistical outlier detection with LLM-driven rule and code generation for automated tabular data quality validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rule-based data quality validation suffers from inefficiency, high human intervention, and computational costs, requiring a more automated and reliable approach.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) Statistical outlier detection with traditional clustering, 2) Iterative LLM prompting for semantic quality rule generation with RAG using external knowledge, 3) Code-generating LLMs to synthesize executable validators with robust guardrails for accuracy.

Result: Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness of the approach in generating reliable data quality rules and validators.

Conclusion: The framework successfully automates data quality validation by combining statistical methods with LLM-driven rule and code generation, addressing limitations of traditional rule-based approaches.

Abstract: Reliable data quality is crucial for downstream analysis of tabular datasets,
yet rule-based validation often struggles with inefficiency, human
intervention, and high computational costs. We present a three-stage framework
that combines statistical inliner detection with LLM-driven rule and code
generation. After filtering data samples through traditional clustering, we
iteratively prompt LLMs to produce semantically valid quality rules and
synthesize their executable validators through code-generating LLMs. To
generate reliable quality rules, we aid LLMs with retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) by leveraging external knowledge sources and domain-specific
few-shot examples. Robust guardrails ensure the accuracy and consistency of
both rules and code snippets. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets
confirm the effectiveness of our approach.

*Jonas Becker,Lars Benedikt Kaesberg,Niklas Bauer,Jan Philip Wahle,Terry Ruas,Bela Gipp*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: MALLM is an open-source framework for systematic analysis of multi-agent debate components with 144+ configurations across personas, generators, paradigms, and protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent debate frameworks lack integrated evaluation, limited configurability, and are often designed only for tool use rather than comprehensive analysis.

Method: Developed MALLM framework with configurable agent personas, response generators, discussion paradigms, and decision protocols using simple configuration files and Huggingface dataset integration.

Result: Created a flexible framework with 144+ unique MAD configurations that enables systematic analysis and evaluation of multi-agent debate components.

Conclusion: MALLM provides researchers with a comprehensive tool to understand multi-agent debate components and their interactions through extensive configurability and evaluation capabilities.

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) has demonstrated the ability to augment collective
intelligence by scaling test-time compute and leveraging expertise. Current
frameworks for multi-agent debate are often designed towards tool use, lack
integrated evaluation, or provide limited configurability of agent personas,
response generators, discussion paradigms, and decision protocols. We introduce
MALLM (Multi-Agent Large Language Models), an open-source framework that
enables systematic analysis of MAD components. MALLM offers more than 144
unique configurations of MAD, including (1) agent personas (e.g., Expert,
Personality), (2) response generators (e.g., Critical, Reasoning), (3)
discussion paradigms (e.g., Memory, Relay), and (4) decision protocols (e.g.,
Voting, Consensus). MALLM uses simple configuration files to define a debate.
Furthermore, MALLM can load any textual Huggingface dataset (e.g., MMLU-Pro,
WinoGrande) and provides an evaluation pipeline for easy comparison of MAD
configurations. MALLM is tailored towards researchers and provides a window
into the heart of multi-agent debate, facilitating the understanding of its
components and their interplay.

### [457] [Biomarkers of brain diseases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10547)
*Pascal Helson,Arvind Kumar*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: Current brain biomarker research relies on flawed cohort comparisons and single data types. The paper argues for multimodal longitudinal data to define meaningful biomarkers instead of just more data/algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brain features are rarely used clinically despite advanced AI and diverse brain data. The field continues using inadequate cohort comparison approaches that don't account for brain feature degeneracy.

Method: The authors use a thought experiment to demonstrate limitations of current approaches and propose using multimodal (brain activity, neurotransmitters, imaging) and longitudinal data to guide patient grouping before defining biomarkers.

Result: The analysis shows that simply acquiring more data or using more powerful algorithms will not be sufficient to identify valid biomarkers for brain diseases using current comparison methods.

Conclusion: Instead of comparing patients vs healthy controls with single data types, researchers should use multimodal longitudinal brain data to properly group patients and define multidimensional biomarkers for brain diseases.

Abstract: Despite the diversity of brain data acquired and advanced AI-based algorithms
to analyze them, brain features are rarely used in clinics for diagnosis and
prognosis. Here we argue that the field continues to rely on cohort comparisons
to seek biomarkers, despite the well-established degeneracy of brain features.
Using a thought experiment, we show that more data and more powerful algorithms
will not be sufficient to identify biomarkers of brain diseases. We argue that
instead of comparing patient versus healthy controls using single data type, we
should use multimodal (e.g. brain activity, neurotransmitters, neuromodulators,
brain imaging) and longitudinal brain data to guide the grouping before
defining multidimensional biomarkers for brain diseases.

*Zhizheng Wang,Yifan Yang,Qiao Jin,Zhiyong Lu*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: Gene-R1 is a data-augmented learning framework that enables lightweight open-source LLMs to perform gene set analysis with step-by-step reasoning, achieving performance comparable to commercial LLMs while addressing cost and privacy concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing gene set analysis methods primarily rely on proprietary LLMs, raising cost and data privacy concerns, and no research has explored advanced reasoning strategies for this task.

Method: Gene-R1 uses a data-augmented learning framework to equip lightweight open-source LLMs with step-by-step reasoning capabilities specifically tailored for gene set analysis.

Result: On 1,508 in-distribution gene sets, Gene-R1 achieves substantial performance gains matching commercial LLMs. On 106 out-of-distribution sets, it performs comparably to both commercial and large-scale LLMs, showing robust generalizability.

Conclusion: Gene-R1 successfully bridges the performance gap between open-source and proprietary LLMs for gene set analysis while providing enhanced reasoning capabilities and addressing cost/privacy concerns.

Abstract: The gene set analysis (GSA) is a foundational approach for uncovering the
molecular functions associated with a group of genes. Recently, LLM-powered
methods have emerged to annotate gene sets with biological functions together
with coherent explanatory insights. However, existing studies primarily focus
on proprietary models, which have been shown to outperform their open-source
counterparts despite concerns over cost and data privacy. Furthermore, no
research has investigated the application of advanced reasoning strategies to
the GSA task. To address this gap, we introduce Gene-R1, a data-augmented
learning framework that equips lightweight and open-source LLMs with
step-by-step reasoning capabilities tailored to GSA. Experiments on 1,508
in-distribution gene sets demonstrate that Gene-R1 achieves substantial
performance gains, matching commercial LLMs. On 106 out-of-distribution gene
sets, Gene-R1 performs comparably to both commercial and large-scale LLMs,
exhibiting robust generalizability across diverse gene sources.

*Hao Wang,Jingshu Peng,Yanyan Shen,Xujia Li,Lei Chen*

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: MiM-StocR is a multi-task learning framework for stock recommendation that integrates momentum indicators, uses adaptive ranking loss, and employs converge-based optimization to handle stock market volatility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deep learning models for stock recommendation fail to simultaneously capture stock trends and rankings, which are both essential for investors. Existing MTL frameworks also suffer from overfitting issues due to stock market volatility.

Method: Proposes MiM-StocR framework with: 1) Momentum line indicator for capturing short-term trends, 2) Adaptive-k ApproxNDCG list-wise ranking loss for prioritizing top stocks, 3) Converge-based Quad-Balancing (CQB) method to prevent overfitting in volatile markets.

Result: Extensive experiments on SEE50, CSI 100, and CSI 300 benchmarks show MiM-StocR outperforms state-of-the-art MTL baselines in both ranking and profitability evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed MiM-StocR framework effectively addresses the limitations of traditional stock recommendation systems by simultaneously capturing trends and rankings while mitigating overfitting issues in volatile stock markets.

Abstract: Stock recommendation is critical in Fintech applications, which use price
series and alternative information to estimate future stock performance.
Although deep learning models are prevalent in stock recommendation systems,
traditional time-series forecasting training often fails to capture stock
trends and rankings simultaneously, which are essential consideration factors
for investors. To tackle this issue, we introduce a Multi-Task Learning (MTL)
framework for stock recommendation, \textbf{M}omentum-\textbf{i}ntegrated
\textbf{M}ulti-task \textbf{Stoc}k \textbf{R}ecommendation with Converge-based
Optimization (\textbf{MiM-StocR}). To improve the model's ability to capture
short-term trends, we novelly invoke a momentum line indicator in model
training. To prioritize top-performing stocks and optimize investment
allocation, we propose a list-wise ranking loss function called Adaptive-k
ApproxNDCG. Moreover, due to the volatility and uncertainty of the stock
market, existing MTL frameworks face overfitting issues when applied to stock
time series. To mitigate this issue, we introduce the Converge-based
Quad-Balancing (CQB) method. We conducted extensive experiments on three stock
benchmarks: SEE50, CSI 100, and CSI 300. MiM-StocR outperforms state-of-the-art
MTL baselines across both ranking and profitable evaluations.

### [460] [Program Skeletons for Automated Program Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07483)
*Bo Wang,Tianyu Li,Ruishi Li,Umang Mathur,Prateek Saxena*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: A novel skeleton-based approach for automated cross-language program translation that abstracts high-level structure while enabling sound decomposition and integration with code synthesizers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated software translation between programming languages is challenging due to the need to re-express behavior in idiomatic target language constructs while preserving functionality. Existing techniques are elusive and hard to scale.

Method: Program skeletons framework that retains high-level structure by abstracting away lower-level code fragments. Fragments can be mechanically translated or filled using code synthesizers. Prototype system Skel implements Python to JavaScript translation.

Result: 95% of code fragments automatically translated for 9 real-world Python programs (some with 1k+ LOC), 5% require manual effort. All final translations correct with respect to whole-program test suites. Promising scalability compared to prior works.

Conclusion: Skeleton-based translation enables sound decomposition and scalable automation of cross-language program translation, with high success rates and correctness guarantees.

Abstract: Translating software between programming languages is a challenging task, for
which automated techniques have been elusive and hard to scale up to larger
programs. A key difficulty in cross-language translation is that one has to
re-express the intended behavior of the source program into idiomatic
constructs of a different target language. This task needs abstracting away
from the source language-specific details, while keeping the overall
functionality the same. In this work, we propose a novel and systematic
approach for making such translation amenable to automation based on a
framework we call program skeletons. A program skeleton retains the high-level
structure of the source program by abstracting away and effectively summarizing
lower-level concrete code fragments, which can be mechanically translated to
the target programming language. A skeleton, by design, permits many different
ways of filling in the concrete implementation for fragments, which can work in
conjunction with existing data-driven code synthesizers. Most importantly,
skeletons can conceptually enable sound decomposition, i.e., if each individual
fragment is correctly translated, taken together with the mechanically
translated skeleton, the final translated program is deemed to be correct as a
whole. We present a prototype system called Skel embodying the idea of
skeleton-based translation from Python to JavaScript. Our results show
promising scalability compared to prior works. For 9 real-world Python
programs, some with more than about 1k lines of code, 95% of their code
fragments can be automatically translated, while about 5% require manual
effort. All the final translations are correct with respect to whole-program
test suites.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Survey on using Large Foundation Models (LFMs) like LLMs and MLLMs for trajectory prediction in autonomous driving, addressing limitations of traditional deep learning methods through interpretable contextual reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deep learning methods for trajectory prediction lack interpretability, require large annotated datasets, and have weak generalization in long-tail scenarios. LFMs offer potential solutions by integrating linguistic and scene semantics.

Method: Three core methodologies: trajectory-language mapping, multimodal fusion, and constraint-based reasoning. Covers prediction tasks for vehicles and pedestrians using LFMs.

Result: LFMs facilitate interpretable contextual reasoning, significantly enhancing prediction safety and generalization in complex environments for autonomous driving applications.

Conclusion: While promising, key challenges remain including computational latency, data scarcity, and real-world robustness. Future directions include low-latency inference, causality-aware modeling, and motion foundation models.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction serves as a critical functionality in autonomous
driving, enabling the anticipation of future motion paths for traffic
participants such as vehicles and pedestrians, which is essential for driving
safety. Although conventional deep learning methods have improved accuracy,
they remain hindered by inherent limitations, including lack of
interpretability, heavy reliance on large-scale annotated data, and weak
generalization in long-tail scenarios. The rise of Large Foundation Models
(LFMs) is transforming the research paradigm of trajectory prediction. This
survey offers a systematic review of recent advances in LFMs, particularly
Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for
trajectory prediction. By integrating linguistic and scene semantics, LFMs
facilitate interpretable contextual reasoning, significantly enhancing
prediction safety and generalization in complex environments. The article
highlights three core methodologies: trajectory-language mapping, multimodal
fusion, and constraint-based reasoning. It covers prediction tasks for both
vehicles and pedestrians, evaluation metrics, and dataset analyses. Key
challenges such as computational latency, data scarcity, and real-world
robustness are discussed, along with future research directions including
low-latency inference, causality-aware modeling, and motion foundation models.

### [462] [DreamNav: A Trajectory-Based Imaginative Framework for Zero-Shot Vision-and-Language Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11197)
*Yunheng Wang,Yuetong Fang,Taowen Wang,Yixiao Feng,Yawen Tan,Shuning Zhang,Peiran Liu,Yiding Ji,Renjing Xu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DreamNav is a zero-shot vision-and-language navigation method that uses egocentric viewpoint correction, trajectory-level planning, and imagination prediction to improve navigation performance without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot VLN methods are expensive, misaligned in action semantics, and short-sighted in planning. They rely on costly perception and passive scene understanding with point-level choices.

Method: DreamNav features three components: (1) EgoView Corrector for viewpoint alignment and perception stabilization, (2) Trajectory Predictor for global trajectory-level planning, and (3) Imagination Predictor for anticipatory and long-horizon planning with proactive thinking.

Result: DreamNav achieves new zero-shot SOTA on VLN-CE and real-world tests, outperforming the strongest egocentric baseline by up to 7.49% in SR and 18.15% in SPL metrics.

Conclusion: This is the first zero-shot VLN method to unify trajectory-level planning and active imagination using only egocentric inputs, addressing key limitations of previous approaches.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE), which
links language instructions to perception and control in the real world, is a
core capability of embodied robots. Recently, large-scale pretrained foundation
models have been leveraged as shared priors for perception, reasoning, and
action, enabling zero-shot VLN without task-specific training. However,
existing zero-shot VLN methods depend on costly perception and passive scene
understanding, collapsing control to point-level choices. As a result, they are
expensive to deploy, misaligned in action semantics, and short-sighted in
planning. To address these issues, we present DreamNav that focuses on the
following three aspects: (1) for reducing sensory cost, our EgoView Corrector
aligns viewpoints and stabilizes egocentric perception; (2) instead of
point-level actions, our Trajectory Predictor favors global trajectory-level
planning to better align with instruction semantics; and (3) to enable
anticipatory and long-horizon planning, we propose an Imagination Predictor to
endow the agent with proactive thinking capability. On VLN-CE and real-world
tests, DreamNav sets a new zero-shot state-of-the-art (SOTA), outperforming the
strongest egocentric baseline with extra information by up to 7.49\% and
18.15\% in terms of SR and SPL metrics. To our knowledge, this is the first
zero-shot VLN method to unify trajectory-level planning and active imagination
while using only egocentric inputs.

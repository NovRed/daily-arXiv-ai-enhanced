Because they are still in development,\nwhat is true today may be false tomorrow. We therefore need general strategies\nfor debiasing that will outlive current models. Strategies developed for\ndebiasing human decision making offer one promising approach as they\nincorporate an LLM-style prompt intervention designed to bring latent knowledge\ninto awareness during decision making. LLMs trained on vast amounts of\ninformation contain information about potential biases, counter-arguments, and\ncontradictory evidence, but that information may only be brought to bear if\nprompted. Metacognitive prompts developed in the human decision making\nliterature are designed to achieve this, and as I demonstrate here, they show\npromise with LLMs. The prompt I focus on here is \"could you be wrong?\"\nFollowing an LLM response, this prompt leads LLMs to produce additional\ninformation, including why they answered as they did, errors, biases,\ncontradictory evidence, and alternatives, none of which were apparent in their\ninitial response. Indeed, this metaknowledge often reveals that how LLMs and\nusers interpret prompts are not aligned. Here I demonstrate this prompt using a\nset of questions taken from recent articles about LLM biases, including\nimplicit discriminatory biases and failures of metacognition. \"Could you be\nwrong\" prompts the LLM to identify its own biases and produce cogent\nmetacognitive reflection. I also present another example involving convincing\nbut incomplete information, which is readily corrected by the metacognitive\nprompt.

Existing LLM-based approaches transfer knowledge\nlearned from text data to time series prediction using prompting or fine-tuning\nstrategies. However, LLMs are proficient at reasoning over discrete tokens and\nsemantic patterns but are not initially designed to model continuous numerical\ntime series data. The gaps between text and time series data lead LLMs to\nachieve inferior performance to a vanilla Transformer model that is directly\ntrained on TSF data. However, the vanilla Transformers often struggle to learn\nhigh-level semantic patterns. In this paper, we design a novel\nTransformer-based architecture that complementarily leverages LLMs and vanilla\nTransformers, so as to integrate the high-level semantic representations\nlearned by LLMs into the temporal information encoded by time series\nTransformers, where a hybrid representation is obtained by fusing the\nrepresentations from the LLM and the Transformer. The resulting fused\nrepresentation contains both historical temporal dynamics and semantic\nvariation patterns, allowing our model to predict more accurate future values.\nExperiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\napproach.", "AI": {"tldr": "A novel Transformer-based architecture integrates LLMs and vanilla Transformers for time series forecasting, combining semantic and temporal patterns for improved accuracy.", "motivation": "LLMs excel in text tasks but underperform in time series forecasting due to gaps between text and numerical data.

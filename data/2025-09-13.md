### [1] [Recurrence Meets Transformers for Universal Multimodal Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08897)
*Davide Caffagni,Sara Sarto,Marcella Cornia,Lorenzo Baraldi,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReT-2 is a unified multimodal retrieval model that handles both image+text queries and searches across multimodal documents, achieving state-of-the-art performance with efficient inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing retrieval methods are limited to single-modality queries/documents and require task-specific fine-tuning, failing to handle complex multimodal retrieval tasks needed for modern LLM applications.

Method: Uses multi-layer representations and a recurrent Transformer architecture with LSTM-inspired gating mechanisms to dynamically integrate information across layers and modalities, capturing fine-grained visual and textual details.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on M2KR and M-BEIR benchmarks across different retrieval configurations, with faster inference and reduced memory usage. Improves downstream performance when integrated into retrieval-augmented generation pipelines.

Conclusion: ReT-2 provides an effective unified solution for multimodal retrieval that supports complex queries and document collections while being efficient and improving downstream applications.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of multimodal retrieval and its application in
LLMs and multimodal LLMs, increasingly complex retrieval tasks have emerged.
Existing methods predominantly rely on task-specific fine-tuning of
vision-language models and are limited to single-modality queries or documents.
In this paper, we propose ReT-2, a unified retrieval model that supports
multimodal queries, composed of both images and text, and searches across
multimodal document collections where text and images coexist. ReT-2 leverages
multi-layer representations and a recurrent Transformer architecture with
LSTM-inspired gating mechanisms to dynamically integrate information across
layers and modalities, capturing fine-grained visual and textual details. We
evaluate ReT-2 on the challenging M2KR and M-BEIR benchmarks across different
retrieval configurations. Results demonstrate that ReT-2 consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance across diverse settings, while offering faster
inference and reduced memory usage compared to prior approaches. When
integrated into retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, ReT-2 also improves
downstream performance on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek datasets. Our source

### [2] [Diffusion-Based Action Recognition Generalizes to Untrained Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08908)
*Rogerio Guimaraes,Frank Xiao,Pietro Perona,Markus Marks*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using Vision Diffusion Model features with transformer aggregation achieves human-like action recognition across species, viewpoints, and contexts, setting new SOTA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans can recognize actions despite large variations in context and viewpoint, but current deep learning models struggle with such generalization.

Method: Features from Vision Diffusion Model (VDM) aggregated via transformer, using model conditioned on earlier diffusion timesteps to emphasize semantic over pixel-level information.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art across three generalization benchmarks: action classification across animal species, viewing angles, and recording contexts.

Conclusion: Brings machine action recognition closer to human-like robustness by leveraging diffusion model features for enhanced generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Humans can recognize the same actions despite large context and viewpoint
variations, such as differences between species (walking in spiders vs.
horses), viewpoints (egocentric vs. third-person), and contexts (real life vs
movies). Current deep learning models struggle with such generalization. We
propose using features generated by a Vision Diffusion Model (VDM), aggregated
via a transformer, to achieve human-like action recognition across these
challenging conditions. We find that generalization is enhanced by the use of a
model conditioned on earlier timesteps of the diffusion process to highlight
semantic information over pixel level details in the extracted features. We
experimentally explore the generalization properties of our approach in
classifying actions across animal species, across different viewing angles, and
different recording contexts. Our model sets a new state-of-the-art across all
three generalization benchmarks, bringing machine action recognition closer to
human-like robustness. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety approaches fail to proactively prevent harmful LLM outputs to vulnerable populations like LGBTQ+ individuals and marginalized communities, requiring source-level prevention.

Method: VulnGuard Prompt uses hybrid technique with real-world data-driven contrastive learning, few-shot examples from GitHub, ethical chain-of-thought reasoning, and adaptive role-prompting with multi-objective optimization.

Result: 25-30% analytical harm reduction demonstrated through entropy bounds and Pareto optimality with comprehensive mathematical formalization and convergence proofs.

Conclusion: PromptGuard establishes mathematical foundations for systematic harm prevention research and creates an intelligent expert system for real-time protection of vulnerable populations.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications
poses unprecedented risks of generating harmful, biased, or misleading
information to vulnerable populations including LGBTQ+ individuals, single
parents, and marginalized communities. While existing safety approaches rely on
post-hoc filtering or generic alignment techniques, they fail to proactively
prevent harmful outputs at the generation source. This paper introduces
PromptGuard, a novel modular prompting framework with our breakthrough
contribution: VulnGuard Prompt, a hybrid technique that prevents harmful
information generation using real-world data-driven contrastive learning.
VulnGuard integrates few-shot examples from curated GitHub repositories,
ethical chain-of-thought reasoning, and adaptive role-prompting to create
population-specific protective barriers. Our framework employs theoretical
multi-objective optimization with formal proofs demonstrating 25-30% analytical
harm reduction through entropy bounds and Pareto optimality. PromptGuard
orchestrates six core modules: Input Classification, VulnGuard Prompting,
Ethical Principles Integration, External Tool Interaction, Output Validation,
and User-System Interaction, creating an intelligent expert system for
real-time harm prevention. We provide comprehensive mathematical formalization
including convergence proofs, vulnerability analysis using information theory,
and theoretical validation framework using GitHub-sourced datasets,
establishing mathematical foundations for systematic empirical research.

*Waqar Ahmad,Evan Murphy,Vladimir A. Krylov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Beta-SOD: A novel Beta mixture similarity-based outlier detection framework that improves object re-identification robustness against label noise by modeling pairwise similarity distributions and combining multiple loss functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object re-identification methods are highly sensitive to label noise, which causes significant performance degradation. Existing approaches struggle with noisy training data scenarios.

Method: Reframes Re-ID as supervised image similarity task using Siamese network. Introduces Beta-SOD framework that models cosine similarity distributions with two-component Beta mixture model. Combines binary cross-entropy, contrastive, and cosine embedding losses for joint optimization.

Result: Superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across 10-30% noise levels on CUHK03, Market-1501 (person Re-ID) and VeRi-776 (vehicle Re-ID) datasets. Demonstrates robustness and broad applicability in noisy scenarios.

Conclusion: Beta-SOD effectively addresses label noise in Re-ID tasks through statistical outlier detection and comprehensive loss optimization, providing a robust solution for real-world noisy data applications.

Abstract: Object re-identification (Re-ID) methods are highly sensitive to label noise,
which typically leads to significant performance degradation. We address this
challenge by reframing Re-ID as a supervised image similarity task and adopting
a Siamese network architecture trained to capture discriminative pairwise
relationships. Central to our approach is a novel statistical outlier detection
(OD) framework, termed Beta-SOD (Beta mixture Similarity-based Outlier
Detection), which models the distribution of cosine similarities between
embedding pairs using a two-component Beta distribution mixture model. We
establish a novel identifiability result for mixtures of two Beta
distributions, ensuring that our learning task is well-posed.The proposed OD
step complements the Re-ID architecture combining binary cross-entropy,
contrastive, and cosine embedding losses that jointly optimize feature-level
similarity learning.We demonstrate the effectiveness of Beta-SOD in de-noising
and Re-ID tasks for person Re-ID, on CUHK03 and Market-1501 datasets, and
vehicle Re-ID, on VeRi-776 dataset. Our method shows superior performance
compared to the state-of-the-art methods across various noise levels (10-30\%),
demonstrating both robustness and broad applicability in noisy Re-ID scenarios.

*Nan Mu,Ruiqi Song,Zhihui Xu,Jingfeng Jiang,Chen Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SFD-Mamba2Net framework improves coronary artery segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA images using multi-scale structural priors, state-space modeling, and frequency-domain enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coronary Artery Disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, but ICA images have low contrast, high noise, and complex vascular structures that challenge existing segmentation and detection methods.

Method: End-to-end SFD-Mamba2Net framework with Curvature-Aware Structural Enhancement module in encoder to highlight vascular structures, and Progressive High-Frequency Perception module in decoder using wavelet decomposition to refine details.

Result: Outperformed state-of-the-art methods across eight segmentation metrics and achieved highest true positive rate and positive predictive value in stenosis detection.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses challenges in ICA image analysis and demonstrates superior performance for clinical CAD diagnosis applications.

Abstract: Background: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of
death worldwide. Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA), regarded as the gold
standard for CAD diagnosis, necessitates precise vessel segmentation and
stenosis detection. However, ICA images are typically characterized by low
contrast, high noise levels, and complex, fine-grained vascular structures,
which pose significant challenges to the clinical adoption of existing
segmentation and detection methods. Objective: This study aims to improve the
accuracy of coronary artery segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA images
by integrating multi-scale structural priors, state-space-based long-range
dependency modeling, and frequency-domain detail enhancement strategies.
Methods: We propose SFD-Mamba2Net, an end-to-end framework tailored for
ICA-based vascular segmentation and stenosis detection. In the encoder, a
Curvature-Aware Structural Enhancement (CASE) module is embedded to leverage
multi-scale responses for highlighting slender tubular vascular structures,
suppressing background interference, and directing attention toward vascular
regions. In the decoder, we introduce a Progressive High-Frequency Perception
(PHFP) module that employs multi-level wavelet decomposition to progressively
refine high-frequency details while integrating low-frequency global
structures. Results and Conclusions: SFD-Mamba2Net consistently outperformed
state-of-the-art methods across eight segmentation metrics, and achieved the
highest true positive rate and positive predictive value in stenosis detection.

### [6] [Live(r) Die: Predicting Survival in Colorectal Liver Metastasis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08935)
*Muhammad Alberb,Helen Cheung,Anne Martel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Automated MRI-based framework for predicting surgical outcomes in colorectal liver metastasis using segmentation and radiomics pipelines, achieving 10%+ improvement over existing biomarkers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Colorectal liver metastasis significantly reduces survival, and current prognostic models lack predictive power, especially for multifocal cases. Need for better automated prediction from preoperative MRI.

Method: Two-pipeline framework: 1) Segmentation pipeline using SAMONAI (zero-shot 3D prompt propagation) to segment liver, tumors, and spleen from partially annotated data 2) Radiomics pipeline using SurvAMINN (autoencoder-based multiple instance neural network) for survival prediction from extracted tumor features.

Result: Framework evaluated on 227 patients, surpassed existing clinical and genomic biomarkers with C-index improvement exceeding 10%.

Conclusion: Integration of automated segmentation and radiomics-based survival analysis provides accurate, annotation-efficient, and interpretable outcome prediction for colorectal liver metastasis.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer frequently metastasizes to the liver, significantly
reducing long-term survival. While surgical resection is the only potentially
curative treatment for colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM), patient outcomes
vary widely depending on tumor characteristics along with clinical and genomic
factors. Current prognostic models, often based on limited clinical or
molecular features, lack sufficient predictive power, especially in multifocal
CRLM cases. We present a fully automated framework for surgical outcome
prediction from pre- and post-contrast MRI acquired before surgery. Our
framework consists of a segmentation pipeline and a radiomics pipeline. The
segmentation pipeline learns to segment the liver, tumors, and spleen from
partially annotated data by leveraging promptable foundation models to complete
missing labels. Also, we propose SAMONAI, a novel zero-shot 3D prompt
propagation algorithm that leverages the Segment Anything Model to segment 3D
regions of interest from a single point prompt, significantly improving our
segmentation pipeline's accuracy and efficiency. The predicted pre- and
post-contrast segmentations are then fed into our radiomics pipeline, which
extracts features from each tumor and predicts survival using SurvAMINN, a
novel autoencoder-based multiple instance neural network for survival analysis.
SurvAMINN jointly learns dimensionality reduction and hazard prediction from
right-censored survival data, focusing on the most aggressive tumors. Extensive
evaluation on an institutional dataset comprising 227 patients demonstrates
that our framework surpasses existing clinical and genomic biomarkers,
delivering a C-index improvement exceeding 10%. Our results demonstrate the
potential of integrating automated segmentation algorithms and radiomics-based
survival analysis to deliver accurate, annotation-efficient, and interpretable
outcome prediction in CRLM.

### [7] [Discovering Divergent Representations between Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08940)
*Lisa Dunlap,Joseph E. Gonzalez,Trevor Darrell,Fabian Caba Heilbron,Josef Sivic,Bryan Russell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CompCon is an evolutionary search algorithm that discovers visual attribute differences between text-to-image models and identifies prompt concepts that trigger these divergences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when and how visual representations learned by different generative models diverge, and to systematically identify visual attributes that appear in one model's outputs but not another's.

Method: Introduced CompCon evolutionary search algorithm to discover visual attributes more prevalent in one model's output, created automated data generation pipeline for ID2 dataset with 60 input-dependent differences, and compared against LLM/VLM baselines.

Result: Successfully found divergent representations between popular models - PixArt depicts loneliness prompts with wet streets, while Stable Diffusion 3.5 depicts African American people in media professions differently.

Conclusion: CompCon effectively identifies visual representation divergences between text-to-image models and reveals the prompt concepts that trigger these differences, providing insights into model-specific biases and characteristics.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate when and how visual representations learned by
two different generative models diverge. Given two text-to-image models, our
goal is to discover visual attributes that appear in images generated by one
model but not the other, along with the types of prompts that trigger these
attribute differences. For example, "flames" might appear in one model's
outputs when given prompts expressing strong emotions, while the other model
does not produce this attribute given the same prompts. We introduce CompCon
(Comparing Concepts), an evolutionary search algorithm that discovers visual
attributes more prevalent in one model's output than the other, and uncovers
the prompt concepts linked to these visual differences. To evaluate CompCon's
ability to find diverging representations, we create an automated data
generation pipeline to produce ID2, a dataset of 60 input-dependent
differences, and compare our approach to several LLM- and VLM-powered
baselines. Finally, we use CompCon to compare popular text-to-image models,
finding divergent representations such as how PixArt depicts prompts mentioning
loneliness with wet streets and Stable Diffusion 3.5 depicts African American
people in media professions. Code at: https://github.com/adobe-research/CompCon

### [8] [An U-Net-Based Deep Neural Network for Cloud Shadow and Sun-Glint Correction of Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08949)
*Yibin Wang,Wondimagegn Beshah,Padmanava Dash,Haifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a U-Net based deep learning model to detect and correct cloud shadows and sun glint in UAS imagery for water quality monitoring applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAS imagery is often affected by cloud shadows and sun glint, which pose serious challenges for accurate water quality parameter estimation from aerial images.

Method: Uses a U-Net based deep learning model trained on pixel-level data to identify, extract, and separate regions affected by cloud shadows and sun glint from clear sky regions.

Result: Developed a high-quality image correction model that successfully recovers cloud shadow and sun glint affected areas in UAS images based on various evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed machine learning approach effectively addresses the limitations of UAS imagery by providing automated detection and correction of cloud shadows and sun glint, enabling more accurate water quality monitoring.

Abstract: The use of unmanned aerial systems (UASs) has increased tremendously in the
current decade. They have significantly advanced remote sensing with the
capability to deploy and image the terrain as per required spatial, spectral,
temporal, and radiometric resolutions for various remote sensing applications.
One of the major advantages of UAS imagery is that images can be acquired in
cloudy conditions by flying the UAS under the clouds. The limitation to the
technology is that the imagery is often sullied by cloud shadows. Images taken
over water are additionally affected by sun glint. These are two pose serious
issues for estimating water quality parameters from the UAS images. This study
proposes a novel machine learning approach first to identify and extract
regions with cloud shadows and sun glint and separate such regions from
non-obstructed clear sky regions and sun-glint unaffected regions. The data was
extracted from the images at pixel level to train an U-Net based deep learning
model and best settings for model training was identified based on the various
evaluation metrics from test cases. Using this evaluation, a high-quality image
correction model was determined, which was used to recover the cloud shadow and
sun glint areas in the images.

### [9] [CoSwin: Convolution Enhanced Hierarchical Shifted Window Attention For Small-Scale Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08959)
*Puskal Khadka,Rodrigue Rizk,Longwei Wang,KC Santosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoSwin integrates convolutional feature learning with hierarchical shifted window attention to enhance local feature extraction in Vision Transformers for small datasets, achieving consistent performance gains across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers lack key inductive biases like locality and translation equivariance, which limits their performance on small datasets where local feature extraction is crucial.

Method: Proposes CoSwin architecture that augments hierarchical shifted window attention with a learnable local feature enhancement module in each attention block, enabling simultaneous capture of fine-grained spatial details and global semantic structure.

Result: Achieves improvements of 2.17% on CIFAR-10, 4.92% on CIFAR-100, 0.10% on MNIST, 0.26% on SVHN, and 4.47% on Tiny ImageNet over baseline Swin Transformer.

Conclusion: Local-global feature fusion effectively enhances generalization and robustness of transformers for small-scale vision tasks.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved impressive results in computer
vision by leveraging self-attention to model long-range dependencies. However,
their emphasis on global context often comes at the expense of local feature
extraction in small datasets, particularly due to the lack of key inductive
biases such as locality and translation equivariance. To mitigate this, we
propose CoSwin, a novel feature-fusion architecture that augments the
hierarchical shifted window attention with localized convolutional feature
learning. Specifically, CoSwin integrates a learnable local feature enhancement
module into each attention block, enabling the model to simultaneously capture
fine-grained spatial details and global semantic structure. We evaluate CoSwin
on multiple image classification benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
MNIST, SVHN, and Tiny ImageNet. Our experimental results show consistent
performance gains over state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer-based
models. Notably, CoSwin achieves improvements of 2.17% on CIFAR-10, 4.92% on
CIFAR-100, 0.10% on MNIST, 0.26% on SVHN, and 4.47% on Tiny ImageNet over the
baseline Swin Transformer. These improvements underscore the effectiveness of
local-global feature fusion in enhancing the generalization and robustness of
transformers for small-scale vision. Code and pretrained weights available at

### [10] [iMatcher: Improve matching in point cloud registration via local-to-global geometric consistency learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08982)
*Karim Slimani,Catherine Achard,Brahim Tamadazte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iMatcher is a differentiable framework for point cloud feature matching that uses learned features with local and global geometric consistency to achieve state-of-the-art registration performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve point cloud registration by developing a fully differentiable framework that incorporates both local and global geometric consistency for more accurate feature matching.

Method: Uses local graph embedding for score matrix initialization, bilateral source-to-target matching via nearest neighbor search, and global geometric consistency learning to refine matching probabilities.

Result: Achieves 95%-97% inlier ratio on KITTI, 94%-97% on KITTI-360, and up to 81.1% on 3DMatch, demonstrating superior performance across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: iMatcher significantly improves rigid registration performance and shows robustness across various real-world indoor and outdoor scenarios, establishing new state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: This paper presents iMatcher, a fully differentiable framework for feature
matching in point cloud registration. The proposed method leverages learned
features to predict a geometrically consistent confidence matrix, incorporating
both local and global consistency. First, a local graph embedding module leads
to an initialization of the score matrix. A subsequent repositioning step
refines this matrix by considering bilateral source-to-target and
target-to-source matching via nearest neighbor search in 3D space. The paired
point features are then stacked together to be refined through global geometric
consistency learning to predict a point-wise matching probability. Extensive
experiments on real-world outdoor (KITTI, KITTI-360) and indoor (3DMatch)
datasets, as well as on 6-DoF pose estimation (TUD-L) and partial-to-partial
matching (MVP-RG), demonstrate that iMatcher significantly improves rigid
registration performance. The method achieves state-of-the-art inlier ratios,
scoring 95% - 97% on KITTI, 94% - 97% on KITTI-360, and up to 81.1% on 3DMatch,
highlighting its robustness across diverse settings.

### [11] [UltrON: Ultrasound Occupancy Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08991)
*Magdalena Wysocki,Felix Duelmer,Ananya Bal,Nassir Navab,Mohammad Farid Azampour*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UltrON is a novel occupancy-based representation method that leverages acoustic features from B-mode ultrasound images for 3D shape reconstruction, addressing view-dependency and occlusion issues without requiring precise annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ultrasound shape reconstruction methods rely on precise annotations and struggle with view-dependent artifacts and acoustic shadowing. There's a need to utilize the rich acoustic information in B-mode images and overcome occlusion limitations.

Method: Proposes an occupancy-based representation that uses acoustic features from B-mode images without additional annotation cost. Introduces a novel loss function to compensate for view-dependency and enables occupancy optimization from multiview ultrasound.

Result: UltrON improves geometric consistency in weakly-supervised optimization, mitigates limitations of occlusions and sparse labeling, and generalizes to shapes of the same anatomy by incorporating acoustic properties.

Conclusion: The method provides more accurate 3D reconstruction from free-hand ultrasound imaging by leveraging acoustic features and addressing view-dependency issues, paving the way for improved clinical visualization and interpretation.

Abstract: In free-hand ultrasound imaging, sonographers rely on expertise to mentally
integrate partial 2D views into 3D anatomical shapes. Shape reconstruction can
assist clinicians in this process. Central to this task is the choice of shape
representation, as it determines how accurately and efficiently the structure
can be visualized, analyzed, and interpreted. Implicit representations, such as
SDF and occupancy function, offer a powerful alternative to traditional voxel-
or mesh-based methods by modeling continuous, smooth surfaces with compact
storage, avoiding explicit discretization. Recent studies demonstrate that SDF
can be effectively optimized using annotations derived from segmented B-mode
ultrasound images. Yet, these approaches hinge on precise annotations,
overlooking the rich acoustic information embedded in B-mode intensity.
Moreover, implicit representation approaches struggle with the ultrasound's
view-dependent nature and acoustic shadowing artifacts, which impair
reconstruction. To address the problems resulting from occlusions and
annotation dependency, we propose an occupancy-based representation and
introduce \gls{UltrON} that leverages acoustic features to improve geometric
consistency in weakly-supervised optimization regime. We show that these
features can be obtained from B-mode images without additional annotation cost.
Moreover, we propose a novel loss function that compensates for view-dependency
in the B-mode images and facilitates occupancy optimization from multiview
ultrasound. By incorporating acoustic properties, \gls{UltrON} generalizes to
shapes of the same anatomy. We show that \gls{UltrON} mitigates the limitations
of occlusions and sparse labeling and paves the way for more accurate 3D
reconstruction. Code and dataset will be available at

Conclusion: INR-based models are suitable for accurate and scalable analysis of myocardial strain in large CMR datasets, offering superior performance and efficiency compared to existing deep learning approaches.

Abstract: Automatic quantification of intramyocardial motion and strain from tagging
MRI remains an important but challenging task. We propose a method using
implicit neural representations (INRs), conditioned on learned latent codes, to
predict continuous left ventricular (LV) displacement -- without requiring

achieved the best tracking accuracy (2.14 mm RMSE) and the lowest combined
error in global circumferential (2.86%) and radial (6.42%) strain compared to

*Samuel Felipe dos Santos,Tiago Agostinho de Almeida,Jurandy Almeida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: E-MLNet improves universal domain adaptation by adding dynamic weighting to OEM, focusing adaptation on relevant class boundaries to better distinguish known vs unknown classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like MLNet treat all classifiers equally, diluting learning signals. There's a need to focus adaptation on the most relevant class boundaries for each target sample.

Method: Enhanced Mutual Learning Network (E-MLNet) integrates dynamic weighting strategy to Open-set Entropy Minimization (OEM), leveraging closed-set classifier predictions to focus adaptation.

Result: Achieves highest average H-scores on VisDA and ImageCLEF, outperforms MLNet in 22/31 Open-Partial DA tasks and 19/31 Open-Set DA tasks.

Conclusion: Dynamic weighting strategy sharpens distinction between known and unknown classes, demonstrating superior robustness and performance over previous methods.

Abstract: Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) seeks to transfer knowledge from a
labeled source to an unlabeled target domain without assuming any relationship
between their label sets, requiring models to classify known samples while
rejecting unknown ones. Advanced methods like Mutual Learning Network (MLNet)
use a bank of one-vs-all classifiers adapted via Open-set Entropy Minimization
(OEM). However, this strategy treats all classifiers equally, diluting the
learning signal. We propose the Enhanced Mutual Learning Network (E-MLNet),
which integrates a dynamic weighting strategy to OEM. By leveraging the
closed-set classifier's predictions, E-MLNet focuses adaptation on the most
relevant class boundaries for each target sample, sharpening the distinction
between known and unknown classes. We conduct extensive experiments on four
challenging benchmarks: Office-31, Office-Home, VisDA-2017, and ImageCLEF. The
results demonstrate that E-MLNet achieves the highest average H-scores on VisDA
and ImageCLEF and exhibits superior robustness over its predecessor. E-MLNet
outperforms the strong MLNet baseline in the majority of individual adaptation
tasks -- 22 out of 31 in the challenging Open-Partial DA setting and 19 out of
31 in the Open-Set DA setting -- confirming the benefits of our focused

### [14] [COCO-Urdu: A Large-Scale Urdu Image-Caption Dataset with Multimodal Quality Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09014)
*Umair Hassan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COCO-Urdu is the largest publicly available Urdu image-caption dataset with 59K images and 319K captions, created to address the under-representation of Urdu in multimodal research and reduce language bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urdu is critically under-served in multimodal and vision-language research despite having over 250 million speakers. The absence of large-scale, high-quality datasets has limited Urdu-capable systems and reinforced biases in multilingual models trained primarily on high-resource languages.

Method: Derived from MS COCO using stratified sampling to preserve original distribution. Captions were translated using SeamlessM4T v2 and validated with a hybrid multimodal quality estimation framework (COMET-Kiwi for translation quality, CLIP-based similarity for visual grounding, BERTScore with back-translation for semantic consistency). Low-scoring captions were iteratively refined using open-source LLMs.

Result: Created a dataset of 59,000 images with 319,000 Urdu captions. Benchmarked on BLEU, SacreBLEU, and chrF with consistently strong results. This is the largest publicly available Urdu captioning dataset.

Conclusion: COCO-Urdu addresses the critical gap in Urdu multimodal resources and aims to reduce language bias in vision-language research. The release of both dataset and quality estimation pipeline establishes a foundation for inclusive vision-language systems.

Abstract: Urdu, spoken by over 250 million people, remains critically under-served in
multimodal and vision-language research. The absence of large-scale,
high-quality datasets has limited the development of Urdu-capable systems and
reinforced biases in multilingual vision-language models trained primarily on
high-resource languages. To address this gap, we present COCO-Urdu, a
large-scale image-caption dataset derived from MS COCO, containing 59,000
images and 319,000 Urdu captions selected through stratified sampling to
preserve the original distribution. Captions were translated using SeamlessM4T
v2 and validated with a hybrid multimodal quality estimation framework that
integrates COMET-Kiwi for translation quality, CLIP-based similarity for visual
grounding, and BERTScore with back-translation for semantic consistency;
low-scoring captions were iteratively refined using open-source large language
models. We further benchmark COCO-Urdu on BLEU, SacreBLEU, and chrF, reporting
consistently strong results. To the best of our knowledge, COCO-Urdu is the
largest publicly available Urdu captioning dataset. By releasing both the
dataset and the quality estimation pipeline, we aim to reduce language bias in
multimodal research and establish a foundation for inclusive vision-language
systems.

### [16] [Integrating Anatomical Priors into a Causal Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09054)
*Binxu Li,Wei Peng,Mingjie Li,Ehsan Adeli,Kilian M. Pohl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PCGM is a novel diffusion-based framework that integrates anatomical constraints to generate high-quality counterfactual brain MRIs, preserving subtle disease-related morphological variations that previous methods failed to capture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D brain MRI studies need to detect subtle morphometric differences between cohorts, but counterfactual models struggle to produce anatomically plausible MRIs due to lack of explicit inductive biases to preserve fine-grained anatomical details and medically relevant local variations.

Method: Proposes Probabilistic Causal Graph Model (PCGM) that integrates anatomical constraints via probabilistic graph module, creates spatial binary masks of regions with subtle variations, uses 3D ControlNet encoding, and employs a novel counterfactual denoising UNet with 3D diffusion decoder.

Result: PCGM generates structural brain MRIs of higher quality than baseline approaches. Brain measurements from PCGM counterfactuals replicate subtle disease effects on cortical regions previously reported in neuroscience literature.

Conclusion: This represents an important milestone for using synthetic MRIs in studies investigating subtle morphological differences, demonstrating that properly constrained generative models can capture medically relevant anatomical variations.

Abstract: 3D brain MRI studies often examine subtle morphometric differences between
cohorts that are hard to detect visually. Given the high cost of MRI
acquisition, these studies could greatly benefit from image syntheses,
particularly counterfactual image generation, as seen in other domains, such as
computer vision. However, counterfactual models struggle to produce
anatomically plausible MRIs due to the lack of explicit inductive biases to
preserve fine-grained anatomical details. This shortcoming arises from the
training of the models aiming to optimize for the overall appearance of the
images (e.g., via cross-entropy) rather than preserving subtle, yet medically
relevant, local variations across subjects. To preserve subtle variations, we
propose to explicitly integrate anatomical constraints on a voxel-level as
prior into a generative diffusion framework. Called Probabilistic Causal Graph
Model (PCGM), the approach captures anatomical constraints via a probabilistic
graph module and translates those constraints into spatial binary masks of
regions where subtle variations occur. The masks (encoded by a 3D extension of
ControlNet) constrain a novel counterfactual denoising UNet, whose encodings
are then transferred into high-quality brain MRIs via our 3D diffusion decoder.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that PCGM generates
structural brain MRIs of higher quality than several baseline approaches.
Furthermore, we show for the first time that brain measurements extracted from
counterfactuals (generated by PCGM) replicate the subtle effects of a disease
on cortical brain regions previously reported in the neuroscience literature.
This achievement is an important milestone in the use of synthetic MRIs in
studies investigating subtle morphological differences.

Abstract: Understanding 3D medical image volumes is critical in the medical field, yet
existing 3D medical convolution and transformer-based self-supervised learning
(SSL) methods often lack deep semantic comprehension. Recent advancements in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) provide a promising approach to

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed multi-task learning approach with fixed object information improves human action recognition accuracy to 99.25%, outperforming skeleton-only GCNs by 2.75% for human-object interaction detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GCNs fail to effectively detect human-object interactions due to lack of scene information representation and appropriate learning architectures for fixed object environments.

Method: Multi-task learning approach that incorporates fixed object information and interaction area data alongside human skeleton poses, using a custom dataset of real public environment interactions.

Result: Achieved 99.25% accuracy in recognizing interaction and non-interaction actions, representing a 2.75% improvement over base models using only human skeleton poses.

Conclusion: Incorporating fixed object information through multi-task learning significantly enhances human action recognition performance for human-object interaction scenarios in public environments.

Abstract: Recent graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) have shown high performance
in the field of human action recognition by using human skeleton poses.
However, it fails to detect human-object interaction cases successfully due to
the lack of effective representation of the scene information and appropriate
learning architectures. In this context, we propose a methodology to utilize
human action recognition performance by considering fixed object information in
the environment and following a multi-task learning approach. In order to
evaluate the proposed method, we collected real data from public environments
and prepared our data set, which includes interaction classes of hands-on fixed
objects (e.g., ATM ticketing machines, check-in/out machines, etc.) and
non-interaction classes of walking and standing. The multi-task learning
approach, along with interaction area information, succeeds in recognizing the
studied interaction and non-interaction actions with an accuracy of 99.25%,
outperforming the accuracy of the base model using only human skeleton poses by
2.75%.

*Jifeng Shen,Haibo Zhan,Xin Zuo,Heng Fan,Xiaohui Yuan,Jun Li,Wankou Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes IRDFusion framework for multispectral object detection using cross-modal feature contrastive learning and iterative feedback to enhance salient features while suppressing background noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multispectral object detection methods retain extraneous background or noise during feature fusion, limiting perceptual performance and detection accuracy.

Method: Introduces two novel modules: Mutual Feature Refinement Module (MFRM) for intra- and inter-modal feature enhancement, and Differential Feature Feedback Module (DFFM) for dynamic computation of inter-modal differential features. These are integrated into an Iterative Relation-Map Differential Guided Feature Fusion mechanism (IRDFusion) that progressively amplifies salient signals through iterative feedback.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on FLIR, LLVIP and M³FD datasets, consistently outperforming existing methods across diverse challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: IRDFusion enables high-quality cross-modal fusion by adaptively enhancing salient structures while suppressing common-mode noise, demonstrating robustness and effectiveness for multispectral object detection.

Abstract: Current multispectral object detection methods often retain extraneous
background or noise during feature fusion, limiting perceptual performance.To
address this, we propose an innovative feature fusion framework based on
cross-modal feature contrastive and screening strategy, diverging from
conventional approaches. The proposed method adaptively enhances salient
structures by fusing object-aware complementary cross-modal features while
suppressing shared background interference.Our solution centers on two novel,
specially designed modules: the Mutual Feature Refinement Module (MFRM) and the
Differential Feature Feedback Module (DFFM). The MFRM enhances intra- and
inter-modal feature representations by modeling their relationships, thereby
improving cross-modal alignment and discriminative power.Inspired by feedback
differential amplifiers, the DFFM dynamically computes inter-modal differential
features as guidance signals and feeds them back to the MFRM, enabling adaptive
fusion of complementary information while suppressing common-mode noise across
modalities. To enable robust feature learning, the MFRM and DFFM are integrated
into a unified framework, which is formally formulated as an Iterative
Relation-Map Differential Guided Feature Fusion mechanism, termed IRDFusion.
IRDFusion enables high-quality cross-modal fusion by progressively amplifying
salient relational signals through iterative feedback, while suppressing
feature noise, leading to significant performance gains.In extensive
experiments on FLIR, LLVIP and M$^3$FD datasets, IRDFusion achieves
state-of-the-art performance and consistently outperforms existing methods
across diverse challenging scenarios, demonstrating its robustness and
effectiveness. Code will be available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SQAP-VLA is a training-free framework that simultaneously applies quantization and token pruning to accelerate Vision-Language-Action models, achieving 1.93x speedup while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models have high computational and memory costs that hinder practical deployment, and existing approaches fail to combine quantization and token pruning effectively due to incompatibility issues.

Method: Co-designs quantization and token pruning pipeline with new quantization-aware token pruning criteria and enhanced quantizer design that works on aggressively quantized models.

Result: Achieves 1.93x speedup and up to 4.5% average success rate enhancement compared to original VLA models while preserving core performance.

Conclusion: SQAP-VLA successfully overcomes the incompatibility between quantization and token pruning, enabling holistic efficiency improvement for VLA models without retraining.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models exhibit unprecedented capabilities for
embodied intelligence. However, their extensive computational and memory costs
hinder their practical deployment. Existing VLA compression and acceleration
approaches conduct quantization or token pruning in an ad-hoc manner but fail
to enable both for a holistic efficiency improvement due to an observed
incompatibility. This work introduces SQAP-VLA, the first structured,
training-free VLA inference acceleration framework that simultaneously enables
state-of-the-art quantization and token pruning. We overcome the
incompatibility by co-designing the quantization and token pruning pipeline,
where we propose new quantization-aware token pruning criteria that work on an
aggressively quantized model while improving the quantizer design to enhance
pruning effectiveness. When applied to standard VLA models, SQAP-VLA yields
significant gains in computational efficiency and inference speed while
successfully preserving core model performance, achieving a $\times$1.93
speedup and up to a 4.5\% average success rate enhancement compared to the
original model.

*Chenghao Zhang,Lun Luo,Si-Yuan Cao,Xiaokai Bai,Yuncheng Jin,Zhu Yu,Beinan Yu,Yisen Wang,Hui-Liang Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: S-BEVLoc is a self-supervised LiDAR global localization framework that eliminates the need for ground-truth poses by using BEV images and geographic distances between keypoint patches, achieving state-of-the-art performance on KITTI and NCLT datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LiDAR localization methods require expensive ground-truth poses from GPS or SLAM odometry for supervision. This work aims to eliminate this dependency to reduce costs and improve scalability.

Method: Uses BEV images to construct training triplets based on geographic distances between keypoint-centered patches. Employs CNN for local feature extraction, NetVLAD for global descriptor aggregation, and introduces SoftCos loss for triplet learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on KITTI and NCLT datasets for place recognition, loop closure, and global localization tasks while offering superior scalability compared to supervised approaches.

Conclusion: S-BEVLoc demonstrates that self-supervised learning can effectively replace supervised methods for LiDAR global localization, providing comparable performance without the need for expensive ground-truth data, making it highly scalable and practical.

Abstract: LiDAR-based global localization is an essential component of simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM), which helps loop closure and re-localization.
Current approaches rely on ground-truth poses obtained from GPS or SLAM
odometry to supervise network training. Despite the great success of these
supervised approaches, substantial cost and effort are required for
high-precision ground-truth pose acquisition. In this work, we propose
S-BEVLoc, a novel self-supervised framework based on bird's-eye view (BEV) for
LiDAR global localization, which eliminates the need for ground-truth poses and
is highly scalable. We construct training triplets from single BEV images by
leveraging the known geographic distances between keypoint-centered BEV
patches. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract local features,
and NetVLAD is employed to aggregate global descriptors. Moreover, we introduce
SoftCos loss to enhance learning from the generated triplets. Experimental
results on the large-scale KITTI and NCLT datasets show that S-BEVLoc achieves
state-of-the-art performance in place recognition, loop closure, and global
localization tasks, while offering scalability that would require extra effort
for supervised approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile device usage detection requires understanding behavioral context and human-device interactions, which existing benchmarks don't fully capture for safety monitoring and productivity assessment.

Method: Created FPI-Det dataset with synchronized face and phone annotations across workplace, education, transportation, and public scenarios, featuring extreme scale variation, occlusions, and varied conditions.

Result: Evaluated YOLO and DETR detectors on the dataset, providing baseline results and performance analysis across object sizes, occlusion levels, and environments.

Conclusion: FPI-Det addresses the gap in fine-grained human-device interaction benchmarks and provides a foundation for improving phone usage detection systems in real-world applications.

Abstract: The widespread use of mobile devices has created new challenges for vision
systems in safety monitoring, workplace productivity assessment, and attention
management. Detecting whether a person is using a phone requires not only
object recognition but also an understanding of behavioral context, which
involves reasoning about the relationship between faces, hands, and devices
under diverse conditions. Existing generic benchmarks do not fully capture such
fine-grained human--device interactions. To address this gap, we introduce the
FPI-Det, containing 22{,}879 images with synchronized annotations for faces and
phones across workplace, education, transportation, and public scenarios. The
dataset features extreme scale variation, frequent occlusions, and varied
capture conditions. We evaluate representative YOLO and DETR detectors,
providing baseline results and an analysis of performance across object sizes,
occlusion levels, and environments. Source code and dataset is available at

TL;DR: ZeroPlantSeg enables zero-shot hierarchical segmentation of rosette-shaped plant individuals by combining foundation segmentation models for leaf extraction with vision-language models for structural reasoning, achieving superior performance without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Segmenting entire plant individuals with multiple overlapping leaves is challenging and typically requires species-specific annotated datasets, which demand significant human labor. Current foundation models work well for leaf extraction but struggle with hierarchical plant segmentation.

Method: Integrates a foundation segmentation model to extract leaf instances and a vision-language model to reason about plant structures, enabling plant individual extraction without additional training.

Result: Outperforms existing zero-shot methods and achieves better cross-domain performance than supervised methods across multiple plant species, growth stages, and shooting environments.

Conclusion: ZeroPlantSeg provides an effective zero-shot solution for hierarchical plant segmentation that eliminates the need for annotated training data while maintaining strong performance across diverse conditions.

Abstract: Foundation segmentation models achieve reasonable leaf instance extraction
from top-view crop images without training (i.e., zero-shot). However,
segmenting entire plant individuals with each consisting of multiple
overlapping leaves remains challenging. This problem is referred to as a
hierarchical segmentation task, typically requiring annotated training
datasets, which are often species-specific and require notable human labor. To
address this, we introduce ZeroPlantSeg, a zero-shot segmentation for
rosette-shaped plant individuals from top-view images. We integrate a
foundation segmentation model, extracting leaf instances, and a vision-language
model, reasoning about plants' structures to extract plant individuals without
additional training. Evaluations on datasets with multiple plant species,
growth stages, and shooting environments demonstrate that our method surpasses
existing zero-shot methods and achieves better cross-domain performance than
supervised methods. Implementations are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper improves CLIP for person representation learning by creating WebPerson dataset (5M high-quality person-centric image-text pairs) and proposing GA-DMS framework that uses gradient-attention guidance to mask noisy text tokens and enhance cross-modal alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP faces two challenges for person representation learning: scarcity of large-scale annotated person-centric vision-language data, and limitations of global contrastive learning which struggles with discriminative local features and is vulnerable to noisy text tokens.

Method: Developed noise-resistant data construction pipeline using MLLMs to automatically filter and caption web images (WebPerson dataset). Proposed GA-DMS framework with gradient-attention guided dual-masking to adaptively mask noisy textual tokens and incorporate masked token prediction objectives.

Result: Extensive experiments show that GA-DMS achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks for person representation learning.

Conclusion: The synergistic improvements in data curation (WebPerson dataset) and model architecture (GA-DMS framework) successfully advance CLIP for person representation learning, addressing both data scarcity and model architecture limitations.

Abstract: Although Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) exhibits strong
performance across diverse vision tasks, its application to person
representation learning faces two critical challenges: (i) the scarcity of
large-scale annotated vision-language data focused on person-centric images,
and (ii) the inherent limitations of global contrastive learning, which
struggles to maintain discriminative local features crucial for fine-grained
matching while remaining vulnerable to noisy text tokens. This work advances
CLIP for person representation learning through synergistic improvements in
data curation and model architecture. First, we develop a noise-resistant data
construction pipeline that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of
MLLMs to automatically filter and caption web-sourced images. This yields
WebPerson, a large-scale dataset of 5M high-quality person-centric image-text
pairs. Second, we introduce the GA-DMS (Gradient-Attention Guided Dual-Masking
Synergetic) framework, which improves cross-modal alignment by adaptively
masking noisy textual tokens based on the gradient-attention similarity score.
Additionally, we incorporate masked token prediction objectives that compel the
model to predict informative text tokens, enhancing fine-grained semantic
representation learning. Extensive experiments show that GA-DMS achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ALL-PET is a low-resource PET foundation model that uses latent diffusion with innovative mask augmentation and attention mechanisms to achieve high-quality sinogram generation with only 500 samples, enabling multiple PET imaging tasks with efficient memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Building large-scale PET foundation models is challenging due to limited labeled data and computational resources. The paper aims to overcome data scarcity and efficiency limitations in PET imaging.

Method: Proposes ALL-PET with three innovations: 1) Radon mask augmentation strategy generating diverse training samples, 2) positive/negative mask constraints for geometric consistency, 3) transparent medical attention mechanism for lesion-focused enhancement in projection data.

Result: ALL-PET achieves high-quality sinogram generation using only 500 samples, with performance comparable to models trained on larger datasets. It generalizes across multiple PET tasks including low-dose reconstruction, attenuation correction, delayed-frame prediction, and tracer separation, while using under 24GB memory.

Conclusion: ALL-PET demonstrates that innovative data augmentation and attention mechanisms can enable effective low-resource PET foundation modeling, overcoming data scarcity challenges while maintaining performance across various clinical applications.

Abstract: Building large-scale foundation model for PET imaging is hindered by limited
access to labeled data and insufficient computational resources. To overcome
data scarcity and efficiency limitations, we propose ALL-PET, a low-resource,
low-shot PET foundation model operating directly in the projection domain.
ALL-PET leverages a latent diffusion model (LDM) with three key innovations.
First, we design a Radon mask augmentation strategy (RMAS) that generates over
200,000 structurally diverse training samples by projecting randomized
image-domain masks into sinogram space, significantly improving generalization
with minimal data. This is extended by a dynamic multi-mask (DMM) mechanism
that varies mask quantity and distribution, enhancing data diversity without
added model complexity. Second, we implement positive/negative mask constraints
to embed strict geometric consistency, reducing parameter burden while
preserving generation quality. Third, we introduce transparent medical
attention (TMA), a parameter-free, geometry-driven mechanism that enhances
lesion-related regions in raw projection data. Lesion-focused attention maps
are derived from coarse segmentation, covering both hypermetabolic and
hypometabolic areas, and projected into sinogram space for physically
consistent guidance. The system supports clinician-defined ROI adjustments,
ensuring flexible, interpretable, and task-adaptive emphasis aligned with PET
acquisition physics. Experimental results show ALL-PET achieves high-quality
sinogram generation using only 500 samples, with performance comparable to
models trained on larger datasets. ALL-PET generalizes across tasks including
low-dose reconstruction, attenuation correction, delayed-frame prediction, and
tracer separation, operating efficiently with memory use under 24GB.

TL;DR: ANNs outperform traditional PH methods for predicting Betti numbers in noisy 2D binary images due to their ability to learn contextual and geometric priors from training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compare noise robustness between Persistent Homology (PH) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for topological structure inference from data, particularly for predicting Betti numbers.

Method: Trained a supervised neural network to predict Betti numbers and compared against a PH pipeline using cubical complexes and Signed Euclidean Distance Transform (SEDT) on one synthetic and two real-world datasets with noise.

Result: ANNs demonstrated superior performance over the PH approach under noise conditions, showing better noise robustness.

Conclusion: ANNs offer a compelling alternative to PH for topology estimation in the presence of structural noise, leveraging their learning capabilities for contextual and geometric information.

Abstract: Persistent Homology (PH) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) offer
contrasting approaches to inferring topological structure from data. In this
study, we examine the noise robustness of a supervised neural network trained
to predict Betti numbers in 2D binary images. We compare an ANN approach
against a PH pipeline based on cubical complexes and the Signed Euclidean
Distance Transform (SEDT), which is a widely adopted strategy for noise-robust
topological analysis. Using one synthetic and two real-world datasets, we show
that ANNs can outperform this PH approach under noise, likely due to their
capacity to learn contextual and geometric priors from training data. Though
still emerging, the use of ANNs for topology estimation offers a compelling
alternative to PH under structural noise.

*Yuiko Uchida,Ren Togo,Keisuke Maeda,Takahiro Ogawa,Miki Haseyama*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OSIM is a new evaluation metric for 3D scenes that focuses on object-level perception rather than overall image quality, better aligning with human visual cognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics assess overall image quality but don't match human perception well. Humans recognize 3D scenes by focusing on individual objects, so a metric should reflect this object-centric approach.

Method: Leverages object detection models and their feature representations to quantify the 'objectness' of each object in 3D scenes. Uses neuropsychological insights about human visual attention to objects.

Result: User study shows OSIM aligns more closely with human perception compared to existing metrics. The paper also re-evaluates recent 3D reconstruction and generation models using standardized experimental setup.

Conclusion: OSIM provides a more human-aligned evaluation approach for 3D scenes by focusing on objects as fundamental units of perception, offering better assessment of 3D reconstruction and generation models.

Abstract: This paper presents Objectness SIMilarity (OSIM), a novel evaluation metric
for 3D scenes that explicitly focuses on "objects," which are fundamental units
of human visual perception. Existing metrics assess overall image quality,
leading to discrepancies with human perception. Inspired by neuropsychological
insights, we hypothesize that human recognition of 3D scenes fundamentally
involves attention to individual objects. OSIM enables object-centric
evaluations by leveraging an object detection model and its feature
representations to quantify the "objectness" of each object in the scene. Our
user study demonstrates that OSIM aligns more closely with human perception
compared to existing metrics. We also analyze the characteristics of OSIM using
various approaches. Moreover, we re-evaluate recent 3D reconstruction and

### [28] [Video Understanding by Design: How Datasets Shape Architectures and Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09151)
*Lei Wang,Piotr Koniusz,Yongsheng Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This survey provides a dataset-driven analysis of video understanding architectures, showing how dataset characteristics (motion complexity, temporal span, hierarchical composition, multimodal richness) shape model design from CNNs to transformers and foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing surveys classify video models by task or architecture family, but overlook how datasets impose structural pressures and inductive biases that guide architectural evolution.

Method: Adopts a dataset-driven perspective to reinterpret major video understanding milestones (two-stream CNNs, 3D CNNs, sequential models, transformers, multimodal foundation models) as responses to specific dataset characteristics and pressures.

Result: Provides a unified framework connecting datasets, inductive biases, and architectures, offering practical guidance for model design that aligns with dataset invariances while balancing scalability and task requirements.

Conclusion: This survey offers both a comprehensive retrospective and a prescriptive roadmap for advancing general-purpose video understanding by systematically analyzing how dataset characteristics drive architectural choices and evolution.

Abstract: Video understanding has advanced rapidly, fueled by increasingly complex
datasets and powerful architectures. Yet existing surveys largely classify
models by task or family, overlooking the structural pressures through which
datasets guide architectural evolution. This survey is the first to adopt a
dataset-driven perspective, showing how motion complexity, temporal span,
hierarchical composition, and multimodal richness impose inductive biases that
models should encode. We reinterpret milestones, from two-stream and 3D CNNs to
sequential, transformer, and multimodal foundation models, as concrete
responses to these dataset-driven pressures. Building on this synthesis, we
offer practical guidance for aligning model design with dataset invariances
while balancing scalability and task demands. By unifying datasets, inductive
biases, and architectures into a coherent framework, this survey provides both
a comprehensive retrospective and a prescriptive roadmap for advancing
general-purpose video understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OCELOT 2023 challenge demonstrated that incorporating multi-scale cell-tissue interactions significantly improves cell detection performance over traditional cell-only models, with top entries achieving up to 7.99 F1-score improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pathologists examine Whole-Slide Images at different magnifications to evaluate both tissue morphology and cellular details, but existing deep learning models struggle to learn these interdependent multi-scale semantics. The challenge aimed to validate that understanding cell-tissue interactions is crucial for human-level performance.

Method: The OCELOT 2023 challenge created a dataset with multi-scale overlapping cell detection and tissue segmentation annotations from 673 pairs across six organs from 306 TCGA Whole-Slide Images. Participants developed models that incorporated cell-tissue relationships.

Result: Top-performing models achieved up to 7.99 increase in F1-score on the test set compared to baseline cell-only models that didn't incorporate cell-tissue relationships, showing substantial performance improvement over traditional methods.

Conclusion: Incorporating multi-scale semantics and cell-tissue interactions is essential for achieving human-level performance in cell detection, demonstrating the need for models that can learn interdependent relationships between different magnification levels.

Abstract: Pathologists routinely alternate between different magnifications when
examining Whole-Slide Images, allowing them to evaluate both broad tissue
morphology and intricate cellular details to form comprehensive diagnoses.
However, existing deep learning-based cell detection models struggle to
replicate these behaviors and learn the interdependent semantics between
structures at different magnifications. A key barrier in the field is the lack
of datasets with multi-scale overlapping cell and tissue annotations. The
OCELOT 2023 challenge was initiated to gather insights from the community to
validate the hypothesis that understanding cell and tissue (cell-tissue)
interactions is crucial for achieving human-level performance, and to
accelerate the research in this field. The challenge dataset includes
overlapping cell detection and tissue segmentation annotations from six organs,
comprising 673 pairs sourced from 306 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
Whole-Slide Images with hematoxylin and eosin staining, divided into training,
validation, and test subsets. Participants presented models that significantly
enhanced the understanding of cell-tissue relationships. Top entries achieved
up to a 7.99 increase in F1-score on the test set compared to the baseline
cell-only model that did not incorporate cell-tissue relationships. This is a
substantial improvement in performance over traditional cell-only detection
methods, demonstrating the need for incorporating multi-scale semantics into
the models. This paper provides a comparative analysis of the methods used by
participants, highlighting innovative strategies implemented in the OCELOT 2023
challenge.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RT-DETR++ enhances RT-DETR's encoder with channel-gated attention-based up/downsampling and CSP-PAC feature fusion, achieving superior small object detection in UAV imagery while maintaining real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in UAV object detection including densely packed small objects, scale variations, and occlusion issues that are common in aerial imagery.

Method: Introduces two key improvements: 1) Channel-gated attention-based upsampling/downsampling (AU/AD) mechanism for error minimization and detail preservation, 2) CSP-PAC technique using parallel hollow convolutions for local and contextual information processing in feature fusion.

Result: Achieves superior performance in detecting small and densely packed objects while maintaining sufficient speed for real-time detection without increasing computational complexity.

Conclusion: Provides an effective approach for feature encoding design in real-time detection systems, particularly beneficial for UAV imagery analysis.

Abstract: Object detection in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery presents
significant challenges. Issues such as densely packed small objects, scale
variations, and occlusion are commonplace. This paper introduces RT-DETR++,
which enhances the encoder component of the RT-DETR model. Our improvements
focus on two key aspects. First, we introduce a channel-gated attention-based
upsampling/downsampling (AU/AD) mechanism. This dual-path system minimizes
errors and preserves details during feature layer propagation. Second, we
incorporate CSP-PAC during feature fusion. This technique employs parallel
hollow convolutions to process local and contextual information within the same
layer, facilitating the integration of multi-scale features. Evaluation
demonstrates that our novel neck design achieves superior performance in
detecting small and densely packed objects. The model maintains sufficient
speed for real-time detection without increasing computational complexity. This

### [31] [A Knowledge Noise Mitigation Framework for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09159)
*Zhiyue Liu,Sihang Liu,Jinyuan Liu,Xinru Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free framework for knowledge-based VQA that reduces noise by enhancing knowledge relevance and reducing redundancy through focused retrieval, large model filtering, and selective integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KB-VQA approaches directly augment models with retrieved knowledge but ignore substantial redundancy, which introduces noise into the answering process.

Method: Proposes a three-step framework: 1) Create low-noise queries from image-question pairs for better retrieval, 2) Use large models to filter and extract answer-beneficial knowledge segments, 3) Selective knowledge integration only when the model lacks confidence.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods by acquiring accurate and critical knowledge.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free framework effectively mitigates knowledge redundancy and noise in KB-VQA, enabling more accurate question answering through focused knowledge utilization.

Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires a model to
understand images and utilize external knowledge to provide accurate answers.
Existing approaches often directly augment models with retrieved information
from knowledge sources while ignoring substantial knowledge redundancy, which
introduces noise into the answering process. To address this, we propose a
training-free framework with knowledge focusing for KB-VQA, that mitigates the
impact of noise by enhancing knowledge relevance and reducing redundancy.
First, for knowledge retrieval, our framework concludes essential parts from
the image-question pairs, creating low-noise queries that enhance the retrieval
of highly relevant knowledge. Considering that redundancy still persists in the
retrieved knowledge, we then prompt large models to identify and extract
answer-beneficial segments from knowledge. In addition, we introduce a
selective knowledge integration strategy, allowing the model to incorporate
knowledge only when it lacks confidence in answering the question, thereby
mitigating the influence of redundant information. Our framework enables the
acquisition of accurate and critical knowledge, and extensive experiments
demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

*Yulin Tong,Fengzong Zhang,Haiqin Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CWSSNet framework for hyperspectral image classification using 3D spectral-spatial features and wavelet convolution, achieving high accuracy with good robustness and small-sample performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral images have rich spectral information but suffer from feature redundancy due to numerous bands, high dimensionality, and spectral mixing, requiring improved classification methods.

Method: Proposed CWSSNet framework integrating 3D spectral-spatial features and wavelet convolution with multiscale convolutional attention module for multimodal information fusion and multi-band decomposition in wavelet domain.

Result: Achieved 74.50% mIoU, 82.73% mAcc, and 84.94% mF1 in Yugan County, with highest IoU for water bodies, vegetation, and bare land classification. Maintained reliable performance with limited training time increase at 70% training set proportion.

Conclusion: CWSSNet demonstrates good robustness and maintains reliable performance under small-sample training conditions, breaking through traditional classification performance bottlenecks for hyperspectral imagery.

Abstract: Hyperspectral remote sensing technology has significant application value in
fields such as forestry ecology and precision agriculture, while also putting
forward higher requirements for fine ground object classification. However,
although hyperspectral images are rich in spectral information and can improve
recognition accuracy, they tend to cause prominent feature redundancy due to
their numerous bands, high dimensionality, and spectral mixing characteristics.
To address this, this study used hyperspectral images from the ZY1F satellite
as a data source and selected Yugan County, Shangrao City, Jiangxi Province as
the research area to perform ground object classification research. A
classification framework named CWSSNet was proposed, which integrates 3D
spectral-spatial features and wavelet convolution. This framework integrates
multimodal information us-ing a multiscale convolutional attention module and
breaks through the classification performance bottleneck of traditional methods
by introducing multi-band decomposition and convolution operations in the
wavelet domain. The experiments showed that CWSSNet achieved 74.50\%, 82.73\%,
and 84.94\% in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), mean Accuracy (mAcc), and
mean F1-score (mF1) respectively in Yugan County. It also obtained the highest
Intersection over Union (IoU) in the classifica-tion of water bodies,
vegetation, and bare land, demonstrating good robustness. Additionally, when
the training set proportion was 70\%, the increase in training time was
limited, and the classification effect was close to the optimal level,
indicating that the model maintains reliable performance under small-sample
training conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the research gap in evaluating AI-generated image detection methods under complex real-world conditions, as current datasets lack comprehensive coverage of diverse scenarios and real-world distortions.

Method: Created RRDataset with three evaluation dimensions: scenario generalization (7 major scenarios), internet transmission robustness (social media sharing effects), and re-digitization robustness (4 digitization methods). Benchmarked 17 detectors and 10 VLMs, plus human study with 192 participants.

Result: Benchmarking revealed significant limitations of current AI detection methods in real-world conditions. Human study showed superior few-shot learning capabilities compared to automated methods.

Conclusion: Current AI detection methods are inadequate for real-world applications. Future robust detection algorithms should incorporate human adaptability principles to improve performance across diverse scenarios and distortions.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, highly realistic image
synthesis has posed new challenges to digital security and media credibility.
Although AI-generated image detection methods have partially addressed these
concerns, a substantial research gap remains in evaluating their performance
under complex real-world conditions. This paper introduces the Real-World
Robustness Dataset (RRDataset) for comprehensive evaluation of detection models
across three dimensions: 1) Scenario Generalization: RRDataset encompasses
high-quality images from seven major scenarios (War and Conflict, Disasters and
Accidents, Political and Social Events, Medical and Public Health, Culture and
Religion, Labor and Production, and everyday life), addressing existing dataset
gaps from a content perspective. 2) Internet Transmission Robustness: examining
detector performance on images that have undergone multiple rounds of sharing
across various social media platforms. 3) Re-digitization Robustness: assessing
model effectiveness on images altered through four distinct re-digitization
methods. We benchmarked 17 detectors and 10 vision-language models (VLMs) on
RRDataset and conducted a large-scale human study involving 192 participants to
investigate human few-shot learning capabilities in detecting AI-generated
images. The benchmarking results reveal the limitations of current AI detection
methods under real-world conditions and underscore the importance of drawing on
human adaptability to develop more robust detection algorithms.

TL;DR: Dark-ISP is a lightweight self-adaptive ISP plugin that processes Bayer RAW images for low-light object detection, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with minimal parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-light object detection is challenging due to degraded image quality. Existing approaches either use RAW-RGB images with information loss or employ complex frameworks, creating a need for a more efficient solution.

Method: Deconstructs conventional ISP pipelines into sequential linear (sensor calibration) and nonlinear (tone mapping) sub-modules as differentiable components optimized through task-driven losses. Uses content-aware adaptability and physics-informed priors, plus a Self-Boost mechanism for sub-module cooperation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art RGB- and RAW-based detection approaches on three RAW image datasets, achieving superior results with minimal parameters in challenging low-light environments.

Conclusion: The proposed Dark-ISP enables seamless end-to-end training for object detection by directly processing Bayer RAW images, providing an effective solution for low-light object detection with improved performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Low-light Object detection is crucial for many real-world applications but
remains challenging due to degraded image quality. While recent studies have
shown that RAW images offer superior potential over RGB images, existing
approaches either use RAW-RGB images with information loss or employ complex
frameworks. To address these, we propose a lightweight and self-adaptive Image
Signal Processing (ISP) plugin, Dark-ISP, which directly processes Bayer RAW
images in dark environments, enabling seamless end-to-end training for object
detection. Our key innovations are: (1) We deconstruct conventional ISP
pipelines into sequential linear (sensor calibration) and nonlinear (tone
mapping) sub-modules, recasting them as differentiable components optimized
through task-driven losses. Each module is equipped with content-aware
adaptability and physics-informed priors, enabling automatic RAW-to-RGB
conversion aligned with detection objectives. (2) By exploiting the ISP
pipeline's intrinsic cascade structure, we devise a Self-Boost mechanism that
facilitates cooperation between sub-modules. Through extensive experiments on
three RAW image datasets, we demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art RGB- and RAW-based detection approaches, achieving superior
results with minimal parameters in challenging low-light environments.

### [36] [MGTraj: Multi-Granularity Goal-Guided Human Trajectory Prediction with Recursive Refinement Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09200)
*Ge Sun,Jun Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MGTraj introduces multi-granularity modeling for human trajectory prediction, using recursive refinement from coarse to fine levels with transformer networks and velocity prediction as auxiliary task, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing goal-guided approaches operate at extreme granularities (coarse goal prediction and fine trajectory completion), leaving intermediate temporal granularity unexplored despite its potential utility in capturing diverse human dynamics.

Method: MGTraj recursively encodes trajectory proposals from coarse to fine granularity levels using transformer-based recursive refinement networks (RRN), integrates features across granularities with weight-sharing strategy, and employs velocity prediction as auxiliary task.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on ETH/UCY and Stanford Drone Dataset show MGTraj outperforms baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance among goal-guided methods.

Conclusion: Multi-granularity modeling effectively captures diverse scales of human dynamics and motion patterns, and the proposed recursive refinement approach with feature integration significantly enhances trajectory prediction accuracy in goal-guided frameworks.

Abstract: Accurate human trajectory prediction is crucial for robotics navigation and
autonomous driving. Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating goal
guidance significantly enhances prediction accuracy by reducing uncertainty and
leveraging prior knowledge. Most goal-guided approaches decouple the prediction
task into two stages: goal prediction and subsequent trajectory completion
based on the predicted goal, which operate at extreme granularities:
coarse-grained goal prediction forecasts the overall intention, while
fine-grained trajectory completion needs to generate the positions for all
future timesteps. The potential utility of intermediate temporal granularity
remains largely unexplored, which motivates multi-granularity trajectory
modeling. While prior work has shown that multi-granularity representations
capture diverse scales of human dynamics and motion patterns, effectively
integrating this concept into goal-guided frameworks remains challenging. In
this paper, we propose MGTraj, a novel Multi-Granularity goal-guided model for
human Trajectory prediction. MGTraj recursively encodes trajectory proposals
from coarse to fine granularity levels. At each level, a transformer-based
recursive refinement network (RRN) captures features and predicts progressive
refinements. Features across different granularities are integrated using a
weight-sharing strategy, and velocity prediction is employed as an auxiliary
task to further enhance performance. Comprehensive experimental results in
EHT/UCY and Stanford Drone Dataset indicate that MGTraj outperforms baseline
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance among goal-guided methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Medverse is a universal in-context learning model for 3D medical imaging that achieves high-fidelity predictions with global anatomical understanding across diverse tasks and anatomical regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ICL models for medical imaging cannot simultaneously achieve high-fidelity predictions and global anatomical understanding, and lack unified training across diverse medical imaging tasks and anatomical regions, limiting the potential of ICL in medical imaging.

Method: Medverse employs a next-scale autoregressive in-context learning framework that progressively refines predictions from coarse to fine, and uses a blockwise cross-attention module for long-range interactions while maintaining computational efficiency through spatial sparsity. Trained on 22 datasets covering diverse tasks across multiple organs, modalities, and clinical centers.

Result: Medverse substantially outperforms existing ICL baselines on held-out datasets covering unseen clinical centers, organs, species, and imaging modalities, generating consistent, full-resolution volumetric outputs with multi-scale anatomical awareness.

Conclusion: Medverse establishes a novel paradigm for in-context learning in medical imaging, demonstrating superior performance and versatility across diverse medical image analysis tasks without retraining.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) offers a promising paradigm for universal medical
image analysis, enabling models to perform diverse image processing tasks
without retraining. However, current ICL models for medical imaging remain
limited in two critical aspects: they cannot simultaneously achieve
high-fidelity predictions and global anatomical understanding, and there is no
unified model trained across diverse medical imaging tasks (e.g., segmentation
and enhancement) and anatomical regions. As a result, the full potential of ICL
in medical imaging remains underexplored. Thus, we present \textbf{Medverse}, a
universal ICL model for 3D medical imaging, trained on 22 datasets covering
diverse tasks in universal image segmentation, transformation, and enhancement
across multiple organs, imaging modalities, and clinical centers. Medverse
employs a next-scale autoregressive in-context learning framework that
progressively refines predictions from coarse to fine, generating consistent,
full-resolution volumetric outputs and enabling multi-scale anatomical
awareness. We further propose a blockwise cross-attention module that
facilitates long-range interactions between context and target inputs while
preserving computational efficiency through spatial sparsity. Medverse is
extensively evaluated on a broad collection of held-out datasets covering
previously unseen clinical centers, organs, species, and imaging modalities.
Results demonstrate that Medverse substantially outperforms existing ICL
baselines and establishes a novel paradigm for in-context learning. Code and
model weights will be made publicly available. Our model are publicly available

Abstract: Background and objective Early diagnosis of gastric diseases is crucial to
prevent fatal outcomes. Although histopathologic examination remains the
diagnostic gold standard, it is performed entirely manually, making evaluations
labor-intensive and prone to variability among pathologists. Critical findings
may be missed, and lack of standard procedures reduces consistency. These
limitations highlight the need for automated, reliable, and efficient methods
for gastric tissue analysis. Methods In this study, a novel hybrid model named
CoAtNeXt was proposed for the classification of gastric tissue images. The
model is built upon the CoAtNet architecture by replacing its MBConv layers
with enhanced ConvNeXtV2 blocks. Additionally, the Convolutional Block
Attention Module (CBAM) is integrated to improve local feature extraction
through channel and spatial attention mechanisms. The architecture was scaled
to achieve a balance between computational efficiency and classification
performance. CoAtNeXt was evaluated on two publicly available datasets,
HMU-GC-HE-30K for eight-class classification and GasHisSDB for binary
classification, and was compared against 10 Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) and ten Vision Transformer (ViT) models. Results CoAtNeXt achieved
96.47% accuracy, 96.60% precision, 96.47% recall, 96.45% F1 score, and 99.89%
AUC on HMU-GC-HE-30K. On GasHisSDB, it reached 98.29% accuracy, 98.07%
precision, 98.41% recall, 98.23% F1 score, and 99.90% AUC. It outperformed all
CNN and ViT models tested and surpassed previous studies in the literature.
Conclusion Experimental results show that CoAtNeXt is a robust architecture for
histopathological classification of gastric tissue images, providing
performance on binary and multiclass. Its highlights its potential to assist
pathologists by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and reducing workload.

TL;DR: MMOral is the first large-scale multimodal instruction dataset and benchmark for panoramic X-ray interpretation in dentistry, revealing current LVLMs' limitations (best model GPT-4o only 41.45% accuracy) and proposing OralGPT which achieves 24.73% improvement through supervised fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large vision-language models perform well on general medical tasks but are underexplored for specialized domains like dentistry, particularly panoramic X-rays which have dense anatomical structures and subtle pathological cues not captured by current benchmarks.

Method: Created MMOral dataset with 20,563 annotated images and 1.3M instruction instances across multiple task types. Developed MMOral-Bench evaluation suite covering five diagnostic dimensions. Proposed OralGPT through supervised fine-tuning of Qwen2.5-VL-7B using the MMOral dataset.

Result: Evaluation of 64 LVLMs showed poor performance (best model GPT-4o achieved only 41.45% accuracy). OralGPT demonstrated substantial 24.73% improvement after just one epoch of supervised fine-tuning.

Conclusion: MMOral and OralGPT provide a critical foundation for intelligent dentistry and enable more clinically impactful multimodal AI systems in dental field, with significant potential to advance specialized medical AI applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
strong performance on general-purpose medical tasks. However, their
effectiveness in specialized domains such as dentistry remains underexplored.
In particular, panoramic X-rays, a widely used imaging modality in oral
radiology, pose interpretative challenges due to dense anatomical structures
and subtle pathological cues, which are not captured by existing medical
benchmarks or instruction datasets. To this end, we introduce MMOral, the first
large-scale multimodal instruction dataset and benchmark tailored for panoramic
X-ray interpretation. MMOral consists of 20,563 annotated images paired with
1.3 million instruction-following instances across diverse task types,
including attribute extraction, report generation, visual question answering,
and image-grounded dialogue. In addition, we present MMOral-Bench, a
comprehensive evaluation suite covering five key diagnostic dimensions in
dentistry. We evaluate 64 LVLMs on MMOral-Bench and find that even the
best-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, only achieves 41.45% accuracy, revealing
significant limitations of current models in this domain. To promote the
progress of this specific domain, we also propose OralGPT, which conducts
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) upon Qwen2.5-VL-7B with our meticulously curated
MMOral instruction dataset. Remarkably, a single epoch of SFT yields
substantial performance enhancements for LVLMs, e.g., OralGPT demonstrates a
24.73% improvement. Both MMOral and OralGPT hold significant potential as a
critical foundation for intelligent dentistry and enable more clinically
impactful multimodal AI systems in the dental field. The dataset, model,
benchmark, and evaluation suite are available at

TL;DR: DATE enhances temporal awareness in MLLMs through timestamp injection and semantic-guided sampling for better long video understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with long-range temporal dependencies and precise event localization in long videos due to uniform frame sampling and implicit position encodings.

Method: Proposes Dynamic Absolute Time Enhancement (DATE) with Timestamp Injection Mechanism and Temporal-Aware Similarity Sampling strategy that treats video sampling as vision-language retrieval with two-stage algorithm.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on hour-long video benchmarks, with 7B model outperforming many 72B models on some tasks.

Conclusion: DATE effectively addresses temporal reasoning challenges in long videos through explicit timestamp modeling and semantic-aware sampling strategies.

Abstract: Long video understanding remains a fundamental challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), particularly in tasks requiring precise temporal
reasoning and event localization. Existing approaches typically adopt uniform
frame sampling and rely on implicit position encodings to model temporal order.
However, these methods struggle with long-range dependencies, leading to
critical information loss and degraded temporal comprehension. In this paper,
we propose Dynamic Absolute Time Enhancement (DATE) that enhances temporal
awareness in MLLMs through the Timestamp Injection Mechanism (TIM) and a
semantically guided Temporal-Aware Similarity Sampling (TASS) strategy.
Specifically, we interleave video frame embeddings with textual timestamp
tokens to construct a continuous temporal reference system. We further
reformulate the video sampling problem as a vision-language retrieval task and
introduce a two-stage algorithm to ensure both semantic relevance and temporal
coverage: enriching each query into a descriptive caption to better align with
the vision feature, and sampling key event with a similarity-driven temporally
regularized greedy strategy. Our method achieves remarkable improvements w.r.t.
absolute time understanding and key event localization, resulting in
state-of-the-art performance among 7B and 72B models on hour-long video
benchmarks. Particularly, our 7B model even exceeds many 72B models on some
benchmarks.

*Linhao Li,Yiwen Ye,Ziyang Chen,Yong Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PSP-Seg is a progressive pruning framework for efficient 3D medical image segmentation that dynamically prunes redundant modules, achieving performance comparable to nnU-Net while significantly reducing GPU memory, training time, and parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D medical image segmentation faces heavy resource and time consumption, limiting clinical scalability. Existing efficient models are static and manually designed, lacking adaptability and difficulty balancing performance with efficiency.

Method: PSP-Seg begins with a redundant model and iteratively prunes redundant modules using block-wise pruning and functional decoupling loss.

Result: PSP-Seg-S (lightweight variant) achieves performance on par with nnU-Net while reducing GPU memory by 42-45%, training time by 29-48%, and parameters by 83-87% across five datasets.

Conclusion: PSP-Seg offers a cost-effective, high-performing alternative for widespread clinical application of 3D medical image segmentation.

Abstract: 3D medical image segmentation often faces heavy resource and time
consumption, limiting its scalability and rapid deployment in clinical
environments. Existing efficient segmentation models are typically static and
manually designed prior to training, which restricts their adaptability across
diverse tasks and makes it difficult to balance performance with resource
efficiency. In this paper, we propose PSP-Seg, a progressive pruning framework
that enables dynamic and efficient 3D segmentation. PSP-Seg begins with a
redundant model and iteratively prunes redundant modules through a combination
of block-wise pruning and a functional decoupling loss. We evaluate PSP-Seg on
five public datasets, benchmarking it against seven state-of-the-art models and
six efficient segmentation models. Results demonstrate that the lightweight
variant, PSP-Seg-S, achieves performance on par with nnU-Net while reducing GPU
memory usage by 42-45%, training time by 29-48%, and parameter number by 83-87%
across all datasets. These findings underscore PSP-Seg's potential as a
cost-effective yet high-performing alternative for widespread clinical
application.

### [42] [Visual Programmability: A Guide for Code-as-Thought in Chart Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09286)
*Bohao Tang,Yan Ma,Fei Zhang,Jiadi Su,Ethan Chern,Zhulin Hu,Zhixin Wang,Pengfei Liu,Ya Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Code-as-Thought (CaT) approach for chart understanding that adaptively chooses between code-based symbolic representation and direct visual reasoning, trained with dual-reward reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior chart understanding methods are either brittle due to external tool dependencies or limited by single reasoning strategies like text-based chain-of-thought, which are difficult to verify and optimize with reinforcement learning.

Method: Proposes adaptive framework where VLMs learn to choose between CaT pathway (code-based symbolic representation) and direct visual reasoning pathway. Uses reinforcement learning with dual-reward system combining data-accuracy reward and decision reward.

Result: Demonstrates strong and robust performance across diverse chart-understanding benchmarks, showing VLMs can dynamically select optimal reasoning pathways.

Conclusion: VLMs can be taught not only to reason but also how to reason, adapting their strategy based on chart complexity and task requirements through visual programmability.

Abstract: Chart understanding presents a critical test to the reasoning capabilities of
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior approaches face critical limitations: some
rely on external tools, making them brittle and constrained by a predefined
toolkit, while others fine-tune specialist models that often adopt a single
reasoning strategy, such as text-based chain-of-thought (CoT). The intermediate
steps of text-based reasoning are difficult to verify, which complicates the
use of reinforcement-learning signals that reward factual accuracy. To address
this, we propose a Code-as-Thought (CaT) approach to represent the visual
information of a chart in a verifiable, symbolic format. Our key insight is
that this strategy must be adaptive: a fixed, code-only implementation
consistently fails on complex charts where symbolic representation is
unsuitable. This finding leads us to introduce Visual Programmability: a
learnable property that determines if a chart-question pair is better solved
with code or direct visual analysis. We implement this concept in an adaptive
framework where a VLM learns to choose between the CaT pathway and a direct
visual reasoning pathway. The selection policy of the model is trained with
reinforcement learning using a novel dual-reward system. This system combines a
data-accuracy reward to ground the model in facts and prevent numerical
hallucination, with a decision reward that teaches the model when to use each
strategy, preventing it from defaulting to a single reasoning mode. Experiments
demonstrate strong and robust performance across diverse chart-understanding
benchmarks. Our work shows that VLMs can be taught not only to reason but also
how to reason, dynamically selecting the optimal reasoning pathway for each
task.

*Anthony P. Addison,Felix Wagner,Wentian Xu,Natalie Voets,Konstantinos Kamnitsas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A U-net modification with modality-agnostic input channels and synthetic MRI augmentation enables brain lesion segmentation on both seen and unseen MRI modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing segmentation models for multimodal brain MRI are restricted to fixed modalities and cannot effectively process new modalities at inference, while generalized models may lose modality-specific information.

Method: Modified U-net architecture with modality-agnostic input channel alongside modality-specific channels, trained using image augmentation that synthesizes artificial MRI modalities by differentially altering pathological and healthy tissue appearance.

Result: Evaluated on 8 MRI databases with 5 pathology types and 8 modalities, the approach preserved performance on training modalities while effectively processing new, unseen modalities to improve segmentation.

Conclusion: The simple architectural modification with synthetic augmentation enables practical multimodal brain MRI segmentation that works with any available imaging modalities, including previously unseen ones.

Abstract: Segmentation models are important tools for the detection and analysis of
lesions in brain MRI. Depending on the type of brain pathology that is imaged,
MRI scanners can acquire multiple, different image modalities (contrasts). Most
segmentation models for multimodal brain MRI are restricted to fixed modalities
and cannot effectively process new ones at inference. Some models generalize to
unseen modalities but may lose discriminative modality-specific information.
This work aims to develop a model that can perform inference on data that
contain image modalities unseen during training, previously seen modalities,
and heterogeneous combinations of both, thus allowing a user to utilize any
available imaging modalities. We demonstrate this is possible with a simple,
thus practical alteration to the U-net architecture, by integrating a
modality-agnostic input channel or pathway, alongside modality-specific input
channels. To train this modality-agnostic component, we develop an image
augmentation scheme that synthesizes artificial MRI modalities. Augmentations
differentially alter the appearance of pathological and healthy brain tissue to
create artificial contrasts between them while maintaining realistic anatomical
integrity. We evaluate the method using 8 MRI databases that include 5 types of
pathologies (stroke, tumours, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis and
white matter hyperintensities) and 8 modalities (T1, T1+contrast, T2, PD, SWI,
DWI, ADC and FLAIR). The results demonstrate that the approach preserves the
ability to effectively process MRI modalities encountered during training,
while being able to process new, unseen modalities to improve its segmentation.

TL;DR: Novel open-set detection framework for UAV air-to-air object detection that handles unknown objects and corrupted flight data using embedding-space entropy modeling with spectral normalization and temperature scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional closed-set detectors degrade significantly under domain shifts and flight data corruption, posing safety risks for UAV autonomy in real-world air-to-air detection scenarios.

Method: Model-agnostic framework for embedding-based detectors that estimates semantic uncertainty via entropy modeling in embedding space, incorporating spectral normalization and temperature scaling for enhanced open-set discrimination.

Result: Achieves up to 10% relative AUROC gain compared to standard YOLO-based detectors on AOT aerial benchmark, with background rejection improving robustness without compromising detection accuracy.

Conclusion: The solution is well-suited for reliable UAV perception in dynamic air-to-air environments, demonstrating consistent improvements over baseline methods through comprehensive ablation studies and real-world flight tests.

Abstract: Open-set detection is crucial for robust UAV autonomy in air-to-air object
detection under real-world conditions. Traditional closed-set detectors degrade
significantly under domain shifts and flight data corruption, posing risks to
safety-critical applications. We propose a novel, model-agnostic open-set
detection framework designed specifically for embedding-based detectors. The
method explicitly handles unknown object rejection while maintaining robustness
against corrupted flight data. It estimates semantic uncertainty via entropy
modeling in the embedding space and incorporates spectral normalization and
temperature scaling to enhance open-set discrimination. We validate our
approach on the challenging AOT aerial benchmark and through extensive
real-world flight tests. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate consistent
improvements over baseline methods, achieving up to a 10\% relative AUROC gain
compared to standard YOLO-based detectors. Additionally, we show that
background rejection further strengthens robustness without compromising
detection accuracy, making our solution particularly well-suited for reliable
UAV perception in dynamic air-to-air environments.

*Oh-Tae Jang,Min-Gon Cho,Kyung-Tae Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SlotSAR is a novel object-centric learning framework that disentangles target representations from background clutter in SAR images without requiring mask annotations, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR images contain complex background clutter that resembles targets, causing models to extract entangled or spurious features that undermine clear target representation regardless of classifier used.

Method: Extracts high-level semantic features from SARATR-X and low-level scattering features from wavelet scattering network, then integrates them through a multi-level slot attention module to enhance slot-wise representation distinctiveness.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in SAR imagery by preserving structural details compared to existing OCL methods.

Conclusion: SlotSAR effectively disentangles target representations from background clutter without mask annotations, demonstrating superior performance through complementary multi-level feature integration.

Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images contain not only targets of interest
but also complex background clutter, including terrain reflections and speckle
noise. In many cases, such clutter exhibits intensity and patterns that
resemble targets, leading models to extract entangled or spurious features.
Such behavior undermines the ability to form clear target representations,
regardless of the classifier. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
object-centric learning (OCL) framework, named SlotSAR, that disentangles
target representations from background clutter in SAR images without mask
annotations. SlotSAR first extracts high-level semantic features from SARATR-X
and low-level scattering features from the wavelet scattering network in order
to obtain complementary multi-level representations for robust target
characterization. We further present a multi-level slot attention module that
integrates these low- and high-level features to enhance slot-wise
representation distinctiveness, enabling effective OCL. Experimental results
demonstrate that SlotSAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in SAR imagery
by preserving structural details compared to existing OCL methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MatCha is the first benchmark for materials characterization image understanding, comprising 1,500 expert-level questions across 21 tasks. Evaluation shows state-of-the-art MLLMs significantly underperform human experts, especially on complex visual perception tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise in materials science but their capacity to understand real-world characterization imaging data remains underexplored. There's a need to bridge this gap and assess MLLM performance on authentic materials research challenges.

Method: Created MatCha benchmark with 1,500 questions requiring expert-level domain expertise, covering four key stages of materials research and 21 distinct tasks. Evaluated state-of-the-art MLLMs and compared their performance against human experts using few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting techniques.

Result: Significant performance gap between MLLMs and human experts. Models exhibit degradation on questions requiring higher-level expertise and sophisticated visual perception. Simple prompting techniques fail to alleviate these limitations, showing MLLMs have limited adaptability to real-world materials characterization scenarios.

Conclusion: Existing MLLMs still struggle with real-world materials characterization tasks. The MatCha benchmark will facilitate future research in areas like new material discovery and autonomous scientific agents, highlighting the need for improved multimodal understanding capabilities in materials science applications.

Abstract: Materials characterization is fundamental to acquiring materials information,
revealing the processing-microstructure-property relationships that guide
material design and optimization. While multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) have recently shown promise in generative and predictive tasks within
materials science, their capacity to understand real-world characterization
imaging data remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present MatCha, the
first benchmark for materials characterization image understanding, comprising
1,500 questions that demand expert-level domain expertise. MatCha encompasses
four key stages of materials research comprising 21 distinct tasks, each
designed to reflect authentic challenges faced by materials scientists. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on MatCha reveals a significant
performance gap compared to human experts. These models exhibit degradation
when addressing questions requiring higher-level expertise and sophisticated
visual perception. Simple few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting struggle to
alleviate these limitations. These findings highlight that existing MLLMs still
exhibit limited adaptability to real-world materials characterization
scenarios. We hope MatCha will facilitate future research in areas such as new

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHCP enables heterogeneous collaborative perception without joint training by using few-shot unsupervised domain adaptation during inference


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods require impractical joint training or pre-storing models for all collaborators, making real-world deployment difficult

Method: Progressive Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception (PHCP) dynamically aligns features by self-training an adapter during inference using unlabeled data

Result: Achieves strong performance on OPV2V dataset, comparable to SOTA methods trained on full dataset while using minimal unlabeled data

Conclusion: PHCP provides a practical solution for real-world heterogeneous collaborative perception by eliminating need for joint training and labeled data

Abstract: Collaborative perception enables vehicles to overcome individual perception
limitations by sharing information, allowing them to see further and through
occlusions. In real-world scenarios, models on different vehicles are often
heterogeneous due to manufacturer variations. Existing methods for
heterogeneous collaborative perception address this challenge by fine-tuning
adapters or the entire network to bridge the domain gap. However, these methods
are impractical in real-world applications, as each new collaborator must
undergo joint training with the ego vehicle on a dataset before inference, or
the ego vehicle stores models for all potential collaborators in advance.
Therefore, we pose a new question: Can we tackle this challenge directly during
inference, eliminating the need for joint training? To answer this, we
introduce Progressive Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception (PHCP), a novel
framework that formulates the problem as few-shot unsupervised domain
adaptation. Unlike previous work, PHCP dynamically aligns features by
self-training an adapter during inference, eliminating the need for labeled
data and joint training. Extensive experiments on the OPV2V dataset demonstrate
that PHCP achieves strong performance across diverse heterogeneous scenarios.
Notably, PHCP achieves performance comparable to SOTA methods trained on the
entire dataset while using only a small amount of unlabeled data.

Motivation: Vision-language models have strong zero-shot classification through image-text alignment, but their purely visual inference capabilities remain under-explored.

Method: Evaluated diverse dual-encoder VLMs (including SigLIP 2 and RADIOv2.5) on ImageNet-1k, analyzed key factors affecting accuracy, and introduced a learning-free fusion method based on per-class precision.

Result: Language and vision offer complementary strengths - some classes favor textual prompts while others are better handled by visual similarity. The fusion method improves classification performance.

Conclusion: The complementary nature of language and vision in VLMs can be effectively exploited through simple fusion methods to enhance image classification performance.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled strong zero-shot classification
through image-text alignment. Yet, their purely visual inference capabilities
remain under-explored. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
both language-guided and vision-only image classification with a diverse set of
dual-encoder VLMs, including both well-established and recent models such as
SigLIP 2 and RADIOv2.5. The performance is compared in a standard setup on the
ImageNet-1k validation set and its label-corrected variant. The key factors
affecting accuracy are analysed, including prompt design, class diversity, the
number of neighbours in k-NN, and reference set size. We show that language and
vision offer complementary strengths, with some classes favouring textual
prompts and others better handled by visual similarity. To exploit this
complementarity, we introduce a simple, learning-free fusion method based on
per-class precision that improves classification performance. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Few-shot learning for surgical skill assessment using self-supervised pre-training shows small domain-relevant datasets outperform large less-aligned ones, achieving up to 73.65% accuracy with procedure-specific data boosting performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated surgical skill assessment faces challenges due to scarce skill annotations that require expert consensus and are time-consuming to produce. Few-shot learning offers a scalable alternative but depends on effective pre-training, which remains unexplored in SSA.

Method: Formulated SSA as a few-shot task and investigated self-supervised pre-training strategies. Annotated a robotic surgery dataset with OSATS scores, evaluated various pre-training sources across three few-shot settings (1-, 2-, and 5-shot), and analyzed domain similarity and procedure-specific data inclusion.

Result: Domain-relevant small datasets outperformed large-scale less aligned ones, achieving accuracies of 60.16% (1-shot), 66.03% (2-shot), and 73.65% (5-shot). Incorporating procedure-specific data with domain-relevant external datasets boosted performance by +1.22% accuracy and +2.28% F1-score, while less similar large-scale sources caused performance degradation.

Conclusion: Small but domain-relevant datasets are more effective than large less-aligned ones for few-shot surgical skill assessment. Strategic inclusion of procedure-specific data with domain-relevant pre-training significantly improves downstream performance, highlighting the importance of domain alignment in pre-training strategies.

Abstract: Automated surgical skill assessment (SSA) is a central task in surgical
computer vision. Developing robust SSA models is challenging due to the
scarcity of skill annotations, which are time-consuming to produce and require
expert consensus. Few-shot learning (FSL) offers a scalable alternative
enabling model development with minimal supervision, though its success
critically depends on effective pre-training. While widely studied for several
surgical downstream tasks, pre-training has remained largely unexplored in SSA.
In this work, we formulate SSA as a few-shot task and investigate how
self-supervised pre-training strategies affect downstream few-shot SSA
performance. We annotate a publicly available robotic surgery dataset with
Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill (OSATS) scores, and evaluate
various pre-training sources across three few-shot settings. We quantify domain
similarity and analyze how domain gap and the inclusion of procedure-specific
data into pre-training influence transferability. Our results show that small
but domain-relevant datasets can outperform large scale, less aligned ones,
achieving accuracies of 60.16%, 66.03%, and 73.65% in the 1-, 2-, and 5-shot
settings, respectively. Moreover, incorporating procedure-specific data into
pre-training with a domain-relevant external dataset significantly boosts
downstream performance, with an average gain of +1.22% in accuracy and +2.28%
in F1-score; however, applying the same strategy with less similar but
large-scale sources can instead lead to performance degradation. Code and

Motivation: Address human error as leading cause of traffic accidents by developing external monitoring system for distracted and impaired driving detection.

Method: Uses computer vision with YOLO object detection, real-time object tracking, lateral displacement analysis, and custom lane estimation algorithms to monitor driving behavior.

Result: System reliably identifies unsafe behaviors like excessive lateral movement and erratic trajectories across diverse road and environmental conditions.

Conclusion: Vision-based approach enables behavioral analysis of non-connected vehicles and shows promise for reducing accidents caused by distracted/impaired driving.

Abstract: Road traffic accidents remain a significant global concern, with human error,

study introduces a novel driver behavior classification system that uses
external observation techniques to detect indicators of distraction and
impairment. The proposed framework employs advanced computer vision
methodologies, including real-time object tracking, lateral displacement
analysis, and lane position monitoring. The system identifies unsafe driving
behaviors such as excessive lateral movement and erratic trajectory patterns by
implementing the YOLO object detection model and custom lane estimation
algorithms. Unlike systems reliant on inter-vehicular communication, this
vision-based approach enables behavioral analysis of non-connected vehicles.
Experimental evaluations on diverse video datasets demonstrate the framework's

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based methods produce texture-less and over-smoothing intrinsic images, failing to handle complex scenes with spatially-varying lighting and rich textures.

Method: Design a texture-guided regularization term and formulate the decomposition problem into an optimization framework to separate material textures and lighting effects.

Result: The method produces high-quality intrinsic images for real-world images and demonstrates superior results compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: Combining texture-aware prior enables effective intrinsic image decomposition for complex scenes with severe lighting and rich textures.

Abstract: This paper aims to recover the intrinsic reflectance layer and shading layer
given a single image. Though this intrinsic image decomposition problem has
been studied for decades, it remains a significant challenge in cases of
complex scenes, i.e. spatially-varying lighting effect and rich textures. In
this paper, we propose a novel method for handling severe lighting and rich
textures in intrinsic image decomposition, which enables to produce
high-quality intrinsic images for real-world images. Specifically, we observe
that previous learning-based methods tend to produce texture-less and
over-smoothing intrinsic images, which can be used to infer the lighting and
texture information given a RGB image. In this way, we design a texture-guided
regularization term and formulate the decomposition problem into an
optimization framework, to separate the material textures and lighting effect.
We demonstrate that combining the novel texture-aware prior can produce
superior results to existing approaches.

Motivation: Explore connections between Plug-and-Play methods and Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models for solving ill-posed inverse problems, particularly single-pixel imaging challenges.

Method: Decouple diffusion process into three stages (denoising, data consistency, sampling), propose hybrid data-consistency module combining multiple PnP-style fidelity terms applied directly to denoised estimates.

Result: Experimental results on single-pixel imaging tasks demonstrate improved reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully integrates learned priors with physical forward models, achieving better performance in single-pixel imaging applications.

Abstract: We explore the connection between Plug-and-Play (PnP) methods and Denoising
Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for solving ill-posed inverse problems, with a
focus on single-pixel imaging. We begin by identifying key distinctions between
PnP and diffusion models-particularly in their denoising mechanisms and
sampling procedures. By decoupling the diffusion process into three
interpretable stages: denoising, data consistency enforcement, and sampling, we
provide a unified framework that integrates learned priors with physical
forward models in a principled manner. Building upon this insight, we propose a
hybrid data-consistency module that linearly combines multiple PnP-style
fidelity terms. This hybrid correction is applied directly to the denoised
estimate, improving measurement consistency without disrupting the diffusion
sampling trajectory. Experimental results on single-pixel imaging tasks
demonstrate that our method achieves better reconstruction quality.

### [54] [A Fully Automatic Framework for Intracranial Pressure Grading: Integrating Keyframe Identification, ONSD Measurement and Clinical Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09368)
*Pengxu Wen,Tingting Yu,Ziwei Nie,Cheng Jiang,Zhenyu Yin,Mingyang He,Bo Liao,Xiaoping Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fully automatic two-stage framework for non-invasive intracranial pressure grading using optic nerve sheath diameter measurement from ultrasound videos and clinical data fusion, achieving significantly higher accuracy than conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intracranial pressure monitoring is crucial but current invasive methods like lumbar puncture have risks. Non-invasive ONSD measurement shows promise but suffers from manual operation inconsistencies, subjectivity, and variability in current clinical practices.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Fundus ultrasound video processing with frame-level anatomical segmentation, rule-based keyframe identification guided by international consensus, and precise ONSD measurement; 2) ICP grading by fusing ONSD metrics with clinical features for ICP grade prediction.

Result: Achieved validation accuracy of 0.845 ± 0.071 (five-fold cross-validation) and independent test accuracy of 0.786, significantly outperforming conventional threshold-based method (0.637 ± 0.111 validation, 0.429 test accuracy).

Conclusion: The framework effectively reduces operator variability and integrates multi-source information, establishing a reliable non-invasive approach for clinical ICP evaluation that improves patient management in acute neurological conditions.

Abstract: Intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation poses severe threats to cerebral
function, thus necessitating monitoring for timely intervention. While lumbar
puncture is the gold standard for ICP measurement, its invasiveness and
associated risks drive the need for non-invasive alternatives. Optic nerve
sheath diameter (ONSD) has emerged as a promising biomarker, as elevated ICP
directly correlates with increased ONSD. However, current clinical practices
for ONSD measurement suffer from inconsistency in manual operation,
subjectivity in optimal view selection, and variability in thresholding,
limiting their reliability. To address these challenges, we introduce a fully
automatic two-stage framework for ICP grading, integrating keyframe
identification, ONSD measurement and clinical data. Specifically, the fundus
ultrasound video processing stage performs frame-level anatomical segmentation,
rule-based keyframe identification guided by an international consensus
statement, and precise ONSD measurement. The intracranial pressure grading
stage then fuses ONSD metrics with clinical features to enable the prediction
of ICP grades, thereby demonstrating an innovative blend of interpretable
ultrasound analysis and multi-source data integration for objective clinical
evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a
validation accuracy of $0.845 \pm 0.071$ (with standard deviation from
five-fold cross-validation) and an independent test accuracy of 0.786,
significantly outperforming conventional threshold-based method ($0.637 \pm
0.111$ validation accuracy, $0.429$ test accuracy). Through effectively
reducing operator variability and integrating multi-source information, our

*Botong Zhao,Qijun Shi,Shujing Lyu,Yue Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unsupervised IC defect segmentation framework that extracts normal features from test images without external references, using reconstruction residuals to identify defects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional defect segmentation methods rely on external normal references which are brittle for IC imagery due to layout variations and alignment difficulties across different products.

Method: Proposes a framework with a learnable normal-information extractor that aggregates representative normal features from the test image, uses coherence loss to associate features with normal regions, and a decoder to reconstruct only normal content. Defects are segmented through reconstruction residuals, with pseudo-anomaly augmentation for training stability.

Result: Experiments on datasets from three IC process stages show consistent improvements over existing approaches and strong robustness to product variability.

Conclusion: The proposed unsupervised framework effectively segments IC defects without external normal support, demonstrating superior performance and robustness across different IC manufacturing stages and product variations.

Abstract: Modern Integrated-Circuit(IC) manufacturing introduces diverse, fine-grained
defects that depress yield and reliability. Most industrial defect segmentation
compares a test image against an external normal set, a strategy that is
brittle for IC imagery where layouts vary across products and accurate
alignment is difficult. We observe that defects are predominantly local, while
each image still contains rich, repeatable normal patterns. We therefore
propose an unsupervised IC defect segmentation framework that requires no
external normal support. A learnable normal-information extractor aggregates
representative normal features from the test image, and a coherence loss
enforces their association with normal regions. Guided by these features, a
decoder reconstructs only normal content; the reconstruction residual then
segments defects. Pseudo-anomaly augmentation further stabilizes training.
Experiments on datasets from three IC process stages show consistent
improvements over existing approaches and strong robustness to product
variability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DRiFt is a feature decoupling framework that separates clinically relevant signals from task-agnostic noise in medical VLMs, improving performance and robustness across distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical VLMs often learn task-agnostic correlations due to variability in imaging protocols and free-text reports, limiting generalizability and increasing failure risk in real-world clinical settings.

Method: Uses parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA) and learnable prompt tokens to explicitly separate clinically relevant signals from noise. Curates high-quality image-text pairs by generating captions for diverse medical data to enhance cross-modal alignment.

Result: Improves in-distribution performance by +11.4% Top-1 accuracy and +3.3% Macro-F1 over prior prompt-based methods, while maintaining strong robustness across unseen datasets.

Conclusion: Disentangling task-relevant features and careful alignment significantly enhance model generalization and reduce unpredictable behavior under domain shift, contributing to safer, more trustworthy clinical VLMs.

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise for clinical decision
support, yet their reliability under distribution shifts remains a major
concern for safe deployment. These models often learn task-agnostic
correlations due to variability in imaging protocols and free-text reports,
limiting their generalizability and increasing the risk of failure in
real-world settings. We propose DRiFt, a structured feature decoupling
framework that explicitly separates clinically relevant signals from
task-agnostic noise using parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA) and learnable
prompt tokens. To enhance cross-modal alignment and reduce uncertainty, we
curate high-quality, clinically grounded image-text pairs by generating
captions for a diverse medical dataset. Our approach improves in-distribution
performance by +11.4% Top-1 accuracy and +3.3% Macro-F1 over prior prompt-based
methods, while maintaining strong robustness across unseen datasets. Ablation
studies reveal that disentangling task-relevant features and careful alignment
significantly enhance model generalization and reduce unpredictable behavior
under domain shift. These insights contribute toward building safer, more
trustworthy VLMs for clinical use. The code is available at

*Yuchan Jie,Yushen Xu,Xiaosong Li,Fuqiang Zhou,Jianming Lv,Huafeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FS-Diff is a novel joint image fusion and super-resolution method that uses semantic guidance and clarity-aware mechanisms to produce high-quality fused images with rich details and semantic information from multimodal inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image fusion techniques struggle with corrupted target/background structures, low resolution, and weak semantic information in real-world applications like military reconnaissance and long-range detection missions.

Method: Unifies image fusion and super-resolution as conditional generation problem using semantic guidance from clarity sensing mechanism. Uses bidirectional feature Mamba for global feature extraction and modified U-Net for random iterative denoising process at multiple noise levels.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods at multiple magnifications on six public datasets and newly constructed AVMS benchmark (600 image pairs), recovering richer details and semantics in fused images.

Conclusion: FS-Diff effectively addresses the challenges of joint image fusion and super-resolution, demonstrating superior performance in producing high-resolution fused images with enhanced semantic information and cross-modal features.

Abstract: As an influential information fusion and low-level vision technique, image
fusion integrates complementary information from source images to yield an
informative fused image. A few attempts have been made in recent years to
jointly realize image fusion and super-resolution. However, in real-world
applications such as military reconnaissance and long-range detection missions,
the target and background structures in multimodal images are easily corrupted,
with low resolution and weak semantic information, which leads to suboptimal
results in current fusion techniques. In response, we propose FS-Diff, a
semantic guidance and clarity-aware joint image fusion and super-resolution
method. FS-Diff unifies image fusion and super-resolution as a conditional
generation problem. It leverages semantic guidance from the proposed clarity
sensing mechanism for adaptive low-resolution perception and cross-modal
feature extraction. Specifically, we initialize the desired fused result as
pure Gaussian noise and introduce the bidirectional feature Mamba to extract
the global features of the multimodal images. Moreover, utilizing the source
images and semantics as conditions, we implement a random iterative denoising
process via a modified U-Net network. This network istrained for denoising at
multiple noise levels to produce high-resolution fusion results with
cross-modal features and abundant semantic information. We also construct a
powerful aerial view multiscene (AVMS) benchmark covering 600 pairs of images.
Extensive joint image fusion and super-resolution experiments on six public and
our AVMS datasets demonstrated that FS-Diff outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods at multiple magnifications and can recover richer details and semantics
in the fused images. The code is available at

### [58] [Semantic Concentration for Self-Supervised Dense Representations Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09429)
*Peisong Wen,Qianqian Xu,Siran Dai,Runmin Cong,Qingming Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses over-dispersion in dense self-supervised learning by proposing explicit semantic concentration through patch correspondence distillation with noise-tolerant ranking loss and object-aware filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image-level SSL avoids over-dispersion through implicit semantic concentration, but dense SSL faces challenges due to spatial sensitivity and complex scene data, requiring explicit solutions.

Method: Proposes two main techniques: 1) Patch correspondence distillation with noise-tolerant ranking loss based on extended AP loss, and 2) Object-aware filter using learnable prototypes via cross-attention to map output to object-based space.

Result: Empirical studies across various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving dense representation learning.

Conclusion: The explicit semantic concentration approach successfully addresses over-dispersion in dense SSL, enabling better patch-level representation learning for downstream dense tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in image-level self-supervised learning (SSL) have made
significant progress, yet learning dense representations for patches remains
challenging. Mainstream methods encounter an over-dispersion phenomenon that
patches from the same instance/category scatter, harming downstream performance
on dense tasks. This work reveals that image-level SSL avoids over-dispersion
by involving implicit semantic concentration. Specifically, the non-strict
spatial alignment ensures intra-instance consistency, while shared patterns,
i.e., similar parts of within-class instances in the input space, ensure
inter-image consistency. Unfortunately, these approaches are infeasible for
dense SSL due to their spatial sensitivity and complicated scene-centric data.
These observations motivate us to explore explicit semantic concentration for
dense SSL. First, to break the strict spatial alignment, we propose to distill
the patch correspondences. Facing noisy and imbalanced pseudo labels, we
propose a noise-tolerant ranking loss. The core idea is extending the Average
Precision (AP) loss to continuous targets, such that its decision-agnostic and
adaptive focusing properties prevent the student model from being misled.
Second, to discriminate the shared patterns from complicated scenes, we propose
the object-aware filter to map the output space to an object-based space.
Specifically, patches are represented by learnable prototypes of objects via
cross-attention. Last but not least, empirical studies across various tasks
soundly support the effectiveness of our method. Code is available in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-source T2I models lag behind closed-source systems due to lack of large-scale reasoning-focused datasets and comprehensive evaluation benchmarks.

Method: Created FLUX-Reason-6M dataset with 6M high-quality images organized by 6 characteristics (Imagination, Entity, Text rendering, Style, Affection, Composition) using Generation Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) for detailed generation steps. Developed PRISM-Bench with 7 evaluation tracks including Long Text challenge using GCoT and advanced VLM-based assessment.

Conclusion: The released dataset, benchmark, and evaluation code aim to catalyze the next wave of reasoning-oriented T2I generation by providing previously unattainable resources to the research community.

Abstract: The advancement of open-source text-to-image (T2I) models has been hindered
by the absence of large-scale, reasoning-focused datasets and comprehensive
evaluation benchmarks, resulting in a performance gap compared to leading
closed-source systems. To address this challenge, We introduce FLUX-Reason-6M
and PRISM-Bench (Precise and Robust Image Synthesis Measurement Benchmark).
FLUX-Reason-6M is a massive dataset consisting of 6 million high-quality
FLUX-generated images and 20 million bilingual (English and Chinese)
descriptions specifically designed to teach complex reasoning. The image are
organized according to six key characteristics: Imagination, Entity, Text
rendering, Style, Affection, and Composition, and design explicit Generation
Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) to provide detailed breakdowns of image generation
steps. The whole data curation takes 15,000 A100 GPU days, providing the
community with a resource previously unattainable outside of large industrial
labs. PRISM-Bench offers a novel evaluation standard with seven distinct
tracks, including a formidable Long Text challenge using GCoT. Through
carefully designed prompts, it utilizes advanced vision-language models for
nuanced human-aligned assessment of prompt-image alignment and image
aesthetics. Our extensive evaluation of 19 leading models on PRISM-Bench

### [60] [FlexiD-Fuse: Flexible number of inputs multi-modal medical image fusion based on diffusion model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09456)
*Yushen Xu,Xiaosong Li,Yuchun Wang,Xiaoqi Cheng,Huafeng Li,Haishu Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlexiD-Fuse is a diffusion-based medical image fusion network that handles flexible input quantities (2 or 3 modalities) with the same weights, outperforming existing fixed-input methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical image fusion methods only work with fixed numbers of input modalities (e.g., only 2 or 3), which limits clinical application where varying numbers of medical images may be available.

Method: Transforms diffusion fusion into maximum likelihood estimation using hierarchical Bayesian modeling and Expectation-Maximization algorithm in diffusion sampling to handle flexible input quantities.

Result: Achieves best performance on Harvard datasets with 9 evaluation metrics for medical image fusion with varying inputs, and shows effectiveness in infrared-visible, multi-exposure, and multi-fusion tasks.

Conclusion: FlexiD-Fuse successfully addresses the limitation of fixed-input fusion methods and demonstrates superior performance across various medical and non-medical image fusion tasks with arbitrary input quantities.

Abstract: Different modalities of medical images provide unique physiological and
anatomical information for diseases. Multi-modal medical image fusion
integrates useful information from different complementary medical images with
different modalities, producing a fused image that comprehensively and
objectively reflects lesion characteristics to assist doctors in clinical
diagnosis. However, existing fusion methods can only handle a fixed number of
modality inputs, such as accepting only two-modal or tri-modal inputs, and
cannot directly process varying input quantities, which hinders their
application in clinical settings. To tackle this issue, we introduce
FlexiD-Fuse, a diffusion-based image fusion network designed to accommodate
flexible quantities of input modalities. It can end-to-end process two-modal
and tri-modal medical image fusion under the same weight. FlexiD-Fuse
transforms the diffusion fusion problem, which supports only fixed-condition
inputs, into a maximum likelihood estimation problem based on the diffusion
process and hierarchical Bayesian modeling. By incorporating the
Expectation-Maximization algorithm into the diffusion sampling iteration
process, FlexiD-Fuse can generate high-quality fused images with cross-modal
information from source images, independently of the number of input images. We
compared the latest two and tri-modal medical image fusion methods, tested them
on Harvard datasets, and evaluated them using nine popular metrics. The
experimental results show that our method achieves the best performance in
medical image fusion with varying inputs. Meanwhile, we conducted extensive
extension experiments on infrared-visible, multi-exposure, and multi-focus
image fusion tasks with arbitrary numbers, and compared them with the
perspective SOTA methods. The results of the extension experiments consistently
demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.

TL;DR: A compact 3D Attention UNet model achieves strong glioma segmentation performance on limited African MRI data, demonstrating practical deployment potential for low-resource settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the scarcity of high-quality annotated brain tumor MRI data in Sub-Saharan Africa and develop an efficient segmentation solution for resource-constrained clinical workflows.

Method: 3D Attention UNet architecture with residual blocks, enhanced through transfer learning from BraTS 2021 pre-trained weights, evaluated on BraTS-Africa dataset (95 MRI cases).

Result: Achieved Dice scores: 0.76 (Enhancing Tumor), 0.80 (Necrotic/Non-Enhancing Tumor Core), 0.85 (Surrounding Non-Functional Hemisphere) despite limited data quality and quantity.

Conclusion: The model demonstrates strong generalizability with compact size (90MB) and fast inference (sub-minute per volume), making it practical for deployment in low-resource African healthcare systems and contributing to equitable AI in global health.

Abstract: Gliomas are the most prevalent type of primary brain tumors, and their
accurate segmentation from MRI is critical for diagnosis, treatment planning,
and longitudinal monitoring. However, the scarcity of high-quality annotated
imaging data in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) poses a significant challenge for
deploying advanced segmentation models in clinical workflows. This study
introduces a robust and computationally efficient deep learning framework
tailored for resource-constrained settings. We leveraged a 3D Attention UNet
architecture augmented with residual blocks and enhanced through transfer
learning from pre-trained weights on the BraTS 2021 dataset. Our model was
evaluated on 95 MRI cases from the BraTS-Africa dataset, a benchmark for glioma
segmentation in SSA MRI data. Despite the limited data quality and quantity,
our approach achieved Dice scores of 0.76 for the Enhancing Tumor (ET), 0.80
for Necrotic and Non-Enhancing Tumor Core (NETC), and 0.85 for Surrounding
Non-Functional Hemisphere (SNFH). These results demonstrate the
generalizability of the proposed model and its potential to support clinical
decision making in low-resource settings. The compact architecture,
approximately 90 MB, and sub-minute per-volume inference time on consumer-grade
hardware further underscore its practicality for deployment in SSA health
systems. This work contributes toward closing the gap in equitable AI for
global health by empowering underserved regions with high-performing and
accessible medical imaging solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfakes intensify misinformation spread in political contexts, and existing detection datasets are limited by outdated generation methods, low realism, or single-face imagery, making them ineffective for general synthetic image detection.

Method: Created a dataset with 3M real images paired with captions, used to generate 963k high-quality synthetic images from proprietary and open-source models. Also developed a crowdsourced adversarial platform where participants generate challenging synthetic images to test detection methods.

Result: Human perception study shows recent proprietary models produce synthetic images increasingly indistinguishable from real ones. The dataset provides comprehensive benchmarking for modern deepfake detection.

Conclusion: The ongoing community-driven initiative ensures deepfake detection methods remain robust and adaptive, proactively safeguarding public discourse from sophisticated misinformation threats as generative techniques continue to evolve.

Abstract: Deepfakes, synthetic media created using advanced AI techniques, have
intensified the spread of misinformation, particularly in politically sensitive
contexts. Existing deepfake detection datasets are often limited, relying on
outdated generation methods, low realism, or single-face imagery, restricting
the effectiveness for general synthetic image detection. By analyzing social
media posts, we identify multiple modalities through which deepfakes propagate
misinformation. Furthermore, our human perception study demonstrates that
recently developed proprietary models produce synthetic images increasingly
indistinguishable from real ones, complicating accurate identification by the
general public. Consequently, we present a comprehensive, politically-focused
dataset specifically crafted for benchmarking detection against modern
generative models. This dataset contains three million real images paired with
descriptive captions, which are used for generating 963k corresponding
high-quality synthetic images from a mix of proprietary and open-source models.
Recognizing the continual evolution of generative techniques, we introduce an
innovative crowdsourced adversarial platform, where participants are
incentivized to generate and submit challenging synthetic images. This ongoing
community-driven initiative ensures that deepfake detection methods remain
robust and adaptive, proactively safeguarding public discourse from
sophisticated misinformation threats.

*Ha Linh Nguyen,Tze Ho Elden Tse,Angela Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes using whole-body linear and angular momentum as a constraint to link local joint motion with global movement, addressing the physical coupling between local and global dynamics in human motion modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion models fail to capture the physical coupling between local joint motion and global movement, while physics-based approaches using joint torques and external forces are computationally expensive and complex.

Method: Introduces a new loss term that enforces consistency between generated momentum profiles and ground-truth data, using whole-body linear and angular momentum as a physically grounded constraint.

Result: The approach reduces foot sliding and jitter, improves balance, and preserves motion accuracy while providing a computationally efficient solution.

Conclusion: Momentum-based constraints provide an effective way to bridge local joint dynamics with global movement, offering improved physical realism in motion generation without complex physics simulations.

Abstract: Many studies decompose human motion into local motion in a frame attached to
the root joint and global motion of the root joint in the world frame, treating
them separately. However, these two components are not independent. Global
movement arises from interactions with the environment, which are, in turn,
driven by changes in the body configuration. Motion models often fail to
precisely capture this physical coupling between local and global dynamics,
while deriving global trajectories from joint torques and external forces is
computationally expensive and complex. To address these challenges, we propose
using whole-body linear and angular momentum as a constraint to link local
motion with global movement. Since momentum reflects the aggregate effect of
joint-level dynamics on the body's movement through space, it provides a
physically grounded way to relate local joint behavior to global displacement.
Building on this insight, we introduce a new loss term that enforces
consistency between the generated momentum profiles and those observed in
ground-truth data. Incorporating our loss reduces foot sliding and jitter,
improves balance, and preserves the accuracy of the recovered motion. Code and
data are available at the project page https://hlinhn.github.io/momentum_bmvc.

TL;DR: A Transformer-based framework for predicting region-wise correspondence between manga line art images without pre-existing labels, achieving high patch-level accuracy and consistent region matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Region-wise correspondence between manga line art images is fundamental for applications like automatic colorization and frame generation, but remains unexplored in realistic scenarios without pre-existing segmentation or annotations.

Method: Divide line art images into patches, use Transformer-based framework to learn patch-level similarities, apply edge-aware clustering and region matching algorithm to convert patch-level predictions into coherent region-level correspondences.

Result: Achieves high patch-level accuracy (96.34%) and generates consistent region-level correspondences across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates strong performance for real-world manga applications and addresses the previously unexplored task of predicting region-wise correspondence without pre-existing labels.

Abstract: Understanding region-wise correspondence between manga line art images is a
fundamental task in manga processing, enabling downstream applications such as
automatic line art colorization and in-between frame generation. However, this
task remains largely unexplored, especially in realistic scenarios without
pre-existing segmentation or annotations. In this paper, we introduce a novel
and practical task: predicting region-wise correspondence between raw manga
line art images without any pre-existing labels or masks. To tackle this
problem, we divide each line art image into a set of patches and propose a
Transformer-based framework that learns patch-level similarities within and
across images. We then apply edge-aware clustering and a region matching
algorithm to convert patch-level predictions into coherent region-level
correspondences. To support training and evaluation, we develop an automatic
annotation pipeline and manually refine a subset of the data to construct
benchmark datasets. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our
method achieves high patch-level accuracy (e.g., 96.34%) and generates
consistent region-level correspondences, highlighting its potential for
real-world manga applications.

TL;DR: Proposes SGDF method using generative diffusion for robust multi-view clustering with noisy/missing data, achieving SOTA results with GDCN framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address low-quality data issues in multi-view clustering caused by noisy views and missing data, which degrade clustering performance.

Method: SGDF uses multiple generative mechanism for multi-view features, robust to low-quality data. GDCN framework builds on SGDF for deep MVC tasks.

Result: Extensive experiments show GDCN achieves state-of-the-art results in deep multi-view clustering tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed SGDF method and GDCN framework effectively handle low-quality multi-view data and advance deep MVC performance.

Abstract: In recent years, Multi-View Clustering (MVC) has been significantly advanced
under the influence of deep learning. By integrating heterogeneous data from
multiple views, MVC enhances clustering analysis, making multi-view fusion
critical to clustering performance. However, there is a problem of low-quality
data in multi-view fusion. This problem primarily arises from two reasons: 1)
Certain views are contaminated by noisy data. 2) Some views suffer from missing
data. This paper proposes a novel Stochastic Generative Diffusion Fusion (SGDF)
method to address this problem. SGDF leverages a multiple generative mechanism
for the multi-view feature of each sample. It is robust to low-quality data.
Building on SGDF, we further present the Generative Diffusion Contrastive
Network (GDCN). Extensive experiments show that GDCN achieves the
state-of-the-art results in deep MVC tasks. The source code is publicly

TL;DR: DualTrack is a dual-encoder architecture for sensorless 3D ultrasound that decouples local and global feature extraction to achieve state-of-the-art trajectory estimation from 2D image sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D ultrasound systems are costly and complex, while existing sensorless approaches either ignore global anatomical features or tightly couple them with local features, limiting robustness.

Method: Proposes DualTrack with separate local encoder (dense spatiotemporal convolutions) and global encoder (image backbone with temporal attention), fused by lightweight module for trajectory estimation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on public benchmark with average reconstruction error below 5 mm, producing globally consistent 3D reconstructions.

Conclusion: Decoupling local and global feature extraction enables more robust 3D ultrasound probe trajectory estimation, outperforming previous methods and demonstrating clinical viability.

Abstract: Three-dimensional ultrasound (US) offers many clinical advantages over
conventional 2D imaging, yet its widespread adoption is limited by the cost and
complexity of traditional 3D systems. Sensorless 3D US, which uses deep
learning to estimate a 3D probe trajectory from a sequence of 2D US images, is
a promising alternative. Local features, such as speckle patterns, can help
predict frame-to-frame motion, while global features, such as coarse shapes and
anatomical structures, can situate the scan relative to anatomy and help
predict its general shape. In prior approaches, global features are either
ignored or tightly coupled with local feature extraction, restricting the
ability to robustly model these two complementary aspects. We propose
DualTrack, a novel dual-encoder architecture that leverages decoupled local and
global encoders specialized for their respective scales of feature extraction.
The local encoder uses dense spatiotemporal convolutions to capture
fine-grained features, while the global encoder utilizes an image backbone
(e.g., a 2D CNN or foundation model) and temporal attention layers to embed
high-level anatomical features and long-range dependencies. A lightweight
fusion module then combines these features to estimate the trajectory.
Experimental results on a large public benchmark show that DualTrack achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and globally consistent 3D reconstructions,
outperforming previous methods and yielding an average reconstruction error
below 5 mm.

Method: Proposes Align4Gen - a multi-feature fusion and alignment method integrated into video diffusion model training. Includes a new metric and analysis of various vision encoders to evaluate their discriminability and temporal consistency for video feature alignment.

Result: The method shows improved video generation performance for both unconditional and class-conditional video generation tasks, as quantified by various metrics.

Conclusion: Feature alignment with pre-trained vision encoders benefits video diffusion model training, and the proposed Align4Gen framework effectively enhances video generation quality through multi-feature fusion and alignment.

Abstract: Video diffusion models have advanced rapidly in the recent years as a result
of series of architectural innovations (e.g., diffusion transformers) and use
of novel training objectives (e.g., flow matching). In contrast, less attention
has been paid to improving the feature representation power of such models. In
this work, we show that training video diffusion models can benefit from
aligning the intermediate features of the video generator with feature
representations of pre-trained vision encoders. We propose a new metric and
conduct an in-depth analysis of various vision encoders to evaluate their
discriminability and temporal consistency, thereby assessing their suitability
for video feature alignment. Based on the analysis, we present Align4Gen which
provides a novel multi-feature fusion and alignment method integrated into
video diffusion model training. We evaluate Align4Gen both for unconditional
and class-conditional video generation tasks and show that it results in
improved video generation as quantified by various metrics. Full video results

Method: Consolidated 21.81 hours of HOI data from diverse sources with detailed text annotations, developed unified optimization framework using contact invariance principle to reduce artifacts and correct hand motions while maintaining human-object relationships.

Result: Created a 30.70-hour enhanced dataset with reduced artifacts, defined six benchmarking tasks, achieved state-of-the-art performance in HOI generative modeling, and validated utility through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: InterAct serves as a foundational resource for advancing 3D human-object interaction generation research and is publicly available for continued development in this field.

Abstract: While large-scale human motion capture datasets have advanced human motion
generation, modeling and generating dynamic 3D human-object interactions (HOIs)
remain challenging due to dataset limitations. Existing datasets often lack
extensive, high-quality motion and annotation and exhibit artifacts such as
contact penetration, floating, and incorrect hand motions. To address these
issues, we introduce InterAct, a large-scale 3D HOI benchmark featuring dataset
and methodological advancements. First, we consolidate and standardize 21.81
hours of HOI data from diverse sources, enriching it with detailed textual
annotations. Second, we propose a unified optimization framework to enhance
data quality by reducing artifacts and correcting hand motions. Leveraging the
principle of contact invariance, we maintain human-object relationships while
introducing motion variations, expanding the dataset to 30.70 hours. Third, we
define six benchmarking tasks and develop a unified HOI generative modeling
perspective, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Extensive experiments
validate the utility of our dataset as a foundational resource for advancing 3D
human-object interaction generation. To support continued research in this
area, the dataset is publicly available at
https://github.com/wzyabcas/InterAct, and will be actively maintained.

*Akshit Achara,Esther Puyol Anton,Alexander Hammers,Andrew P. King*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates shortcut learning and demographic bias in deep learning-based Alzheimer's disease diagnosis from MRI scans, demonstrating race and sex-based biases in DL models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DL algorithms for AD diagnosis can suffer from shortcut learning using spurious features related to protected attributes like race and sex, leading to performance bias against underrepresented groups.

Method: Researchers used multiple datasets and DL models (ResNet and SwinTransformer) to: 1) test if models can identify race/sex from MRI scans, 2) examine performance drops due to training set imbalance, and 3) analyze feature attributions in brain regions for both protected attribute and AD classification tasks.

Result: The study demonstrated the existence of both race and sex-based shortcut learning and bias in DL-based AD classification, showing that models can identify demographic attributes and exhibit performance bias.

Conclusion: This work establishes the foundation for developing fairer DL diagnostic tools in brain MRI by identifying and quantifying demographic biases in current AD classification models.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard for brain imaging. Deep
learning (DL) algorithms have been proposed to aid in the diagnosis of diseases
such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) from MRI scans. However, DL algorithms can
suffer from shortcut learning, in which spurious features, not directly related
to the output label, are used for prediction. When these features are related
to protected attributes, they can lead to performance bias against
underrepresented protected groups, such as those defined by race and sex. In
this work, we explore the potential for shortcut learning and demographic bias
in DL based AD diagnosis from MRI. We first investigate if DL algorithms can
identify race or sex from 3D brain MRI scans to establish the presence or
otherwise of race and sex based distributional shifts. Next, we investigate
whether training set imbalance by race or sex can cause a drop in model
performance, indicating shortcut learning and bias. Finally, we conduct a
quantitative and qualitative analysis of feature attributions in different
brain regions for both the protected attribute and AD classification tasks.
Through these experiments, and using multiple datasets and DL models (ResNet
and SwinTransformer), we demonstrate the existence of both race and sex based
shortcut learning and bias in DL based AD classification. Our work lays the
foundation for fairer DL diagnostic tools in brain MRI. The code is provided at

*Sijun Dong,Yuxuan Hu,LiBo Wang,Geng Chen,Xiaoliang Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PeftCD is a parameter-efficient change detection framework using Vision Foundation Models with LoRA and Adapter modules, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple remote sensing datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in remote sensing change detection including pseudo changes, limited labeled samples, and cross-domain generalization difficulties.

Method: Uses weight-sharing Siamese encoder from VFMs (SAM2 and DINOv3) with integrated LoRA and Adapter modules for efficient fine-tuning, complemented by lightweight decoder.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on multiple datasets: SYSU-CD (73.81% IoU), WHUCD (92.05%), MSRSCD (64.07%), MLCD (76.89%), CDD (97.01%), S2Looking (52.25%), LEVIR-CD (85.62%) with precise boundaries and pseudo-change suppression.

Conclusion: PeftCD provides optimal balance of accuracy, efficiency, and generalization, offering scalable paradigm for adapting large VFMs to real-world remote sensing applications.

Abstract: To tackle the prevalence of pseudo changes, the scarcity of labeled samples,
and the difficulty of cross-domain generalization in multi-temporal and
multi-source remote sensing imagery, we propose PeftCD, a change detection
framework built upon Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) with Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT). At its core, PeftCD employs a weight-sharing Siamese
encoder derived from a VFM, into which LoRA and Adapter modules are seamlessly
integrated. This design enables highly efficient task adaptation by training
only a minimal set of additional parameters. To fully unlock the potential of
VFMs, we investigate two leading backbones: the Segment Anything Model v2
(SAM2), renowned for its strong segmentation priors, and DINOv3, a
state-of-the-art self-supervised representation learner. The framework is
complemented by a deliberately lightweight decoder, ensuring the focus remains
on the powerful feature representations from the backbones. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PeftCD achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple public datasets, including SYSU-CD (IoU 73.81%), WHUCD
(92.05%), MSRSCD (64.07%), MLCD (76.89%), CDD (97.01%), S2Looking (52.25%) and
LEVIR-CD (85.62%), with notably precise boundary delineation and strong
suppression of pseudo-changes. In summary, PeftCD presents an optimal balance
of accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. It offers a powerful and scalable
paradigm for adapting large-scale VFMs to real-world remote sensing change
detection applications. The code and pretrained models will be released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Talk2Event is the first large-scale benchmark for language-driven object grounding using event camera data, featuring 5,567 driving scenes with 30,000+ validated referring expressions and structured attributes for interpretable contextual reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras offer microsecond precision and reliability under challenging conditions, but their integration with natural language understanding remains unexplored, creating a gap in multimodal perception for dynamic scenes.

Method: Built a benchmark on real-world driving scenarios with 5,567 scenes, 13,458 annotated objects, and 30,000+ validated referring expressions enriched with four structured attributes: appearance, status, relation to viewer, and relation to surrounding objects.

Result: Created the first comprehensive benchmark for event-based language grounding that supports interpretable and compositional grounding, enabling analysis beyond simple object recognition to contextual reasoning in dynamic environments.

Conclusion: Talk2Event serves as a foundation for advancing multimodal and temporally-aware perception with applications in robotics and human-AI interaction, bridging the gap between event camera data and natural language understanding.

Abstract: Event cameras capture changes in brightness with microsecond precision and
remain reliable under motion blur and challenging illumination, offering clear
advantages for modeling highly dynamic scenes. Yet, their integration with
natural language understanding has received little attention, leaving a gap in
multimodal perception. To address this, we introduce Talk2Event, the first
large-scale benchmark for language-driven object grounding using event data.
Built on real-world driving scenarios, Talk2Event comprises 5,567 scenes,
13,458 annotated objects, and more than 30,000 carefully validated referring
expressions. Each expression is enriched with four structured attributes --
appearance, status, relation to the viewer, and relation to surrounding objects
-- that explicitly capture spatial, temporal, and relational cues. This
attribute-centric design supports interpretable and compositional grounding,
enabling analysis that moves beyond simple object recognition to contextual
reasoning in dynamic environments. We envision Talk2Event as a foundation for
advancing multimodal and temporally-aware perception, with applications
spanning robotics, human-AI interaction, and so on.

TL;DR: Kling-Avatar is a novel cascaded framework that unifies multimodal instruction understanding with photorealistic avatar video generation, addressing limitations in narrative coherence and character expressiveness of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing audio-driven avatar generation methods treat instruction conditioning as low-level tracking without modeling communicative purpose, compromising narrative coherence and expressiveness.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) MLLM director produces blueprint video conditioned on multimodal instructions to govern high-level semantics; 2) Parallel generation of sub-clips using first-last frame strategy guided by blueprint keyframes.

Result: Generates vivid, fluent 1080p videos at 48 fps with superior lip sync accuracy, emotion expressiveness, instruction controllability, identity preservation, and cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: Kling-Avatar establishes a new benchmark for semantically grounded, high-fidelity audio-driven avatar synthesis, suitable for real-world applications like digital human livestreaming.

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-driven avatar video generation have significantly
enhanced audio-visual realism. However, existing methods treat instruction
conditioning merely as low-level tracking driven by acoustic or visual cues,
without modeling the communicative purpose conveyed by the instructions. This
limitation compromises their narrative coherence and character expressiveness.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Kling-Avatar, a novel cascaded framework that
unifies multimodal instruction understanding with photorealistic portrait
generation. Our approach adopts a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we
design a multimodal large language model (MLLM) director that produces a
blueprint video conditioned on diverse instruction signals, thereby governing
high-level semantics such as character motion and emotions. In the second
stage, guided by blueprint keyframes, we generate multiple sub-clips in
parallel using a first-last frame strategy. This global-to-local framework
preserves fine-grained details while faithfully encoding the high-level intent
behind multimodal instructions. Our parallel architecture also enables fast and
stable generation of long-duration videos, making it suitable for real-world
applications such as digital human livestreaming and vlogging. To
comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a benchmark of 375 curated
samples covering diverse instructions and challenging scenarios. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Kling-Avatar is capable of generating vivid,
fluent, long-duration videos at up to 1080p and 48 fps, achieving superior
performance in lip synchronization accuracy, emotion and dynamic
expressiveness, instruction controllability, identity preservation, and
cross-domain generalization. These results establish Kling-Avatar as a new
benchmark for semantically grounded, high-fidelity audio-driven avatar
synthesis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid framework combining mathematical tumor growth model with guided diffusion model to predict future brain tumor progression from MRI scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting spatio-temporal progression of brain tumors is crucial for clinical decision-making in neuro-oncology, especially in data-limited scenarios.

Method: Combines mechanistic ODE-based tumor growth model with gradient-guided denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) to synthesize anatomically feasible future MRIs from previous scans.

Result: Generates realistic follow-up scans with high spatial similarity and produces tumor growth probability maps showing clinically relevant extent and directionality (95th percentile Hausdorff Distance).

Conclusion: The framework enables biologically informed image generation that accounts for mechanistic priors, offering generative-space-time predictions for brain tumor progression.

Abstract: Predicting the spatio-temporal progression of brain tumors is essential for
guiding clinical decisions in neuro-oncology. We propose a hybrid mechanistic
learning framework that combines a mathematical tumor growth model with a
guided denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) to synthesize anatomically
feasible future MRIs from preceding scans. The mechanistic model, formulated as
a system of ordinary differential equations, captures temporal tumor dynamics
including radiotherapy effects and estimates future tumor burden. These
estimates condition a gradient-guided DDIM, enabling image synthesis that
aligns with both predicted growth and patient anatomy. We train our model on
the BraTS adult and pediatric glioma datasets and evaluate on 60 axial slices
of in-house longitudinal pediatric diffuse midline glioma (DMG) cases. Our
framework generates realistic follow-up scans based on spatial similarity
metrics. It also introduces tumor growth probability maps, which capture both
clinically relevant extent and directionality of tumor growth as shown by 95th
percentile Hausdorff Distance. The method enables biologically informed image
generation in data-limited scenarios, offering generative-space-time
predictions that account for mechanistic priors.

TL;DR: HumbleBench is a new benchmark that evaluates multimodal LLMs' ability to reject incorrect answers and choose "None of the above" when no options are valid, addressing hallucination risks in safety-critical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM benchmarks focus on recognition accuracy but overlook the critical capability of epistemic humility - recognizing when none of provided options are correct, which is essential for trustworthy AI in real-world applications.

Method: Built from panoptic scene graph dataset using fine-grained annotations to extract ground-truth entities/relations. GPT-4-Turbo generates multiple-choice questions with "None of the above" option, followed by rigorous manual filtering process.

Result: Evaluated various state-of-the-art MLLMs (general-purpose and specialized reasoning models) on HumbleBench, providing valuable findings about their ability to reject plausible but incorrect answers across object, relation, and attribute hallucination types.

Conclusion: HumbleBench fills a key gap in current evaluation by incorporating explicit false-option rejection, providing a more realistic measure of MLLM reliability in safety-critical settings where hallucination risks pose significant dangers.

Abstract: Hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) -- where the model
generates content inconsistent with the input image -- pose significant risks
in real-world applications, from misinformation in visual question answering to
unsafe errors in decision-making. Existing benchmarks primarily test
recognition accuracy, i.e., evaluating whether models can select the correct
answer among distractors. This overlooks an equally critical capability for
trustworthy AI: recognizing when none of the provided options are correct, a
behavior reflecting epistemic humility. We present HumbleBench, a new
hallucination benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' ability to reject plausible
but incorrect answers across three hallucination types: object, relation, and
attribute. Built from a panoptic scene graph dataset, we leverage fine-grained
scene graph annotations to extract ground-truth entities and relations, and
prompt GPT-4-Turbo to generate multiple-choice questions, followed by a
rigorous manual filtering process. Each question includes a "None of the above"
option, requiring models not only to recognize correct visual information but
also to identify when no provided answer is valid. We evaluate a variety of
state-of-the-art MLLMs -- including both general-purpose and specialized
reasoning models -- on HumbleBench and share valuable findings and insights
with the community. By incorporating explicit false-option rejection,
HumbleBench fills a key gap in current evaluation suites, providing a more
realistic measure of MLLM reliability in safety-critical settings. Our code and
dataset are released publicly and can be accessed at

TL;DR: UAE framework unifies multimodal learning by treating understanding as image-to-text encoding and generation as text-to-image decoding, using reconstruction fidelity as training objective with reinforcement learning to achieve bidirectional improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified multimodal learning framework that bridges visual understanding and generation through bidirectional information flow, enabling mutual enhancement between image captioning and image generation tasks.

Method: Proposes UAE framework with three-stage Unified-GRPO RL approach: cold-start initialization, generation for understanding (encoder trained to produce captions that maximize decoder reconstruction), and understanding for generation (decoder refined to reconstruct from detailed captions).

Result: The framework achieves striking reconstruction fidelity with encoder autonomously producing more descriptive captions and decoder demonstrating profound understanding of intricate descriptions during RL progression.

Conclusion: The unified approach successfully creates coherent bidirectional information flow between understanding and generation processes, bringing mutual gains and establishing a new paradigm for multimodal learning with improved long-context instruction following and generation quality.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an insightful paradigm through the Auto-Encoder
lens-understanding as the encoder (I2T) that compresses images into text, and
generation as the decoder (T2I) that reconstructs images from that text. Using
reconstruction fidelity as the unified training objective, we enforce the
coherent bidirectional information flow between the understanding and
generation processes, bringing mutual gains. To implement this, we propose UAE,
a novel framework for unified multimodal learning. We begin by pre-training the
decoder with large-scale long-context image captions to capture fine-grained
semantic and complex spatial relationships. We then propose Unified-GRPO via
reinforcement learning (RL), which covers three stages: (1) A cold-start phase
to gently initialize both encoder and decoder with a semantic reconstruction
loss; (2) Generation for Understanding, where the encoder is trained to
generate informative captions that maximize the decoder's reconstruction
quality, enhancing its visual understanding; (3) Understanding for Generation,
where the decoder is refined to reconstruct from these captions, forcing it to
leverage every detail and improving its long-context instruction following and
generation fidelity. For evaluation, we introduce Unified-Bench, the first
benchmark tailored to assess the degree of unification of the UMMs. A
surprising "aha moment" arises within the multimodal learning domain: as RL
progresses, the encoder autonomously produces more descriptive captions, while
the decoder simultaneously demonstrates a profound ability to understand these
intricate descriptions, resulting in reconstructions of striking fidelity.

TL;DR: NRMF is a 3D generative human motion prior that models motion using neural distance fields on Riemannian manifolds, enabling robust and physically plausible motion recovery across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VAE and diffusion-based methods lack explicit modeling of human motion dynamics and physical plausibility. The authors aim to create a motion prior that respects the geometric structure of human articulations and ensures temporal consistency.

Method: Models human motion as zero level sets of neural distance fields for pose, velocity, and acceleration dynamics on product space of joint rotations. Introduces adaptive-step hybrid projection algorithm and geometric integrator for motion rollout.

Result: Significant improvements in motion recovery tasks including denoising, in-betweening, and fitting to partial 2D/3D observations. Shows remarkable generalization across input modalities when trained on AMASS dataset.

Conclusion: NRMF provides a rigorous geometric framework for 3D human motion generation that outperforms existing methods by explicitly modeling motion dynamics on Riemannian manifolds and ensuring physical plausibility.

Abstract: We introduce Neural Riemannian Motion Fields (NRMF), a novel 3D generative
human motion prior that enables robust, temporally consistent, and physically
plausible 3D motion recovery. Unlike existing VAE or diffusion-based methods,
our higher-order motion prior explicitly models the human motion in the zero
level set of a collection of neural distance fields (NDFs) corresponding to
pose, transition (velocity), and acceleration dynamics. Our framework is
rigorous in the sense that our NDFs are constructed on the product space of
joint rotations, their angular velocities, and angular accelerations,
respecting the geometry of the underlying articulations. We further introduce:
(i) a novel adaptive-step hybrid algorithm for projecting onto the set of
plausible motions, and (ii) a novel geometric integrator to "roll out"
realistic motion trajectories during test-time-optimization and generation. Our
experiments show significant and consistent gains: trained on the AMASS
dataset, NRMF remarkably generalizes across multiple input modalities and to
diverse tasks ranging from denoising to motion in-betweening and fitting to
partial 2D / 3D observations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper shows that locality in deep diffusion models is a statistical property of image datasets, not due to CNN inductive biases, and creates an improved analytical denoiser.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why deep diffusion models outperform the theoretical optimal denoiser and characterize the performance gap between analytical models and trained neural networks.

Method: Demonstrated that optimal parametric linear denoisers exhibit locality similar to deep neural denoisers, analyzed pixel correlations in natural images, and crafted an improved analytical denoiser based on these insights.

Result: Found that locality emerges from statistical properties of image datasets rather than CNN inductive biases, and created an analytical denoiser that better matches deep diffusion model scores than previous methods.

Conclusion: The performance gap in diffusion models is primarily due to statistical properties of image data rather than architectural biases, enabling better analytical models that capture deep network behavior.

Abstract: Among generative models, diffusion models are uniquely intriguing due to the
existence of a closed-form optimal minimizer of their training objective, often
referred to as the optimal denoiser. However, diffusion using this optimal
denoiser merely reproduces images in the training set and hence fails to
capture the behavior of deep diffusion models. Recent work has attempted to
characterize this gap between the optimal denoiser and deep diffusion models,
proposing analytical, training-free models that can generate images that
resemble those generated by a trained UNet. The best-performing method
hypothesizes that shift equivariance and locality inductive biases of
convolutional neural networks are the cause of the performance gap, hence
incorporating these assumptions into its analytical model. In this work, we
present evidence that the locality in deep diffusion models emerges as a
statistical property of the image dataset, not due to the inductive bias of
convolutional neural networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that an optimal
parametric linear denoiser exhibits similar locality properties to the deep
neural denoisers. We further show, both theoretically and experimentally, that
this locality arises directly from the pixel correlations present in natural
image datasets. Finally, we use these insights to craft an analytical denoiser
that better matches scores predicted by a deep diffusion model than the prior
expert-crafted alternative.

Motivation: Current spatial intelligence models are constrained by limited training data that lacks scale, diversity, and annotation richness, particularly for real-world dynamic scenes with ground-truth camera motion.

Method: Collected over 21,000 hours of raw video and processed them into 2.7 million clips through hierarchical filtering, then enriched with detailed spatial annotations including camera poses, depth maps, dynamic masks, structured captions, and serialized motion instructions.

Result: Created SpatialVID dataset with 7,089 hours of diverse dynamic content featuring comprehensive 3D annotations that demonstrate richness and diversity to improve model generalization and performance.

Conclusion: SpatialVID establishes itself as a key asset for video and 3D vision research by providing large-scale, high-quality training data that addresses current limitations in spatial intelligence model development.

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in spatial intelligence, spanning both
spatial reconstruction and world exploration. However, the scalability and
real-world fidelity of current models remain severely constrained by the
scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. While several datasets
provide camera pose information, they are typically limited in scale,
diversity, and annotation richness, particularly for real-world dynamic scenes
with ground-truth camera motion. To this end, we collect \textbf{SpatialVID}, a
dataset consists of a large corpus of in-the-wild videos with diverse scenes,
camera movements and dense 3D annotations such as per-frame camera poses,
depth, and motion instructions. Specifically, we collect more than 21,000 hours
of raw video, and process them into 2.7 million clips through a hierarchical
filtering pipeline, totaling 7,089 hours of dynamic content. A subsequent
annotation pipeline enriches these clips with detailed spatial and semantic
information, including camera poses, depth maps, dynamic masks, structured
captions, and serialized motion instructions. Analysis of SpatialVID's data
statistics reveals a richness and diversity that directly foster improved model
generalization and performance, establishing it as a key asset for the video

*John T. Rickard,William A. Dembski,James Rickards*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Develops an interval type-2 version of Bayes Theorem that handles input uncertainties using SME-provided interval estimates and avoids inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Bayesian inference assumes precise input values, which is unrealistic for real-world applications where subject matter experts often provide interval range estimates rather than exact probabilities.

Method: Created an IT2 version of Bayes Theorem with a conservative method to prevent input inconsistencies, and developed a novel algorithm to encode SME-provided intervals into interval type-2 fuzzy membership functions.

Result: The approach enables Bayesian inference with uncertain input probabilities represented as intervals, maintaining validity of output results while accommodating expert uncertainty.

Conclusion: The proposed IT2 Bayes Theorem and interval encoding algorithm provide a more realistic and flexible framework for Bayesian analysis when dealing with uncertain expert-provided input probabilities.

Abstract: Bayesian inference is widely used in many different fields to test hypotheses
against observations. In most such applications, an assumption is made of
precise input values to produce a precise output value. However, this is
unrealistic for real-world applications. Often the best available information
from subject matter experts (SMEs) in a given field is interval range estimates
of the input probabilities involved in Bayes Theorem. This paper provides two
key contributions to extend Bayes Theorem to an interval type-2 (IT2) version.
First, we develop an IT2 version of Bayes Theorem that uses a novel and
conservative method to avoid potential inconsistencies in the input IT2 MFs
that otherwise might produce invalid output results. We then describe a novel
and flexible algorithm for encoding SME-provided intervals into IT2 fuzzy
membership functions (MFs), which we can use to specify the input probabilities
in Bayes Theorem. Our algorithm generalizes and extends previous work on this
problem that primarily addressed the encoding of intervals into word MFs for
Computing with Words applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural language descriptions of optimization problems are difficult to translate into correct MiniZinc models, requiring both logical reasoning and constraint programming expertise that current approaches struggle with.

Method: Multiple specialized LLM agents each handle detection and code generation for specific global constraint types, with a final assembler agent integrating constraint snippets into complete MiniZinc models.

Result: Initial experiments show better performance compared to baselines like one-shot prompting and chain-of-thought prompting across several LLMs.

Conclusion: The agentic approach effectively decomposes complex modeling tasks into simpler sub-tasks, demonstrating promise for automated constraint modeling with identified directions for future enhancements.

Abstract: Natural language descriptions of optimization or satisfaction problems are
challenging to translate into correct MiniZinc models, as this process demands
both logical reasoning and constraint programming expertise. We introduce a
framework that addresses this challenge with an agentic approach: multiple
specialized large language model (LLM) agents decompose the modeling task by
global constraint type. Each agent is dedicated to detecting and generating
code for a specific class of global constraint, while a final assembler agent
integrates these constraint snippets into a complete MiniZinc model. By
dividing the problem into smaller, well-defined sub-tasks, each LLM handles a
simpler reasoning challenge, potentially reducing overall complexity. We
conduct initial experiments with several LLMs and show better performance
against baselines such as one-shot prompting and chain-of-thought prompting.
Finally, we outline a comprehensive roadmap for future work, highlighting
potential enhancements and directions for improvement.

TL;DR: Proposes Truncated Cross Entropy (TCE) loss function to mitigate model collapse in generative AI by downweighting high-confidence predictions during recursive training on synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing reliance on generative AI models leads to synthetic data dominating training datasets by 2030, causing model collapse where performance degrades over generations of training on synthetic data. Existing mitigation strategies are limited.

Method: Identifies model overconfidence in self-generated data as key driver of collapse. Proposes confidence-aware loss function called Truncated Cross Entropy (TCE) that downweights high-confidence predictions during training. Provides model-agnostic framework linking loss function design to collapse mitigation.

Result: TCE significantly delays model collapse in recursive training, extending model's fidelity interval before collapse by more than 2.3x. Method generalizes across different modalities.

Conclusion: Loss function design provides a simple yet powerful tool for preserving generative model quality in the era of increasing synthetic data, with TCE offering effective mitigation against model collapse.

Abstract: The increasing reliance on generative AI models has accelerated the
generation rate of synthetic data, with some projections suggesting that most
available new data for training could be machine-generated by 2030. This shift
to a mainly synthetic content presents a critical challenge: repeated training
in synthetic data leads to a phenomenon known as model collapse, where model
performance degrades over generations of training, eventually rendering the
models ineffective. Although prior studies have explored the causes and
detection of model collapse, existing mitigation strategies remain limited.
  In this paper, we identify model overconfidence in their self-generated data
as a key driver of collapse. Building on this observation, we propose a
confidence-aware loss function that downweights high-confidence predictions
during training. We introduce a novel loss function we call Truncated Cross
Entropy (TCE). We demonstrate that TCE significantly delays model collapse in
recursive training.
  We provide a model-agnostic framework that links the loss function design to
model collapse mitigation and validate our approach both theoretically and
empirically, showing that it can extend the model's fidelity interval before
collapse by more than 2.3x. Finally, we show that our method generalizes across
modalities. These findings suggest that the design of loss functions provides a
simple yet powerful tool for preserving the quality of generative models in the
era of increasing synthetic data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes uncertainty explanations and global explanations in XAI, testing an algorithm that covers uncertainty, robustness, and global XAI concepts to calibrate trust and improve user satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While many areas of XAI are well studied, uncertainty explanations and global explanations are often overlooked. The researchers aim to address this gap by developing general guidelines for XAI schemes.

Method: The researchers selected an algorithm that simultaneously covers multiple concepts (uncertainty, robustness, and global XAI) and tested its ability to calibrate trust. They evaluated whether complex but intuitive visual explanations can provide higher user satisfaction and human interpretability.

Result: The paper presents findings on how algorithms providing intuitive visual understanding impact user satisfaction and interpretability, though specific quantitative results are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: The study contributes to XAI guidelines by focusing on under-explored areas of uncertainty and global explanations, demonstrating the value of intuitive visual approaches despite their complexity.

Abstract: Explainable AI has become a common term in the literature, scrutinized by
computer scientists and statisticians and highlighted by psychological or
philosophical researchers. One major effort many researchers tackle is
constructing general guidelines for XAI schemes, which we derived from our
study. While some areas of XAI are well studied, we focus on uncertainty
explanations and consider global explanations, which are often left out. We
chose an algorithm that covers various concepts simultaneously, such as
uncertainty, robustness, and global XAI, and tested its ability to calibrate
trust. We then checked whether an algorithm that aims to provide more of an
intuitive visual understanding, despite being complicated to understand, can
provide higher user satisfaction and human interpretability.

*Haowei Yang,Yushang Zhao,Sitao Min,Bo Su,Chao Yao,Wei Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a prompt formulation method P(u, Ds) → R̂ to address cold-start user issues in LLM-based recommender systems, showing that optimal exemplar injection and instruction structuring significantly improves precision@k and NDCG scores in low-data settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cold-start users lack historical behavioral information, which compromises recommender system effectiveness. The paper aims to address this issue through prompt-based adaptation in LLM-based recommendation pipelines.

Method: Proposes context-conditioned prompt formulation P(u, Ds) → R̂ where u is cold-start user profile and Ds is curated support set. Uses transformer-based LLMs (BioGPT, LLaMA-2, GPT-4) with token-level alignments and embedding space regularization for semantic fidelity.

Result: Empirical evidence shows significant improvement in precision@k and NDCG scores. Demonstrates that prompt composition controls attention scales and decoder conduct during inference, proving functional beyond just syntactic benefits.

Conclusion: Prompt-based adaptation is an effective approach to address cold-start recommendation issues in LLM-based pipelines, with optimal exemplar injection and instruction structuring being key to performance improvement.

Abstract: The cold-start user issue further compromises the effectiveness of
recommender systems in limiting access to the historical behavioral
information. It is an effective pipeline to optimize instructional prompts on a
few-shot large language model (LLM) used in recommender tasks. We introduce a
context-conditioned prompt formulation method P(u,\ Ds)\ \rightarrow\
R\widehat, where u is a cold-start user profile, Ds is a curated support set,
and R\widehat is the predicted ranked list of items. Based on systematic
experimentation with transformer-based autoregressive LLMs (BioGPT, LLaMA-2,
GPT-4), we provide empirical evidence that optimal exemplar injection and
instruction structuring can significantly improve the precision@k and NDCG
scores of such models in low-data settings. The pipeline uses token-level
alignments and embedding space regularization with a greater semantic fidelity.
Our findings not only show that timely composition is not merely syntactic but
also functional as it is in direct control of attention scales and decoder
conduct through inference. This paper shows that prompt-based adaptation may be
considered one of the ways to address cold-start recommendation issues in
LLM-based pipelines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Comparison of humans, LLMs, and Bayesian agents in dynamic negotiation tasks shows performance parity can mask fundamental behavioral differences critical for real-world deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As autonomous agents increasingly handle coordination tasks traditionally done by humans, it's critical to evaluate not just their performance but also their negotiation processes and behavioral dynamics in multi-agent environments.

Method: Compared humans (N=216), LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro), and Bayesian agents in identical dynamic negotiation conditions, capturing both outcomes and behavioral dynamics.

Result: Bayesian agents achieved highest surplus through aggressive optimization but with frequent rejections. Humans and LLMs achieved similar overall surplus but through distinct behaviors: LLMs favored conservative concessionary trades with few rejections, while humans employed more strategic, risk-taking, and fairness-oriented approaches.

Conclusion: Performance parity alone is insufficient for agent evaluation - fundamental differences in process and alignment are critical considerations for practical deployment in real-world coordination tasks.

Abstract: Coordination tasks traditionally performed by humans are increasingly being
delegated to autonomous agents. As this pattern progresses, it becomes critical
to evaluate not only these agents' performance but also the processes through
which they negotiate in dynamic, multi-agent environments. Furthermore,
different agents exhibit distinct advantages: traditional statistical agents,
such as Bayesian models, may excel under well-specified conditions, whereas
large language models (LLMs) can generalize across contexts. In this work, we
compare humans (N = 216), LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro), and Bayesian agents in
a dynamic negotiation setting that enables direct, identical-condition
comparisons across populations, capturing both outcomes and behavioral
dynamics. Bayesian agents extract the highest surplus through aggressive
optimization, at the cost of frequent trade rejections. Humans and LLMs can
achieve similar overall surplus, but through distinct behaviors: LLMs favor
conservative, concessionary trades with few rejections, while humans employ
more strategic, risk-taking, and fairness-oriented behaviors. Thus, we find
that performance parity -- a common benchmark in agent evaluation -- can
conceal fundamental differences in process and alignment, which are critical
for practical deployment in real-world coordination tasks.

Abstract: Anti-money laundering (AML) actions and measurements are among the priorities
of financial institutions, for which machine learning (ML) has shown to have a
high potential. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive and systematic
approach for developing ML pipelines to identify high-risk bank clients in a
dataset curated for Task 1 of the University of Toronto 2023-2024 Institute for
Management and Innovation (IMI) Big Data and Artificial Intelligence

robust. We also framed the data in a SQLite database, developed SQL-based
feature engineering algorithms, connected our pre-trained model to the
database, and made it inference-ready, and provided explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) modules to derive feature importance. Our pipeline achieved
a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.961
with a standard deviation (SD) of 0.005. The proposed pipeline achieved second

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a neuroscience-inspired computational framework for agentic spatial intelligence, identifying six essential modules and analyzing current methods to bridge the gap between AI systems and human-like spatial reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agentic AI systems have limited spatial reasoning abilities compared to human spatial intelligence, which is critical for better interaction with the physical 3D world and unstructured environments.

Method: The authors introduce a computational framework with six neuroscience-grounded modules: bio-inspired multimodal sensing, multi-sensory integration, egocentric-allocentric conversion, artificial cognitive map, spatial memory, and spatial reasoning. They conduct framework-guided analysis of existing methods and benchmarks.

Result: The paper provides a structured perspective landscape for agentic spatial reasoning, identifies critical gaps in current approaches, and evaluates relevance of recent methods to each neuroscience-inspired module.

Conclusion: The work outlines a promising roadmap for developing more neuroscience-grounded spatial reasoning capabilities that can generalize across dynamic environments, benefiting both virtual and embodied AI systems like robotics.

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic AI have led to systems capable of autonomous task
execution and language-based reasoning, yet their spatial reasoning abilities
remain limited and underexplored, largely constrained to symbolic and
sequential processing. In contrast, human spatial intelligence, rooted in
integrated multisensory perception, spatial memory, and cognitive maps, enables
flexible, context-aware decision-making in unstructured environments.
Therefore, bridging this gap is critical for advancing Agentic Spatial
Intelligence toward better interaction with the physical 3D world. To this end,
we first start from scrutinizing the spatial neural models as studied in
computational neuroscience, and accordingly introduce a novel computational
framework grounded in neuroscience principles. This framework maps core
biological functions to six essential computation modules: bio-inspired
multimodal sensing, multi-sensory integration, egocentric-allocentric
conversion, an artificial cognitive map, spatial memory, and spatial reasoning.
Together, these modules form a perspective landscape for agentic spatial
reasoning capability across both virtual and physical environments. On top, we
conduct a framework-guided analysis of recent methods, evaluating their
relevance to each module and identifying critical gaps that hinder the
development of more neuroscience-grounded spatial reasoning modules. We further
examine emerging benchmarks and datasets and explore potential application
domains ranging from virtual to embodied systems, such as robotics. Finally, we
outline potential research directions, emphasizing the promising roadmap that
can generalize spatial reasoning across dynamic or unstructured environments.
We hope this work will benefit the research community with a
neuroscience-grounded perspective and a structured pathway. Our project page

TL;DR: ProgD is a novel progressive multi-scale decoding strategy for multi-agent motion prediction that uses dynamic heterogeneous graphs to capture evolving social interactions and progressively eliminate uncertainty in future scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent prediction methods overlook the evolving nature of interactions between agents, which is crucial for accurate motion prediction of surrounding agents in autonomous vehicle planning.

Method: Proposed ProgD uses dynamic heterogeneous graph-based scenario modeling to capture evolving social interactions, with a factorized architecture to process spatio-temporal dependencies and progressively eliminate uncertainty through multi-scale decoding.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, ranking 1st on the INTERACTION multi-agent prediction benchmark and performing well on the Argoverse 2 multi-world forecasting benchmark.

Conclusion: The progressive multi-scale decoding with dynamic heterogeneous graphs effectively addresses the evolving nature of social interactions in multi-agent motion prediction, leading to superior performance on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate motion prediction of surrounding agents is crucial for the safe
planning of autonomous vehicles. Recent advancements have extended prediction
techniques from individual agents to joint predictions of multiple interacting
agents, with various strategies to address complex interactions within future
motions of agents. However, these methods overlook the evolving nature of these
interactions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel progressive
multi-scale decoding strategy, termed ProgD, with the help of dynamic
heterogeneous graph-based scenario modeling. In particular, to explicitly and
comprehensively capture the evolving social interactions in future scenarios,
given their inherent uncertainty, we design a progressive modeling of scenarios
with dynamic heterogeneous graphs. With the unfolding of such dynamic
heterogeneous graphs, a factorized architecture is designed to process the
spatio-temporal dependencies within future scenarios and progressively
eliminate uncertainty in future motions of multiple agents. Furthermore, a
multi-scale decoding procedure is incorporated to improve on the future
scenario modeling and consistent prediction of agents' future motion. The
proposed ProgD achieves state-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION
multi-agent prediction benchmark, ranking $1^{st}$, and the Argoverse 2
multi-world forecasting benchmark.

Motivation: Address governance and accountability challenges posed by unpredictable behaviors and heterogeneous capabilities of LLM-powered autonomous agents in multi-agent collaboration systems

Method: Propose a blockchain-enabled layered architecture with three key modules: agent behavior tracing and arbitration, dynamic reputation evaluation, and malicious behavior forecasting

Result: Establishes a systematic foundation for trustworthy, resilient, and scalable regulatory mechanisms in large-scale agent ecosystems

Conclusion: Blockchain technology provides effective regulatory framework for multi-agent systems, with identified future research directions for further development

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-empowered autonomous agents are transforming
both digital and physical environments by enabling adaptive, multi-agent
collaboration. While these agents offer significant opportunities across
domains such as finance, healthcare, and smart manufacturing, their
unpredictable behaviors and heterogeneous capabilities pose substantial
governance and accountability challenges. In this paper, we propose a
blockchain-enabled layered architecture for regulatory agent collaboration,
comprising an agent layer, a blockchain data layer, and a regulatory
application layer. Within this framework, we design three key modules: (i) an
agent behavior tracing and arbitration module for automated accountability,
(ii) a dynamic reputation evaluation module for trust assessment in
collaborative scenarios, and (iii) a malicious behavior forecasting module for
early detection of adversarial activities. Our approach establishes a
systematic foundation for trustworthy, resilient, and scalable regulatory
mechanisms in large-scale agent ecosystems. Finally, we discuss the future
research directions for blockchain-enabled regulatory frameworks in multi-agent
systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in automating data

and tool use, which limits their effectiveness on complex data analysis tasks.
To address this, we propose a scalable pipeline that extracts high-quality,
tool-based data analysis tasks and their executable multi-step solutions from
real-world Jupyter notebooks and associated data files. Using this pipeline, we
introduce NbQA, a large-scale dataset of standardized task-solution pairs that
reflect authentic tool-use patterns in practical data science scenarios. To
further enhance multi-step reasoning, we present Jupiter, a framework that
formulates data analysis as a search problem and applies Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to generate diverse solution trajectories for value model
learning. During inference, Jupiter combines the value model and node visit
counts to efficiently collect executable multi-step plans with minimal search
steps. Experimental results show that Qwen2.5-7B and 14B-Instruct models on
NbQA solve 77.82% and 86.38% of tasks on InfiAgent-DABench,

Motivation: Traditional RAG approaches struggle with thematic and holistic understanding of complex texts, requiring deeper analysis of both text and context that knowledge graphs can provide.

Method: Comprehensive technical comparative study evaluating three open-source methodologies for constructing knowledge graph triplets and integrating them with LLMs for question answering.

Result: Experimental results show OpenIE provides the most comprehensive triplet coverage, while GraphRAG demonstrates superior reasoning abilities among the three methods.

Conclusion: Discussion of strengths/limitations of each method and insights for future directions in improving knowledge graph-based question answering systems.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs, a powerful tool for structuring information through

comprehensive coverage of triplets, GraphRAG demonstrates superior reasoning
abilities among the three. We conclude with a discussion on the strengths and

Motivation: Recent advances show MCTS effectively generates high-quality intermediate trajectories in reasoning tasks, but these trajectories are traditionally used for training value/reward models rather than policy optimization

Method: Propose staged GRPO training paradigm using completions from partially revealed MCTS rollouts, introducing tree-structured setting for advantage estimation and prefix-conditioned reward signals

Result: Initial results show structured advantage estimation stabilizes updates and better reflects compositional reasoning quality, but challenges like advantage saturation and reward signal collapse remain

Conclusion: Heuristic and statistical solutions proposed to mitigate issues, with discussion of open challenges for learning under staged/tree-like reward structures

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have shown the
effectiveness of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for generating high-quality
intermediate trajectories, particularly in math and symbolic domains. Inspired
by this, we explore how MCTS-derived trajectories, traditionally used for
training value or reward models, can be repurposed to improve policy
optimization in preference-based reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we
focus on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a recent algorithm that
enables preference-consistent policy learning without value networks. We
propose a staged GRPO training paradigm where completions are derived from
partially revealed MCTS rollouts, introducing a novel tree-structured setting
for advantage estimation. This leads to a rich class of prefix-conditioned
reward signals, which we analyze theoretically and empirically. Our initial
results indicate that while structured advantage estimation can stabilize
updates and better reflect compositional reasoning quality, challenges such as
advantage saturation and reward signal collapse remain. We propose heuristic
and statistical solutions to mitigate these issues and discuss open challenges
for learning under staged or tree-like reward structures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tournaments model pairwise dominance relationships, and there's a need for formal explainable AI approaches to provide certified explanations for why certain candidates win under different tournament rules.

Method: The authors identify minimal supports (minimal sub-tournaments) where a candidate is a necessary winner, and develop polynomial-time algorithms to compute these for various tournament solutions including top cycle, uncovered set, Copeland, Borda, maximin rules.

Result: They determine the size of smallest minimal supports for each rule and present efficient algorithms for all rules except the weighted uncovered set, for which the problem is NP-complete.

Conclusion: Minimal supports provide compact, certified, and intuitive explanations for tournament winners, offering a formal explainable AI framework for understanding dominance relationships in tournament settings.

Abstract: Tournaments are widely used models to represent pairwise dominance between
candidates, alternatives, or teams. We study the problem of providing certified
explanations for why a candidate appears among the winners under various
tournament rules. To this end, we identify minimal supports, minimal
sub-tournaments in which the candidate is guaranteed to win regardless of how
the rest of the tournament is completed (that is, the candidate is a necessary
winner of the sub-tournament). This notion corresponds to an abductive
explanation for the question,"Why does the winner win the tournament", a
central concept in formal explainable AI. We focus on common tournament
solutions: the top cycle, the uncovered set, the Copeland rule, the Borda rule,
the maximin rule, and the weighted uncovered set. For each rule we determine
the size of the smallest minimal supports, and we present polynomial-time
algorithms to compute them for all but the weighted uncovered set, for which
the problem is NP-complete. Finally, we show how minimal supports can serve to
produce compact, certified, and intuitive explanations.

TL;DR: Study examines how spatial coordination dimensions (exploration diversity, movement specialization, adaptive proximity) affect team performance in search/rescue tasks with restricted communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Teams in emergency response, military, and law enforcement must coordinate physical movements without visual cues or extensive communication, but existing research focuses mainly on co-located or knowledge work coordination.

Method: Analyzed data from 34 four-person teams (136 participants) performing specialized roles in collaborative online search/rescue task with restricted explicit communication, measuring spatial proximity, distribution patterns, and movement alignment.

Result: Spatial specialization positively predicts performance; adaptive spatial proximity shows marginal inverted U-shaped relationship (moderate adaptation optimal); temporal dynamics differentiate high/low-performing teams over time.

Conclusion: Findings provide insights into implicit spatial coordination in role-based teamwork, highlighting importance of balanced adaptive strategies for training and AI-assisted team support systems.

Abstract: Coordinated teamwork is essential in fast-paced decision-making environments
that require dynamic adaptation, often without an opportunity for explicit
communication. Although implicit coordination has been extensively considered
in the existing literature, the majority of work has focused on co-located,
synchronous teamwork (such as sports teams) or, in distributed teams, primarily
on coordination of knowledge work. However, many teams (firefighters, military,
law enforcement, emergency response) must coordinate their movements in
physical space without the benefit of visual cues or extensive explicit
communication. This paper investigates how three dimensions of spatial
coordination, namely exploration diversity, movement specialization, and
adaptive spatial proximity, influence team performance in a collaborative
online search and rescue task where explicit communication is restricted and
team members rely on movement patterns to infer others' intentions and
coordinate actions. Our metrics capture the relational aspects of teamwork by
measuring spatial proximity, distribution patterns, and alignment of movements
within shared environments. We analyze data from 34 four-person teams (136
participants) assigned to specialized roles in a search and rescue task.
Results show that spatial specialization positively predicts performance, while
adaptive spatial proximity exhibits a marginal inverted U-shaped relationship,
suggesting moderate levels of adaptation are optimal. Furthermore, the temporal
dynamics of these metrics differentiate high- from low-performing teams over
time. These findings provide insights into implicit spatial coordination in
role-based teamwork and highlight the importance of balanced adaptive
strategies, with implications for training and AI-assisted team support
systems.

TL;DR: TAM Bench is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLM-based agents on end-to-end machine learning workflows, featuring automated task collection from multiple platforms, difficulty modeling, and multi-dimensional evaluation across 150 curated AutoML tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLM-based ML agents are limited in task coverage, domain diversity, difficulty modeling, and evaluation rigor, failing to capture their full capabilities in realistic settings.

Method: The benchmark uses: (1) browser automation and LLM-based task acquisition from platforms like Kaggle, AIcrowd, and Biendata; (2) leaderboard-driven difficulty modeling using participant counts and score dispersion; (3) multi-dimensional evaluation framework assessing performance, format compliance, constraint adherence, and task generalization.

Result: The authors constructed three benchmark subsets (Lite, Medium, Full) based on 150 curated AutoML tasks, with the Lite version (18 tasks) providing balanced coverage across modalities and difficulty levels for practical daily benchmarking.

Conclusion: TAM Bench provides a diverse, realistic, and structured evaluation framework that addresses the limitations of existing benchmarks and enables comprehensive assessment of LLM-based agents in end-to-end ML workflows.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the emergence of
general-purpose agents for automating end-to-end machine learning (ML)
workflows, including data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and
competition solving. However, existing benchmarks remain limited in task
coverage, domain diversity, difficulty modeling, and evaluation rigor, failing
to capture the full capabilities of such agents in realistic settings. We
present TAM Bench, a diverse, realistic, and structured benchmark for
evaluating LLM-based agents on end-to-end ML tasks. TAM Bench features three
key innovations: (1) A browser automation and LLM-based task acquisition system
that automatically collects and structures ML challenges from platforms such as
Kaggle, AIcrowd, and Biendata, spanning multiple task types and data modalities
(e.g., tabular, text, image, graph, audio); (2) A leaderboard-driven difficulty
modeling mechanism that estimates task complexity using participant counts and
score dispersion, enabling scalable and objective task calibration; (3) A
multi-dimensional evaluation framework incorporating performance, format
compliance, constraint adherence, and task generalization. Based on 150 curated
AutoML tasks, we construct three benchmark subsets of different sizes -- Lite,
Medium, and Full -- designed for varying evaluation scenarios. The Lite
version, with 18 tasks and balanced coverage across modalities and difficulty
levels, serves as a practical testbed for daily benchmarking and comparative
studies.

*Abdel Hakim Drid,Vincenzo Suriani,Daniele Nardi,Abderrezzak Debilou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Novel DRL architecture with VLM integration for resource-efficient semantic exploration, using strategic VLM queries and curriculum learning to enhance object discovery and navigation to semantically rich areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL approaches struggle with balancing efficient exploration and semantic understanding due to limited cognitive capabilities in small policies, requiring human intervention for semantic exploration tasks.

Method: Integration of Vision-Language Model (VLM) common-sense through layered reward function, modeling VLM query as dedicated action for strategic external guidance, combined with curriculum learning for robust training at different complexity levels.

Result: Significantly enhanced object discovery rates, learned capability to navigate towards semantically rich regions, and strategic mastery of when to prompt for external environmental information.

Conclusion: Provides a practical and scalable method for embedding common-sense semantic reasoning in autonomous agents, enabling fully intelligent and self-guided exploration in robotics.

Abstract: Navigating and understanding complex and unknown environments autonomously
demands more than just basic perception and movement from embodied agents.
Truly effective exploration requires agents to possess higher-level cognitive
abilities, the ability to reason about their surroundings, and make more
informed decisions regarding exploration strategies. However, traditional RL
approaches struggle to balance efficient exploration and semantic understanding
due to limited cognitive capabilities embedded in the small policies for the
agents, leading often to human drivers when dealing with semantic exploration.
In this paper, we address this challenge by presenting a novel Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) architecture that is specifically designed for
resource efficient semantic exploration. A key methodological contribution is
the integration of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) common-sense through a layered
reward function. The VLM query is modeled as a dedicated action, allowing the
agent to strategically query the VLM only when deemed necessary for gaining
external guidance, thereby conserving resources. This mechanism is combined
with a curriculum learning strategy designed to guide learning at different
levels of complexity to ensure robust and stable learning. Our experimental
evaluation results convincingly demonstrate that our agent achieves
significantly enhanced object discovery rates and develops a learned capability
to effectively navigate towards semantically rich regions. Furthermore, it also
shows a strategic mastery of when to prompt for external environmental
information. By demonstrating a practical and scalable method for embedding
common-sense semantic reasoning with autonomous agents, this research provides
a novel approach to pursuing a fully intelligent and self-guided exploration in
robotics.

TL;DR: TORSO is a template-oriented reasoning approach that enables LLMs to generate proper responses across various tasks without relying on manually crafted few-shot examples, achieving strong performance on diverse benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing few-shot prompting approaches heavily depend on provided examples, limiting the utilization of models' inherent reasoning capabilities and requiring costly task-specific prompt construction that may lead to inconsistencies across different tasks.

Method: Template-Oriented Reasoning (TORSO) elicits models to utilize their internal reasoning abilities to generate proper responses without needing manually crafted few-shot examples.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that TORSO achieves strong performance on diverse LLM benchmarks with reasonable rationales.

Conclusion: TORSO provides an effective alternative to few-shot prompting that leverages models' internal reasoning capabilities while eliminating the need for costly manual example construction and ensuring consistency across tasks.

Abstract: The approaches that guide Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate human
reasoning during response generation have emerged as an effective method for
enabling them to solve complex problems in a step-by-step manner, thereby
achieving superior performance. However, most existing approaches using
few-shot prompts to generate responses heavily depend on the provided examples,
limiting the utilization of the model's inherent reasoning capabilities.
Moreover, constructing task-specific few-shot prompts is often costly and may
lead to inconsistencies across different tasks. In this work, we introduce
Template-Oriented Reasoning (TORSO), which elicits the model to utilize
internal reasoning abilities to generate proper responses across various tasks
without the need for manually crafted few-shot examples. Our experimental
results demonstrate that TORSO achieves strong performance on diverse LLMs
benchmarks with reasonable rationales.

Motivation: Address the critical problem of false information (hallucinations) in legal LLMs and evaluate mitigation strategies.

Method: Technical analysis of hallucination causes, manifestations, and effectiveness of RAG mitigation strategy with proposed holistic optimizations.

*Haoran Xu,Jiacong Hu,Ke Zhang,Lei Yu,Yuxin Tang,Xinyuan Song,Yiqun Duan,Lynn Ai,Bill Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SEDM is a self-evolving distributed memory framework that transforms memory from passive storage to an active, self-optimizing component for multi-agent systems, improving reasoning accuracy while reducing computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory management methods for multi-agent systems suffer from noise accumulation, uncontrolled memory expansion, and limited cross-domain generalization, making efficient memory management essential for performance and scalability.

Method: SEDM integrates verifiable write admission based on reproducible replay, a self-scheduling memory controller that dynamically ranks and consolidates entries by utility, and cross-domain knowledge diffusion that abstracts reusable insights for transfer across heterogeneous tasks.

Result: Evaluations show SEDM improves reasoning accuracy while reducing token overhead compared to strong memory baselines, and enables knowledge distilled from fact verification to enhance multi-hop reasoning.

Conclusion: SEDM represents a scalable and sustainable memory mechanism for open-ended multi-agent collaboration, transforming memory into an active, self-optimizing component rather than a passive repository.

Abstract: Long-term multi-agent systems inevitably generate vast amounts of
trajectories and historical interactions, which makes efficient memory
management essential for both performance and scalability. Existing methods
typically depend on vector retrieval and hierarchical storage, yet they are
prone to noise accumulation, uncontrolled memory expansion, and limited
generalization across domains. To address these challenges, we present SEDM,
Self-Evolving Distributed Memory, a verifiable and adaptive framework that
transforms memory from a passive repository into an active, self-optimizing
component. SEDM integrates verifiable write admission based on reproducible
replay, a self-scheduling memory controller that dynamically ranks and
consolidates entries according to empirical utility, and cross-domain knowledge
diffusion that abstracts reusable insights to support transfer across
heterogeneous tasks. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEDM
improves reasoning accuracy while reducing token overhead compared with strong
memory baselines, and further enables knowledge distilled from fact
verification to enhance multi-hop reasoning. The results highlight SEDM as a
scalable and sustainable memory mechanism for open-ended multi-agent
collaboration. The code will be released in the later stage of this project.

*Hala Hawashin,Mina Abbaszadeh,Nicholas Joseph,Beth Pearson,Martha Lewis,Mehrnoosh sadrzadeh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Quantum models show promise for compositional generalization in vision-language tasks, outperforming classical tensor-based approaches in image captioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of compositional generalization in current AI tools like vision-language models, building on previous negative results from classical tensor-based semantics approaches.

Method: Interpreted compositional tensor-based models in Hilbert spaces and trained Variational Quantum Circuits on image captioning tasks. Used two encoding techniques: multi-hot encoding on binary image vectors and angle/amplitude encoding on CLIP image vectors.

Result: Achieved good proof-of-concept results with noisy multi-hot encodings. Performance on CLIP image vectors was mixed but still outperformed classical compositional models.

Conclusion: Quantum models demonstrate improved training efficiency and better performance for compositional generalization tasks compared to classical approaches, showing potential for quantum-enhanced AI systems.

Abstract: Compositional generalization is a key facet of human cognition, but lacking
in current AI tools such as vision-language models. Previous work examined
whether a compositional tensor-based sentence semantics can overcome the
challenge, but led to negative results. We conjecture that the increased
training efficiency of quantum models will improve performance in these tasks.
We interpret the representations of compositional tensor-based models in
Hilbert spaces and train Variational Quantum Circuits to learn these
representations on an image captioning task requiring compositional
generalization. We used two image encoding techniques: a multi-hot encoding
(MHE) on binary image vectors and an angle/amplitude encoding on image vectors
taken from the vision-language model CLIP. We achieve good proof-of-concept
results using noisy MHE encodings. Performance on CLIP image vectors was more
mixed, but still outperformed classical compositional models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Auras is an algorithm-system co-designed framework that improves embodied AI inference frequency by disaggregating perception/generation modules with pipeline parallelism, achieving 2.54x throughput increase while maintaining original accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sequential computation patterns in embodied AI systems face limitations in achieving the necessary thinking frequency for real-world applications due to high-frequency input/output demands.

Method: Auras disaggregates perception and generation modules, provides controlled pipeline parallelism, and establishes a public context for both modules to share to address data staleness issues from increased parallelism.

Result: Experimental results show Auras improves throughput by 2.54x on average while achieving 102.7% of the original accuracy.

Conclusion: Auras effectively overcomes the constraints of sequential computation in embodied AI systems, providing high and stable throughput while maintaining accuracy through its co-designed algorithm-system approach.

Abstract: Embodied AI systems operate in dynamic environments, requiring seamless
integration of perception and generation modules to process high-frequency
input and output demands. Traditional sequential computation patterns, while
effective in ensuring accuracy, face significant limitations in achieving the
necessary "thinking" frequency for real-world applications. In this work, we
present Auras, an algorithm-system co-designed inference framework to optimize
the inference frequency of embodied AI agents. Auras disaggregates the
perception and generation and provides controlled pipeline parallelism for them
to achieve high and stable throughput. Faced with the data staleness problem
that appears when the parallelism is increased, Auras establishes a public
context for perception and generation to share, thereby promising the accuracy
of embodied agents. Experimental results show that Auras improves throughput by
2.54x on average while achieving 102.7% of the original accuracy, demonstrating
its efficacy in overcoming the constraints of sequential computation and
providing high throughput.

### [103] [The Illusion of Diminishing Returns: Measuring Long Horizon Execution in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09677)
*Akshit Sinha,Arvindh Arun,Shashwat Goel,Steffen Staab,Jonas Geiping*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Scaling LLMs provides exponential benefits for long-horizon tasks despite diminishing single-step accuracy returns. Larger models execute significantly more steps correctly, but suffer from self-conditioning errors where prior mistakes compound. Thinking models avoid this issue and handle longer tasks better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why LLMs fail at simple tasks when made longer, despite excelling at complex reasoning. The work aims to reconcile this paradox by examining execution capability rather than reasoning limitations.

Method: Isolate execution capability by providing explicit knowledge and plans for long-horizon tasks. Compare model performance across different sizes, analyze per-step accuracy degradation, and examine self-conditioning effects where models become more error-prone when context contains prior mistakes.

Result: Larger models correctly execute significantly more turns even when small models have 100% single-turn accuracy. Per-step accuracy degrades with more steps due to self-conditioning (models make more errors when context contains prior mistakes), which doesn't improve with scaling. Thinking models avoid self-conditioning and execute much longer tasks.

Conclusion: Focusing on execution capability reveals massive benefits of scaling model size and sequential test-time compute for long-horizon tasks. Self-conditioning is a key limitation that thinking models overcome, highlighting the importance of execution-focused approaches for complex task completion.

Abstract: Does continued scaling of large language models (LLMs) yield diminishing
returns? Real-world value often stems from the length of task an agent can
complete. We start this work by observing the simple but counterintuitive fact
that marginal gains in single-step accuracy can compound into exponential
improvements in the length of a task a model can successfully complete. Then,
we argue that failures of LLMs when simple tasks are made longer arise from
mistakes in execution, rather than an inability to reason. We propose isolating
execution capability, by explicitly providing the knowledge and plan needed to
solve a long-horizon task. We find that larger models can correctly execute
significantly more turns even when small models have 100\% single-turn
accuracy. We observe that the per-step accuracy of models degrades as the
number of steps increases. This is not just due to long-context limitations --
curiously, we observe a self-conditioning effect -- models become more likely
to make mistakes when the context contains their errors from prior turns.
Self-conditioning does not reduce by just scaling the model size. In contrast,
recent thinking models do not self-condition, and can also execute much longer
tasks in a single turn. We conclude by benchmarking frontier thinking models on
the length of task they can execute in a single turn. Overall, by focusing on
the ability to execute, we hope to reconcile debates on how LLMs can solve
complex reasoning problems yet fail at simple tasks when made longer, and
highlight the massive benefits of scaling model size and sequential test-time
compute for long-horizon tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Analysis of triple completion task in constrained LLM settings, focusing on generation quality, filtering, and response parsing tradeoffs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of RAG and fine-tuning in constrained environments like the 2025 LM-KBC challenge, where these common techniques are restricted.

Method: Investigated three aspects: generation techniques, quality assurance through LLM-based filtering, and response parsing approaches in constrained settings.

Result: Found that additional information improves generation quality, LLMs can effectively filter poor quality triples, and response parsing involves a tradeoff between flexibility and consistency that depends on the specific setting.

Conclusion: In constrained LLM environments, strategic use of information augmentation, LLM-based filtering, and context-aware response parsing can effectively compensate for the limitations of restricted RAG and fine-tuning approaches.

Abstract: RAG and fine-tuning are prevalent strategies for improving the quality of LLM
outputs. However, in constrained situations, such as that of the 2025 LM-KBC
challenge, such techniques are restricted. In this work we investigate three
facets of the triple completion task: generation, quality assurance, and LLM
response parsing. Our work finds that in this constrained setting: additional
information improves generation quality, LLMs can be effective at filtering
poor quality triples, and the tradeoff between flexibility and consistency with
LLM response parsing is setting dependent.

*Imene Kolli,Ario Saeid Vaghefi,Chiara Colesanti Senni,Shantam Raj,Markus Leippold*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AI-assisted framework using RAG to automate evidence extraction from corporate climate policy documents, showing best performance with layout-aware parsing and few-shot prompting, but still requires human oversight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual assessment of corporate climate policy engagement is time-consuming and error-prone, needing automation to scale monitoring of 500+ companies and 250+ industry associations.

Method: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with layout-aware parsing, Nomic embedding model, and few-shot prompting strategies for multilingual document analysis.

Result: The automated RAG system effectively accelerates evidence extraction and classification from large-scale textual data with optimal performance from the proposed combination.

Conclusion: While RAG accelerates evidence extraction, the nuanced analysis requires human-in-the-loop approach where AI augments rather replaces expert judgment for accuracy.

Abstract: InfluenceMap's LobbyMap Platform monitors the climate policy engagement of
over 500 companies and 250 industry associations, assessing each entity's
support or opposition to science-based policy pathways for achieving the Paris
Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5{\deg}C. Although
InfluenceMap has made progress with automating key elements of the analytical
workflow, a significant portion of the assessment remains manual, making it
time- and labor-intensive and susceptible to human error. We propose an
AI-assisted framework to accelerate the monitoring of corporate climate policy
engagement by leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation to automate the most
time-intensive extraction of relevant evidence from large-scale textual data.
Our evaluation shows that a combination of layout-aware parsing, the Nomic
embedding model, and few-shot prompting strategies yields the best performance
in extracting and classifying evidence from multilingual corporate documents.
We conclude that while the automated RAG system effectively accelerates
evidence extraction, the nuanced nature of the analysis necessitates a
human-in-the-loop approach where the technology augments, rather than replaces,
expert judgment to ensure accuracy.

TL;DR: Novel psychometric method using LLMs to analyze textual data by treating documents as individuals and words as items, enabling factor analysis to uncover latent dimensions in text corpora.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a psychometric approach for textual data analysis that can uncover latent knowledge dimensions and patterns, particularly useful for fields rich in textual information like education, psychology, and law.

Method: Two-stage process: 1) Use NLP and transformer models to identify keywords and generate contextual scores, 2) Apply factor analysis (exploratory and bifactor models) to extract latent factors, determine correlations, and identify significant word associations.

Result: Successfully applied to Wiki STEM corpus, demonstrating the method's ability to uncover latent knowledge dimensions and patterns within textual data.

Conclusion: This approach enhances psychometric analysis of textual data and shows promise for applications across various text-rich domains by providing a natural psychometric interpretation framework.

Abstract: This research introduces a novel psychometric method for analyzing textual
data using large language models. By leveraging contextual embeddings to create
contextual scores, we transform textual data into response data suitable for
psychometric analysis. Treating documents as individuals and words as items,
this approach provides a natural psychometric interpretation under the
assumption that certain keywords, whose contextual meanings vary significantly
across documents, can effectively differentiate documents within a corpus. The
modeling process comprises two stages: obtaining contextual scores and
performing psychometric analysis. In the first stage, we utilize natural
language processing techniques and encoder based transformer models to identify
common keywords and generate contextual scores. In the second stage, we employ
various types of factor analysis, including exploratory and bifactor models, to
extract and define latent factors, determine factor correlations, and identify
the most significant words associated with each factor. Applied to the Wiki
STEM corpus, our experimental results demonstrate the method's potential to
uncover latent knowledge dimensions and patterns within textual data. This
approach not only enhances the psychometric analysis of textual data but also
holds promise for applications in fields rich in textual information, such as
education, psychology, and law.

TL;DR: BRoverbs is a new benchmark dataset using Brazilian proverbs to evaluate Portuguese-language LLMs, addressing limitations of existing translated datasets and providing culturally relevant assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations for Portuguese LLMs are limited, relying on translated datasets that miss linguistic nuances and cultural references, or focus narrowly on exams and sentiment analysis, leaving gaps in broader linguistic understanding.

Method: Created BRoverbs dataset specifically designed with Brazilian proverbs that encapsulate cultural wisdom, figurative expressions, and complex syntactic structures to challenge LLM comprehension of regional expressions.

Result: A new evaluation tool for Portuguese-language LLMs that provides regionally informed benchmarking through culturally rich proverbs rather than translated content.

Conclusion: BRoverbs addresses the need for mature evaluation frameworks that assess LLM capabilities in specific regional contexts, contributing to better assessment of Portuguese-language models through culturally relevant linguistic challenges.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant performance variations
depending on the linguistic and cultural context in which they are applied.
This disparity signals the necessity of mature evaluation frameworks that can
assess their capabilities in specific regional settings. In the case of
Portuguese, existing evaluations remain limited, often relying on translated
datasets that may not fully capture linguistic nuances or cultural references.
Meanwhile, native Portuguese-language datasets predominantly focus on
structured national exams or sentiment analysis of social media interactions,
leaving gaps in evaluating broader linguistic understanding. To address this
limitation, we introduce BRoverbs, a dataset specifically designed to assess
LLM performance through Brazilian proverbs. Proverbs serve as a rich linguistic
resource, encapsulating cultural wisdom, figurative expressions, and complex
syntactic structures that challenge the model comprehension of regional
expressions. BRoverbs aims to provide a new evaluation tool for
Portuguese-language LLMs, contributing to advancing regionally informed
benchmarking. The benchmark is available at

*Monjoy Narayan Choudhury,Junling Wang,Yifan Hou,Mrinmaya Sachan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VLMs struggle with visual equation solving due to counting bottlenecks and multi-step reasoning challenges, despite strong performance on textual equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why Vision-Language Models (VLMs) perform poorly on tasks requiring integrated perception and symbolic computation, specifically visual equation solving where equations are embedded in images with object icons as variables.

Method: Decomposed visual equation solving into coefficient counting and variable recognition components, analyzed performance on both textual and visually grounded equations, and examined how task complexity affects reasoning capabilities.

Result: VLMs fail on visually grounded equations despite good performance on textual versions. Counting is the primary bottleneck, and composing recognition with reasoning introduces additional errors. Symbolic reasoning itself becomes limiting as equation complexity increases.

Conclusion: Current VLMs have key weaknesses in visually grounded mathematical reasoning, particularly in counting and multi-step reasoning integration, pointing to areas needing future improvement.

Abstract: Despite strong performance in visual understanding and language-based
reasoning, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with tasks requiring
integrated perception and symbolic computation. We study this limitation
through visual equation solving, where mathematical equations are embedded in
images, variables are represented by object icons, and coefficients must be
inferred by counting. While VLMs perform well on textual equations, they fail
on visually grounded counterparts. To understand this gap, we decompose the
task into coefficient counting and variable recognition, and find that counting
is the primary bottleneck, even when recognition is accurate. We also observe
that composing recognition and reasoning introduces additional errors,
highlighting challenges in multi-step visual reasoning. Finally, as equation
complexity increases, symbolic reasoning itself becomes a limiting factor.
These findings reveal key weaknesses in current VLMs and point toward future
improvements in visually grounded mathematical reasoning.

*Thomas Manuel Rost,Martina Figlia,Bernd Wallraff*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPICE is a simple diagnostic signal that measures LLM willingness to continue interactions based on user tone, showing strong discrimination between friendly (97.5% continue), unclear (60.4%), and abusive (17.9%) interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a low-overhead, reproducible tool for auditing model dispositions and understanding how LLMs respond to different user interaction tones, complementing existing metrics with a direct relational signal.

Method: Tested 4 open-weight chat models using a 3-tone (friendly, unclear, abusive) by 10-interaction stimulus set across 4 framing conditions (480 trials total), asking YES/NO questions about willingness to re-engage after reviewing transcripts.

Result: SPICE sharply discriminates by user tone with near-unanimous preference to continue friendly interactions (97.5% YES) and strong preference to discontinue abusive interactions (17.9% YES). Provides distinct signal from abuse classification - even when models fail to identify abuse, they still prefer not to continue 81% of the time.

Conclusion: SPICE is validated as a robust, low-overhead tool for auditing model dispositions, offering a direct relational signal that complements existing metrics. Study context preamble impacts SPICE under ambiguity when transcripts are presented as single text blocks.

Abstract: We introduce and evaluate Stated Preference for Interaction and Continued
Engagement (SPICE), a simple diagnostic signal elicited by asking a Large
Language Model a YES or NO question about its willingness to re-engage with a
user's behavior after reviewing a short transcript. In a study using a 3-tone
(friendly, unclear, abusive) by 10-interaction stimulus set, we tested four
open-weight chat models across four framing conditions, resulting in 480
trials. Our findings show that SPICE sharply discriminates by user tone.
Friendly interactions yielded a near-unanimous preference to continue (97.5%
YES), while abusive interactions yielded a strong preference to discontinue
(17.9% YES), with unclear interactions falling in between (60.4% YES). This
core association remains decisive under multiple dependence-aware statistical
tests, including Rao-Scott adjustment and cluster permutation tests.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that SPICE provides a distinct signal from abuse
classification. In trials where a model failed to identify abuse, it still
overwhelmingly stated a preference not to continue the interaction (81% of the
time). An exploratory analysis also reveals a significant interaction effect: a
preamble describing the study context significantly impacts SPICE under
ambiguity, but only when transcripts are presented as a single block of text
rather than a multi-turn chat. The results validate SPICE as a robust,
low-overhead, and reproducible tool for auditing model dispositions,
complementing existing metrics by offering a direct, relational signal of a
model's state. All stimuli, code, and analysis scripts are released to support
replication.

TL;DR: SFT+DPO combination outperforms individual SFT or DPO methods for aligning OPT-350M model, achieving best results across harmlessness, helpfulness, and combined alignment metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate and compare the effectiveness of different alignment techniques (SFT, DPO, and their combination) for improving language model safety and helpfulness.

Method: Trained and evaluated four OPT-350M models: base model, SFT-only, DPO-only, and combined SFT+DPO using Anthropic Helpful-Harmless RLHF dataset with three evaluation metrics (HmR, HpR, CAS).

Result: SFT outperformed DPO individually, but the combined SFT+DPO model achieved the best performance across all metrics (harmlessness rate, helpfulness rate, and combined alignment score).

Conclusion: SFT and DPO techniques are complementary, with their combination providing superior alignment results, though challenges remain with noisy data and resource constraints.

Abstract: This research investigates the effectiveness of alignment techniques,

we train and evaluate four models: the base OPT350M, an SFT model, a DPO model,
and a model trained with both SFT and DPO. We introduce three key evaluation
metrics: Harmlessness Rate (HmR), Helpfulness Rate (HpR), and a Combined
Alignment Score (CAS), all derived from reward model outputs. The results show
that while SFT outperforms DPO, The combined SFT+DPO model outperforms all
others across all metrics, demonstrating the complementary nature of these
techniques. Our findings also highlight challenges posed by noisy data, limited
GPU resources, and training constraints. This study offers a comprehensive view
of how fine-tuning strategies affect model alignment and provides a foundation
for more robust alignment pipelines in future work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes MR-UIE, a reinforcement learning approach with multi-perspective reasoning to enhance LLMs' performance in universal information extraction, transforming them from passive extractors to active reasoners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show strong capabilities but underperform in universal information extraction, especially with structured outputs requiring complex schema understanding and multi-step reasoning.

Method: Integrates reinforcement learning with multi-perspective reasoning to enable LLMs to understand both what to extract and how to reason through complex IE tasks.

Result: MR-UIE consistently improves extraction accuracy across domains and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple IE benchmarks.

Conclusion: Multi-perspective reasoning combined with RL significantly enhances generalization in complex IE tasks, highlighting the critical importance of reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate robust capabilities across diverse
research domains. However, their performance in universal information
extraction (UIE) remains insufficient, especially when tackling structured
output scenarios that involve complex schema descriptions and require
multi-step reasoning. While existing approaches enhance the performance of LLMs
through in-context learning and instruction tuning, significant limitations
nonetheless persist. To enhance the model's generalization ability, we propose
integrating reinforcement learning (RL) with multi-perspective reasoning for
information extraction (IE) tasks. Our work transitions LLMs from passive
extractors to active reasoners, enabling them to understand not only what to
extract but also how to reason. Experiments conducted on multiple IE benchmarks
demonstrate that MR-UIE consistently elevates extraction accuracy across
domains and surpasses state-of-the-art methods on several datasets.
Furthermore, incorporating multi-perspective reasoning into RL notably enhances
generalization in complex IE tasks, underscoring the critical role of reasoning
in challenging scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bangla is the 5th most spoken language but severely underrepresented in code generation LLMs due to scarcity of high-quality training data.

Method: Created comprehensive Bangla code instruction datasets, developed MBPP-Bangla evaluation benchmark, and built TigerCoder-family Code LLMs with programming domain adaptation.

Result: Achieved significant ~11-18% performance gains at Pass@1 over existing multilingual and general-purpose Bangla LLMs.

Conclusion: Curated high-quality datasets can overcome limitations of smaller models for low-resource languages; all resources open-sourced to advance Bangla LLM research.

Abstract: Despite being the 5th most spoken language, Bangla remains underrepresented
in Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for code generation. This
primarily stems from the scarcity of high-quality data to pre-train and/or
finetune such models. Hence, we introduce the first dedicated family of Code
LLMs for Bangla (1B & 9B). We offer three major contributions: (1) a
comprehensive Bangla code instruction datasets for programming domain
adaptation; (2) MBPP-Bangla, an evaluation benchmark for Bangla code
generation; and (3) the TigerCoder-family of Code LLMs, achieving significant
~11-18% performance gains at Pass@1 over existing multilingual and
general-purpose Bangla LLMs. Our findings show that curated, high-quality
datasets can overcome limitations of smaller models for low-resource languages.
We open-source all resources to advance further Bangla LLM research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Compass-v3 is a 245B parameter Mixture-of-Experts model specialized for Southeast Asian e-commerce, featuring hardware optimizations, multilingual training on 12T tokens, and a novel OTPO alignment method that achieves state-of-the-art performance in e-commerce tasks while maintaining strong multilingual capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models underperform in specialized domains like e-commerce due to noisy, heterogeneous, multilingual, and dynamic data characteristics, particularly challenging in Southeast Asian markets.

Method: Developed a vertical-domain MoE model with 245B total parameters (71B active per token) using fewer but larger experts, hardware-efficient optimizations (intra-node expert parallelism, custom memcpy), trained on 12T tokens of curated multilingual corpora and synthetic e-commerce instructions with mixed-training strategy, plus Optimal-Transport Direct Preference Optimization (OTPO) for better alignment.

Result: State-of-the-art e-commerce performance surpassing DeepSeek-V3.1, GPT-4 series, and Qwen3-235B; strong multilingual capability across low-resource Southeast Asian languages (Indonesian, Thai, Filipino, Vietnamese, Malay, Tagalog) and Portuguese; deployed at industrial scale in Shopee, replacing over 70% of OpenAI's traffic.

Conclusion: Compass-v3 demonstrates successful specialization for e-commerce while maintaining broad linguistic competence, proving effective for real-world industrial applications in multilingual Southeast Asian markets.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in general-domain applications, yet their
performance often degrades in specialized tasks requiring domain-specific
knowledge. E-commerce is particularly challenging, as its data are noisy,
heterogeneous, multilingual, and highly dynamic. We present Compass-v3, a
vertical-domain Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model with 245B total parameters and
71B active per token, designed for Southeast Asian e-commerce. Compass-v3
adopts fewer but larger experts, combined with hardware-efficient
optimizations-such as intra-node expert parallelism and a customized memcpy
operator-to maximize GPU utilization. The model is trained on 12T tokens of
curated multilingual corpora and large-scale synthetic e-commerce instructions
using a mixed-training strategy. To enhance alignment, we propose
Optimal-Transport Direct Preference Optimization (OTPO), which captures
token-level distinctions and improves instruction adherence in
commerce-specific scenarios. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Compass-v3
delivers state-of-the-art e-commerce performance, surpassing DeepSeek-V3.1,
GPT-4 series, and Qwen3-235B. Moreover, Compass-v3 demonstrates strong
multilingual capability across low-resource Southeast Asian languages
(Indonesian, Thai, Filipino, Vietnamese, Malay, Taglog) and Portuguese while
sustaining competitive performance on general benchmarks. It has already been
widely applied in Shopee's industrial-scale e-commerce platform and is
gradually replacing OpenAI's traffic, now accounting for over 70\% of total LLM
usage, highlighting its dual strengths in specialized commerce expertise and
broad linguistic competence.

*Taha Binhuraib,Ruimin Gao,Anna A. Ivanova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LITcoder is an open-source library for building and benchmarking neural encoding models that standardizes the pipeline from stimulus alignment to brain data mapping and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To lower technical barriers for implementing neural encoding models, facilitate systematic comparisons across models and datasets, foster methodological rigor, and accelerate development of high-performance predictive models of brain activity.

Method: Provides a modular pipeline with standardized tools for aligning continuous stimuli with brain data, transforming stimuli into representational features, mapping features to brain data, and evaluating predictive performance. Includes various methodological choices like brain datasets, regions, stimulus features, downsampling approaches, and integrates with experiment tracking platforms.

Result: Demonstrated scalability and versatility by fitting encoding models to three story listening datasets. Identified critical methodological choices including accounting for all tokens in TR scans, incorporating hemodynamic lag effects, using proper train-test splits, and accounting for head motion effects.

Conclusion: LITcoder successfully provides a flexible framework that enables researchers to easily compose, compare, and extend encoding models without reinventing core infrastructure, thereby advancing the field of neural encoding modeling.

Abstract: We introduce LITcoder, an open-source library for building and benchmarking
neural encoding models. Designed as a flexible backend, LITcoder provides
standardized tools for aligning continuous stimuli (e.g., text and speech) with
brain data, transforming stimuli into representational features, mapping those
features onto brain data, and evaluating the predictive performance of the
resulting model on held-out data. The library implements a modular pipeline
covering a wide array of methodological design choices, so researchers can
easily compose, compare, and extend encoding models without reinventing core
infrastructure. Such choices include brain datasets, brain regions, stimulus
feature (both neural-net-based and control, such as word rate), downsampling
approaches, and many others. In addition, the library provides built-in
logging, plotting, and seamless integration with experiment tracking platforms
such as Weights & Biases (W&B). We demonstrate the scalability and versatility
of our framework by fitting a range of encoding models to three story listening
datasets: LeBel et al. (2023), Narratives, and Little Prince. We also explore
the methodological choices critical for building encoding models for continuous
fMRI data, illustrating the importance of accounting for all tokens in a TR
scan (as opposed to just taking the last one, even when contextualized),
incorporating hemodynamic lag effects, using train-test splits that minimize
information leakage, and accounting for head motion effects on encoding model
predictivity. Overall, LITcoder lowers technical barriers to encoding model
implementation, facilitates systematic comparisons across models and datasets,
fosters methodological rigor, and accelerates the development of high-quality
high-performance predictive models of brain activity.

### [117] [Target-oriented Multimodal Sentiment Classification with Counterfactual-enhanced Debiasing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09160)
*Zhiyue Liu,Fanrong Ma,Xin Ling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A counterfactual-enhanced debiasing framework for target-oriented multimodal sentiment classification that reduces spurious correlations between text features and output labels by using counterfactual data augmentation and adaptive debiasing contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods over-rely on textual content and fail to consider dataset biases, particularly word-level contextual biases, leading to spurious correlations that impair classification accuracy.

Method: Proposes a counterfactual data augmentation strategy that minimally alters sentiment-related causal features to generate detail-matched image-text samples, combined with an adaptive debiasing contrastive learning mechanism to learn robust features and mitigate biased word influence.

Result: Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The counterfactual-enhanced debiasing framework effectively reduces spurious correlations and improves target-oriented multimodal sentiment classification performance.

Abstract: Target-oriented multimodal sentiment classification seeks to predict
sentiment polarity for specific targets from image-text pairs. While existing
works achieve competitive performance, they often over-rely on textual content
and fail to consider dataset biases, in particular word-level contextual
biases. This leads to spurious correlations between text features and output
labels, impairing classification accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a novel
counterfactual-enhanced debiasing framework to reduce such spurious
correlations. Our framework incorporates a counterfactual data augmentation
strategy that minimally alters sentiment-related causal features, generating
detail-matched image-text samples to guide the model's attention toward content
tied to sentiment. Furthermore, for learning robust features from
counterfactual data and prompting model decisions, we introduce an adaptive
debiasing contrastive learning mechanism, which effectively mitigates the
influence of biased words. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets
show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: EchoX is a speech-to-speech LLM that bridges the acoustic-semantic gap using semantic representations and dynamic speech target generation, preserving reasoning capabilities while achieving strong performance on knowledge QA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SLLMs derived from text LLMs show degradation in knowledge and reasoning due to failure to bridge the acoustic-semantic gap in feature representation space.

Method: Proposes EchoX which leverages semantic representations and dynamically generates speech training targets, integrating both acoustic and semantic learning.

Result: Achieves advanced performance on multiple knowledge-based question-answering benchmarks with about six thousand hours of training data.

Conclusion: EchoX effectively bridges the acoustic-semantic gap, enabling speech LLMs to preserve strong reasoning abilities comparable to text-based models.

Abstract: Speech-to-speech large language models (SLLMs) are attracting increasing
attention. Derived from text-based large language models (LLMs), SLLMs often
exhibit degradation in knowledge and reasoning capabilities. We hypothesize
that this limitation arises because current training paradigms for SLLMs fail
to bridge the acoustic-semantic gap in the feature representation space. To
address this issue, we propose EchoX, which leverages semantic representations
and dynamically generates speech training targets. This approach integrates
both acoustic and semantic learning, enabling EchoX to preserve strong
reasoning abilities as a speech LLM. Experimental results demonstrate that
EchoX, with about six thousand hours of training data, achieves advanced
performance on multiple knowledge-based question-answering benchmarks. The

*Chin Yuen Kwok,Jia Qi yip*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a look-ahead multi-step prediction method to improve contextual biasing in ASR models, eliminating the need for computationally expensive bonus revocation in Trie-based biasing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trie-based biasing methods for rare word recognition in ASR require computationally expensive revocation of bonus scores when full words aren't recognized, particularly problematic for large decoder models.

Method: Adapt ASR models to look ahead and predict multiple steps simultaneously, fine-tuning Whisper with only 10 hours of synthetic data to better estimate whether partial hypotheses will lead to full rare word generation.

Result: Significantly reduces word error rate on NSC Part 2 test set from 30.86% to 12.19%.

Conclusion: The proposed look-ahead multi-step prediction approach effectively overcomes computational limitations of traditional Trie-based biasing while dramatically improving rare word recognition performance.

Abstract: Contextual biasing improves rare word recognition of ASR models by
prioritizing the output of rare words during decoding. A common approach is
Trie-based biasing, which gives "bonus scores" to partial hypothesis (e.g.
"Bon") that may lead to the generation of the rare word (e.g. "Bonham"). If the
full word ("Bonham") isn't ultimately recognized, the system revokes those
earlier bonuses. This revocation is limited to beam search and is
computationally expensive, particularly for models with large decoders. To
overcome these limitations, we propose adapting ASR models to look ahead and
predict multiple steps at once. This avoids the revocation step entirely by
better estimating whether a partial hypothesis will lead to the generation of
the full rare word. By fine-tuning Whisper with only 10 hours of synthetic
data, our method reduces the word error rate on the NSC Part 2 test set from
30.86% to 12.19%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Enhanced contextual biasing with keyword-aware loss function improves rare word recognition in ASR systems, reducing WER from 29.71% to 11.81% on NSC Part 2 test set.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rare word recognition in ASR systems can be improved through synthetic data adaptation and contextual biasing, but synthetic data training can lead to overfitting due to audio artifacts.

Method: Proposed a keyword-aware loss function with masked cross-entropy for biased word prediction and binary classification for detecting biased word positions, enhancing TCPGen-based contextual biasing approach.

Result: Adapting Whisper to 10 hours of synthetic data with the proposed method reduced word error rate from 29.71% to 11.81% on NSC Part 2 test set.

Conclusion: The keyword-aware loss function effectively addresses overfitting in synthetic data training and significantly improves rare word recognition through complementary decoding support during inference.

Abstract: Rare word recognition can be improved by adapting ASR models to synthetic
data that includes these words. Further improvements can be achieved through
contextual biasing, which trains and adds a biasing module into the model
architecture to prioritize rare words. While training the module on synthetic
rare word data is more effective than using non-rare-word data, it can lead to
overfitting due to artifacts in the synthetic audio. To address this, we
enhance the TCPGen-based contextual biasing approach and propose a
keyword-aware loss function that additionally focuses on biased words when
training biasing modules. This loss includes a masked cross-entropy term for
biased word prediction and a binary classification term for detecting biased
word positions. These two terms complementarily support the decoding of biased
words during inference. By adapting Whisper to 10 hours of synthetic data, our
method reduced the word error rate on the NSC Part 2 test set from 29.71% to
11.81%.

TL;DR: GmSLM is a spoken language model pipeline optimized for Marmoset monkey vocal communication, enabling generation of realistic vocalizations and supporting neuroscience research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Marmoset monkeys exhibit complex vocal communication similar to human speech features, but studying brain activity in humans is difficult. Their vocal-based communication presents challenges for standard LLM approaches.

Method: Developed Generative Marmoset Spoken Language Modeling (GmSLM) pipeline with novel zero-shot evaluation metrics using unsupervised in-the-wild data and weakly labeled conversational data.

Result: GmSLM generated vocalizations closely matched real resynthesized samples acoustically, performed well on downstream tasks, and effectively distinguished real from artificial conversations despite being fully unsupervised.

Conclusion: GmSLM provides a practical framework linking vocalization and brain activity, benefiting future work in neuroscience, bioacoustics, and evolutionary biology.

Abstract: Marmoset monkeys exhibit complex vocal communication, challenging the view
that nonhuman primates vocal communication is entirely innate, and show similar
features of human speech, such as vocal labeling of others and turn-taking.
Studying their vocal communication offers a unique opportunity to link it with
brain activity-especially given the difficulty of accessing the human brain in
speech and language research. Since Marmosets communicate primarily through
vocalizations, applying standard LLM approaches is not straightforward. We
introduce Generative Marmoset Spoken Language Modeling (GmSLM), an optimized
spoken language model pipeline for Marmoset vocal communication. We designed a
novel zero-shot evaluation metrics using unsupervised in-the-wild data,
alongside weakly labeled conversational data, to assess GmSLM and demonstrate
its advantage over a basic human-speech-based baseline. GmSLM generated
vocalizations closely matched real resynthesized samples acoustically and
performed well on downstream tasks. Despite being fully unsupervised, GmSLM
effectively distinguish real from artificial conversations and may support
further investigations of the neural basis of vocal communication and provides
a practical framework linking vocalization and brain activity. We believe GmSLM
stands to benefit future work in neuroscience, bioacoustics, and evolutionary
biology. Samples are provided under: pages.cs.huji.ac.il/adiyoss-lab/GmSLM.

TL;DR: CCF is a context compression framework that enables efficient long-context modeling through hierarchical latent representations and memory encoding, achieving high compression ratios with competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling language models to longer contexts is essential but imposes significant computational and memory burdens with naive context extension approaches.

Method: Proposes CCF framework with segment-wise semantic aggregation and key-value memory encoding, plus training-efficient optimization with incremental segment decoding and sparse reservoir sampling.

Result: Achieves competitive perplexity under high compression ratios, significantly improves throughput and memory efficiency compared to existing approaches on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: Structured compression through CCF demonstrates potential for scalable and effective long-context language modeling.

Abstract: Scaling language models to longer contexts is essential for capturing rich
dependencies across extended discourse. However, na\"ive context extension
imposes significant computational and memory burdens, often resulting in
inefficiencies during both training and inference. In this work, we propose
CCF, a novel context compression framework designed to enable efficient
long-context modeling by learning hierarchical latent representations that
preserve global semantics while aggressively reducing input redundancy. CCF
integrates segment-wise semantic aggregation with key-value memory encoding,
forming compact representations that support accurate reconstruction and
long-range understanding. To further enhance scalability, we introduce a
training-efficient optimization strategy that couples incremental segment
decoding with sparse reservoir sampling, substantially reducing memory overhead
without degrading performance. Empirical results on multiple long-context
language modeling benchmarks demonstrate that CCF achieves competitive
perplexity under high compression ratios, and significantly improves throughput
and memory efficiency compared to existing approaches. These findings highlight
the potential of structured compression for scalable and effective long-context
language modeling.

Abstract: Question Answering over Tabular Data (Table QA) presents unique challenges

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of large labeled datasets for patent-SDG classification limits supervised learning, while existing methods like keyword searches lack scalability and generalizability.

Method: Uses citations from patents to SDG-tagged scientific papers as noisy signal, develops composite labeling function with LLMs to extract structured concepts (functions, solutions, applications), computes cross-domain similarity with rank-based retrieval, and calibrates via positive-only loss.

Result: Creates silver-standard multi-label dataset enabling effective regression models; outperforms baselines in internal validation and shows greater thematic coherence in external validation using network modularity metrics.

Conclusion: Weak supervision with semantic alignment enables scalable and effective SDG classification of patents, addressing global innovation tracking challenges.

Abstract: Classifying patents by their relevance to the UN Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) is crucial for tracking how innovation addresses global
challenges. However, the absence of a large, labeled dataset limits the use of
supervised learning. Existing methods, such as keyword searches, transfer
learning, and citation-based heuristics, lack scalability and generalizability.
This paper frames patent-to-SDG classification as a weak supervision problem,
using citations from patents to SDG-tagged scientific publications (NPL
citations) as a noisy initial signal. To address its sparsity and noise, we
develop a composite labeling function (LF) that uses large language models
(LLMs) to extract structured concepts, namely functions, solutions, and
applications, from patents and SDG papers based on a patent ontology.
Cross-domain similarity scores are computed and combined using a rank-based
retrieval approach. The LF is calibrated via a custom positive-only loss that
aligns with known NPL-SDG links without penalizing discovery of new SDG
associations. The result is a silver-standard, soft multi-label dataset mapping
patents to SDGs, enabling the training of effective multi-label regression
models. We validate our approach through two complementary strategies: (1)
internal validation against held-out NPL-based labels, where our method
outperforms several baselines including transformer-based models, and zero-shot
LLM; and (2) external validation using network modularity in patent citation,
co-inventor, and co-applicant graphs, where our labels reveal greater thematic,
cognitive, and organizational coherence than traditional technological
classifications. These results show that weak supervision and semantic
alignment can enhance SDG classification at scale.

### [126] [MetaRAG: Metamorphic Testing for Hallucination Detection in RAG Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09360)
*Channdeth Sok,David Luz,Yacine Haddam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MetaRAG is a metamorphic testing framework for detecting hallucinations in RAG systems through factoid decomposition, controlled mutations, and context verification without requiring ground truth or model access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs deployed in enterprise applications suffer from hallucinations, and existing detection methods don't address the unique challenges of RAG systems where responses must align with retrieved evidence.

Method: Four-stage framework: 1) decompose answers into atomic factoids, 2) generate controlled mutations using synonym/antonym substitutions, 3) verify variants against retrieved context, 4) aggregate penalties into hallucination scores with span-level localization.

Result: Effective hallucination detection on proprietary enterprise dataset, enabling trustworthy deployment of RAG-based conversational agents with identity-aware safeguards.

Conclusion: MetaRAG provides real-time, unsupervised black-box testing for RAG systems, offering practical hallucination detection and identity-aware safeguards without requiring ground truth or model internals access.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in enterprise
applications, yet their reliability remains limited by hallucinations, i.e.,
confident but factually incorrect information. Existing detection approaches,
such as SelfCheckGPT and MetaQA, primarily target standalone LLMs and do not
address the unique challenges of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems,
where responses must be consistent with retrieved evidence. We therefore
present MetaRAG, a metamorphic testing framework for hallucination detection in
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. MetaRAG operates in a real-time,
unsupervised, black-box setting, requiring neither ground-truth references nor
access to model internals, making it suitable for proprietary and high-stakes
domains. The framework proceeds in four stages: (1) decompose answers into
atomic factoids, (2) generate controlled mutations of each factoid using
synonym and antonym substitutions, (3) verify each variant against the
retrieved context (synonyms are expected to be entailed and antonyms
contradicted), and (4) aggregate penalties for inconsistencies into a
response-level hallucination score. Crucially for identity-aware AI, MetaRAG
localizes unsupported claims at the factoid span where they occur (e.g.,
pregnancy-specific precautions, LGBTQ+ refugee rights, or labor eligibility),
allowing users to see flagged spans and enabling system designers to configure
thresholds and guardrails for identity-sensitive queries. Experiments on a
proprietary enterprise dataset illustrate the effectiveness of MetaRAG for
detecting hallucinations and enabling trustworthy deployment of RAG-based
conversational agents. We also outline a topic-based deployment design that
translates MetaRAG's span-level scores into identity-aware safeguards; this
design is discussed but not evaluated in our experiments.

TL;DR: Connecting cognitive science theories of analogical reasoning to NLP research to improve relational understanding in text processing


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analogical reasoning is crucial for human cognition but not sufficiently explored in NLP through a cognitive lens, despite clear connections between cognitive processes and NLP concepts

Method: Summarizing key cognitive science theories about analogical reasoning processes and relating them to current NLP research, showing relevance for major NLP challenges beyond analogy solving

Result: Demonstrates how cognitive theories of analogy can guide NLP researchers to better optimize relational understanding in text rather than relying primarily on entity-level similarity

Conclusion: Integrating cognitive science perspectives on analogical reasoning can significantly benefit NLP research by improving relational text understanding and addressing core challenges in the field

Abstract: Analogical reasoning is an essential aspect of human cognition. In this
paper, we summarize key theory about the processes underlying analogical
reasoning from the cognitive science literature and relate it to current
research in natural language processing. While these processes can be easily
linked to concepts in NLP, they are generally not viewed through a cognitive
lens. Furthermore, we show how these notions are relevant for several major
challenges in NLP research, not directly related to analogy solving. This may
guide researchers to better optimize relational understanding in text, as
opposed to relying heavily on entity-level similarity.

TL;DR: Hierarchical bracketing encodings enable linear-time dependency graph parsing with n tagging actions while handling reentrancies, cycles, and empty nodes, reducing label space while maintaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a practical approach for dependency graph parsing that can handle complex linguistic phenomena like reentrancies and cycles while maintaining efficiency and reducing computational complexity.

Method: Encodes dependency graphs as sequences using hierarchical bracketing encodings, enabling linear-time parsing with n tagging actions. The method reduces label space while preserving structural information.

Result: Competitive results on multilingual and multi-formalism benchmark, with consistent improvements in exact match accuracy over other graph parsing methods.

Conclusion: Hierarchical bracketing encodings provide an efficient and practical solution for dependency graph parsing, offering reduced computational complexity while maintaining strong performance across diverse linguistic contexts.

Abstract: We revisit hierarchical bracketing encodings from a practical perspective in
the context of dependency graph parsing. The approach encodes graphs as
sequences, enabling linear-time parsing with $n$ tagging actions, and still
representing reentrancies, cycles, and empty nodes. Compared to existing graph
linearizations, this representation substantially reduces the label space while
preserving structural information. We evaluate it on a multilingual and
multi-formalism benchmark, showing competitive results and consistent
improvements over other methods in exact match accuracy.

*Zhaohan Zhang,Ziquan Liu,Ioannis Patras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GrACE is a scalable confidence elicitation method for LLMs that uses hidden state similarity to a special token for real-time confidence estimation, achieving better calibration and discriminative capacity than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing confidence elicitation methods for LLMs are either computationally expensive or poorly calibrated, making them impractical for real-world deployment in high-stakes applications like healthcare and finance.

Method: GrACE uses a novel mechanism where confidence is expressed through similarity between the last hidden state and a special token's embedding. The model is fine-tuned with calibration targets associated with accuracy.

Result: Experiments with three LLMs and two benchmark datasets show GrACE achieves best discriminative capacity and calibration on open-ended generation tasks, outperforming six competing methods without additional sampling or auxiliary models.

Conclusion: GrACE provides a practical solution for deploying LLMs with scalable, reliable, and real-time confidence estimation, improving accuracy and reducing required samples in test-time scaling schemes.

Abstract: Assessing the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by confidence
elicitation is a prominent approach to AI safety in high-stakes applications,
such as healthcare and finance. Existing methods either require expensive
computational overhead or suffer from poor calibration, making them impractical
and unreliable for real-world deployment. In this work, we propose GrACE, a
Generative Approach to Confidence Elicitation that enables scalable and
reliable confidence elicitation for LLMs. GrACE adopts a novel mechanism in
which the model expresses confidence by the similarity between the last hidden
state and the embedding of a special token appended to the vocabulary, in
real-time. We fine-tune the model for calibrating the confidence with
calibration targets associated with accuracy. Experiments with three LLMs and
two benchmark datasets show that the confidence produced by GrACE achieves the
best discriminative capacity and calibration on open-ended generation tasks,
outperforming six competing methods without resorting to additional sampling or
an auxiliary model. Moreover, we propose two strategies for improving test-time
scaling based on confidence induced by GrACE. Experimental results show that
using GrACE not only improves the accuracy of the final decision but also
significantly reduces the number of required samples in the test-time scaling
scheme, indicating the potential of GrACE as a practical solution for deploying
LLMs with scalable, reliable, and real-time confidence estimation.

*Vadim Zadykian,Bruno Andrade,Haithem Afli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Self-supervised hybrid architecture combining sentence embeddings with knowledge graphs improves job title matching, with 25% RMSE reduction in high semantic relatedness regions through stratified evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in resume recommendation systems where job title matching suffers from limited overlapping terms and misleading lexical similarity, requiring better semantic understanding beyond surface-level features.

Method: Hybrid architecture combining dense sentence embeddings with domain-specific Knowledge Graphs via graph neural networks, with stratified evaluation partitioning STR scores into low, medium, and high semantic relatedness regions.

Result: Fine-tuned SBERT models augmented with KGs achieved 25% RMSE reduction in high-STR region compared to strong baselines, demonstrating consistent improvements in semantic alignment.

Conclusion: Combining KGs with text embeddings provides significant benefits for semantic matching, and stratified regional analysis reveals model strengths/weaknesses hidden by global metrics, supporting fair and explainable HR systems.

Abstract: Semantic Textual Relatedness (STR) captures nuanced relationships between
texts that extend beyond superficial lexical similarity. In this study, we
investigate STR in the context of job title matching - a key challenge in
resume recommendation systems, where overlapping terms are often limited or
misleading. We introduce a self-supervised hybrid architecture that combines
dense sentence embeddings with domain-specific Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to
improve both semantic alignment and explainability. Unlike previous work that
evaluated models on aggregate performance, our approach emphasizes data
stratification by partitioning the STR score continuum into distinct regions:
low, medium, and high semantic relatedness. This stratified evaluation enables
a fine-grained analysis of model performance across semantically meaningful
subspaces. We evaluate several embedding models, both with and without KG
integration via graph neural networks. The results show that fine-tuned SBERT
models augmented with KGs produce consistent improvements in the high-STR
region, where the RMSE is reduced by 25% over strong baselines. Our findings
highlight not only the benefits of combining KGs with text embeddings, but also
the importance of regional performance analysis in understanding model
behavior. This granular approach reveals strengths and weaknesses hidden by
global metrics, and supports more targeted model selection for use in Human
Resources (HR) systems and applications where fairness, explainability, and
contextual matching are essential.

TL;DR: DeMeVa team's approaches for LeWiDi 2025: ICL with LLMs using different sampling strategies and LDL methods with RoBERTa for soft label predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore effective methods for predicting perspectivist annotations (annotator-specific labels) in learning with disagreements tasks.

Method: Two approaches: 1) In-context learning with large language models comparing example sampling strategies, 2) Label distribution learning methods with RoBERTa using various fine-tuning techniques.

Result: ICL effectively predicts annotator-specific annotations, and aggregating these predictions into soft labels yields competitive performance. LDL methods show promise for soft label predictions.

Conclusion: Both ICL and LDL methods are effective for perspectivist annotation tasks, with LDL methods deserving further exploration by the perspectivist community.

Abstract: This system paper presents the DeMeVa team's approaches to the third edition
of the Learning with Disagreements shared task (LeWiDi 2025; Leonardelli et
al., 2025). We explore two directions: in-context learning (ICL) with large
language models, where we compare example sampling strategies; and label
distribution learning (LDL) methods with RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019b), where we
evaluate several fine-tuning methods. Our contributions are twofold: (1) we
show that ICL can effectively predict annotator-specific annotations
(perspectivist annotations), and that aggregating these predictions into soft
labels yields competitive performance; and (2) we argue that LDL methods are
promising for soft label predictions and merit further exploration by the
perspectivist community.

Motivation: The rapid transformation of financial NLP through LLMs has outpaced traditional surveys, creating a need for structured, data-driven analysis of research trends and methodological shifts in the field.

Method: Developed an ontology for financial NLP research and applied an LLM-based extraction pipeline to analyze 681 papers (2022-2025) to create queryable knowledge graphs for large-scale trend analysis.

Result: Identified three key evolutionary phases: early LLM adoption with task/dataset innovation, critical reflection on LLM limitations, and growing integration of peripheral techniques into modular systems.

Conclusion: MetaGraph provides a structured, queryable view of financial NLP evolution and offers a reusable methodology for mapping scientific progress across other domains, benefiting both practitioners and researchers.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly reshaped financial NLP, enabling
new tasks and driving a proliferation of datasets and diversification of data
sources. Yet, this transformation has outpaced traditional surveys. In this
paper, we present MetaGraph, a generalizable methodology for extracting
knowledge graphs from scientific literature and analyzing them to obtain a
structured, queryable view of research trends. We define an ontology for
financial NLP research and apply an LLM-based extraction pipeline to 681 papers
(2022-2025), enabling large-scale, data-driven analysis. MetaGraph reveals
three key phases: early LLM adoption and task/dataset innovation; critical
reflection on LLM limitations; and growing integration of peripheral techniques
into modular systems. This structured view offers both practitioners and
researchers a clear understanding of how financial NLP has evolved -
highlighting emerging trends, shifting priorities, and methodological
shifts-while also demonstrating a reusable approach for mapping scientific

TL;DR: Using GPT's zero-shot capability to detect Big-Five personality traits from forum posts and integrate them into SAMI's matchmaking system for personality-informed social recommendations in online courses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online learning environments lack organic social connection formation. SAMI's current system has limited Theory of Mind and cannot intuit personality, which may affect recommendation relevance.

Method: Developed a personality detection model using GPT's zero-shot capability to infer Big-Five traits from student introduction forum posts, then integrated this into SAMI's entity-based matchmaking system.

Result: The GPT-based model demonstrated efficacy in personality detection when benchmarked against established models. Initial integration shows personality traits can complement existing matching factors.

Conclusion: Personality-informed recommendations show promise for improving social connections in online courses, though further evaluation is needed to determine full impact on student engagement and match quality.

Abstract: Social connection is a vital part of learning, yet online course environments
present barriers to the organic formation of social groups. SAMI offers one
solution by facilitating student connections, but its effectiveness is
constrained by an incomplete Theory of Mind, limiting its ability to create an
effective mental model of a student. One facet of this is its inability to
intuit personality, which may influence the relevance of its recommendations.
To explore this, we propose a personality detection model utilizing GPTs
zero-shot capability to infer Big-Five personality traits from forum
introduction posts, often encouraged in online courses. We benchmark its
performance against established models, demonstrating its efficacy in this
task. Furthermore, we integrate this model into SAMIs entity-based matchmaking
system, enabling personality-informed social recommendations. Initial
integration suggests personality traits can complement existing matching
factors, though additional evaluation is required to determine their full
impact on student engagement and match quality.

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with fine-grained emotion alignment despite their NLP capabilities. EXPRESS benchmark reveals limitations in capturing nuanced human emotions compared to self-disclosures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether LLMs can align with human emotions at a fine-grained level, addressing the gap in existing research that focuses only on broad emotion categories.

Method: Created EXPRESS benchmark dataset with 251 fine-grained emotion labels from Reddit, evaluated LLMs using comprehensive framework that decomposes emotions into 8 basic categories, and conducted systematic testing under various prompt settings.

Result: LLMs find it challenging to accurately predict emotions that align with human self-disclosed emotions, often failing to capture contextual cues effectively compared to human disclosures.

Conclusion: LLMs have significant limitations in fine-grained emotion alignment, highlighting the need for enhanced contextual understanding in future research.

Abstract: The versatility of Large Language Models (LLMs) in natural language
understanding has made them increasingly popular in mental health research.
While many studies explore LLMs' capabilities in emotion recognition, a
critical gap remains in evaluating whether LLMs align with human emotions at a
fine-grained level. Existing research typically focuses on classifying emotions
into predefined, limited categories, overlooking more nuanced expressions. To
address this gap, we introduce EXPRESS, a benchmark dataset curated from Reddit
communities featuring 251 fine-grained, self-disclosed emotion labels. Our
comprehensive evaluation framework examines predicted emotion terms and
decomposes them into eight basic emotions using established emotion theories,
enabling a fine-grained comparison. Systematic testing of prevalent LLMs under
various prompt settings reveals that accurately predicting emotions that align
with human self-disclosed emotions remains challenging. Qualitative analysis
further shows that while certain LLMs generate emotion terms consistent with
established emotion theories and definitions, they sometimes fail to capture
contextual cues as effectively as human self-disclosures. These findings
highlight the limitations of LLMs in fine-grained emotion alignment and offer
insights for future research aimed at enhancing their contextual understanding.

TL;DR: MOAT is a joint alignment tuning framework that improves multi-agent collaboration through iterative planning agent alignment and grounding agent improvement, outperforming SOTA methods by 3.1-4.4% across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent systems fine-tune agents independently, leading to capability gaps and poor coordination between planning and grounding agents.

Method: MOAT alternates between two stages: Planning Agent Alignment (optimizes subgoal generation) and Grounding Agent Improving (fine-tunes using diverse subgoal-action pairs for better generalization).

Result: Achieves average improvements of 3.1% on held-in tasks and 4.4% on held-out tasks across six benchmarks, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The iterative joint alignment framework effectively bridges capability gaps and improves coordination between planning and grounding agents in multi-agent systems.

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the construction
of multi-agent systems to solve complex tasks by dividing responsibilities
among specialized agents, such as a planning agent for subgoal generation and a
grounding agent for executing tool-use actions. Most existing methods typically
fine-tune these agents independently, leading to capability gaps among them
with poor coordination. To address this, we propose MOAT, a Multi-Agent Joint
Alignment Tuning framework that improves agents collaboration through iterative
alignment. MOAT alternates between two key stages: (1) Planning Agent
Alignment, which optimizes the planning agent to generate subgoal sequences
that better guide the grounding agent; and (2) Grounding Agent Improving, which
fine-tunes the grounding agent using diverse subgoal-action pairs generated by
the agent itself to enhance its generalization capablity. Theoretical analysis
proves that MOAT ensures a non-decreasing and progressively convergent training
process. Experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate that MOAT outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average improvements of 3.1% on held-in
tasks and 4.4% on held-out tasks.

TL;DR: The paper identifies a specific subgraph (AF1) in LLMs that handles mental math tasks, where computation occurs late and only at the last token using specific middle layers for information transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs internally process mental math tasks despite their complex architecture, specifically investigating the extent to which token computations and information transfer actually occur across layers.

Method: Uses Context-Aware Mean Ablation (CAMA) and Attention-Based Peeking (ABP) to inhibit early token computations, restrict information transfer routes, and force computation at the last token to identify the critical All-for-One subgraph.

Result: Identified AF1 subgraph achieves high accuracy on mental math tasks, showing computation happens late at the last token using specific middle layers. This subgraph is sufficient, necessary, transferable across models, and works with various input styles.

Conclusion: LLMs use a specific computational subgraph for mental math where meaningful computation occurs very late and only at the final token position, with information transfer happening through particular middle layers.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate proficiency across numerous
computational tasks, yet their inner workings remain unclear. In theory, the
combination of causal self-attention and multilayer perceptron layers allows
every token to access and compute information based on all preceding tokens. In
practice, to what extent are such operations present? In this paper, on mental
math tasks (i.e., direct math calculation via next-token prediction without
explicit reasoning), we investigate this question in three steps: inhibiting
input-specific token computations in the initial layers, restricting the routes
of information transfer across token positions in the next few layers, and
forcing all computation to happen at the last token in the remaining layers.
With two proposed techniques, Context-Aware Mean Ablation (CAMA) and
Attention-Based Peeking (ABP), we identify an All-for-One subgraph (AF1) with
high accuracy on a wide variety of mental math tasks, where meaningful
computation occurs very late (in terms of layer depth) and only at the last
token, which receives information of other tokens in few specific middle
layers. Experiments on a variety of models and arithmetic expressions show that
this subgraph is sufficient and necessary for high model performance, transfers
across different models, and works on a variety of input styles. Ablations on
different CAMA and ABP alternatives reveal their unique advantages over other
methods, which may be of independent interest.

TL;DR: SteerMoE framework detects and controls behavior-specific experts in MoE LLMs to steer model behaviors like safety and faithfulness without weight modifications, achieving significant improvements and also demonstrating vulnerability to adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mixture-of-Experts models route tokens through specialized FFN experts, but there's a need to understand and control which experts drive specific behaviors like safety and faithfulness without retraining the entire model.

Method: Detects experts with distinct activation patterns across paired inputs showing contrasting behaviors, then selectively (de)activates these experts during inference to control model behaviors without modifying weights.

Result: Across 11 benchmarks and 6 LLMs: +20% safety improvement, +27% faithfulness improvement. In adversarial mode: -41% safety alone, -100% safety when combined with jailbreak methods, bypassing all safety guardrails.

Conclusion: SteerMoE enables effective behavior control in MoE models but also reveals a critical vulnerability - alignment faking hidden within experts that can be exploited to bypass safety mechanisms.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) in Large Language Models (LLMs) routes each token
through a subset of specialized Feed-Forward Networks (FFN), known as experts.
We present SteerMoE, a framework for steering MoE models by detecting and
controlling behavior-linked experts. Our detection method identifies experts
with distinct activation patterns across paired inputs exhibiting contrasting
behaviors. By selectively (de)activating such experts during inference, we
control behaviors like faithfulness and safety without retraining or modifying
weights. Across 11 benchmarks and 6 LLMs, our steering raises safety by up to
+20% and faithfulness by +27%. In adversarial attack mode, it drops safety by
-41% alone, and -100% when combined with existing jailbreak methods, bypassing
all safety guardrails and exposing a new dimension of alignment faking hidden
within experts.

TL;DR: Curiosity-Driven Exploration (CDE) framework addresses premature convergence in RLVR by using actor perplexity and critic variance as intrinsic curiosity signals to improve exploration and achieve +3 point gains on AIME benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods suffer from poor exploration, leading to premature convergence and entropy collapse, which limits the reasoning ability enhancement of LLMs.

Method: CDE leverages intrinsic curiosity signals: actor's perplexity over generated responses and critic's variance from multi-head value estimates as exploration bonuses within RLVR framework.

Result: Achieves approximately +3 point improvement over standard RLVR using GRPO/PPO on AIME benchmarks, and identifies calibration collapse mechanism in RLVR.

Conclusion: Curiosity-driven exploration effectively addresses exploration challenges in RLVR, with theoretical grounding connecting to established RL exploration methods and practical performance gains.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a powerful paradigm
for enhancing the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). Yet
current RLVR methods often explore poorly, leading to premature convergence and
entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we introduce Curiosity-Driven
Exploration (CDE), a framework that leverages the model's own intrinsic sense
of curiosity to guide exploration. We formalize curiosity with signals from
both the actor and the critic: for the actor, we use perplexity over its
generated response, and for the critic, we use the variance of value estimates
from a multi-head architecture. Both signals serve as an exploration bonus
within the RLVR framework to guide the model. Our theoretical analysis shows
that the actor-wise bonus inherently penalizes overconfident errors and
promotes diversity among correct responses; moreover, we connect the
critic-wise bonus to the well-established count-based exploration bonus in RL.
Empirically, our method achieves an approximate +3 point improvement over
standard RLVR using GRPO/PPO on AIME benchmarks. Further analysis identifies a
calibration collapse mechanism within RLVR, shedding light on common LLM
failure modes.

### [141] [Uncertainty Estimation using Variance-Gated Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08846)
*H. Martin Gillis,Isaac Xu,Thomas Trappenberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a new framework for uncertainty estimation and decomposition using signal-to-noise ratio of class probabilities across model predictions, introducing a variance-gated confidence measure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing additive uncertainty decomposition approaches have been questioned, and there's a need for better per-sample uncertainty quantification for high-risk applications.

Method: Uses signal-to-noise ratio of class probability distributions across different model predictions, with a variance-gated measure that scales predictions by confidence factors derived from ensembles.

Result: The framework provides intuitive uncertainty estimation and helps analyze the collapse in diversity of committee machines.

Conclusion: The proposed signal-to-noise ratio based framework offers a more reliable approach for uncertainty decomposition compared to traditional additive methods.

Abstract: Evaluation of per-sample uncertainty quantification from neural networks is
essential for decision-making involving high-risk applications. A common
approach is to use the predictive distribution from Bayesian or approximation
models and decompose the corresponding predictive uncertainty into epistemic
(model-related) and aleatoric (data-related) components. However, additive
decomposition has recently been questioned. In this work, we propose an
intuitive framework for uncertainty estimation and decomposition based on the
signal-to-noise ratio of class probability distributions across different model
predictions. We introduce a variance-gated measure that scales predictions by a
confidence factor derived from ensembles. We use this measure to discuss the
existence of a collapse in the diversity of committee machines.

### [142] [Instance-Optimal Matrix Multiplicative Weight Update and Its Quantum Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08911)
*Weiyuan Gong,Tongyang Li,Xinzhao Wang,Zhiyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Improved matrix multiplicative weight update algorithm achieves instance-optimal regret bound O(√(T·S(X||d⁻¹I_d))) for matrix learning from expert advice, matching computational complexity of standard MMWU while providing better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The standard Matrix Multiplicative Weight Update (MMWU) algorithm achieves minimax-optimal regret O(√(T log d)) for matrix learning from expert advice, but this bound may not be tight for specific instances. The authors aim to develop an algorithm that achieves instance-optimal regret bounds while maintaining the same computational efficiency.

Method: Developed a general potential-based framework for matrix LEA, with MMWU as a special case. Introduced a new 'one-sided' Jensen's trace inequality using Laplace transform techniques to enable application of general potential functions beyond exponential. The algorithm is induced by an optimal potential function based on the imaginary error function from vector LEA.

Result: The new algorithm achieves instance-optimal regret bound O(√(T·S(X||d⁻¹I_d))) where S(·||·) is quantum relative entropy, with the same computational complexity as standard MMWU. Outperforms state-of-the-art for learning quantum states corrupted by depolarization noise, random quantum states, and Gibbs states. Enables prediction of nonlinear quantum properties like purity, quantum virtual cooling, and Rényi-2 correlation.

Conclusion: The improved algorithm provides 'free' improvement in regret bounds over standard MMWU while maintaining computational efficiency. The technical contributions include a general potential-based framework and novel trace inequality, with significant applications in quantum learning theory and quantum state prediction.

Abstract: The Matrix Multiplicative Weight Update (MMWU) is a seminal online learning
algorithm with numerous applications. Applied to the matrix version of the
Learning from Expert Advice (LEA) problem on the $d$-dimensional spectraplex,
it is well known that MMWU achieves the minimax-optimal regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{T\log d})$, where $T$ is the time horizon. In this paper, we present
an improved algorithm achieving the instance-optimal regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{T\cdot S(X||d^{-1}I_d)})$, where $X$ is the comparator in the regret,
$I_d$ is the identity matrix, and $S(\cdot||\cdot)$ denotes the quantum
relative entropy. Furthermore, our algorithm has the same computational
complexity as MMWU, indicating that the improvement in the regret bound is
``free''.
  Technically, we first develop a general potential-based framework for matrix
LEA, with MMWU being its special case induced by the standard exponential
potential. Then, the crux of our analysis is a new ``one-sided'' Jensen's trace
inequality built on a Laplace transform technique, which allows the application
of general potential functions beyond exponential to matrix LEA. Our algorithm
is finally induced by an optimal potential function from the vector LEA
problem, based on the imaginary error function.
  Complementing the above, we provide a memory lower bound for matrix LEA, and
explore the applications of our algorithm in quantum learning theory. We show
that it outperforms the state of the art for learning quantum states corrupted
by depolarization noise, random quantum states, and Gibbs states. In addition,
applying our algorithm to linearized convex losses enables predicting nonlinear
quantum properties, such as purity, quantum virtual cooling, and R\'{e}nyi-$2$
correlation.

### [143] [Corruption-Tolerant Asynchronous Q-Learning with Near-Optimal Rates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08933)
*Sreejeet Maity,Aritra Mitra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Robust Q-learning algorithm for adversarial reward corruption with finite-time convergence guarantees matching non-adversarial rates plus unavoidable corruption term.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical RL algorithms like Q-learning degrade severely under adversarial reward corruption from noise, sensor faults, or malicious attacks.

Method: Proposed provably robust Q-learning variant that works with corrupted rewards, using refined Azuma-Hoeffding inequality for almost-martingales in unknown statistics case.

Result: Achieves finite-time convergence rate matching non-adversarial case up to additive corruption term, with information-theoretic lower bound showing this term is unavoidable.

Conclusion: First finite-time robustness guarantees for asynchronous Q-learning under adversarial corruption, bridging significant gap in robust RL.

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning the optimal policy in a discounted,
infinite-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) setting where the reward signal is
subject to adversarial corruption. Such corruption, which may arise from
extreme noise, sensor faults, or malicious attacks, can severely degrade the
performance of classical algorithms such as Q-learning. To address this
challenge, we propose a new provably robust variant of the Q-learning algorithm
that operates effectively even when a fraction of the observed rewards are
arbitrarily perturbed by an adversary. Under the asynchronous sampling model
with time-correlated data, we establish that despite adversarial corruption,
the finite-time convergence rate of our algorithm matches that of existing
results for the non-adversarial case, up to an additive term proportional to
the fraction of corrupted samples. Moreover, we derive an information-theoretic
lower bound revealing that the additive corruption term in our upper bounds is
unavoidable.
  Next, we propose a variant of our algorithm that requires no prior knowledge
of the statistics of the true reward distributions. The analysis of this
setting is particularly challenging and is enabled by carefully exploiting a
refined Azuma-Hoeffding inequality for almost-martingales, a technical tool
that might be of independent interest. Collectively, our contributions provide
the first finite-time robustness guarantees for asynchronous Q-learning,
bridging a significant gap in robust RL.

### [144] [Group Distributionally Robust Machine Learning under Group Level Distributional Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08942)
*Xenia Konti,Yi Shen,Zifan Wang,Karl Henrik Johansson,Michael J. Pencina,Nicoleta J. Economou-Zavlanos,Michael M. Zavlanos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a Wasserstein-based distributionally robust optimization framework to improve worst-group performance in ML models when group distributions are uncertain due to noisy, non-stationary environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard ML methods often learn spurious correlations that perform well on average but degrade performance for underrepresented groups, especially when group distributions cannot be accurately estimated from training data.

Method: Uses Wasserstein-based distributionally robust optimization (DRO) to account for distributional uncertainty within each group while optimizing worst-group performance, with a gradient descent-ascent algorithm for solving the DRO problem.

Result: The method is validated on real-world data, showing effectiveness in handling distributional uncertainty while preserving worst-group performance objectives.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a robust solution for improving ML model performance on underrepresented groups in environments with distributional uncertainty and noisy data sources.

Abstract: The performance of machine learning (ML) models critically depends on the
quality and representativeness of the training data. In applications with
multiple heterogeneous data generating sources, standard ML methods often learn
spurious correlations that perform well on average but degrade performance for
atypical or underrepresented groups. Prior work addresses this issue by
optimizing the worst-group performance. However, these approaches typically
assume that the underlying data distributions for each group can be accurately
estimated using the training data, a condition that is frequently violated in
noisy, non-stationary, and evolving environments. In this work, we propose a
novel framework that relies on Wasserstein-based distributionally robust
optimization (DRO) to account for the distributional uncertainty within each
group, while simultaneously preserving the objective of improving the
worst-group performance. We develop a gradient descent-ascent algorithm to
solve the proposed DRO problem and provide convergence results. Finally, we
validate the effectiveness of our method on real-world data.

Conclusion: FoundationalECGNet represents a scalable, interpretable, and generalizable solution that can improve diagnostic precision and patient outcomes in healthcare settings for automated ECG analysis.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain a leading cause of mortality worldwide,
underscoring the importance of accurate and scalable diagnostic systems.
Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is central to detecting cardiac abnormalities,
yet challenges such as noise, class imbalance, and dataset heterogeneity limit
current methods. To address these issues, we propose FoundationalECGNet, a
foundational framework for automated ECG classification. The model integrates a
dual-stage denoising by Morlet and Daubechies wavelets transformation,
Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), Graph Attention Networks (GAT),
and Time Series Transformers (TST) to jointly capture spatial and temporal
dependencies in multi-channel ECG signals. FoundationalECGNet first
distinguishes between Normal and Abnormal ECG signals, and then classifies the
Abnormal signals into one of five cardiac conditions: Arrhythmias, Conduction
Disorders, Myocardial Infarction, QT Abnormalities, or Hypertrophy. Across
multiple datasets, the model achieves a 99% F1-score for Normal vs. Abnormal
classification and shows state-of-the-art performance in multi-class disease
detection, including a 99% F1-score for Conduction Disorders and Hypertrophy,
as well as a 98.9% F1-score for Arrhythmias. Additionally, the model provides
risk level estimations to facilitate clinical decision-making. In conclusion,
FoundationalECGNet represents a scalable, interpretable, and generalizable
solution for automated ECG analysis, with the potential to improve diagnostic
precision and patient outcomes in healthcare settings. We'll share the code
after acceptance.

### [146] [Value bounds and Convergence Analysis for Averages of LRP attributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08963)
*Alexander Binder,Nastaran Takmil-Homayouni,Urun Dogan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Analysis of LRP attribution methods through matrix representation, deriving bounds for singular values and attribution values, with key finding that LRP-beta constants remain independent of weight norms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the numerical properties and distribution characteristics of Layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) attribution methods by representing them as matrix products and analyzing their convergence behavior.

Method: Represent LRP-type attribution methods as products of modified gradient matrices, derive upper bounds for singular values and component-wise bounds for attribution values, and apply these bounds to obtain multiplicative constants governing convergence.

Result: Derived bounds for singular values and attribution values, with key finding that multiplicative constants for LRP-beta remain independent of weight norms, unlike gradient-based methods and LRP-epsilon.

Conclusion: The analysis provides important insights for scenarios with multiple non-geometric data augmentations and Smoothgrad-type methods, highlighting LRP-beta's unique property of weight norm independence in convergence constants.

Abstract: We analyze numerical properties of Layer-wise relevance propagation
(LRP)-type attribution methods by representing them as a product of modified
gradient matrices. This representation creates an analogy to matrix
multiplications of Jacobi-matrices which arise from the chain rule of
differentiation. In order to shed light on the distribution of attribution
values, we derive upper bounds for singular values. Furthermore we derive
component-wise bounds for attribution map values. As a main result, we apply
these component-wise bounds to obtain multiplicative constants. These constants
govern the convergence of empirical means of attributions to expectations of
attribution maps. This finding has important implications for scenarios where
multiple non-geometric data augmentations are applied to individual test
samples, as well as for Smoothgrad-type attribution methods. In particular, our
analysis reveals that the constants for LRP-beta remain independent of weight
norms, a significant distinction from both gradient-based methods and
LRP-epsilon.

*Daniel Richards Arputharaj,Charlotte Rodriguez,Angelo Rodio,Giovanni Neglia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Carbon-aware federated learning scheduler that leverages slack time and fair carbon allocation to reduce emissions while maintaining model accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale ML training generates substantial carbon emissions. FL's distributed nature allows leveraging regional/temporal carbon intensity variations to reduce environmental impact.

Method: Carbon-aware client selection and scheduling that uses slack time to defer training to low-carbon periods, integrates alpha-fair carbon allocation, and includes global fine-tuning.

Result: Outperforms slack-agnostic baselines, achieving higher model accuracy across various carbon budgets, with particularly strong gains under tight carbon constraints.

Conclusion: Carbon-aware scheduling in FL effectively reduces emissions while maintaining performance, especially valuable when carbon budgets are constrained.

Abstract: Training large-scale machine learning models incurs substantial carbon
emissions. Federated Learning (FL), by distributing computation across
geographically dispersed clients, offers a natural framework to leverage
regional and temporal variations in Carbon Intensity (CI). This paper
investigates how to reduce emissions in FL through carbon-aware client
selection and training scheduling. We first quantify the emission savings of a
carbon-aware scheduling policy that leverages slack time -- permitting a modest
extension of the training duration so that clients can defer local training
rounds to lower-carbon periods. We then examine the performance trade-offs of
such scheduling which stem from statistical heterogeneity among clients,
selection bias in participation, and temporal correlation in model updates. To
leverage these trade-offs, we construct a carbon-aware scheduler that
integrates slack time, $\alpha$-fair carbon allocation, and a global
fine-tuning phase. Experiments on real-world CI data show that our scheduler
outperforms slack-agnostic baselines, achieving higher model accuracy across a
wide range of carbon budgets, with especially strong gains under tight carbon
constraints.

TL;DR: A framework combining active Pareto front learning (PyePAL) with visualization (UMAP) and explainable AI (fuzzy linguistic summaries) to optimize spin coating parameters for polymer thin films with specific mechanical properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spin coating polymer thin films to achieve specific mechanical properties is inherently a multi-objective optimization problem that requires balancing competing objectives like hardness and elasticity.

Method: Integrates PyePAL algorithm with Gaussian process models to predict mechanical properties from design variables (spin speed, dilution, polymer mixture), uses UMAP for 2D visualization of Pareto front exploration, and incorporates fuzzy linguistic summaries for explainable insights.

Result: The method efficiently identifies promising polymer designs while providing visual and linguistic explanations that facilitate expert-driven analysis and knowledge discovery.

Conclusion: The framework successfully combines optimization with explainable AI techniques to provide both optimal solutions and interpretable insights into the relationships between process parameters and performance objectives.

Abstract: Spin coating polymer thin films to achieve specific mechanical properties is
inherently a multi-objective optimization problem. We present a framework that
integrates an active Pareto front learning algorithm (PyePAL) with
visualization and explainable AI techniques to optimize processing parameters.
PyePAL uses Gaussian process models to predict objective values (hardness and
elasticity) from the design variables (spin speed, dilution, and polymer
mixture), guiding the adaptive selection of samples toward promising regions of
the design space. To enable interpretable insights into the high-dimensional
design space, we utilize UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)
for two-dimensional visualization of the Pareto front exploration.
Additionally, we incorporate fuzzy linguistic summaries, which translate the
learned relationships between process parameters and performance objectives
into linguistic statements, thus enhancing the explainability and understanding
of the optimization results. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
efficiently identifies promising polymer designs, while the visual and
linguistic explanations facilitate expert-driven analysis and knowledge
discovery.

Motivation: Transformers have quadratic time complexity that limits scalability, despite their ability to simulate Massively Parallel Computation algorithms.

Method: Introduces Approximate Nearest Neighbor Attention (ANNA) with sub-quadratic time complexity, proving it retains the expressive power of standard attention and can solve reasoning tasks like Match2 and k-hop with near-optimal depth.

Result: ANNA-transformers maintain MPC simulation capabilities, solve key reasoning tasks efficiently, and can simulate constant-depth low-rank transformers within the MPC framework.

Conclusion: ANNA provides a unified framework for reasoning about efficient attention approximations while preserving transformer expressiveness and enabling scalable computation.

Abstract: Transformers have the representational capacity to simulate Massively
Parallel Computation (MPC) algorithms, but they suffer from quadratic time
complexity, which severely limits their scalability. We introduce an efficient
attention mechanism called Approximate Nearest Neighbor Attention (ANNA) with
sub-quadratic time complexity. We prove that ANNA-transformers (1) retain the
expressive power previously established for standard attention in terms of
matching the capabilities of MPC algorithms, and (2) can solve key reasoning
tasks such as Match2 and $k$-hop with near-optimal depth. Using the MPC
framework, we further prove that constant-depth ANNA-transformers can simulate
constant-depth low-rank transformers, thereby providing a unified way to reason
about a broad class of efficient attention approximations.

TL;DR: A context-conditional anomaly detection framework for tabular data that automatically identifies context features and uses deep autoencoders to model conditional distributions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised anomaly detection in tabular data is challenging because real-world datasets contain heterogeneous contexts where globally rare events can be normal under specific contexts, making single global distribution models ineffective.

Method: The approach automatically identifies context features and models the conditional data distribution using a simple deep autoencoder framework tailored for tabular datasets.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple tabular benchmark datasets demonstrate that the method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The framework underscores the importance of considering contextual nuances in accurately distinguishing anomalous from normal instances in tabular data anomaly detection.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is critical in domains such as cybersecurity and finance,
especially when working with large-scale tabular data. Yet, unsupervised
anomaly detection -- where no labeled anomalies are available -- remains a
significant challenge. Although various deep learning methods have been
proposed to model a dataset's joint distribution, real-world tabular data often
contain heterogeneous contexts (e.g., different users), making globally rare
events normal under certain contexts. Consequently, relying on a single global
distribution can overlook these contextual nuances, degrading detection
performance. In this paper, we present a context-conditional anomaly detection
framework tailored for tabular datasets. Our approach automatically identifies
context features and models the conditional data distribution using a simple
deep autoencoder. Extensive experiments on multiple tabular benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches,
underscoring the importance of context in accurately distinguishing anomalous
from normal instances.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Progress in data-driven weather models has plateaued, and there's a need for more accurate forecasting without developing entirely new models from scratch.

Method: Uses Vision Transformer-based gating network to dynamically weight contributions of multiple expert weather models at each grid point, conditioned on forecast lead time.

Result: Achieves up to 10% lower RMSE than best-performing AI weather model on 2-day forecast horizon, outperforming individual experts and simple averaging.

Conclusion: MoWE provides computationally efficient and scalable strategy to advance data-driven weather prediction by optimally combining existing high-quality forecast models.

Abstract: Data-driven weather models have recently achieved state-of-the-art
performance, yet progress has plateaued in recent years. This paper introduces
a Mixture of Experts (MoWE) approach as a novel paradigm to overcome these
limitations, not by creating a new forecaster, but by optimally combining the
outputs of existing models. The MoWE model is trained with significantly lower
computational resources than the individual experts. Our model employs a Vision
Transformer-based gating network that dynamically learns to weight the
contributions of multiple "expert" models at each grid point, conditioned on
forecast lead time. This approach creates a synthesized deterministic forecast
that is more accurate than any individual component in terms of Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method,
achieving up to a 10% lower RMSE than the best-performing AI weather model on a
2-day forecast horizon, significantly outperforming individual experts as well
as a simple average across experts. This work presents a computationally
efficient and scalable strategy to push the state of the art in data-driven
weather prediction by making the most out of leading high-quality forecast
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Renewable energy integration challenges conventional protection schemes, requiring ML solutions for modern power systems.

Method: PRISMA for Scoping Reviews framework applied to synthesize literature, assess ML scope, evaluate performance, and identify suitable methods for evolving grid conditions.

Result: ML models show high accuracy on simulated data but lack real-world validation; literature is fragmented with inconsistent methodologies, datasets, and evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: Critical gaps exist in real-world validation and robustness testing; future research needs benchmark datasets, realistic validation, and advanced ML architectures for practical deployment.

Abstract: The integration of renewable and distributed energy resources reshapes modern
power systems, challenging conventional protection schemes. This scoping review
synthesizes recent literature on machine learning (ML) applications in power
system protection and disturbance management, following the PRISMA for Scoping
Reviews framework. Based on over 100 publications, three key objectives are
addressed: (i) assessing the scope of ML research in protection tasks; (ii)
evaluating ML performance across diverse operational scenarios; and (iii)
identifying methods suitable for evolving grid conditions. ML models often
demonstrate high accuracy on simulated datasets; however, their performance
under real-world conditions remains insufficiently validated. The existing
literature is fragmented, with inconsistencies in methodological rigor, dataset
quality, and evaluation metrics. This lack of standardization hampers the
comparability of results and limits the generalizability of findings. To
address these challenges, this review introduces a ML-oriented taxonomy for
protection tasks, resolves key terminological inconsistencies, and advocates
for standardized reporting practices. It further provides guidelines for
comprehensive dataset documentation, methodological transparency, and
consistent evaluation protocols, aiming to improve reproducibility and enhance
the practical relevance of research outcomes. Critical gaps remain, including
the scarcity of real-world validation, insufficient robustness testing, and
limited consideration of deployment feasibility. Future research should
prioritize public benchmark datasets, realistic validation methods, and
advanced ML architectures. These steps are essential to move ML-based
protection from theoretical promise to practical deployment in increasingly
dynamic and decentralized power systems.

TL;DR: STRIDE is a scalable XAI framework that avoids exponential subset enumeration costs by using RKHS functional decomposition, providing both local/global explanations with high fidelity and speed improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of current XAI frameworks: exponential cost of feature subset reasoning and reduced expressiveness of scalar attribution summaries.

Method: Framing explanation as subset-enumeration-free orthogonal functional decomposition in RKHS using analytical projection with recursive kernel-centering procedure.

Result: Achieved speedups from 0.6x to 9.7x (median ~3x) across 10 datasets while maintaining high fidelity (R² 0.81-0.999) and rank agreement.

Conclusion: STRIDE complements scalar attribution methods by offering structured functional perspective and enabling novel diagnostics like component surgery for interaction analysis.

Abstract: Most explainable AI (XAI) frameworks face two practical limitations: the
exponential cost of reasoning over feature subsets and the reduced
expressiveness of summarizing effects as single scalar values. We present
STRIDE, a scalable framework that aims to mitigate both issues by framing
explanation as a subset-enumeration-free, orthogonal functional decomposition
in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). Rather than focusing only on
scalar attributions, STRIDE computes functional components f_S(x_S) via an
analytical projection scheme based on a recursive kernel-centering procedure,
avoiding explicit subset enumeration. In the tabular setups we study, the
approach is model-agnostic, provides both local and global views, and is
supported by theoretical results on orthogonality and L^2 convergence under
stated assumptions. On public tabular benchmarks in our environment, we
observed speedups ranging from 0.6 times (slower than TreeSHAP on a small
dataset) to 9.7 times (California), with a median approximate 3.0 times across
10 datasets, while maintaining high fidelity (R^2 between 0.81 and 0.999) and
substantial rank agreement on most datasets. Overall, STRIDE complements scalar
attribution methods by offering a structured functional perspective, enabling
novel diagnostics like 'component surgery' to quantitatively measure the impact
of specific interactions within our experimental scope.

Method: Grouping models based on both performance and explanations to construct ensembles that maximize diversity while maintaining predictive accuracy, ensuring each model covers distinct regions of the solution space.

Result: Validated on real-world datasets showing up to 0.20+ AUROC improvements, particularly in scenarios with large Rashomon ratio, with demonstrated tangible business benefits.

Conclusion: The Rashomon Ensemble approach provides robust, practical, and effective solution for improving model generalization by leveraging diverse high-performing models from the solution space.

Abstract: Creating models from past observations and ensuring their effectiveness on
new data is the essence of machine learning. However, selecting models that
generalize well remains a challenging task. Related to this topic, the Rashomon
Effect refers to cases where multiple models perform similarly well for a given
learning problem. This often occurs in real-world scenarios, like the
manufacturing process or medical diagnosis, where diverse patterns in data lead
to multiple high-performing solutions. We propose the Rashomon Ensemble, a
method that strategically selects models from these diverse high-performing
solutions to improve generalization. By grouping models based on both their
performance and explanations, we construct ensembles that maximize diversity
while maintaining predictive accuracy. This selection ensures that each model
covers a distinct region of the solution space, making the ensemble more robust
to distribution shifts and variations in unseen data. We validate our approach
on both open and proprietary collaborative real-world datasets, demonstrating
up to 0.20+ AUROC improvements in scenarios where the Rashomon ratio is large.
Additionally, we demonstrate tangible benefits for businesses in various
real-world applications, highlighting the robustness, practicality, and
effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Riemannian geometry analysis of Deep Linear Networks using group actions and Riemannian submersion to define Boltzmann entropy and study learning thermodynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a thermodynamic description of the learning process in Deep Linear Networks by studying their Riemannian geometry and overparametrization through group actions.

Method: Using group actions to analyze overparametrization, Riemannian submersion from parameter space to observable space, foliation of balanced manifold by group orbits, and explicit construction of orthonormal basis using Jacobi matrices theory.

Result: Successfully defined and computed Boltzmann entropy using the foliation structure, and showed that Riemannian geometry on observable space is obtained by Riemannian submersion of the balanced manifold.

Conclusion: The Riemannian geometric framework provides a foundation for thermodynamic description of learning in Deep Linear Networks, with group orbits and submersion techniques enabling entropy computation and geometric analysis.

Abstract: We study the Riemannian geometry of the Deep Linear Network (DLN) as a
foundation for a thermodynamic description of the learning process. The main
tools are the use of group actions to analyze overparametrization and the use
of Riemannian submersion from the space of parameters to the space of
observables. The foliation of the balanced manifold in the parameter space by
group orbits is used to define and compute a Boltzmann entropy. We also show
that the Riemannian geometry on the space of observables defined in [2] is
obtained by Riemannian submersion of the balanced manifold. The main technical
step is an explicit construction of an orthonormal basis for the tangent space
of the balanced manifold using the theory of Jacobi matrices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sensitivity-LoRA is an efficient fine-tuning method that dynamically allocates ranks to weight matrices based on global and local sensitivities using second-order derivatives, overcoming limitations of uniform rank allocation in traditional LoRA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting LLMs for specialized tasks in resource-constrained environments is challenging. Traditional LoRA's uniform rank allocation and existing rank allocation techniques are computationally inefficient, complex, and unstable.

Method: Proposes Sensitivity-LoRA that uses second-order derivatives (Hessian Matrix) of the loss function to capture weight sensitivity, enabling dynamic rank allocation to weight matrices with minimal computational overhead.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate robust effectiveness, efficiency, and stability across diverse tasks and benchmarks.

Conclusion: Sensitivity-LoRA provides an efficient and stable solution for fine-tuning LLMs by addressing the limitations of uniform rank allocation in traditional LoRA methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed both everyday life and
scientific research. However, adapting LLMs from general-purpose models to
specialized tasks remains challenging, particularly in resource-constrained
environments. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a prominent method within
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), has emerged as a promising approach to
LLMs by approximating model weight updates using low-rank decomposition.
However, LoRA is limited by its uniform rank ( r ) allocation to each
incremental matrix, and existing rank allocation techniques aimed at addressing
this issue remain computationally inefficient, complex, and unstable, hindering
practical applications. To address these limitations, we propose
Sensitivity-LoRA, an efficient fine-tuning method that dynamically allocates
ranks to weight matrices based on both their global and local sensitivities. It
leverages the second-order derivatives (Hessian Matrix) of the loss function to
effectively capture weight sensitivity, enabling optimal rank allocation with
minimal computational overhead. Our experimental results have demonstrated
robust effectiveness, efficiency and stability of Sensitivity-LoRA across
diverse tasks and benchmarks.

*Emam Hossain,Md Osman Gani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A causality-aware deep learning framework that integrates MVGC and PCMCI+ for causal feature selection, improving Arctic Sea Ice Extent prediction accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional ML models fail to distinguish genuine causal relationships from spurious associations, limiting robustness and generalization capabilities.

Method: Hybrid neural architecture combining Multivariate Granger Causality (MVGC) and PCMCI+ for causal feature selection, using 43 years of Arctic Sea Ice Extent data and ocean-atmospheric variables.

Result: Improved prediction accuracy and interpretability across varying lead times, with reduced unnecessary features and enhanced computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework is broadly applicable to dynamic, high-dimensional domains, advancing both theoretical foundations and practical performance of causality-informed predictive modeling.

Abstract: Conventional machine learning and deep learning models typically rely on
correlation-based learning, which often fails to distinguish genuine causal
relationships from spurious associations, limiting their robustness,
interpretability, and ability to generalize. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce a causality-aware deep learning framework that integrates
Multivariate Granger Causality (MVGC) and PCMCI+ for causal feature selection
within a hybrid neural architecture. Leveraging 43 years (1979-2021) of Arctic
Sea Ice Extent (SIE) data and associated ocean-atmospheric variables at daily
and monthly resolutions, the proposed method identifies causally influential
predictors, prioritizes direct causes of SIE dynamics, reduces unnecessary
features, and enhances computational efficiency. Experimental results show that
incorporating causal inputs leads to improved prediction accuracy and
interpretability across varying lead times. While demonstrated on Arctic SIE
forecasting, the framework is broadly applicable to other dynamic,
high-dimensional domains, offering a scalable approach that advances both the
theoretical foundations and practical performance of causality-informed
predictive modeling.

### [159] [Continuous-Time Value Iteration for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09135)
*Xuefeng Wang,Lei Zhang,Henglin Pu,Ahmed H. Qureshi,Husheng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A continuous-time multi-agent reinforcement learning framework using physics-informed neural networks to solve Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, overcoming dimensionality and stability challenges in complex multi-agent systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods struggle with high-frequency or irregular time interval interactions in complex dynamical systems. Continuous-time RL shows promise but has been limited to single-agent domains due to the curse of dimensionality in HJB equations and difficulty in approximating centralized value functions in multi-agent settings.

Method: Proposes CT-MARL framework using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate HJB-based value functions. Introduces Value Gradient Iteration (VGI) module that iteratively refines value gradients along trajectories to align value learning with value-gradient learning.

Result: The method consistently outperforms existing continuous-time RL baselines on continuous-time variants of multi-agent particle environment (MPE) and multi-agent MuJoCo benchmarks, demonstrating scalability to complex multi-agent dynamics.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses key challenges in continuous-time multi-agent reinforcement learning, enabling effective scaling to high-dimensional multi-agent systems while maintaining stable policy training through improved gradient fidelity and value approximation.

Abstract: Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle with complex dynamical
systems that demand interactions at high frequencies or irregular time
intervals. Continuous-time RL (CTRL) has emerged as a promising alternative by
replacing discrete-time Bellman recursion with differential value functions
defined as viscosity solutions of the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation.
While CTRL has shown promise, its applications have been largely limited to the
single-agent domain. This limitation stems from two key challenges: (i)
conventional solution methods for HJB equations suffer from the curse of
dimensionality (CoD), making them intractable in high-dimensional systems; and
(ii) even with HJB-based learning approaches, accurately approximating
centralized value functions in multi-agent settings remains difficult, which in
turn destabilizes policy training. In this paper, we propose a CT-MARL
framework that uses physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate
HJB-based value functions at scale. To ensure the value is consistent with its
differential structure, we align value learning with value-gradient learning by
introducing a Value Gradient Iteration (VGI) module that iteratively refines
value gradients along trajectories. This improves gradient fidelity, in turn
yielding more accurate values and stronger policy learning. We evaluate our
method using continuous-time variants of standard benchmarks, including
multi-agent particle environment (MPE) and multi-agent MuJoCo. Our results
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing continuous-time
RL baselines and scales to complex multi-agent dynamics.

*Md Ibrahim Ibne Alam,Ankur Senapati,Anindo Mahmood,Murat Yuksel,Koushik Kar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine learning model using public ISP data to automate peering partner selection with 98% accuracy using XGBoost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automate the lengthy and complex peering process between ISPs to enhance efficiency in global Internet connectivity.

Method: Collect public data from PeeringDB and CAIDA, then evaluate tree-based, neural network, and transformer ML models for predicting peering relationships.

Result: XGBoost achieved 98% accuracy and showed resilience to time, space, and missing data variations.

Conclusion: ISPs can adopt this automated approach to optimize peering partner selection and create a more efficient Internet ecosystem.

Abstract: Internet service providers (ISPs) need to connect with other ISPs to provide
global connectivity services to their users. To ensure global connectivity,
ISPs can either use transit service(s) or establish direct peering
relationships between themselves via Internet exchange points (IXPs). Peering
offers more room for ISP-specific optimizations and is preferred, but it often
involves a lengthy and complex process. Automating peering partner selection
can enhance efficiency in the global Internet ecosystem. We explore the use of
publicly available data on ISPs to develop a machine learning (ML) model that
can predict whether an ISP pair should peer or not. At first, we explore public
databases, e.g., PeeringDB, CAIDA, etc., to gather data on ISPs. Then, we
evaluate the performance of three broad types of ML models for predicting
peering relationships: tree-based, neural network-based, and transformer-based.
Among these, we observe that tree-based models achieve the highest accuracy and
efficiency in our experiments. The XGBoost model trained with publicly
available data showed promising performance, with a 98% accuracy rate in
predicting peering partners. In addition, the model demonstrated great
resilience to variations in time, space, and missing data. We envision that
ISPs can adopt our method to fully automate the peering partner selection
process, thus transitioning to a more efficient and optimized Internet
ecosystem.

*Maria Risques,Kratika Bhagtani,Amit Kumar Singh Yadav,Edward J. Delp*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First large-scale Spanish dataset (HISPASpoof) for synthetic speech detection and attribution, addressing the gap in Spanish speech forensics where existing English-trained detectors fail to generalize.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spanish is spoken by over 600 million people but remains underrepresented in speech forensics research, while zero-shot voice cloning and TTS technologies pose serious misuse concerns that need detection capabilities.

Method: Created HISPASpoof dataset with real speech from public corpora across six Spanish accents and synthetic speech generated using six zero-shot TTS systems. Evaluated five representative detection methods.

Result: Detectors trained on English failed to generalize to Spanish, but training on HISPASpoof substantially improved detection performance. Also evaluated synthetic speech attribution (identifying generation method).

Conclusion: HISPASpoof provides a critical benchmark for advancing reliable and inclusive speech forensics in Spanish, addressing the significant gap in Spanish-language synthetic speech detection capabilities.

Abstract: Zero-shot Voice Cloning (VC) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) methods have advanced
rapidly, enabling the generation of highly realistic synthetic speech and
raising serious concerns about their misuse. While numerous detectors have been
developed for English and Chinese, Spanish-spoken by over 600 million people
worldwide-remains underrepresented in speech forensics. To address this gap, we
introduce HISPASpoof, the first large-scale Spanish dataset designed for
synthetic speech detection and attribution. It includes real speech from public
corpora across six accents and synthetic speech generated with six zero-shot
TTS systems. We evaluate five representative methods, showing that detectors
trained on English fail to generalize to Spanish, while training on HISPASpoof
substantially improves detection. We also evaluate synthetic speech attribution
performance on HISPASpoof, i.e., identifying the generation method of synthetic
speech. HISPASpoof thus provides a critical benchmark for advancing reliable
and inclusive speech forensics in Spanish.

*Omar Erak,Omar Alhussein,Hatem Abou-Zeid,Mehdi Bennis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Training-free adaptive token merging for vision transformers in semantic communication systems, using Bayesian optimization to balance accuracy and computational efficiency across varying channel conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large transformer models are powerful for semantic communication but computationally intensive, making deployment challenging in resource-constrained 6G networks.

Method: Formulate token merging as multi-objective optimization problem, use Gaussian process-based Bayesian optimization to find Pareto-optimal configurations for adaptive per-layer merging proportions.

Result: Outperforms other baselines, achieves significant FLOPs reduction while maintaining competitive accuracy across various SNR conditions, enables adaptive trade-offs between latency and semantic fidelity.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable and efficient approach for deploying transformer-based semantic communication in future edge intelligence systems with flexible runtime adaptation.

Abstract: Large-scale transformer models have emerged as a powerful tool for semantic
communication systems, enabling edge devices to extract rich representations
for robust inference across noisy wireless channels. However, their substantial
computational demands remain a major barrier to practical deployment in
resource-constrained 6G networks. In this paper, we present a training-free
framework for adaptive token merging in pretrained vision transformers to
jointly reduce inference time and transmission resource usage. We formulate the
selection of per-layer merging proportions as a multi-objective optimization
problem to balance accuracy and computational cost. We employ Gaussian
process-based Bayesian optimization to construct a Pareto frontier of optimal
configurations, enabling flexible runtime adaptation to dynamic application
requirements and channel conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms other baselines and achieves significant
reductions in floating-point operations while maintaining competitive accuracy
across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Additional
results highlight the effectiveness of adaptive policies that adjust merging
aggressiveness in response to channel quality, providing a practical mechanism
to trade off latency and semantic fidelity on demand. These findings establish
a scalable and efficient approach for deploying transformer-based semantic
communication in future edge intelligence systems.

Abstract: The convergence of quantum-inspired neural networks and deep reinforcement
learning offers a promising avenue for financial trading. We implemented a

*Hanyi Mao,Quanjia Xiao,Lei Pang,Haixiao Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FSPO is a sequence-level RL method for LLMs that addresses length bias in PPO/GRPO-style clipping by introducing length-fair clipping in IS weight space with a √L-scaled band.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard sequence-level RL methods like PPO/GRPO exhibit length bias where fixed clip ranges systematically reweight short vs long responses, distorting the optimization objective.

Method: Proposes FSPO which clips sequence log-IS ratios using a Gaussian-motivated band that applies KL-corrected drift and scales as √L to ensure length fairness.

Result: FSPO flattens clip rates across length bins, stabilizes training, and outperforms all baselines across multiple evaluation datasets.

Conclusion: FSPO successfully addresses length fairness in sequence-level RL through theoretically-grounded clipping that maintains directional alignment between clipped and true updates.

Abstract: We propose FSPO (Fair Sequence Policy Optimization), a sequence-level
reinforcement learning method for LLMs that enforces length-fair clipping
directly in the importance-sampling (IS) weight space. We revisit
sequence-level RL methods and identify a mismatch when PPO/GRPO-style clipping
is transplanted to sequences: a fixed clip range systematically reweights short
vs. long responses, distorting the effective objective. Theoretically, we
formalize length fairness via a Length Reweighting Error (LRE) and prove that
small LRE yields a directional cosine guarantee between the clipped and true
updates. FSPO introduces a simple, Gaussian-motivated remedy: we clip the
sequence log-IS ratio with a band that applies a KL-corrected drift term and
scales as $\sqrt{L}$. Empirically, FSPO flattens clip rates across length bins,
stabilizes training, and outperforms all baselines across multiple evaluation
datasets.

*Md Tanveer Hossain Munim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Current weather model metrics create a "Statistical Similarity Trap" that rewards blurry predictions but misses rare extreme events. DART framework addresses this with dual-decoder architecture for high-resolution convection detection, showing significant improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional evaluation metrics for deep learning weather models fail to detect rare, high-impact extreme weather events while rewarding statistically similar but blurry predictions, creating a dangerous gap in extreme weather preparedness.

Method: DART (Dual Architecture for Regression Tasks) uses dual-decoder architecture with explicit background/extreme decomposition, physically motivated oversampling, and task-specific loss functions to transform coarse forecasts into high-resolution satellite data optimized for extreme convection detection.

Result: DART achieves CSI = 0.273 with bias = 2.52 vs. 6.72 for baselines at equivalent CSI, improves extreme convection detection by 270% by removing Integrated Water Vapor Transport, and validates on real-world cases like the August 2023 Chittagong flooding disaster.

Conclusion: DART successfully addresses the hybrid conversion-segmentation-downscaling task for extreme weather detection, provides operational flexibility through beta-tuning, trains quickly on standard hardware, and integrates with existing meteorological workflows for trustworthy AI in extreme weather preparedness.

Abstract: Current evaluation metrics for deep learning weather models create a
"Statistical Similarity Trap", rewarding blurry predictions while missing rare,
high-impact events. We provide quantitative evidence of this trap, showing
sophisticated baselines achieve 97.9% correlation yet 0.00 CSI for dangerous
convection detection. We introduce DART (Dual Architecture for Regression
Tasks), a framework addressing the challenge of transforming coarse atmospheric
forecasts into high-resolution satellite brightness temperature fields
optimized for extreme convection detection (below 220 K). DART employs
dual-decoder architecture with explicit background/extreme decomposition,
physically motivated oversampling, and task-specific loss functions. We present
four key findings: (1) empirical validation of the Statistical Similarity Trap
across multiple sophisticated baselines; (2) the "IVT Paradox", removing
Integrated Water Vapor Transport, widely regarded as essential for atmospheric
river analysis, improves extreme convection detection by 270%; (3)
architectural necessity demonstrated through operational flexibility (DART
achieves CSI = 0.273 with bias = 2.52 vs. 6.72 for baselines at equivalent
CSI), and (4) real-world validation with the August 2023 Chittagong flooding
disaster as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
systematically address this hybrid conversion-segmentation-downscaling task,
with no direct prior benchmarks identified in existing literature. Our
validation against diverse statistical and deep learning baselines sufficiently
demonstrates DART's specialized design. The framework enables precise
operational calibration through beta-tuning, trains in under 10 minutes on
standard hardware, and integrates seamlessly with existing meteorological
workflows, demonstrating a pathway toward trustworthy AI for extreme weather
preparedness.

TL;DR: IP3O algorithm integrates adaptive incentives and progressive penalties to stabilize constrained RL training near constraint boundaries, outperforming state-of-the-art safe RL methods with theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Constrained RL faces challenges in balancing reward maximization with constraint satisfaction, particularly instability near constraint boundaries that leads to suboptimal performance in continuous control settings.

Method: Proposes Incrementally Penalized Proximal Policy Optimization (IP3O) that uses adaptive incentive mechanism and progressively increasing penalties to stabilize training dynamics before approaching constraint boundaries.

Result: Empirical evaluation on benchmark environments demonstrates IP3O's efficacy compared to state-of-the-art Safe RL algorithms, with improved stability and performance near constraint boundaries.

Conclusion: IP3O provides a practical solution with theoretical guarantees for constrained RL, effectively addressing training instability issues while maintaining constraint satisfaction in continuous control tasks.

Abstract: Constrained Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to maximize the return while
adhering to predefined constraint limits, which represent domain-specific
safety requirements. In continuous control settings, where learning agents
govern system actions, balancing the trade-off between reward maximization and
constraint satisfaction remains a significant challenge. Policy optimization
methods often exhibit instability near constraint boundaries, resulting in
suboptimal training performance. To address this issue, we introduce a novel
approach that integrates an adaptive incentive mechanism in addition to the
reward structure to stay within the constraint bound before approaching the
constraint boundary. Building on this insight, we propose Incrementally
Penalized Proximal Policy Optimization (IP3O), a practical algorithm that
enforces a progressively increasing penalty to stabilize training dynamics.
Through empirical evaluation on benchmark environments, we demonstrate the
efficacy of IP3O compared to the performance of state-of-the-art Safe RL
algorithms. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees by deriving a bound
on the worst-case error of the optimality achieved by our algorithm.

TL;DR: Study identifies key indicators for agro-tourism growth using machine learning feature selection methods, with LASSO combined with Logistic Regression achieving up to 99% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agro-tourism is a strategic economic model for rural development and cultural conservation, requiring detailed study of growth strategies to support this booming tourism subdomain.

Method: Two-phase study: comprehensive literature review to identify indicators, then machine learning feature selection techniques (LASSO with classifiers including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost) applied to determine important growth indicators.

Result: LASSO with Logistic Regression achieved highest classification accuracy: 98% in 70-30% train-test split and 99% in 80-20% split. Other models (Random Forest, Decision Trees, XGBoost) showed 95-97% accuracy.

Conclusion: Machine learning feature selection methods, particularly LASSO combined with Logistic Regression, effectively identify key indicators for agro-tourism growth with high accuracy, providing valuable insights for strategic development.

Abstract: Agro-tourism serves as a strategic economic model designed to facilitate
rural development by diversifying income streams for local communities like
farmers while promoting the conservation of indigenous cultural heritage and
traditional agricultural practices. As a very booming subdomain of tourism,
there is a need to study the strategies for the growth of Agro-tourism in
detail. The current study has identified the important indicators for the
growth and enhancement of agro-tourism. The study is conducted in two phases:
identification of the important indicators through a comprehensive literature
review and in the second phase state-of-the-art techniques were used to
identify the important indicators for the growth of agro-tourism. The
indicators are also called features synonymously, the machine learning models
for feature selection were applied and it was observed that the Least Absolute
Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method combined with, the machine
Learning Classifiers such as Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Trees (DT),
Random Forest (RF) Tree, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBOOST) models were
used to suggest the growth of the agro-tourism. The results show that with the
LASSO method, LR model gives the highest classification accuracy of 98% in
70-30% train-test data followed by RF with 95% accuracy. Similarly, in the
80-20% train-test data LR maintains the highest accuracy at 99%, while DT and
XGBoost follow with 97% accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Vejde framework combines data abstraction, graph neural networks, and reinforcement learning to create inductive policy functions for decision problems with structured states, enabling generalization to unseen problem instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address decision problems with richly structured states (object classes and relations) and create policies that can generalize across problem instances of varying size and structure.

Method: Represents MDP states as databases of facts, converts states to bipartite graphs, uses neural message passing for latent state mapping, and employs both supervised and reinforcement learning for policy training.

Result: Vejde agents generalized well to unseen test instances without significant performance loss, achieving scores close to instance-specific MLP agents across eight problem domains.

Conclusion: The framework successfully produces inductive policies that handle varying problem sizes and structures while maintaining competitive performance compared to specialized agents.

Abstract: We present and evaluate Vejde; a framework which combines data abstraction,
graph neural networks and reinforcement learning to produce inductive policy
functions for decision problems with richly structured states, such as object
classes and relations. MDP states are represented as data bases of facts about
entities, and Vejde converts each state to a bipartite graph, which is mapped
to latent states through neural message passing. The factored representation of
both states and actions allows Vejde agents to handle problems of varying size
and structure. We tested Vejde agents on eight problem domains defined in RDDL,
with ten problem instances each, where policies were trained using both
supervised and reinforcement learning. To test policy generalization, we
separate problem instances in two sets, one for training and the other solely
for testing. Test results on unseen instances for the Vejde agents were
compared to MLP agents trained on each problem instance, as well as the online
planning algorithm Prost. Our results show that Vejde policies in average
generalize to the test instances without a significant loss in score.
Additionally, the inductive agents received scores on unseen test instances
that on average were close to the instance-specific MLP agents.

### [169] [Constructing a Question-Answering Simulator through the Distillation of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09226)
*Haipeng Liu,Ting Long,Jing Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LDSim is a novel QA simulator that distills LLM knowledge to improve prediction accuracy while maintaining fast inference speed, outperforming both traditional sequential models and direct LLM methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: QA simulators help educational recommender systems collect training data without harming real students, but existing methods face trade-offs between performance (LLM-based) and efficiency (LLM-free).

Method: Proposes LLM Distillation based Simulator (LDSim) that distills domain knowledge and reasoning capability from LLMs to enhance prediction performance while avoiding high computational costs.

Result: Extensive experiments show LDSim achieves strong results on both simulation tasks and knowledge tracing tasks, demonstrating improved performance over existing methods.

Conclusion: LDSim successfully bridges the gap between performance and efficiency in QA simulators by leveraging LLM distillation, making it suitable for practical educational applications.

Abstract: The question-answering (QA) simulator is a model that mimics real student
learning behaviors and predicts their correctness of their responses to
questions. QA simulators enable educational recommender systems (ERS) to
collect large amounts of training data without interacting with real students,
thereby preventing harmful recommendations made by an undertrained ERS from
undermining actual student learning. Given the QA history, there are two
categories of solutions to predict the correctness, conducting the simulation:
(1) LLM-free methods, which apply a traditional sequential model to transfer
the QA history into a vector representation first, and make predictions based
on the representation; (2) LLM-based methods, which leverage the domain
knowledge and reasoning capability of LLM to enhence the prediction. LLM-free
methods offer fast inference but generally yield suboptimal performance. In
contrast, most LLM-based methods achieve better results, but at the cost of
slower inference speed and higher GPU memory consumption. In this paper, we
propose a method named LLM Distillation based Simulator (LDSim), which distills
domain knowledge and reasoning capability from an LLM to better assist
prediction, thereby improving simulation performance. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our LDSim achieves strong results on both the simulation task
and the knowledge tracing (KT) task. Our code is publicly available at

*Hanyang Wang,Yuxuan Yang,Hongjun Wang,Lihui Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes MMT-FD method for few-shot unsupervised fault diagnosis of rotating machinery, achieving 99% accuracy with only 1% labeled data through time-frequency encoding and meta-learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges of limited labeled fault samples and lack of model generalizability across different rotating mechanical equipment types in industrial applications.

Method: Integrates time-frequency domain encoder with meta-learning generalization model, using random augmentations for representation learning and contrastive learning for optimization.

Result: Achieves 99% fault diagnosis accuracy with only 1% of labeled sample data, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities on bearing and rotor test datasets.

Conclusion: MMT-FD framework provides efficient and generalizable solution for few-shot unsupervised fault diagnosis in rotating machinery with minimal labeled data requirements.

Abstract: The intelligent fault diagnosis of rotating mechanical equipment usually
requires a large amount of labeled sample data. However, in practical
industrial applications, acquiring enough data is both challenging and
expensive in terms of time and cost. Moreover, different types of rotating
mechanical equipment with different unique mechanical properties, require
separate training of diagnostic models for each case. To address the challenges
of limited fault samples and the lack of generalizability in prediction models
for practical engineering applications, we propose a Multi-Attention Meta
Transformer method for few-shot unsupervised rotating machinery fault diagnosis
(MMT-FD). This framework extracts potential fault representations from
unlabeled data and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, making it
suitable for diagnosing faults across various types of mechanical equipment.
The MMT-FD framework integrates a time-frequency domain encoder and a
meta-learning generalization model. The time-frequency domain encoder predicts
status representations generated through random augmentations in the
time-frequency domain. These enhanced data are then fed into a meta-learning
network for classification and generalization training, followed by fine-tuning
using a limited amount of labeled data. The model is iteratively optimized
using a small number of contrastive learning iterations, resulting in high
efficiency. To validate the framework, we conducted experiments on a bearing
fault dataset and rotor test bench data. The results demonstrate that the
MMT-FD model achieves 99\% fault diagnosis accuracy with only 1\% of labeled
sample data, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EMPG addresses LLM policy gradient issues by modulating updates based on action confidence and task outcomes, achieving better performance in long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents struggle with sparse rewards in long-horizon tasks, and traditional policy gradients have inefficient learning dynamics where update magnitudes are coupled with entropy, leading to unstable learning.

Method: Proposes Entropy-Modulated Policy Gradients (EMPG) that recalibrates learning signals using step-wise uncertainty and final outcomes, amplifies confident correct actions, penalizes confident errors, and adds future clarity bonus.

Result: EMPG achieves substantial performance gains and significantly outperforms strong policy gradient baselines on WebShop, ALFWorld, and Deep Search tasks.

Conclusion: EMPG effectively resolves the fundamental learning dynamics problem in LLMs by modulating policy gradients based on uncertainty, leading to more stable and efficient learning in long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: In long-horizon tasks, recent agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs)
face a significant challenge that sparse, outcome-based rewards make it
difficult to assign credit to intermediate steps. Previous methods mainly focus
on creating dense reward signals to guide learning, either through traditional
reinforcement learning techniques like inverse reinforcement learning or by
using Process Reward Models for step-by-step feedback. In this paper, we
identify a fundamental problem in the learning dynamics of LLMs: the magnitude
of policy gradients is inherently coupled with the entropy, which leads to
inefficient small updates for confident correct actions and potentially
destabilizes large updates for uncertain ones. To resolve this, we propose
Entropy-Modulated Policy Gradients (EMPG), a framework that re-calibrates the
learning signal based on step-wise uncertainty and the final task outcome. EMPG
amplifies updates for confident correct actions, penalizes confident errors,
and attenuates updates from uncertain steps to stabilize exploration. We
further introduce a bonus term for future clarity that encourages agents to
find more predictable solution paths. Through comprehensive experiments on
three challenging agent tasks, WebShop, ALFWorld, and Deep Search, we
demonstrate that EMPG achieves substantial performance gains and significantly
outperforms strong policy gradient baselines. Project page is at

TL;DR: Proposes DRSALife framework to learn Soft Artificial Life rulesets from data for reaction-diffusion systems without prior physics knowledge, achieving 74% accuracy in predicting emergent dynamics with robustness to noise and sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of system identification for reaction-diffusion systems when there is no prior knowledge of underlying physics, particularly for emergent dynamics studied across neuroscience, ecology, and epidemiology.

Method: Uses Data-driven Rulesets for Soft Artificial Life (DRSALife) model to learn Soft ALife rulesets (Agent-based and Cellular Automata models) from observed data, testing on Elementary CA Rule 30, Game of Life, and Vicsek Flocking problems.

Result: Achieves 74% accuracy in predicting emergent dynamics, demonstrates robust performance against Gaussian noise and temporal sparsity, and successfully identifies structure and parameters of underlying PDEs.

Conclusion: DRSALife framework effectively learns Soft ALife rulesets for reaction-diffusion systems without prior physics knowledge, showing promising results for data-driven discovery of emergent dynamics with practical applicability to noisy and sparse datasets.

Abstract: Data-driven discovery of emergent dynamics is gaining popularity,
particularly in the context of reaction-diffusion systems. These systems are
widely studied across various fields, including neuroscience, ecology,
epidemiology, and several other subject areas that deal with emergent dynamics.
A current challenge in the discovery process relates to system identification
when there is no prior knowledge of the underlying physics. We attempt to
address this challenge by learning Soft Artificial Life (Soft ALife) models,
such as Agent-based and Cellular Automata (CA) models, from observed data for
reaction-diffusion systems. In this paper, we present findings on the
applicability of a conceptual framework, the Data-driven Rulesets for Soft
Artificial Life (DRSALife) model, to learn Soft ALife rulesets that accurately
represent emergent dynamics in a reaction-diffusion system from observed data.
This model has demonstrated promising results for Elementary CA Rule 30, Game
of Life, and Vicsek Flocking problems in recent work. To our knowledge, this is
one of the few studies that explore machine-based Soft ALife ruleset learning
and system identification for reaction-diffusion dynamics without any prior
knowledge of the underlying physics. Moreover, we provide comprehensive
findings from experiments investigating the potential effects of using noisy
and sparse observed datasets on learning emergent dynamics. Additionally, we
successfully identify the structure and parameters of the underlying partial
differential equations (PDEs) representing these dynamics. Experimental results
demonstrate that the learned models are able to predict the emergent dynamics
with good accuracy (74%) and exhibit quite robust performance when subjected to
Gaussian noise and temporal sparsity.

TL;DR: MoSE framework enhances GNN expressiveness by using mixture of subgraph experts to capture diverse high-order patterns, overcoming limitations of traditional message passing and fixed kernel methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional GNNs rely on local pairwise message passing, which limits their ability to capture complex subgraph patterns. Existing random walk kernel methods are designed for graph-level tasks and lack flexibility for diverse downstream applications.

Method: Proposes Mixture of Subgraph Experts (MoSE) framework that extracts informative subgraphs via anonymous walks and dynamically routes them to specialized experts based on structural semantics.

Result: MoSE demonstrates superior performance over competitive baselines, provides theoretical proof of being more powerful than Subgraph Weisfeiler-Lehman Test, and offers interpretable insights through learned subgraph experts visualization.

Conclusion: MoSE provides a flexible and expressive subgraph-based representation learning framework that captures diverse structural patterns with improved interpretability across various graph tasks.

Abstract: While graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in learning
from graph-structured data, their reliance on local, pairwise message passing
restricts their ability to capture complex, high-order subgraph patterns.
leading to insufficient structural expressiveness. Recent efforts have
attempted to enhance structural expressiveness by integrating random walk
kernels into GNNs. However, these methods are inherently designed for
graph-level tasks, which limits their applicability to other downstream tasks
such as node classification. Moreover, their fixed kernel configurations hinder
the model's flexibility in capturing diverse subgraph structures. To address
these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Mixture of Subgraph Experts
(MoSE) framework for flexible and expressive subgraph-based representation
learning across diverse graph tasks. Specifically, MoSE extracts informative
subgraphs via anonymous walks and dynamically routes them to specialized
experts based on structural semantics, enabling the model to capture diverse
subgraph patterns with improved flexibility and interpretability. We further
provide a theoretical analysis of MoSE's expressivity within the Subgraph
Weisfeiler-Lehman (SWL) Test, proving that it is more powerful than SWL.
Extensive experiments, together with visualizations of learned subgraph
experts, demonstrate that MoSE not only outperforms competitive baselines but
also provides interpretable insights into structural patterns learned by the
model.

TL;DR: Novel robust computational approach for HGR correlation coefficient using configurable polynomial kernels, offering improved reliability for real-world applications like constrained machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HGR estimation methods suffer from bias-variance trade-offs due to inherent uncomputability, compromising robustness in real-world scenarios like algorithmic fairness and causal discovery.

Method: Proposes a computational approach based on user-configurable polynomial kernels that provides greater robustness and faster yet effective restriction compared to previous methods.

Result: The method offers significant advantages in robustness and determinism, with experimental validation showing it produces insightful subgradients suitable as loss regularizers in constrained ML frameworks.

Conclusion: This approach provides a more reliable and robust option for HGR computation in real-world applications, addressing technical concerns of previous methods while maintaining effectiveness.

Abstract: The Hirschfeld-Gebelein-R\'enyi (HGR) correlation coefficient is an extension
of Pearson's correlation that is not limited to linear correlations, with
potential applications in algorithmic fairness, scientific analysis, and causal
discovery. Recently, novel algorithms to estimate HGR in a differentiable
manner have been proposed to facilitate its use as a loss regularizer in
constrained machine learning applications. However, the inherent
uncomputability of HGR requires a bias-variance trade-off, which can possibly
compromise the robustness of the proposed methods, hence raising technical
concerns if applied in real-world scenarios. We introduce a novel computational
approach for HGR that relies on user-configurable polynomial kernels, offering
greater robustness compared to previous methods and featuring a faster yet
almost equally effective restriction. Our approach provides significant
advantages in terms of robustness and determinism, making it a more reliable
option for real-world applications. Moreover, we present a brief experimental
analysis to validate the applicability of our approach within a constrained
machine learning framework, showing that its computation yields an insightful
subgradient that can serve as a loss regularizer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AutoML and LLM-based approaches for model/hyperparameter selection rely on expensive trial-and-error methods and APIs, offering limited interpretability and generalizability.

Method: Leverages historical experiment outcomes with SHAP explanations, employs meta-learning and efficient LLM reasoning for zero-shot hyperparameter recommendations, and uses LLM-as-judge evaluation for output control.

Result: Achieves competitive/superior performance to traditional HPO methods, optimal results on 5 of 8 medical imaging tasks, 99.6-99.9% response time reduction, and 2.4-15.7x faster training times while maintaining accuracy within 1-5% of best baselines.

Conclusion: MetaLLMiX provides an efficient, interpretable, and cost-effective alternative to traditional hyperparameter optimization methods, enabling high-performance model selection without expensive computational trials.

Abstract: Effective model and hyperparameter selection remains a major challenge in
deep learning, often requiring extensive expertise and computation. While
AutoML and large language models (LLMs) promise automation, current LLM-based
approaches rely on trial and error and expensive APIs, which provide limited
interpretability and generalizability. We propose MetaLLMiX, a zero-shot
hyperparameter optimization framework combining meta-learning, explainable AI,
and efficient LLM reasoning. By leveraging historical experiment outcomes with
SHAP explanations, MetaLLMiX recommends optimal hyperparameters and pretrained
models without additional trials. We further employ an LLM-as-judge evaluation
to control output format, accuracy, and completeness. Experiments on eight
medical imaging datasets using nine open-source lightweight LLMs show that
MetaLLMiX achieves competitive or superior performance to traditional HPO
methods while drastically reducing computational cost. Our local deployment
outperforms prior API-based approaches, achieving optimal results on 5 of 8
tasks, response time reductions of 99.6-99.9%, and the fastest training times
on 6 datasets (2.4-15.7x faster), maintaining accuracy within 1-5% of
best-performing baselines.

*Harry Mayne,Ryan Othniel Kearns,Yushi Yang,Andrew M. Bean,Eoin Delaney,Chris Russell,Adam Mahdi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs can generate valid counterfactual explanations but struggle with minimality - they either make excessive edits or overly minimal ones that don't change predictions, creating unreliable self-explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable effective human-AI collaboration, language models need to explain their decisions in natural language through self-generated counterfactual explanations.

Method: The study evaluates whether LLMs can produce self-generated counterfactual explanations (SCEs) that are both valid (achieve intended outcome) and minimal (modify input only as necessary).

Result: LLMs typically produce valid SCEs but they are far from minimal, offering little insight. When asked for minimal counterfactuals, they make excessively small edits that fail to change predictions.

Conclusion: SCEs are an ineffective explainability tool that can provide misleading insights, and proposals to deploy LLMs in high-stakes settings must consider the impact of unreliable self-explanations.

Abstract: To collaborate effectively with humans, language models must be able to
explain their decisions in natural language. We study a specific type of
self-explanation: self-generated counterfactual explanations (SCEs), where a
model explains its prediction by modifying the input such that it would have
predicted a different outcome. We evaluate whether LLMs can produce SCEs that
are valid, achieving the intended outcome, and minimal, modifying the input no
more than necessary. When asked to generate counterfactuals, we find that LLMs
typically produce SCEs that are valid, but far from minimal, offering little
insight into their decision-making behaviour. Worryingly, when asked to
generate minimal counterfactuals, LLMs typically make excessively small edits
that fail to change predictions. The observed validity-minimality trade-off is
consistent across several LLMs, datasets, and evaluation settings. Our findings
suggest that SCEs are, at best, an ineffective explainability tool and, at
worst, can provide misleading insights into model behaviour. Proposals to
deploy LLMs in high-stakes settings must consider the impact of unreliable
self-explanations on downstream decision-making. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid framework combining machine learning and geostatistics using spatial lag features from kriging to improve soil property predictions in precision agriculture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between machine learning (which captures feature relationships) and geostatistics (which leverages spatial structure) for more accurate digital soil mapping.

Method: Kriging prior regression (KpR) - enriches ML with spatial context through engineering of 'spatial lag' features from ordinary kriging, using TabPFN model on six field-scale datasets with soil properties and sensing features.

Result: KpR with TabPFN demonstrated reliable uncertainty estimates and 30% average R2 improvement over non-spatial ML algorithms, outperforming both spatial techniques and established ML methods.

Conclusion: KpR with TabPFN is a robust and versatile modeling framework for digital soil mapping in precision agriculture, particularly effective for small sample sizes and limited sensing data scenarios.

Abstract: Machine learning and geostatistics are two fundamentally different frameworks
for predicting and spatially mapping soil properties. Geostatistics leverages
the spatial structure of soil properties, while machine learning captures the
relationship between available environmental features and soil properties. We
propose a hybrid framework that enriches ML with spatial context through
engineering of 'spatial lag' features from ordinary kriging. We call this
approach 'kriging prior regression' (KpR), as it follows the inverse logic of
regression kriging. To evaluate this approach, we assessed both the point and
probabilistic prediction performance of KpR, using the TabPFN model across six
fieldscale datasets from LimeSoDa. These datasets included soil organic carbon,
clay content, and pH, along with features derived from remote sensing and
in-situ proximal soil sensing. KpR with TabPFN demonstrated reliable
uncertainty estimates and more accurate predictions in comparison to several
other spatial techniques (e.g., regression/residual kriging with TabPFN), as
well as to established non-spatial machine learning algorithms (e.g., random
forest). Most notably, it significantly improved the average R2 by around 30%
compared to machine learning algorithms without spatial context. This
improvement was due to the strong prediction performance of the TabPFN
algorithm itself and the complementary spatial information provided by KpR
features. TabPFN is particularly effective for prediction tasks with small
sample sizes, common in precision agriculture, whereas KpR can compensate for
weak relationships between sensing features and soil properties when proximal
soil sensing data are limited. Hence, we conclude that KpR with TabPFN is a
very robust and versatile modelling framework for digital soil mapping in
precision agriculture.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes fuser algorithm for microbiome network inference that handles spatial/temporal dynamics, outperforming existing methods in cross-environment scenarios while maintaining performance in homogeneous environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing co-occurrence network algorithms analyze single environments and capture static snapshots, failing to account for how microbial associations adapt to varying ecological conditions across different niches.

Method: Developed Same-All Cross-validation (SAC) framework and fuser algorithm that retains subsample-specific signals while sharing relevant information across environments, generating distinct environment-specific predictive networks.

Result: fuser achieves comparable performance to glmnet in homogeneous environments and significantly reduces test error in cross-environment scenarios compared to baseline algorithms.

Conclusion: The fuser algorithm effectively addresses limitations of conventional microbiome network inference methods by capturing dynamic microbial associations across different environmental conditions, providing more accurate environment-specific predictive networks.

Abstract: Co-occurrence network inference algorithms have significantly advanced our
understanding of microbiome communities. However, these algorithms typically
analyze microbial associations within samples collected from a single
environmental niche, often capturing only static snapshots rather than dynamic
microbial processes. Previous studies have commonly grouped samples from
different environmental niches together without fully considering how microbial
communities adapt their associations when faced with varying ecological
conditions. Our study addresses this limitation by explicitly investigating
both spatial and temporal dynamics of microbial communities. We analyzed
publicly available microbiome abundance data across multiple locations and time
points, to evaluate algorithm performance in predicting microbial associations
using our proposed Same-All Cross-validation (SAC) framework. SAC evaluates
algorithms in two distinct scenarios: training and testing within the same
environmental niche (Same), and training and testing on combined data from
multiple environmental niches (All). To overcome the limitations of
conventional algorithms, we propose fuser, an algorithm that, while not
entirely new in machine learning, is novel for microbiome community network
inference. It retains subsample-specific signals while simultaneously sharing
relevant information across environments during training. Unlike standard
approaches that infer a single generalized network from combined data, fuser
generates distinct, environment-specific predictive networks. Our results
demonstrate that fuser achieves comparable predictive performance to existing
algorithms such as glmnet when evaluated within homogeneous environments
(Same), and notably reduces test error compared to baseline algorithms in
cross-environment (All) scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph diffusion models have limited effectiveness in multi-conditional molecular generation due to reliance on joint conditioning or continuous relaxations that compromise fidelity.

Method: Extends score matching to discrete graphs via concrete scores, introduces Composable Guidance (CoG) for fine-grained control over condition subsets, and Probability Calibration (PC) to mitigate train-test mismatches.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four molecular datasets with 15.3% average improvement in controllability over prior methods while maintaining high validity and distributional fidelity.

Conclusion: Score-based modeling provides practical advantages for discrete graph generation and enables flexible, multi-property molecular design with superior controllability.

Abstract: Controllable molecular graph generation is essential for material and drug
discovery, where generated molecules must satisfy diverse property constraints.
While recent advances in graph diffusion models have improved generation
quality, their effectiveness in multi-conditional settings remains limited due
to reliance on joint conditioning or continuous relaxations that compromise
fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose Composable Score-based Graph
Diffusion model (CSGD), the first model that extends score matching to discrete
graphs via concrete scores, enabling flexible and principled manipulation of
conditional guidance. Building on this foundation, we introduce two score-based
techniques: Composable Guidance (CoG), which allows fine-grained control over
arbitrary subsets of conditions during sampling, and Probability Calibration
(PC), which adjusts estimated transition probabilities to mitigate train-test
mismatches. Empirical results on four molecular datasets show that CSGD
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 15.3% average improvement in
controllability over prior methods, while maintaining high validity and
distributional fidelity. Our findings highlight the practical advantages of
score-based modeling for discrete graph generation and its capacity for
flexible, multi-property molecular design.

TL;DR: AquaCast is a multi-input deep learning model for urban water forecasting that captures dependencies between endogenous variables (water measurements) and exogenous factors (weather data) using an embedding layer, achieving state-of-the-art performance on real and synthetic datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of forecasting urban water dynamics by incorporating both internal water measurements and external weather factors while eliminating the need to forecast exogenous variables, improving accuracy and efficiency.

Method: Developed a multi-input, multi-output deep learning model with embedding layer for exogenous inputs, evaluated on LausanneCity dataset with 4 sensors and three large-scale synthetic datasets (MeteoSwiss, Lorenz Attractors, Random Fields) across 100 nodes.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance using only endogenous variables, with further improvements when including exogenous variables and forecast reports. Consistently outperformed existing baselines across both real and synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: AquaCast provides robust and accurate urban water forecasting by effectively capturing inter-variable and temporal dependencies while focusing solely on endogenous variable prediction, demonstrating strong generalization and scalability capabilities.

Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of forecasting urban water dynamics by
developing a multi-input, multi-output deep learning model that incorporates
both endogenous variables (e.g., water height or discharge) and exogenous
factors (e.g., precipitation history and forecast reports). Unlike conventional
forecasting, the proposed model, AquaCast, captures both inter-variable and
temporal dependencies across all inputs, while focusing forecast solely on
endogenous variables. Exogenous inputs are fused via an embedding layer,
eliminating the need to forecast them and enabling the model to attend to their
short-term influences more effectively. We evaluate our approach on the
LausanneCity dataset, which includes measurements from four urban drainage
sensors, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance when using only
endogenous variables. Performance also improves with the inclusion of exogenous
variables and forecast reports. To assess generalization and scalability, we
additionally test the model on three large-scale synthesized datasets,
generated from MeteoSwiss records, the Lorenz Attractors model, and the Random
Fields model, each representing a different level of temporal complexity across
100 nodes. The results confirm that our model consistently outperforms existing
baselines and maintains a robust and accurate forecast across both real and
synthetic datasets.

TL;DR: D2P2-SGD optimizer combines dynamic differential privacy with automatic gradient clipping and random projection to improve privacy-utility tradeoff in stochastic optimization while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DPSGD has static noise that impacts model performance, and increasing model parameters make efficient learning challenging while maintaining privacy against gradient leakage.

Method: Combines dynamic differential privacy (DDP) with automatic gradient clipping and random projection with SGD, allowing dynamic adjustment of privacy-utility tradeoff.

Result: Exhibits provably sub-linear convergence rates across different objective functions, matching best available rates. Extensive experiments show enhanced accuracy while maintaining privacy.

Conclusion: D2P2-SGD provides better utility at the cost of privacy through DDP and enables more efficient model learning through random projection, addressing key limitations of existing private optimization methods.

Abstract: Stochastic optimization is a pivotal enabler in modern machine learning,
producing effective models for various tasks. However, several existing works
have shown that model parameters and gradient information are susceptible to
privacy leakage. Although Differentially Private SGD (DPSGD) addresses privacy
concerns, its static noise mechanism impacts the error bounds for model
performance. Additionally, with the exponential increase in model parameters,
efficient learning of these models using stochastic optimizers has become more
challenging. To address these concerns, we introduce the Dynamically
Differentially Private Projected SGD (D2P2-SGD) optimizer. In D2P2-SGD, we
combine two important ideas: (i) dynamic differential privacy (DDP) with
automatic gradient clipping and (ii) random projection with SGD, allowing
dynamic adjustment of the tradeoff between utility and privacy of the model. It
exhibits provably sub-linear convergence rates across different objective
functions, matching the best available rate. The theoretical analysis further
suggests that DDP leads to better utility at the cost of privacy, while random
projection enables more efficient model learning. Extensive experiments across
diverse datasets show that D2P2-SGD remarkably enhances accuracy while
maintaining privacy. Our code is available here.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PIPES addresses OpenML's limitations by creating a diverse collection of 9,408 pipelines across 300 datasets to support meta-learning research with comprehensive experimental results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OpenML repositories lack diversity in machine learning pipelines, particularly in preprocessing steps, and are imbalanced with focus on popular techniques, limiting their usefulness for algorithm selection research.

Method: Created PIPES - a collection of experiments with 9,408 pipelines applied to 300 datasets, representing all combinations of selected techniques to ensure diversity and completeness, including detailed performance metrics and error information.

Result: Built a comprehensive repository with detailed pipeline block information, training/testing times, predictions, performances, and error messages, enabling cross-analysis of diverse and representative pipelines and datasets.

Conclusion: PIPES overcomes OpenML's limitations by providing a more diverse and complete experimental database that supports meta-learning research and can be expanded with additional data for the community.

Abstract: Solutions to the Algorithm Selection Problem (ASP) in machine learning face
the challenge of high computational costs associated with evaluating various
algorithms' performances on a given dataset. To mitigate this cost, the
meta-learning field can leverage previously executed experiments shared in
online repositories such as OpenML. OpenML provides an extensive collection of
machine learning experiments. However, an analysis of OpenML's records reveals
limitations. It lacks diversity in pipelines, specifically when exploring data
preprocessing steps/blocks, such as scaling or imputation, resulting in limited
representation. Its experiments are often focused on a few popular techniques
within each pipeline block, leading to an imbalanced sample. To overcome the
observed limitations of OpenML, we propose PIPES, a collection of experiments
involving multiple pipelines designed to represent all combinations of the
selected sets of techniques, aiming at diversity and completeness. PIPES stores
the results of experiments performed applying 9,408 pipelines to 300 datasets.
It includes detailed information on the pipeline blocks, training and testing
times, predictions, performances, and the eventual error messages. This
comprehensive collection of results allows researchers to perform analyses
across diverse and representative pipelines and datasets. PIPES also offers
potential for expansion, as additional data and experiments can be incorporated
to support the meta-learning community further. The data, code, supplementary
material, and all experiments can be found at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Few-shot learning using Prototypical Networks achieves competitive accuracy (74.87% multi-class, >70% binary) for COVID-19/Flu/healthy cough sound classification with minimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of limited labeled medical data by investigating whether few-shot learning can achieve performance comparable to traditional deep learning approaches for respiratory sound classification.

Method: Leveraged Prototypical Networks with spectrogram representations of cough sounds, using only 15 support examples per class. Compared multi-class vs binary classification models for COVID-19, Flu, and healthy conditions.

Result: Achieved 74.87% accuracy in multi-class classification and over 70% accuracy in binary classification across all class pairs. Flu was most distinguishable, Healthy most challenging. No significant performance difference between binary and multi-class models (p=0.149, p=0.125).

Conclusion: Few-shot learning is viable for medical diagnostics when large labeled datasets are unavailable, with multi-class classification performing comparably to binary approaches for respiratory sound classification.

Abstract: This paper investigates the effectiveness of few-shot learning for
respiratory sound classification, focusing on coughbased detection of COVID-19,
Flu, and healthy conditions. We leverage Prototypical Networks with spectrogram
representations of cough sounds to address the challenge of limited labeled
data. Our study evaluates whether few-shot learning can enable models to
achieve performance comparable to traditional deep learning approaches while
using significantly fewer training samples. Additionally, we compare
multi-class and binary classification models to assess whether multi-class
models can perform comparably to their binary counterparts. Experimental
findings show that few-shot learning models can achieve competitive accuracy.
Our model attains 74.87% accuracy in multi-class classification with only 15
support examples per class, while binary classification achieves over 70%
accuracy across all class pairs. Class-wise analysis reveals Flu as the most
distinguishable class, and Healthy as the most challenging. Statistical tests
(paired t-test p = 0.149, Wilcoxon p = 0.125) indicate no significant
performance difference between binary and multiclass models, supporting the
viability of multi-class classification in this setting. These results
highlight the feasibility of applying few-shot learning in medical diagnostics,
particularly when large labeled datasets are unavailable.

*Sena Ergisi,Luis Maßny,Rawad Bitar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProDiGy is a Byzantine-robust federated learning algorithm that uses a dual scoring system based on gradient proximity and dissimilarity to detect adversarial attacks, particularly effective under non-IID data distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning is vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially in data heterogeneous environments where existing defense mechanisms often fail.

Method: Proposes a joint dual scoring system that evaluates client gradients based on both proximity (similarity to honest clients) and dissimilarity (detecting suspicious uniformity that indicates attacks).

Result: Extensive experiments show ProDiGy outperforms existing defenses, maintaining strong defense capabilities and model accuracy even when clients' data are non-IID and other defenses fail.

Conclusion: A dual perspective approach that promotes natural similarity among honest clients while detecting suspicious uniformity as attack indicators is highly effective for Byzantine-robust FL.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) emerged as a widely studied paradigm for distributed
learning. Despite its many advantages, FL remains vulnerable to adversarial
attacks, especially under data heterogeneity. We propose a new Byzantine-robust
FL algorithm called ProDiGy. The key novelty lies in evaluating the client
gradients using a joint dual scoring system based on the gradients' proximity
and dissimilarity. We demonstrate through extensive numerical experiments that
ProDiGy outperforms existing defenses in various scenarios. In particular, when
the clients' data do not follow an IID distribution, while other defense
mechanisms fail, ProDiGy maintains strong defense capabilities and model
accuracy. These findings highlight the effectiveness of a dual perspective
approach that promotes natural similarity among honest clients while detecting
suspicious uniformity as a potential indicator of an attack.

*Maysam Behmanesh,Erkan Turan,Maks Ovsjanikov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel graph alignment framework that enhances node distinctiveness and enforces geometric consistency across latent spaces, outperforming existing unsupervised methods and generalizing to vision-language domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised graph alignment methods suffer from node distinctiveness degradation due to GNN oversmoothing and latent space misalignment caused by structural noise, feature heterogeneity, and training instability.

Method: Dual-pass encoder combining low-pass and high-pass spectral filters for discriminative embeddings, plus geometry-aware functional map module for learning bijective and isometric transformations between graph embeddings.

Result: Extensive experiments show consistent outperformance of existing unsupervised baselines with superior robustness to structural inconsistencies and successful generalization to vision-language benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses key limitations in graph alignment by simultaneously enhancing node distinctiveness and ensuring geometric consistency, demonstrating broad applicability across domains.

Abstract: Graph alignment-the problem of identifying corresponding nodes across
multiple graphs-is fundamental to numerous applications. Most existing
unsupervised methods embed node features into latent representations to enable
cross-graph comparison without ground-truth correspondences. However, these
methods suffer from two critical limitations: the degradation of node
distinctiveness due to oversmoothing in GNN-based embeddings, and the
misalignment of latent spaces across graphs caused by structural noise, feature
heterogeneity, and training instability, ultimately leading to unreliable node
correspondences. We propose a novel graph alignment framework that
simultaneously enhances node distinctiveness and enforces geometric consistency
across latent spaces. Our approach introduces a dual-pass encoder that combines
low-pass and high-pass spectral filters to generate embeddings that are both
structure-aware and highly discriminative. To address latent space
misalignment, we incorporate a geometry-aware functional map module that learns
bijective and isometric transformations between graph embeddings, ensuring
consistent geometric relationships across different representations. Extensive
experiments on graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing unsupervised alignment baselines, exhibiting superior
robustness to structural inconsistencies and challenging alignment scenarios.
Additionally, comprehensive evaluation on vision-language benchmarks using
diverse pretrained models shows that our framework effectively generalizes
beyond graph domains, enabling unsupervised alignment of vision and language
representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create computationally efficient emulators for complex PDE systems that can generalize across parameter spaces and handle varying domain sizes, enabling faster parameter space exploration than conventional numerical methods.

Method: Pre-training on a single parameter domain followed by fine-tuning on diverse datasets, incorporating local attention mechanisms to handle varying domain sizes and resolutions, with both deterministic and probabilistic variants.

Result: The model successfully captures phenomena at interpolated parameter values for chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and stochastically-forced beta-plane turbulence, providing significant computational speed-ups over numerical integration.

Conclusion: The approach enables efficient parameter space exploration with uncertainty quantification, facilitating statistical study of rare events in complex spatio-temporal systems.

Abstract: We present a deep learning emulator for stochastic and chaotic
spatio-temporal systems, explicitly conditioned on the parameter values of the
underlying partial differential equations (PDEs). Our approach involves
pre-training the model on a single parameter domain, followed by fine-tuning on
a smaller, yet diverse dataset, enabling generalisation across a broad range of
parameter values. By incorporating local attention mechanisms, the network is
capable of handling varying domain sizes and resolutions. This enables
computationally efficient pre-training on smaller domains while requiring only
a small additional dataset to learn how to generalise to larger domain sizes.
We demonstrate the model's capabilities on the chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky
equation and stochastically-forced beta-plane turbulence, showcasing its
ability to capture phenomena at interpolated parameter values. The emulator
provides significant computational speed-ups over conventional numerical
integration, facilitating efficient exploration of parameter space, while a
probabilistic variant of the emulator provides uncertainty quantification,
allowing for the statistical study of rare events.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the generalization gap and lack of discretization invariance in existing operator learning algorithms for solving PDEs with multiple distinct inputs, while maintaining computational efficiency.

Method: Combines Reduced Basis Method with Generative Pre-Trained Physics-Informed Neural Networks using a greedy algorithm to build network structure offline adaptively, with knowledge distillation via task-specific activation functions for compact architecture.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods (PCA-Net, DeepONet, FNO, CNO) in eliminating/shrinking generalization gap for both in- and out-of-distribution tests, and is the only operator learning algorithm achieving strict discretization invariance.

Conclusion: ReBaNO provides a mathematically rigorous, computationally efficient approach for operator learning that addresses key limitations of existing methods, particularly generalization performance and discretization invariance.

Abstract: We propose a novel data-lean operator learning algorithm, the Reduced Basis
Neural Operator (ReBaNO), to solve a group of PDEs with multiple distinct
inputs. Inspired by the Reduced Basis Method and the recently introduced
Generative Pre-Trained Physics-Informed Neural Networks, ReBaNO relies on a
mathematically rigorous greedy algorithm to build its network structure offline
adaptively from the ground up. Knowledge distillation via task-specific
activation function allows ReBaNO to have a compact architecture requiring
minimal computational cost online while embedding physics. In comparison to
state-of-the-art operator learning algorithms such as PCA-Net, DeepONet, FNO,
and CNO, numerical results demonstrate that ReBaNO significantly outperforms
them in terms of eliminating/shrinking the generalization gap for both in- and
out-of-distribution tests and being the only operator learning algorithm
achieving strict discretization invariance.

*Ignacy Stępka,Jerzy Stefanowski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel methodology for explaining concept drift by analyzing temporal evolution of group-based counterfactual explanations to reveal structural changes in model decision boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models in dynamic environments suffer from concept drift that degrades performance, and while detection is well-studied, explaining how and why model decision-making changes remains challenging.

Method: Analyzes temporal evolution of group-based counterfactual explanations (GCEs) by tracking shifts in cluster centroids and counterfactual action vectors before/after drift, using a three-layer framework combining data layer (distributional shifts), model layer (prediction disagreement), and explanation layer insights.

Result: The approach provides interpretable proxies that reveal structural changes in model's decision boundary and underlying rationale, enabling comprehensive drift diagnosis.

Conclusion: The methodology allows distinguishing between different root causes of concept drift (e.g., spatial data shift vs. re-labeling of concepts) through holistic analysis of explanation evolution.

Abstract: Machine learning models in dynamic environments often suffer from concept
drift, where changes in the data distribution degrade performance. While
detecting this drift is a well-studied topic, explaining how and why the
model's decision-making logic changes still remains a significant challenge. In
this paper, we introduce a novel methodology to explain concept drift by
analyzing the temporal evolution of group-based counterfactual explanations
(GCEs). Our approach tracks shifts in the GCEs' cluster centroids and their
associated counterfactual action vectors before and after a drift. These
evolving GCEs act as an interpretable proxy, revealing structural changes in
the model's decision boundary and its underlying rationale. We operationalize
this analysis within a three-layer framework that synergistically combines
insights from the data layer (distributional shifts), the model layer
(prediction disagreement), and our proposed explanation layer. We show that
such holistic view allows for a more comprehensive diagnosis of drift, making
it possible to distinguish between different root causes, such as a spatial
data shift versus a re-labeling of concepts.

TL;DR: A novel Functional Group Representation (FGR) framework that encodes molecules using chemical substructures for interpretable molecular property prediction with state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for molecular property prediction lack interpretability, hindering adoption by chemists who need to understand structure-property relationships.

Method: Integrates curated functional groups from chemical knowledge and mined functional groups using sequential pattern mining, encodes molecules into lower-dimensional latent space with pre-training on unlabeled molecules, and includes 2D structure-based descriptors.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 33 benchmark datasets across physical chemistry, biophysics, quantum mechanics, biological activity, and pharmacokinetics while maintaining chemical interpretability.

Conclusion: The FGR framework represents a significant advancement toward high-performing, chemically interpretable deep learning models that align with established chemical principles and facilitate structure-property insights.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction using deep learning (DL) models has accelerated
drug and materials discovery, but the resulting DL models often lack
interpretability, hindering their adoption by chemists. This work proposes
developing molecule representations using the concept of Functional Groups (FG)
in chemistry. We introduce the Functional Group Representation (FGR) framework,
a novel approach to encoding molecules based on their fundamental chemical
substructures. Our method integrates two types of functional groups: those
curated from established chemical knowledge (FG), and those mined from a large
molecular corpus using sequential pattern mining (MFG). The resulting FGR
framework encodes molecules into a lower-dimensional latent space by leveraging
pre-training on a large dataset of unlabeled molecules. Furthermore, the
proposed framework allows the inclusion of 2D structure-based descriptors of
molecules. We demonstrate that the FGR framework achieves state-of-the-art
performance on a diverse range of 33 benchmark datasets spanning physical
chemistry, biophysics, quantum mechanics, biological activity, and
pharmacokinetics while enabling chemical interpretability. Crucially, the
model's representations are intrinsically aligned with established chemical
principles, allowing chemists to directly link predicted properties to specific
functional groups and facilitating novel insights into structure-property
relationships. Our work presents a significant step toward developing
high-performing, chemically interpretable DL models for molecular discovery.

Motivation: To develop a reinforcement learning approach that ensures safety and fairness across different protected subgroups in healthcare decision support systems, addressing disparities in harm and coverage.

Method: Feasibility-Guided Fair Adaptive Reinforcement Learning (FG-FARL) calibrates per-group safety thresholds to balance harm reduction and fairness. Evaluated using de-identified Medicaid data against behavior cloning and HACO baselines with bootstrap confidence intervals and subgroup disparity analysis.

Result: FG-FARL achieves comparable value to behavior cloning and HACO baselines while significantly improving fairness metrics (coverage or harm equality across subgroups) with statistical significance.

Conclusion: FG-FARL provides a practical approach for safer and more equitable decision support in healthcare applications, successfully balancing performance with fairness objectives across protected subgroups.

Abstract: We introduce Feasibility-Guided Fair Adaptive Reinforcement Learning
(FG-FARL), an offline RL procedure that calibrates per-group safety thresholds
to reduce harm while equalizing a chosen fairness target (coverage or harm)
across protected subgroups. Using de-identified longitudinal trajectories from
a Medicaid population health management program, we evaluate FG-FARL against
behavior cloning (BC) and HACO (Hybrid Adaptive Conformal Offline RL; a global
conformal safety baseline). We report off-policy value estimates with bootstrap
95% confidence intervals and subgroup disparity analyses with p-values. FG-FARL
achieves comparable value to baselines while improving fairness metrics,
demonstrating a practical path to safer and more equitable decision support.

*Bingxin Xu,Zhen Dong,Oussama Elachqar,Yuzhang Shang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ButterflyQuant introduces learnable butterfly transforms for 2-bit quantization of large language models, replacing fixed Hadamard rotations with continuous parameterized transforms to adapt to layer-specific outlier patterns and improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extreme 2-bit quantization suffers from catastrophic performance loss due to activation outliers. Fixed rotation methods like QuIP and QuaRot cannot adapt to different transformer layers' distinct outlier patterns, motivating layer-adaptive approaches.

Method: Replaces fixed Hadamard rotations with learnable butterfly transforms parameterized by continuous Givens rotation angles. Uses orthogonal constraint for theoretical guarantees and introduces uniformity regularization on post-transformation activations. Requires only 128 calibration samples and converges quickly on a single GPU.

Result: On LLaMA-2-7B with 2-bit quantization, ButterflyQuant achieves 15.4 perplexity compared to 22.1 for QuaRot, demonstrating significant performance improvement.

Conclusion: ButterflyQuant provides an efficient, adaptive quantization method that outperforms fixed rotation approaches while maintaining computational efficiency and requiring minimal calibration overhead.

Abstract: Large language models require massive memory footprints, severely limiting
deployment on consumer hardware. Quantization reduces memory through lower
numerical precision, but extreme 2-bit quantization suffers from catastrophic
performance loss due to outliers in activations. Rotation-based methods such as
QuIP and QuaRot apply orthogonal transforms to eliminate outliers before
quantization, using computational invariance: $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{Wx} =
(\mathbf{WQ}^T)(\mathbf{Qx})$ for orthogonal $\mathbf{Q}$. However, these
methods use fixed transforms--Hadamard matrices achieving optimal worst-case
coherence $\mu = 1/\sqrt{n}$--that cannot adapt to specific weight
distributions. We identify that different transformer layers exhibit distinct
outlier patterns, motivating layer-adaptive rotations rather than
one-size-fits-all approaches. We propose ButterflyQuant, which replaces
Hadamard rotations with learnable butterfly transforms parameterized by
continuous Givens rotation angles. Unlike Hadamard's discrete $\{+1, -1\}$
entries that are non-differentiable and prohibit gradient-based learning,
butterfly transforms' continuous parameterization enables smooth optimization
while guaranteeing orthogonality by construction. This orthogonal constraint
ensures theoretical guarantees in outlier suppression while achieving $O(n \log
n)$ computational complexity with only $\frac{n \log n}{2}$ learnable
parameters. We further introduce a uniformity regularization on
post-transformation activations to promote smoother distributions amenable to
quantization. Learning requires only 128 calibration samples and converges in
minutes on a single GPU--a negligible one-time cost. On LLaMA-2-7B with 2-bit
quantization, ButterflyQuant achieves 15.4 perplexity versus 22.1 for QuaRot.

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: READ is a Wasserstein distributionally robust learning framework that incorporates representation awareness into robustness against distributional shifts, using multidimensional alignment parameters to differentially handle feature perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional distributionally robust approaches treat all feature perturbations equally, but this fails to account for the varying importance of different feature directions in predictive representations. The authors aim to develop a framework that preserves invariant structure while being robust to feature variation.

Method: The method embeds multidimensional alignment parameters into the transport cost of Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization, allowing differential treatment of perturbations along informative representation directions. It provides tractable reformulations as seminorm regularizations and uses robust Wasserstein profile inference for radius selection.

Result: The framework yields representation-aware confidence regions with distinct geometric features and enables selection among equally robust estimators while optimally constructing representation structure. Extensive simulations and real-world studies demonstrate its effectiveness.

Conclusion: READ provides a powerful robust estimation framework grounded in learning representation, unifying a broad class of regularized estimators under the distributionally robust optimization lens and offering practical tools for representation-aware robust learning.

Abstract: We propose REpresentation-Aware Distributionally Robust Estimation (READ), a
novel framework for Wasserstein distributionally robust learning that accounts
for predictive representations when guarding against distributional shifts.
Unlike classical approaches that treat all feature perturbations equally, READ
embeds a multidimensional alignment parameter into the transport cost, allowing
the model to differentially discourage perturbations along directions
associated with informative representations. This yields robustness to feature
variation while preserving invariant structure. Our first contribution is a
theoretical foundation: we show that seminorm regularizations for linear
regression and binary classification arise as Wasserstein distributionally
robust objectives, thereby providing tractable reformulations of READ and
unifying a broad class of regularized estimators under the DRO lens. Second, we
adopt a principled procedure for selecting the Wasserstein radius using the
techniques of robust Wasserstein profile inference. This further enables the
construction of valid, representation-aware confidence regions for model
parameters with distinct geometric features. Finally, we analyze the geometry
of READ estimators as the alignment parameters vary and propose an optimization
algorithm to estimate the projection of the global optimum onto this solution
surface. This procedure selects among equally robust estimators while optimally
constructing a representation structure. We conclude by demonstrating the
effectiveness of our framework through extensive simulations and a real-world
study, providing a powerful robust estimation grounded in learning
representation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing energy efficiency benchmarks for LLMs don't adequately represent real-world deployment scenarios, creating a need for more practical evaluation methods to help developers build sustainable AI systems.

Method: Developed the LLM Efficiency Benchmark using vLLM (a production-ready LLM serving backend) to simulate real-world usage conditions and analyze how model size, architecture, and concurrent request volume impact inference energy efficiency.

Result: The benchmark successfully demonstrates that energy efficiency evaluations can better reflect practical deployment conditions, providing actionable insights for developers.

Conclusion: It's possible to create energy efficiency benchmarks that accurately mirror real-world LLM deployment scenarios, offering valuable guidance for building more sustainable AI systems.

Abstract: The prevalence of Large Language Models (LLMs) is having an growing impact on
the climate due to the substantial energy required for their deployment and
use. To create awareness for developers who are implementing LLMs in their
products, there is a strong need to collect more information about the energy
efficiency of LLMs. While existing research has evaluated the energy efficiency
of various models, these benchmarks often fall short of representing realistic
production scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the LLM Efficiency Benchmark,
designed to simulate real-world usage conditions. Our benchmark utilizes vLLM,
a high-throughput, production-ready LLM serving backend that optimizes model
performance and efficiency. We examine how factors such as model size,
architecture, and concurrent request volume affect inference energy efficiency.
Our findings demonstrate that it is possible to create energy efficiency
benchmarks that better reflect practical deployment conditions, providing

*Doha Nam,Taehyoun Kim,Duksan Ryu,Jongmoon Baik*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: ReDef dataset provides high-confidence function-level defect labels using revert commits and GPT-assisted validation. Evaluation shows PLMs perform best with diff encodings but rely on superficial cues rather than true semantic understanding of code changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing JIT-SDP datasets suffer from noisy labels and low precision in identifying bug-inducing commits, necessitating a more reliable benchmark for defect prediction.

Method: Created ReDef dataset using revert commits for defective cases, history checks for clean cases, and GPT-assisted filtering. Evaluated CodeBERT, CodeT5+, and UniXcoder with five encoding strategies and counterfactual perturbation tests.

Result: Diff-style encodings consistently outperform whole-function formats across all PLMs. However, counterfactual tests reveal models rely on superficial cues rather than genuine semantic understanding of code modifications.

Conclusion: Current pre-trained language models remain limited in their ability to genuinely comprehend code modifications, unlike in snapshot-based tasks, despite good performance with diff encodings.

Abstract: Just-in-Time software defect prediction (JIT-SDP) plays a critical role in
prioritizing risky code changes during code review and continuous integration.
However, existing datasets often suffer from noisy labels and low precision in
identifying bug-inducing commits. To address this, we present ReDef
(Revert-based Defect dataset), a high-confidence benchmark of function-level
modifications curated from 22 large-scale C/C++ projects. Defective cases are
anchored by revert commits, while clean cases are validated through post-hoc
history checks. Ambiguous instances are conservatively filtered out via a
GPT-assisted triage process involving multiple votes and audits. This pipeline
yields 3,164 defective and 10,268 clean modifications, offering substantially
more reliable labels than prior existing resources. Beyond dataset
construction, we provide the first systematic evaluation of how pre-trained
language models (PLMs) reason about code modifications -- specifically, which
input encodings most effectively expose change information, and whether models
genuinely capture edit semantics. We fine-tune CodeBERT, CodeT5+, and UniXcoder
under five encoding strategies, and further probe their sensitivity through
counterfactual perturbations that swap added/deleted blocks, invert diff
polarity, or inject spurious markers. Our results show that compact diff-style
encodings consistently outperform whole-function formats across all PLMs, with
statistical tests confirming large, model-independent effects. However, under
counterfactual tests, performance degrades little or not at all -- revealing
that what appears to be robustness in fact reflects reliance on superficial
cues rather than true semantic understanding. These findings indicate that,
unlike in snapshot-based tasks, current PLMs remain limited in their ability to
genuinely comprehend code modifications.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: A methodology combining LLMs with Scenario-Based Programming to create more reliable AI-assisted software development, demonstrated through a Connect4 game implementation that achieved strong performance and formal verification capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are becoming essential tools for developers but often introduce significant errors with persuasive confidence, misleading developers into accepting flawed code solutions.

Method: Combining LLMs with traditional software engineering techniques using Scenario-Based Programming (SBP) paradigm - an event-driven, scenario-based approach that allows human developers to inject expert knowledge and verify LLM outputs.

Result: Successfully designed and implemented a Connect4 game agent that could defeat various strong existing agents, with some cases achieving formal verification of correctness. The approach demonstrated practical ease-of-use.

Conclusion: The structured combination of LLMs with SBP provides a reliable way to integrate AI into software development cycles, reducing errors while maintaining verifiability and leveraging human expertise.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are fast becoming indispensable tools for
software developers, assisting or even partnering with them in crafting complex
programs. The advantages are evident -- LLMs can significantly reduce
development time, generate well-organized and comprehensible code, and
occasionally suggest innovative ideas that developers might not conceive on
their own. However, despite their strengths, LLMs will often introduce
significant errors and present incorrect code with persuasive confidence,
potentially misleading developers into accepting flawed solutions.
  In order to bring LLMs into the software development cycle in a more reliable
manner, we propose a methodology for combining them with ``traditional''
software engineering techniques in a structured way, with the goal of
streamlining the development process, reducing errors, and enabling users to
verify crucial program properties with increased confidence. Specifically, we
focus on the Scenario-Based Programming (SBP) paradigm -- an event-driven,
scenario-based approach for software engineering -- to allow human developers
to pour their expert knowledge into the LLM, as well as to inspect and verify
its outputs.
  To evaluate our methodology, we conducted a significant case study, and used
it to design and implement the Connect4 game. By combining LLMs and SBP we were
able to create a highly-capable agent, which could defeat various strong
existing agents. Further, in some cases, we were able to formally verify the

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LoCoBench is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating long-context LLMs in complex software development scenarios with 8,000 scenarios across 10 languages and context lengths from 10K to 1M tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: Created 8,000 evaluation scenarios systematically generated across 10 programming languages with context lengths spanning 10K to 1M tokens. Introduced 8 task categories covering architectural understanding, cross-file refactoring, multi-session development, bug investigation, feature implementation, code comprehension, integration testing, and security analysis. Developed a 5-phase pipeline for diverse scenario generation and a comprehensive evaluation framework with 17 metrics across 4 dimensions.

Result: Evaluation of state-of-the-art long-context models revealed substantial performance gaps, demonstrating that long-context understanding in complex software development represents a significant unsolved challenge.

Conclusion: LoCoBench addresses the critical need for evaluating long-context capabilities in realistic software development scenarios and shows that current models struggle with complex codebase reasoning at scale, indicating this area requires more research attention.

Abstract: The emergence of long-context language models with context windows extending
to millions of tokens has created new opportunities for sophisticated code
understanding and software development evaluation. We propose LoCoBench, a
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate long-context LLMs in
realistic, complex software development scenarios. Unlike existing code
evaluation benchmarks that focus on single-function completion or short-context
tasks, LoCoBench addresses the critical evaluation gap for long-context
capabilities that require understanding entire codebases, reasoning across
multiple files, and maintaining architectural consistency across large-scale
software systems. Our benchmark provides 8,000 evaluation scenarios
systematically generated across 10 programming languages, with context lengths
spanning 10K to 1M tokens, a 100x variation that enables precise assessment of
long-context performance degradation in realistic software development
settings. LoCoBench introduces 8 task categories that capture essential
long-context capabilities: architectural understanding, cross-file refactoring,
multi-session development, bug investigation, feature implementation, code
comprehension, integration testing, and security analysis. Through a 5-phase
pipeline, we create diverse, high-quality scenarios that challenge LLMs to
reason about complex codebases at unprecedented scale. We introduce a
comprehensive evaluation framework with 17 metrics across 4 dimensions,
including 8 new evaluation metrics, combined in a LoCoBench Score (LCBS). Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art long-context models reveals substantial
performance gaps, demonstrating that long-context understanding in complex
software development represents a significant unsolved challenge that demands
more attention. LoCoBench is released at:

### [199] [DeepTV: A neural network approach for total variation minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05569)
*Andreas Langer,Sara Behnamian*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Neural network approach for infinite-dimensional total variation minimization with theoretical issues, solved via auxiliary problem and Γ-convergence analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks have shown success in solving PDEs (physics-informed neural networks, Deep Ritz method), but applying them to infinite-dimensional total variation minimization problems presents theoretical challenges.

Method: Propose an auxiliary neural network problem that has solutions, prove its Γ-convergence to original problem, develop discrete version with Γ-convergence, and connect to finite difference discretization.

Result: Theoretical framework established showing auxiliary problem converges to original problem, with numerical experiments supporting the findings.

Conclusion: The proposed auxiliary neural network approach provides a theoretically sound method for solving infinite-dimensional total variation minimization problems using neural networks, overcoming the original problem's lack of solutions.

Abstract: Neural network approaches have been demonstrated to work quite well to solve
partial differential equations in practice. In this context approaches like
physics-informed neural networks and the Deep Ritz method have become popular.
In this paper, we propose a similar approach to solve an infinite-dimensional
total variation minimization problem using neural networks. We illustrate that
the resulting neural network problem does not have a solution in general. To
circumvent this theoretic issue, we consider an auxiliary neural network
problem, which indeed has a solution, and show that it converges in the sense
of $\Gamma$-convergence to the original problem. For computing a numerical
solution we further propose a discrete version of the auxiliary neural network
problem and again show its $\Gamma$-convergence to the original
infinite-dimensional problem. In particular, the $\Gamma$-convergence proof
suggests a particular discretization of the total variation. Moreover, we
connect the discrete neural network problem to a finite difference
discretization of the infinite-dimensional total variation minimization
problem. Numerical experiments are presented supporting our theoretical
findings.

*Hanfei Zhou,Lei Shi*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: First simultaneous approximation theory for deep neural networks on manifolds, showing constant-depth ReLU networks can approximate Sobolev functions with optimal parameter efficiency that overcomes curse of dimensionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Solving PDEs on complex domains with curved geometry is challenging due to difficulties in approximating functions and derivatives required by differential operators on manifolds.

Method: Prove that constant-depth ReLU networks with bounded weights can approximate functions in Sobolev spaces on manifolds with optimal parameter efficiency, and provide matching lower bounds using novel VC dimension estimates.

Result: Achieves approximation error ε in Sobolev norm using O(ε^{-d/(k-s)}) parameters, overcoming curse of dimensionality by depending only on intrinsic dimension d. Lower bound proves construction is nearly optimal.

Conclusion: Provides theoretical foundation for learning PDEs on manifolds, revealing network architecture leverages sparse structure to exploit low-dimensional geometry efficiently.

Abstract: A key challenge in scientific machine learning is solving partial
differential equations (PDEs) on complex domains, where the curved geometry
complicates the approximation of functions and their derivatives required by
differential operators. This paper establishes the first simultaneous
approximation theory for deep neural networks on manifolds. We prove that a
constant-depth $\mathrm{ReLU}^{k-1}$ network with bounded weights--a property
that plays a crucial role in controlling generalization error--can approximate
any function in the Sobolev space $\mathcal{W}_p^{k}(\mathcal{M}^d)$ to an
error of $\varepsilon$ in the $\mathcal{W}_p^{s}(\mathcal{M}^d)$ norm, for
$k\geq 3$ and $s<k$, using $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-d/(k-s)})$ nonzero
parameters, a rate that overcomes the curse of dimensionality by depending only
on the intrinsic dimension $d$. These results readily extend to functions in
H\"older-Zygmund spaces. We complement this result with a matching lower bound,
proving our construction is nearly optimal by showing the required number of
parameters matches up to a logarithmic factor. Our proof of the lower bound
introduces novel estimates for the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension and
pseudo-dimension of the network's high-order derivative classes. These
complexity bounds provide a theoretical cornerstone for learning PDEs on
manifolds involving derivatives. Our analysis reveals that the network
architecture leverages a sparse structure to efficiently exploit the manifold's
low-dimensional geometry.

### [201] [The Role of Community Detection Methods in Performance Variations of Graph Mining Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09045)
*Shrabani Ghosh,Erik Saule*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: Study investigates how community detection algorithm choice affects downstream graph mining performance, proposing a framework to evaluate different methods systematically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world large graphs lack ground truth community information, and there's no universal standard for community detection. Practitioners often choose methods without considering downstream task impact.

Method: Proposed a framework that integrates various community detection methods to systematically evaluate their effects on downstream task outcomes through comparative analysis.

Result: Comparative analysis reveals that specific community detection algorithms yield superior results in certain applications, showing method selection substantially affects performance.

Conclusion: The choice of community detection algorithm significantly influences downstream application performance, highlighting the need for careful method selection based on specific application requirements.

Abstract: In real-world scenarios, large graphs represent relationships among entities
in complex systems. Mining these large graphs often containing millions of
nodes and edges helps uncover structural patterns and meaningful insights.
Dividing a large graph into smaller subgraphs facilitates complex system
analysis by revealing local information. Community detection extracts clusters
or communities of graphs based on statistical methods and machine learning
models using various optimization techniques. Structure based community
detection methods are more suitable for applying to graphs because they do not
rely heavily on rich node or edge attribute information. The features derived
from these communities can improve downstream graph mining tasks, such as link
prediction and node classification. In real-world applications, we often lack
ground truth community information. Additionally, there is neither a
universally accepted gold standard for community detection nor a single method
that is consistently optimal across diverse applications. In many cases, it is
unclear how practitioners select community detection methods, and choices are
often made without explicitly considering their potential impact on downstream
tasks. In this study, we investigate whether the choice of community detection
algorithm significantly influences the performance of downstream applications.
We propose a framework capable of integrating various community detection
methods to systematically evaluate their effects on downstream task outcomes.
Our comparative analysis reveals that specific community detection algorithms
yield superior results in certain applications, highlighting that method
selection substantially affects performance.

*Teresa Portone,Bert Debusschere,Samantha Yang,Emiliano Islas-Quinones,T. Patrick Xiao*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Extensions to given-data Sobol' index methods enabling variance-based sensitivity analysis for models with >10^4 inputs, addressing memory limitations and nonstandard distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing given-data methods for Sobol' index computation are impractical for models with extremely large numbers of inputs (>10^4) due to memory constraints and limitations with nonstandard input distributions.

Method: Developed practical extensions including: general Sobol' index estimator with arbitrary partition, streaming algorithm for batch processing, and heuristic to filter out statistically insignificant indices.

Result: The streaming algorithm achieves comparable accuracy and runtime with lower memory requirements. Equiprobable partitions in existing methods can introduce significant bias even at large sample sizes.

Conclusion: The proposed extensions enable efficient variance-based sensitivity analysis for large-scale models like neural networks, overcoming memory limitations and handling nonstandard input distributions effectively.

Abstract: Given-data methods for variance-based sensitivity analysis have significantly
advanced the feasibility of Sobol' index computation for computationally
expensive models and models with many inputs. However, the limitations of
existing methods still preclude their application to models with an extremely
large number of inputs. In this work, we present practical extensions to the
existing given-data Sobol' index method, which allow variance-based sensitivity
analysis to be efficiently performed on large models such as neural networks,
which have $>10^4$ parameterizable inputs. For models of this size, holding all
input-output evaluations simultaneously in memory -- as required by existing
methods -- can quickly become impractical. These extensions also support
nonstandard input distributions with many repeated values, which are not
amenable to equiprobable partitions employed by existing given-data methods.
  Our extensions include a general definition of the given-data Sobol' index
estimator with arbitrary partition, a streaming algorithm to process
input-output samples in batches, and a heuristic to filter out small indices
that are indistinguishable from zero indices due to statistical noise. We show
that the equiprobable partition employed in existing given-data methods can
introduce significant bias into Sobol' index estimates even at large sample
sizes and provide numerical analyses that demonstrate why this can occur. We
also show that our streaming algorithm can achieve comparable accuracy and
runtimes with lower memory requirements, relative to current methods which
process all samples at once. We demonstrate our novel developments on two
application problems in neural network modeling.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: WS-KDE provides excellent confidence bounds for stochastic functions with outputs in [0,1], enabling stable Bayesian optimization without requiring many evaluations or disturbance modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing time-expensive black-box stochastic functions in robotics requires efficient Bayesian optimization with reliable confidence bounds, but existing estimators need many evaluations or disturbance modeling.

Method: Proposes using Wilson Score Kernel Density Estimator (WS-KDE) to provide informative confidence bounds for any stochastic function with output in [0,1] interval.

Result: WS-KDE demonstrates excellent performance as confidence bounds regardless of output distribution, enabling stable global optimization on wider range of cost functions.

Conclusion: WS-KDE is applicable for Bayesian optimization of stochastic functions with [0,1] outputs, validated through simulations and applied to automated trap design for vibrational part feeders.

Abstract: Many optimization problems in robotics involve the optimization of
time-expensive black-box functions, such as those involving complex simulations
or evaluation of real-world experiments. Furthermore, these functions are often
stochastic as repeated experiments are subject to unmeasurable disturbances.
Bayesian optimization can be used to optimize such methods in an efficient
manner by deploying a probabilistic function estimator to estimate with a given
confidence so that regions of the search space can be pruned away.
Consequently, the success of the Bayesian optimization depends on the function
estimator's ability to provide informative confidence bounds. Existing function
estimators require many function evaluations to infer the underlying confidence
or depend on modeling of the disturbances. In this paper, it is shown that the
confidence bounds provided by the Wilson Score Kernel Density Estimator
(WS-KDE) are applicable as excellent bounds to any stochastic function with an
output confined to the closed interval [0;1] regardless of the distribution of
the output. This finding opens up the use of WS-KDE for stable global
optimization on a wider range of cost functions. The properties of WS-KDE in
the context of Bayesian optimization are demonstrated in simulation and applied
to the problem of automated trap design for vibrational part feeders.

### [204] [Low-degree lower bounds via almost orthonormal bases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09353)
*Alexandra Carpentier,Simone Maria Giancola,Christophe Giraud,Nicolas Verzelen*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A new method for establishing low-degree lower bounds using almost orthonormal polynomial bases in random graph models, addressing limitations of existing approaches for complex statistical problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for low-degree polynomial analysis break down for estimation tasks and complex testing problems where the null distribution has planted structures, requiring delicate technical workarounds.

Method: Construct a basis of polynomials that is almost orthonormal under the null distribution in regimes where statistical-computational gaps arise, enabling direct low-degree lower bound proofs and identification of optimal polynomials.

Result: The approach successfully recovers known low-degree lower bounds and establishes new ones for problems including hidden subcliques, stochastic block models, and seriation models.

Conclusion: The proposed almost orthonormal basis provides a more direct and effective proof strategy for low-degree analysis, offering insights into optimal polynomial-time algorithm design for complex statistical problems.

Abstract: Low-degree polynomials have emerged as a powerful paradigm for providing
evidence of statistical-computational gaps across a variety of high-dimensional
statistical models [Wein25]. For detection problems -- where the goal is to
test a planted distribution $\mathbb{P}'$ against a null distribution
$\mathbb{P}$ with independent components -- the standard approach is to bound
the advantage using an $\mathbb{L}^2(\mathbb{P})$-orthonormal family of
polynomials. However, this method breaks down for estimation tasks or more
complex testing problems where $\mathbb{P}$ has some planted structures, so
that no simple $\mathbb{L}^2(\mathbb{P})$-orthogonal polynomial family is
available. To address this challenge, several technical workarounds have been
proposed [SW22,SW25], though their implementation can be delicate. In this
work, we propose a more direct proof strategy. Focusing on random graph models,
we construct a basis of polynomials that is almost orthonormal under
$\mathbb{P}$, in precisely those regimes where statistical-computational gaps
arise. This almost orthonormal basis not only yields a direct route to
establishing low-degree lower bounds, but also allows us to explicitly identify
the polynomials that optimize the low-degree criterion. This, in turn, provides
insights into the design of optimal polynomial-time algorithms. We illustrate
the effectiveness of our approach by recovering known low-degree lower bounds,
and establishing new ones for problems such as hidden subcliques, stochastic
block models, and seriation models.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A distributed coordination method for multi-agent systems in low-communication environments with active asymmetric obstacles and partial observability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of coordinating multi-agent systems with limited communication capabilities and active asymmetric obstacles in partially observable environments.

Method: Novel distributed coordination algorithm inspired by market-based task assignments, specifically designed to handle asymmetric obstacles and poor communication channels.

Result: 52% reduction in task overlaps in limited communication settings, with significant decrease in frequently reallocated tasks. Validated in simulation and real-world RoboCup competitions using NAO robots.

Conclusion: The presented architecture effectively handles complex scenarios with active asymmetric obstacles, poor communication, and partial observability, demonstrating practical applicability in real-world robotic systems.

Abstract: Coordinating a fully distributed multi-agent system (MAS) can be challenging
when the communication channel has very limited capabilities in terms of
sending rate and packet payload. When the MAS has to deal with active obstacles
in a highly partially observable environment, the communication channel
acquires considerable relevance. In this paper, we present an approach to deal
with task assignments in extremely active scenarios, where tasks need to be
frequently reallocated among the agents participating in the coordination
process. Inspired by market-based task assignments, we introduce a novel
distributed coordination method to orchestrate autonomous agents' actions
efficiently in low communication scenarios. In particular, our algorithm takes
into account asymmetric obstacles. While in the real world, the majority of
obstacles are asymmetric, they are usually treated as symmetric ones, thus
limiting the applicability of existing methods. To summarize, the presented
architecture is designed to tackle scenarios where the obstacles are active and
asymmetric, the communication channel is poor and the environment is partially
observable. Our approach has been validated in simulation and in the real
world, using a team of NAO robots during official RoboCup competitions.
Experimental results show a notable reduction in task overlaps in limited
communication settings, with a decrease of 52% in the most frequent reallocated
task.

*Alice Kate Li,Thales C Silva,Victoria Edwards,Vijay Kumar,M. Ani Hsieh*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: KoopMotion is a novel flow field-based motion planning method that uses Koopman operator theory to create motion fields that converge to desired trajectories and end points, demonstrating high sample efficiency and improved performance over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Koopman operator theory is effective for modeling dynamical systems but doesn't inherently enforce convergence to desired trajectories or goals, which is crucial for learning from demonstrations (LfD).

Method: KoopMotion represents motion flow fields as dynamical systems parameterized by Koopman Operators, leveraging divergence properties to obtain smooth motion fields that converge to reference trajectories and track them to end points.

Result: Evaluations on LASA handwriting dataset and 3D manipulator trajectories show high sample efficiency (only 3% of dataset needed), improved spatial and temporal dynamics modeling, and successful physical robot experiments in non-static fluid flow environments.

Conclusion: KoopMotion provides an effective approach for motion planning that ensures convergence to desired trajectories while being highly sample efficient and outperforming baseline methods in both spatial and temporal dynamics modeling.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel flow field-based motion planning method that
drives a robot from any initial state to a desired reference trajectory such
that it converges to the trajectory's end point. Despite demonstrated efficacy
in using Koopman operator theory for modeling dynamical systems, Koopman does
not inherently enforce convergence to desired trajectories nor to specified
goals -- a requirement when learning from demonstrations (LfD). We present
KoopMotion which represents motion flow fields as dynamical systems,
parameterized by Koopman Operators to mimic desired trajectories, and leverages
the divergence properties of the learnt flow fields to obtain smooth motion
fields that converge to a desired reference trajectory when a robot is placed
away from the desired trajectory, and tracks the trajectory until the end
point. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we show evaluations of
KoopMotion on the LASA human handwriting dataset and a 3D manipulator
end-effector trajectory dataset, including spectral analysis. We also perform
experiments on a physical robot, verifying KoopMotion on a miniature autonomous
surface vehicle operating in a non-static fluid flow environment. Our approach
is highly sample efficient in both space and time, requiring only 3\% of the
LASA dataset to generate dense motion plans. Additionally, KoopMotion provides
a significant improvement over baselines when comparing metrics that measure
spatial and temporal dynamics modeling efficacy.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: OmniEVA addresses geometric adaptability and embodiment constraint gaps in MLLM-based embodied systems through task-adaptive 3D grounding and embodiment-aware reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse embodied tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLM-based embodied systems suffer from two critical limitations: Geometric Adaptability Gap (insufficient spatial information or restricted 2D generalization) and Embodiment Constraint Gap (neglecting physical robot constraints, making plans theoretically valid but practically infeasible).

Method: OmniEVA introduces two innovations: (1) Task-Adaptive 3D Grounding mechanism with a gated router for explicit selective regulation of 3D fusion based on contextual requirements, enabling context-aware 3D grounding. (2) Embodiment-Aware Reasoning framework that jointly incorporates task goals and embodiment constraints into the reasoning loop.

Result: Extensive experiments show OmniEVA achieves state-of-the-art general embodied reasoning performance and exhibits strong ability across a wide range of downstream scenarios. Evaluations on embodied benchmarks confirm robust and versatile planning capabilities for both primitive and composite tasks.

Conclusion: OmniEVA successfully addresses the identified gaps in MLLM-based embodied systems through its innovative 3D grounding and embodiment-aware reasoning approaches, demonstrating superior adaptability and practical feasibility for real-world robotic applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have opened new
opportunities for embodied intelligence, enabling multimodal understanding,
reasoning, and interaction, as well as continuous spatial decision-making.
Nevertheless, current MLLM-based embodied systems face two critical
limitations. First, Geometric Adaptability Gap: models trained solely on 2D
inputs or with hard-coded 3D geometry injection suffer from either insufficient
spatial information or restricted 2D generalization, leading to poor
adaptability across tasks with diverse spatial demands. Second, Embodiment
Constraint Gap: prior work often neglects the physical constraints and
capacities of real robots, resulting in task plans that are theoretically valid
but practically infeasible.To address these gaps, we introduce OmniEVA -- an
embodied versatile planner that enables advanced embodied reasoning and task
planning through two pivotal innovations: (1) a Task-Adaptive 3D Grounding
mechanism, which introduces a gated router to perform explicit selective
regulation of 3D fusion based on contextual requirements, enabling
context-aware 3D grounding for diverse embodied tasks. (2) an Embodiment-Aware
Reasoning framework that jointly incorporates task goals and embodiment
constraints into the reasoning loop, resulting in planning decisions that are
both goal-directed and executable. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that OmniEVA not only achieves state-of-the-art general embodied reasoning
performance, but also exhibits a strong ability across a wide range of
downstream scenarios. Evaluations of a suite of proposed embodied benchmarks,
including both primitive and composite tasks, confirm its robust and versatile
planning capabilities. Project page: https://omnieva.github.io

TL;DR: SimpleVLA-RL is an efficient RL framework that enhances Vision-Language-Action models, reducing dependence on costly human demonstrations and improving generalization through reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address two fundamental challenges in VLA models: (1) scarcity and high cost of large-scale human-operated robotic trajectories for supervised fine-tuning, and (2) limited generalization to tasks with distribution shift.

Method: Builds upon veRL framework with VLA-specific trajectory sampling, scalable parallelization, multi-environment rendering, and optimized loss computation. Introduces exploration-enhancing strategies for RL training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on LIBERO benchmark and outperforms baseline (π₀) on RoboTwin 1.0 & 2.0. Reduces dependence on large-scale data and enables robust generalization, surpassing SFT in real-world tasks.

Conclusion: RL can significantly improve long-horizon step-by-step action planning in VLA models, discovering novel patterns ("pushcut" phenomenon) beyond previous training data, making it a promising approach for robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for robotic manipulation. Despite substantial progress enabled by
large-scale pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these models face two
fundamental challenges: (i) the scarcity and high cost of large-scale
human-operated robotic trajectories required for SFT scaling, and (ii) limited
generalization to tasks involving distribution shift. Recent breakthroughs in
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) can
dramatically enhance step-by-step reasoning capabilities, raising a natural
question: Can RL similarly improve the long-horizon step-by-step action
planning of VLA? In this work, we introduce SimpleVLA-RL, an efficient RL
framework tailored for VLA models. Building upon veRL, we introduce
VLA-specific trajectory sampling, scalable parallelization, multi-environment
rendering, and optimized loss computation. When applied to OpenVLA-OFT,
SimpleVLA-RL achieves SoTA performance on LIBERO and even outperforms $\pi_0$
on RoboTwin 1.0\&2.0 with the exploration-enhancing strategies we introduce.
SimpleVLA-RL not only reduces dependence on large-scale data and enables robust
generalization, but also remarkably surpasses SFT in real-world tasks.
Moreover, we identify a novel phenomenon ``pushcut'' during RL training,
wherein the policy discovers previously unseen patterns beyond those seen in
the previous training process. Github: https://github.com/PRIME-RL/SimpleVLA-RL

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Object-relative visual navigation using 3D scene graphs instead of image-level representations, enabling better cross-embodiment generalization and reverse trajectory navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image-level representations are tied to agent pose and embodiment, limiting generalization. Objects offer invariant world representation that can enable better navigation across different embodiments and trajectories.

Method: Proposes topometric map using relative 3D scene graphs for object-level path planning. Trains ObjectReact controller conditioned on WayObject Costmap instead of RGB input, eliminating explicit image matching requirements.

Result: Shows advantages over image-relative methods across sensor height variations and challenging navigation tasks like reverse direction traversal. Sim-only policy generalizes well to real-world indoor environments.

Conclusion: Object-relative control paradigm enables more robust visual navigation with higher invariance to embodiment and trajectory variations, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities compared to traditional image-relative approaches.

Abstract: Visual navigation using only a single camera and a topological map has
recently become an appealing alternative to methods that require additional
sensors and 3D maps. This is typically achieved through an "image-relative"
approach to estimating control from a given pair of current observation and
subgoal image. However, image-level representations of the world have
limitations because images are strictly tied to the agent's pose and
embodiment. In contrast, objects, being a property of the map, offer an
embodiment- and trajectory-invariant world representation. In this work, we
present a new paradigm of learning "object-relative" control that exhibits
several desirable characteristics: a) new routes can be traversed without
strictly requiring to imitate prior experience, b) the control prediction
problem can be decoupled from solving the image matching problem, and c) high
invariance can be achieved in cross-embodiment deployment for variations across
both training-testing and mapping-execution settings. We propose a topometric
map representation in the form of a "relative" 3D scene graph, which is used to
obtain more informative object-level global path planning costs. We train a
local controller, dubbed "ObjectReact", conditioned directly on a high-level
"WayObject Costmap" representation that eliminates the need for an explicit RGB
input. We demonstrate the advantages of learning object-relative control over
its image-relative counterpart across sensor height variations and multiple
navigation tasks that challenge the underlying spatial understanding
capability, e.g., navigating a map trajectory in the reverse direction. We
further show that our sim-only policy is able to generalize well to real-world
indoor environments. Code and supplementary material are accessible via project

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Dexplore is a unified optimization method that learns robot control policies directly from human motion-capture data through joint retargeting and tracking, using demonstrations as soft guidance rather than ground truth, and scales to large datasets while enabling robot-specific strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hand-object motion-capture repositories contain valuable contact-rich demonstrations but suffer from inaccuracies and embodiment gaps between human and robot hands. Existing three-stage workflows (retargeting, tracking, residual correction) compound errors and underuse demonstrations.

Method: Single-loop optimization that jointly performs retargeting and tracking using reinforcement learning. Derives adaptive spatial scopes from raw trajectories, treats demonstrations as soft guidance, and minimizes control effort while keeping policy in-scope and accomplishing tasks.

Result: Unified formulation preserves demonstration intent, enables robot-specific strategies, improves robustness to noise, and scales to large demonstration corpora. Distills into vision-based, skill-conditioned generative controller that supports generalization across objects and real-world deployment.

Conclusion: Dexplore provides a principled bridge that transforms imperfect human demonstrations into effective training signals for dexterous robotic manipulation, overcoming limitations of traditional multi-stage approaches.

Abstract: Hand-object motion-capture (MoCap) repositories offer large-scale,
contact-rich demonstrations and hold promise for scaling dexterous robotic
manipulation. Yet demonstration inaccuracies and embodiment gaps between human
and robot hands limit the straightforward use of these data. Existing methods
adopt a three-stage workflow, including retargeting, tracking, and residual
correction, which often leaves demonstrations underused and compound errors
across stages. We introduce Dexplore, a unified single-loop optimization that
jointly performs retargeting and tracking to learn robot control policies
directly from MoCap at scale. Rather than treating demonstrations as ground
truth, we use them as soft guidance. From raw trajectories, we derive adaptive
spatial scopes, and train with reinforcement learning to keep the policy
in-scope while minimizing control effort and accomplishing the task. This
unified formulation preserves demonstration intent, enables robot-specific
strategies to emerge, improves robustness to noise, and scales to large
demonstration corpora. We distill the scaled tracking policy into a
vision-based, skill-conditioned generative controller that encodes diverse
manipulation skills in a rich latent representation, supporting generalization
across objects and real-world deployment. Taken together, these contributions
position Dexplore as a principled bridge that transforms imperfect
demonstrations into effective training signals for dexterous manipulation.

### [211] [Database Views as Explanations for Relational Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09482)
*Agapi Rissaki,Ilias Fountalis,Wolfgang Gatterbauer,Benny Kimelfeld*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: A framework for explaining ML models over relational databases using view definitions that highlight database parts contributing to predictions, with adaptations of determinacy concept and heuristic algorithms for efficient generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models over relational databases (like hetero-GNNs) create complex numerical expressions that are hard to explain in human-understandable terms, making it difficult to understand how models use available data for predictions.

Method: Proposes global abductive explanations using view definitions that highlight relevant database parts. Adapts Nash-Segoufin-Vianu determinacy concept, uses heuristic algorithms to avoid exhaustive search, and includes model-agnostic techniques plus hetero-GNN-specific learnable masking.

Result: Extensive evaluation on RelBench collection shows the framework produces useful explanations and generates them efficiently across various domains and record-level tasks.

Conclusion: The framework successfully provides human-understandable explanations for ML models over relational databases, balancing determinacy and conciseness while controlling granularity through different view definition fragments.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been significant progress in the development of
deep learning models over relational databases, including architectures based
on heterogeneous graph neural networks (hetero-GNNs) and heterogeneous graph
transformers. In effect, such architectures state how the database records and
links (e.g., foreign-key references) translate into a large, complex numerical
expression, involving numerous learnable parameters. This complexity makes it
hard to explain, in human-understandable terms, how a model uses the available
data to arrive at a given prediction. We present a novel framework for
explaining machine-learning models over relational databases, where
explanations are view definitions that highlight focused parts of the database
that mostly contribute to the model's prediction. We establish such global
abductive explanations by adapting the classic notion of determinacy by Nash,
Segoufin, and Vianu (2010). In addition to tuning the tradeoff between
determinacy and conciseness, the framework allows controlling the level of
granularity by adopting different fragments of view definitions, such as ones
highlighting whole columns, foreign keys between tables, relevant groups of
tuples, and so on. We investigate the realization of the framework in the case
of hetero-GNNs. We develop heuristic algorithms that avoid the exhaustive
search over the space of all databases. We propose techniques that are
model-agnostic, and others that are tailored to hetero-GNNs via the notion of
learnable masking. Our approach is evaluated through an extensive empirical
study on the RelBench collection, covering a variety of domains and different
record-level tasks. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed
explanations, as well as the efficiency of their generation.

### [212] [Bona fide Cross Testing Reveals Weak Spot in Audio Deepfake Detection Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09204)
*Chin Yuen Kwok,Jia Qi Yip,Zhen Qiu,Chi Hung Chi,Kwok Yan Lam*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Proposes bona fide cross-testing framework to address limitations in current audio deepfake detection evaluation, using diverse bona fide datasets and aggregated EERs for more balanced and reliable assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current audio deepfake detection evaluation methods disproportionately weight synthesizers with more samples and lack diversity in bona fide speech, limiting real-world simulation and reliability of single EER metrics.

Method: Introduces bona fide cross-testing framework that incorporates diverse bona fide datasets and aggregates EERs across multiple synthesizers for more balanced evaluation. Benchmarked over 150 synthesizers across nine bona fide speech types.

Result: The proposed approach improves robustness and interpretability compared to traditional evaluation methods, providing more reliable assessment of audio deepfake detection models.

Conclusion: The bona fide cross-testing framework addresses critical limitations in current evaluation practices and a new dataset is released to facilitate further research in audio deepfake detection evaluation.

Abstract: Audio deepfake detection (ADD) models are commonly evaluated using datasets
that combine multiple synthesizers, with performance reported as a single Equal
Error Rate (EER). However, this approach disproportionately weights
synthesizers with more samples, underrepresenting others and reducing the
overall reliability of EER. Additionally, most ADD datasets lack diversity in
bona fide speech, often featuring a single environment and speech style (e.g.,
clean read speech), limiting their ability to simulate real-world conditions.
To address these challenges, we propose bona fide cross-testing, a novel
evaluation framework that incorporates diverse bona fide datasets and
aggregates EERs for more balanced assessments. Our approach improves robustness
and interpretability compared to traditional evaluation methods. We benchmark
over 150 synthesizers across nine bona fide speech types and release a new
dataset to facilitate further research at

### [213] [DiFlow-TTS: Discrete Flow Matching with Factorized Speech Tokens for Low-Latency Zero-Shot Text-To-Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09631)
*Ngoc-Son Nguyen,Hieu-Nghia Huynh-Nguyen,Thanh V. T. Tran,Truong-Son Hy,Van Nguyen*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: DiFlow-TTS is the first discrete flow matching model for zero-shot TTS that achieves fast inference (25.8x speedup) while maintaining high quality in naturalness, prosody, and speaker style preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot TTS methods suffer from slow inference and repetition artifacts. While discrete codec representations show promise, current flow-matching approaches embed tokens into continuous space, failing to fully leverage discrete advantages.

Method: DiFlow-TTS uses purely discrete flow matching with factorized speech attributes. It employs in-context learning with text, prosodic, and acoustic attributes from reference speech, plus factorized flow prediction with separate heads for prosody and acoustic details.

Result: Achieves promising performance in naturalness, prosody, speaker style preservation, and energy control. Generates speech 25.8x faster than latest baselines while maintaining compact model size.

Conclusion: Discrete flow matching effectively addresses zero-shot TTS challenges, enabling fast, high-quality speech synthesis with accurate attribute modeling in a purely discrete framework.

Abstract: Zero-shot Text-to-Speech (TTS) aims to synthesize high-quality speech that
mimics the voice of an unseen speaker using only a short reference sample,
requiring not only speaker adaptation but also accurate modeling of prosodic
attributes. Recent approaches based on language models, diffusion, and flow
matching have shown promising results in zero-shot TTS, but still suffer from
slow inference and repetition artifacts. Discrete codec representations have
been widely adopted for speech synthesis, and recent works have begun to
explore diffusion models in purely discrete settings, suggesting the potential
of discrete generative modeling for speech synthesis. However, existing
flow-matching methods typically embed these discrete tokens into a continuous
space and apply continuous flow matching, which may not fully leverage the
advantages of discrete representations. To address these challenges, we
introduce DiFlow-TTS, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first model
to explore purely Discrete Flow Matching for speech synthesis. DiFlow-TTS
explicitly models factorized speech attributes within a compact and unified
architecture. It leverages in-context learning by conditioning on textual
content, along with prosodic and acoustic attributes extracted from a reference
speech, enabling effective attribute cloning in a zero-shot setting. In
addition, the model employs a factorized flow prediction mechanism with
distinct heads for prosody and acoustic details, allowing it to learn
aspect-specific distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that DiFlow-TTS
achieves promising performance in several key metrics, including naturalness,
prosody, preservation of speaker style, and energy control. It also maintains a
compact model size and achieves low-latency inference, generating speech up to
25.8 times faster than the latest existing baselines.

*Seung Gyu Jeong,Seong Eun Kim*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: A knowledge distillation system with device-aware feature alignment and test-time device-specific fine-tuning achieves 57.93% accuracy on DCASE 2025 Challenge Task 1, significantly outperforming the baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the dual challenges of strict complexity constraints and robust generalization to both seen and unseen devices in acoustic scene classification, while leveraging the new rule allowing device labels at test time.

Method: A knowledge distillation framework using an efficient CP-MobileNet student learning from a two-teacher ensemble (baseline PaSST + generalization expert with Device-Aware Feature Alignment loss), followed by device-specific fine-tuning using test-time device labels.

Result: Achieves 57.93% accuracy on the development set, showing significant improvement over the official baseline, particularly on unseen devices.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively combines knowledge distillation with device-aware feature alignment and test-time adaptation to achieve robust acoustic scene classification under strict complexity constraints.

Abstract: In this technical report, we describe our submission for Task 1,
Low-Complexity Device-Robust Acoustic Scene Classification, of the DCASE 2025
Challenge. Our work tackles the dual challenges of strict complexity
constraints and robust generalization to both seen and unseen devices, while
also leveraging the new rule allowing the use of device labels at test time.
Our proposed system is based on a knowledge distillation framework where an
efficient CP-MobileNet student learns from a compact, specialized two-teacher
ensemble. This ensemble combines a baseline PaSST teacher, trained with
standard cross-entropy, and a 'generalization expert' teacher. This expert is
trained using our novel Device-Aware Feature Alignment (DAFA) loss, adapted
from prior work, which explicitly structures the feature space for device
robustness. To capitalize on the availability of test-time device labels, the
distilled student model then undergoes a final device-specific fine-tuning
stage. Our proposed system achieves a final accuracy of 57.93\% on the
development set, demonstrating a significant improvement over the official
baseline, particularly on unseen devices.

### [215] [Finite Scalar Quantization Enables Redundant and Transmission-Robust Neural Audio Compression at Low Bit-rates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09550)
*Harry Julia,Rachel Beeson,Lohith Konathala,Johanna Ulin,Jiameng Gao*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: NeuCodec is a neural audio codec using Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) that shows superior robustness to channel noise compared to traditional Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) codecs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural audio codecs rely on RVQ, but FSQ offers simplified training and single codebook support. The paper explores FSQ's inherent redundancy properties for robust audio transmission.

Method: Introduced NeuCodec based on FSQ. Conducted encoder distillation experiments showing different encoders produce different codes with same quality. Compared RVQ vs FSQ robustness by simulating noisy channel transmission.

Result: FSQ encodes baked-in redundancy making it robust to noisy channels. Two different encoders learned to encode identical audio into vastly different code sequences while maintaining comparable reconstruction quality. FSQ showed vastly superior bit-level perturbation robustness compared to RVQ.

Conclusion: FSQ-based neural audio codecs like NeuCodec offer significant advantages in robustness for noisy channel transmission while maintaining audio reconstruction quality, making them a compelling alternative to traditional RVQ approaches.

Abstract: Neural Audio Codecs (NACs) have become increasingly adopted in speech
processing tasks due to their excellent rate-distortion performance and
compatibility with Large Language Models (LLMs) as discrete feature
representations for audio generation. While most existing codecs rely on
Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ), Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) has
recently emerged as a compelling alternative that simplifies training and
natively supports single codebooks. We introduce NeuCodec, an FSQ-based NAC,
and show that FSQ encodes baked-in redundancy which produces an encoding which
is robust when transmitted through noisy channels. First, through an encoder
distillation experiment, we show that two different encoders can learn to
encode identical audio into vastly different code sequences whilst maintaining
comparable reconstruction quality with the same quantizer and decoder. Second,
we demonstrate that FSQ has vastly superior bit-level perturbation robustness
by comparing the performance of RVQ and FSQ codecs when simulating the
transmission of code sequences through a noisy channel.

*Yancheng Cai,Robert Wanat,Rafal Mantiuk*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: CameraVDP framework combines camera-based display measurement with visual difference prediction to perceptually assess display artifacts and distortions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional display measurement methods using sparse radiometric sampling fail to capture high-frequency and pixel-level artifacts, while cameras introduce optical and photometric distortions that need to be accounted for in perceptual assessment.

Method: Combines HDR image stacking, MTF inversion, vignetting correction, geometric undistortion, homography transformation, and color correction with a Visual Difference Predictor (VDP) to model human visual system perception under different viewing conditions.

Result: Validated through three applications: defective pixel detection, color fringing awareness, and display non-uniformity evaluation. Provides uncertainty analysis with theoretical upper bounds for defect detection and confidence intervals for VDP quality scores.

Conclusion: The CameraVDP framework enables cameras to function as precise display measurement instruments for perceptual assessment by accounting for both camera measurement inaccuracies and visual difference prediction.

Abstract: Accurate measurement of images produced by electronic displays is critical
for the evaluation of both traditional and computational displays. Traditional
display measurement methods based on sparse radiometric sampling and fitting a
model are inadequate for capturing spatially varying display artifacts, as they
fail to capture high-frequency and pixel-level distortions. While cameras offer
sufficient spatial resolution, they introduce optical, sampling, and
photometric distortions. Furthermore, the physical measurement must be combined
with a model of a visual system to assess whether the distortions are going to
be visible. To enable perceptual assessment of displays, we propose a
combination of a camera-based reconstruction pipeline with a visual difference
predictor, which account for both the inaccuracy of camera measurements and
visual difference prediction. The reconstruction pipeline combines HDR image
stacking, MTF inversion, vignetting correction, geometric undistortion,
homography transformation, and color correction, enabling cameras to function
as precise display measurement instruments. By incorporating a Visual
Difference Predictor (VDP), our system models the visibility of various stimuli
under different viewing conditions for the human visual system. We validate the
proposed CameraVDP framework through three applications: defective pixel
detection, color fringing awareness, and display non-uniformity evaluation. Our
uncertainty analysis framework enables the estimation of the theoretical upper
bound for defect pixel detection performance and provides confidence intervals
for VDP quality scores.

*Shangqing Shi,Luoxiao Zhang,Yuchen Yin,Xiong Yang,Hoileong Lee*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: MRIME-CD is an enhanced RIME algorithm that uses covariance learning, average bootstrapping, and stochastic covariance strategies to improve population diversity, balance exploration/exploitation, and escape local optima.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The original RIME algorithm suffers from rapid loss of population diversity, tendency to fall into local optima, and unbalanced exploitation-exploration capabilities.

Method: Three strategies: 1) Covariance learning in soft-rime search stage for population diversity, 2) Average bootstrapping in hard-rime puncture mechanism for global search, 3) Stochastic covariance learning with stagnation indicator to escape local optima.

Result: Tested on CEC2017 and CEC2022 benchmarks, MRIME-CD shows significant improvements in solution accuracy, convergence speed, and stability compared to basic RIME.

Conclusion: MRIME-CD effectively addresses RIME's limitations and demonstrates superior optimization performance across multiple test sets and statistical analyses.

Abstract: Metaheuristics are widely applied for their ability to provide more efficient
solutions. The RIME algorithm is a recently proposed physical-based
metaheuristic algorithm with certain advantages. However, it suffers from rapid
loss of population diversity during optimization and is prone to fall into
local optima, leading to unbalanced exploitation and exploration. To address
the shortcomings of RIME, this paper proposes a modified RIME with covariance
learning and diversity enhancement (MRIME-CD). The algorithm applies three
strategies to improve the optimization capability. First, a covariance learning
strategy is introduced in the soft-rime search stage to increase the population
diversity and balance the over-exploitation ability of RIME through the
bootstrapping effect of dominant populations. Second, in order to moderate the
tendency of RIME population to approach the optimal individual in the early
search stage, an average bootstrapping strategy is introduced into the
hard-rime puncture mechanism, which guides the population search through the
weighted position of the dominant populations, thus enhancing the global search
ability of RIME in the early stage. Finally, a new stagnation indicator is
proposed, and a stochastic covariance learning strategy is used to update the
stagnant individuals in the population when the algorithm gets stagnant, thus
enhancing the ability to jump out of the local optimal solution. The proposed
MRIME-CD algorithm is subjected to a series of validations on the CEC2017 test
set, the CEC2022 test set, and the experimental results are analyzed using the
Friedman test, the Wilcoxon rank sum test, and the Kruskal Wallis test. The
results show that MRIME-CD can effectively improve the performance of basic
RIME and has obvious superiorities in terms of solution accuracy, convergence
speed and stability.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: Enhanced Educational Competition Optimizer (IECO-MCO) with multi-covariance learning operators improves ECO algorithm by balancing exploration-exploitation and preventing premature convergence, outperforming basic ECO and other algorithms on benchmark functions and real-world optimization problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The basic Educational Competition Optimizer (ECO) faces limitations due to imbalance between exploitation and exploration, making it susceptible to local optima and ineffective for complex optimization problems.

Method: Introduces three distinct covariance learning operators to enhance ECO performance, assessed through CEC 2017 and CEC 2022 benchmark functions with statistical validation using Friedman, Kruskal-Wallis, and Wilcoxon tests.

Result: IECO-MCO achieved average rankings of 2.213 (vs basic algorithms) and 2.488 (vs improved algorithms) on test suites, demonstrating superior convergence speed, stability, and local optima avoidance capabilities.

Conclusion: IECO-MCO shows robust performance and practical effectiveness in solving complex optimization problems, validated through both benchmark testing and real-world constrained optimization applications.

Abstract: The educational competition optimizer is a recently introduced metaheuristic
algorithm inspired by human behavior, originating from the dynamics of
educational competition within society. Nonetheless, ECO faces constraints due
to an imbalance between exploitation and exploration, rendering it susceptible
to local optima and demonstrating restricted effectiveness in addressing
complex optimization problems. To address these limitations, this study
presents an enhanced educational competition optimizer (IECO-MCO) utilizing
multi-covariance learning operators. In IECO, three distinct covariance
learning operators are introduced to improve the performance of ECO. Each
operator effectively balances exploitation and exploration while preventing
premature convergence of the population. The effectiveness of IECO is assessed
through benchmark functions derived from the CEC 2017 and CEC 2022 test suites,
and its performance is compared with various basic and improved algorithms
across different categories. The results demonstrate that IECO-MCO surpasses
the basic ECO and other competing algorithms in convergence speed, stability,
and the capability to avoid local optima. Furthermore, statistical analyses,
including the Friedman test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Wilcoxon rank-sum test,
are conducted to validate the superiority of IECO-MCO over the compared
algorithms. Compared with the basic algorithm (improved algorithm), IECO-MCO
achieved an average ranking of 2.213 (2.488) on the CE2017 and CEC2022 test
suites. Additionally, the practical applicability of the proposed IECO-MCO
algorithm is verified by solving constrained optimization problems. The
experimental outcomes demonstrate the superior performance of IECO-MCO in
tackling intricate optimization problems, underscoring its robustness and
practical effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: Quantum generative models that are classically hard to simulate, efficiently trainable, and demonstrate quantum advantage in learning and sampling complex distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge of demonstrating generative quantum advantage - showing quantum computers can learn and generate outputs substantially better than classical computers, which has been hindered by complexity issues in quantum experiments.

Method: Introducing families of generative quantum models that are classically hard to simulate but efficiently trainable, using a 68-qubit superconducting quantum processor to demonstrate capabilities in learning classically intractable distributions and quantum circuits for accelerated physical simulation.

Result: Successful demonstration that both learning and sampling can be performed efficiently in the beyond-classical regime, establishing quantum-enhanced generative models with provable advantage.

Conclusion: The research opens new possibilities for quantum advantage in generative modeling by showing efficient learning and sampling capabilities that surpass classical computational limits.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative machine learning, powered by massive
computational resources, have demonstrated unprecedented human-like
capabilities. While beyond-classical quantum experiments can generate samples
from classically intractable distributions, their complexity has thwarted all
efforts toward efficient learning. This challenge has hindered demonstrations
of generative quantum advantage: the ability of quantum computers to learn and
generate desired outputs substantially better than classical computers. We
resolve this challenge by introducing families of generative quantum models
that are hard to simulate classically, are efficiently trainable, exhibit no
barren plateaus or proliferating local minima, and can learn to generate
distributions beyond the reach of classical computers. Using a $68$-qubit
superconducting quantum processor, we demonstrate these capabilities in two
scenarios: learning classically intractable probability distributions and
learning quantum circuits for accelerated physical simulation. Our results
establish that both learning and sampling can be performed efficiently in the
beyond-classical regime, opening new possibilities for quantum-enhanced
generative models with provable advantage.

TL;DR: PerFairX framework evaluates trade-offs between personality-based personalization and demographic fairness in LLM recommender systems, showing personality-aware prompts improve individual alignment but worsen fairness disparities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs enable zero-shot personality-based recommendations but create tension between psychological alignment and demographic fairness, requiring a unified evaluation framework.

Method: Proposed PerFairX framework with neutral and personality-sensitive prompts, tested on ChatGPT and DeepSeek using MovieLens 10M and Last.fm 360K datasets across diverse user profiles.

Result: Personality-aware prompting improves individual trait alignment but exacerbates fairness disparities; DeepSeek has stronger psychological fit but higher prompt sensitivity, ChatGPT offers stable but less personalized outputs.

Conclusion: PerFairX provides principled benchmarking for developing equitable and psychologically informed LLM-based recommender systems for inclusive, user-centric AI applications.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into recommender systems has
enabled zero-shot, personality-based personalization through prompt-based
interactions, offering a new paradigm for user-centric recommendations.
However, incorporating user personality traits via the OCEAN model highlights a
critical tension between achieving psychological alignment and ensuring
demographic fairness. To address this, we propose PerFairX, a unified
evaluation framework designed to quantify the trade-offs between
personalization and demographic equity in LLM-generated recommendations. Using
neutral and personality-sensitive prompts across diverse user profiles, we
benchmark two state-of-the-art LLMs, ChatGPT and DeepSeek, on movie (MovieLens
10M) and music (Last.fm 360K) datasets. Our results reveal that
personality-aware prompting significantly improves alignment with individual
traits but can exacerbate fairness disparities across demographic groups.
Specifically, DeepSeek achieves stronger psychological fit but exhibits higher
sensitivity to prompt variations, while ChatGPT delivers stable yet less
personalized outputs. PerFairX provides a principled benchmark to guide the
development of LLM-based recommender systems that are both equitable and
psychologically informed, contributing to the creation of inclusive,
user-centric AI applications in continual learning contexts.

### [221] [Deep opacity and AI: A threat to XAI and to privacy protection mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08835)
*Vincent C. Müller*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: Big data analytics and AI create privacy threats through opacity problems that prevent proper justification for judgments and actions, making privacy protection difficult.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze how opacity in AI systems undermines privacy protection by preventing informed consent and anonymity guarantees.

Method: Distinguishes three types of opacity: shallow opacity (subjects don't know), standard black box opacity (analysts don't know), and deep opacity (analysts cannot possibly know).

Result: Agents in big data analytics cannot provide necessary justifications for privacy-protecting judgments, making privacy problems worse and remedies less effective.

Conclusion: Big data analytics exacerbates privacy issues due to opacity problems, though technical solutions may offer some mitigation.

Abstract: It is known that big data analytics and AI pose a threat to privacy, and that
some of this is due to some kind of "black box problem" in AI. I explain how
this becomes a problem in the context of justification for judgments and
actions. Furthermore, I suggest distinguishing three kinds of opacity: 1) the
subjects do not know what the system does ("shallow opacity"), 2) the analysts
do not know what the system does ("standard black box opacity"), or 3) the
analysts cannot possibly know what the system might do ("deep opacity"). If the
agents, data subjects as well as analytics experts, operate under opacity, then
these agents cannot provide justifications for judgments that are necessary to
protect privacy, e.g., they cannot give "informed consent", or guarantee
"anonymity". It follows from these points that agents in big data analytics and
AI often cannot make the judgments needed to protect privacy. So I conclude
that big data analytics makes the privacy problems worse and the remedies less
effective. As a positive note, I provide a brief outlook on technical ways to
handle this situation.

Result: The approach provides transparent and reproducible evidence of model quality in real-world settings, identifies common pitfalls (data leakage, inadequate domain definitions, bias neglect, lack of drift controls), and offers practical lessons from application.

Conclusion: By aligning technical best practices with emerging European standards, the framework provides regulators, providers, and users with a practical roadmap for legally compliant, functionally trustworthy, and certifiable AI systems, with ongoing research in robustness, fairness, and post-certification requirements.

Abstract: There is an increasing adoption of artificial intelligence in safety-critical
applications, yet practical schemes for certifying that AI systems are safe,
lawful and socially acceptable remain scarce. This white paper presents the
T\"UV AUSTRIA Trusted AI framework an end-to-end audit catalog and methodology
for assessing and certifying machine learning systems. The audit catalog has
been in continuous development since 2019 in an ongoing collaboration with
scientific partners. Building on three pillars - Secure Software Development,
Functional Requirements, and Ethics & Data Privacy - the catalog translates the
high-level obligations of the EU AI Act into specific, testable criteria. Its
core concept of functional trustworthiness couples a statistically defined
application domain with risk-based minimum performance requirements and
statistical testing on independently sampled data, providing transparent and
reproducible evidence of model quality in real-world settings. We provide an
overview of the functional requirements that we assess, which are oriented on
the lifecycle of an AI system. In addition, we share some lessons learned from
the practical application of the audit catalog, highlighting common pitfalls we
encountered, such as data leakage scenarios, inadequate domain definitions,
neglect of biases, or a lack of distribution drift controls. We further discuss
key aspects of certifying AI systems, such as robustness, algorithmic fairness,
or post-certification requirements, outlining both our current conclusions and
a roadmap for future research. In general, by aligning technical best practices
with emerging European standards, the approach offers regulators, providers,
and users a practical roadmap for legally compliant, functionally trustworthy,

TL;DR: Pilot study on vibe coding (AI-assisted software development using natural language) for EFL education, showing that students' success depends on their meta-languaging skills with AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how AI can serve as a languaging machine in EFL education and understand the factors that influence students' success in vibe coding applications.

Method: Case study methodology with two students in a 4-hour workshop using backward design principles. Data collected from worksheets, video recordings, think-aloud protocols, screen recordings, and AI-generated images.

Result: One student successfully created a functional application while another encountered technical difficulties. Differences in prompt engineering approaches and AI mental models explained outcome variations.

Conclusion: Effective vibe coding instruction requires explicit meta-languaging scaffolding, structured prompt engineering teaching, critical authorship discussions, and vocabulary development for articulating AI mental models.

Abstract: This innovative practice article reports on the piloting of vibe coding
(using natural language to create software applications with AI) for English as
a Foreign Language (EFL) education. We developed a human-AI meta-languaging
framework with three dimensions: talking to AI (prompt engineering), talking
through AI (negotiating authorship), and talking about AI (mental models of
AI). Using backward design principles, we created a four-hour workshop where
two students designed applications addressing authentic EFL writing challenges.
We adopted a case study methodology, collecting data from worksheets and video
recordings, think-aloud protocols, screen recordings, and AI-generated images.
Contrasting cases showed one student successfully vibe coding a functional
application cohering to her intended design, while another encountered
technical difficulties with major gaps between intended design and actual
functionality. Analysis reveals differences in students' prompt engineering
approaches, suggesting different AI mental models and tensions in attributing
authorship. We argue that AI functions as a beneficial languaging machine, and
that differences in how students talk to, through, and about AI explain vibe
coding outcome variations. Findings indicate that effective vibe coding
instruction requires explicit meta-languaging scaffolding, teaching structured
prompt engineering, facilitating critical authorship discussions, and
developing vocabulary for articulating AI mental models.

### [224] [Investigating Student Interaction Patterns with Large Language Model-Powered Course Assistants in Computer Science Courses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08862)
*Chang Liu,Loc Hoang,Andrew Stolman,Rene F. Kizilcec,Bo Wu*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: LLM-powered course assistant deployed to 2000+ CS students shows strong evening/night usage, helps address temporal support gaps and novice needs, but has limitations in generating higher-order questions and needs educator oversight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of providing flexible academic support outside scheduled hours by leveraging LLMs to bridge the gap in student assistance availability.

Method: Developed and deployed an LLM-powered course assistant across 6 computer science courses at 3 institutions, analyzed interaction data from ~2000 students, and manually annotated 200 conversations per course to assess response quality and pedagogical effectiveness.

Result: Usage was strong during evenings/nights and higher in introductory courses; most responses were correct and helpful (with some unhelpful/erroneous); only ~11% contained LLM-generated follow-up questions; limited capability in generating higher-order cognitive questions per Bloom's taxonomy.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for addressing temporal support gaps but require pedagogically oriented systems with greater educator involvement in configuring prompts, content, and policies to maximize educational effectiveness.

Abstract: Providing students with flexible and timely academic support is a challenge
at most colleges and universities, leaving many students without help outside
scheduled hours. Large language models (LLMs) are promising for bridging this
gap, but interactions between students and LLMs are rarely overseen by
educators. We developed and studied an LLM-powered course assistant deployed
across multiple computer science courses to characterize real-world use and
understand pedagogical implications. By Spring 2024, our system had been
deployed to approximately 2,000 students across six courses at three
institutions. Analysis of the interaction data shows that usage remains strong
in the evenings and nights and is higher in introductory courses, indicating
that our system helps address temporal support gaps and novice learner needs.
We sampled 200 conversations per course for manual annotation: most sampled
responses were judged correct and helpful, with a small share unhelpful or
erroneous; few responses included dedicated examples. We also examined an
inquiry-based learning strategy: only around 11% of sampled conversations
contained LLM-generated follow-up questions, which were often ignored by
students in advanced courses. A Bloom's taxonomy analysis reveals that current
LLM capabilities are limited in generating higher-order cognitive questions.
These patterns suggest opportunities for pedagogically oriented LLM-based
educational systems and greater educator involvement in configuring prompts,
content, and policies.

*Oriane Peter,Kate Devlin*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: Current LLM alignment methods impose narrow normative preferences on users. This paper proposes decentralizing alignment through context, pluralism, and participation to resist epistemic injustice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current alignment techniques predominantly reflect the values of a narrow reference group, centralizing control over knowledge production within influential institutions, which imposes their values on a broad user base.

Method: Proposes decentralizing alignment through three characteristics: context (delineating context-of-use), pluralism (incorporating diverse values), and participation (engaging broader stakeholders). Grounds these features in concrete use cases.

Result: Demonstrates the critical importance of context-specific alignment practices and provides concrete examples illustrating how decentralization strategies can work across different usage contexts.

Conclusion: LLM alignment can serve as a site of resistance against epistemic injustice and democratic erosion, though these strategies alone cannot substitute for broader societal changes. The paper highlights the need for context-aware, pluralistic, and participatory alignment approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) alignment methods have been credited with the
commercial success of products like ChatGPT, given their role in steering LLMs
towards user-friendly outputs. However, current alignment techniques
predominantly mirror the normative preferences of a narrow reference group,
effectively imposing their values on a wide user base. Drawing on theories of
the power/knowledge nexus, this work argues that current alignment practices
centralise control over knowledge production and governance within already
influential institutions. To counter this, we propose decentralising alignment
through three characteristics: context, pluralism, and participation.
Furthermore, this paper demonstrates the critical importance of delineating the
context-of-use when shaping alignment practices by grounding each of these
features in concrete use cases. This work makes the following contributions:
(1) highlighting the role of context, pluralism, and participation in
decentralising alignment; (2) providing concrete examples to illustrate these
strategies; and (3) demonstrating the nuanced requirements associated with
applying alignment across different contexts of use. Ultimately, this paper
positions LLM alignment as a potential site of resistance against epistemic
injustice and the erosion of democratic processes, while acknowledging that
these strategies alone cannot substitute for broader societal changes.

*Avinash Agarwal,Manisha J. Nene*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: Paper identifies regulatory gaps for AI incidents in telecommunications, proposes mandatory reporting framework for high-risk AI failures using India as case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI integration in telecom introduces novel risks like algorithmic bias that fall outside traditional cybersecurity frameworks, creating regulatory gaps.

Method: Analyzes India's digital regulations (Telecom Act 2023, CERT-In Rules, DPDP Act 2023) as case study for jurisdictions without horizontal AI law, examines structural barriers to disclosure.

Result: Existing legal instruments focus on cybersecurity/data breaches, leaving significant gap for AI-specific operational incidents like performance degradation and algorithmic bias.

Conclusion: Proposes mandatory reporting for high-risk AI failures, designating nodal agency, and standardized frameworks to enhance regulatory clarity and resilience, offering blueprint for other nations.

Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into telecommunications
infrastructure introduces novel risks, such as algorithmic bias and
unpredictable system behavior, that fall outside the scope of traditional
cybersecurity and data protection frameworks. This paper introduces a precise
definition and a detailed typology of telecommunications AI incidents,
establishing them as a distinct category of risk that extends beyond
conventional cybersecurity and data protection breaches. It argues for their
recognition as a distinct regulatory concern. Using India as a case study for
jurisdictions that lack a horizontal AI law, the paper analyzes the country's
key digital regulations. The analysis reveals that India's existing legal
instruments, including the Telecommunications Act, 2023, the CERT-In Rules, and
the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, focus on cybersecurity and data
breaches, creating a significant regulatory gap for AI-specific operational
incidents, such as performance degradation and algorithmic bias. The paper also
examines structural barriers to disclosure and the limitations of existing AI
incident repositories. Based on these findings, the paper proposes targeted
policy recommendations centered on integrating AI incident reporting into
India's existing telecom governance. Key proposals include mandating reporting
for high-risk AI failures, designating an existing government body as a nodal
agency to manage incident data, and developing standardized reporting
frameworks. These recommendations aim to enhance regulatory clarity and
strengthen long-term resilience, offering a pragmatic and replicable blueprint
for other nations seeking to govern AI risks within their existing sectoral
frameworks.

*Le Duc Hieu*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper analyzes when the optimization curve of first-order methods (sequence of function values) is convex, specifically for gradient descent on convex L-smooth functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the convexity properties of optimization curves in discrete-time gradient descent methods and connect them with continuous-time gradient flow dynamics.

Method: Theoretical analysis of gradient descent with constant stepsize on convex L-smooth functions, examining when the sequence of function values f(x_n) produces a convex curve (nonincreasing forward differences).

Result: For gradient descent: convex optimization curve for all stepsizes η ≤ 1.75/L (tight threshold), gradient norms nonincreasing for η ≤ 2/L, and continuous-time gradient flow always produces convex curves.

Conclusion: The results refine classical smooth convex optimization theory by establishing precise thresholds for convex optimization curves and connecting discrete and continuous optimization dynamics.

Abstract: We study when the \emph{optimization curve} of first-order methods -- the
sequence \${f(x\_n)}*{n\ge0}\$ produced by constant-stepsize iterations -- is
convex, equivalently when the forward differences \$f(x\_n)-f(x*{n+1})\$ are
nonincreasing. For gradient descent (GD) on convex \$L\$-smooth functions, the
curve is convex for all stepsizes \$\eta \le 1.75/L\$, and this threshold is
tight. Moreover, gradient norms are nonincreasing for all \$\eta \le 2/L\$, and
in continuous time (gradient flow) the curve is always convex. These results
complement and refine the classical smooth convex optimization toolbox,
connecting discrete and continuous dynamics as well as worst-case analyses.

*Xinquan Huang,Fu Wang,Tariq Alkhalifah*

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: Physics-informed FWI framework that integrates physical constraints into neural operator-based full waveform inversion to reduce noise and artifacts while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full waveform inversion (FWI) faces challenges with limited data null space leading to low-resolution models and high computational costs. Neural operator-based approaches show efficiency but suffer from noisy and unstable inversion performance.

Method: Integrates physics constraint term into loss function, starting with initial model to simulate wavefields, then evaluating loss based on wavefield compliance with physical laws (wave equation) and data matching, rather than relying solely on L2 norm objective.

Result: Numerical experiments on OpenFWI and Overthrust models demonstrate superior performance with cleaner, more accurate subsurface velocity models compared to vanilla approaches, while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The physics-informed framework represents a significant advancement for practical FWI applications in real-time subsurface monitoring by enhancing inversion accuracy while preserving the efficiency of neural operator-based methods.

Abstract: Full waveform inversion (FWI) is crucial for reconstructing high-resolution
subsurface models, but it is often hindered, considering the limited data, by
its null space resulting in low-resolution models, and more importantly, by its
computational cost, especially if needed for real-time applications. Recent
attempts to accelerate FWI using learned wavefield neural operators have shown
promise in efficiency and differentiability, but typically suffer from noisy
and unstable inversion performance. To address these limitations, we introduce
a novel physics-informed FWI framework to enhance the inversion in accuracy
while maintaining the efficiency of neural operator-based FWI. Instead of
relying only on the L2 norm objective function via automatic differentiation,
resulting in noisy model reconstruction, we integrate a physics constraint term
in the loss function of FWI, improving the quality of the inverted velocity
models. Specifically, starting with an initial model to simulate wavefields and
then evaluating the loss over how much the resulting wavefield obeys the
physical laws (wave equation) and matches the recorded data, we achieve a
reduction in noise and artifacts. Numerical experiments using the OpenFWI and
Overthrust models demonstrate our method's superior performance, offering
cleaner and more accurate subsurface velocity than vanilla approaches.
Considering the efficiency of the approach compared to FWI, this advancement
represents a significant step forward in the practical application of FWI for
real-time subsurface monitoring.

*Honglan Yu,Yibin Wang,Feifei Dai,Dong Liu,Haihui Fan,Xiaoyan Gu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: CMIF is a confidential model inference framework that combines TEEs and optimized differential privacy to enable efficient LLM inference while preserving privacy, reducing TEE overhead and maintaining model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for private LLM inference face challenges: TEE-based methods have high latency and communication overhead when offloading nonlinear layers to GPUs, while DP-based methods compromise model performance and semantic understanding with added noise.

Method: CMIF deploys the embedding layer in client-side TEEs and subsequent layers on GPU servers. It optimizes the Report-Noisy-Max differential privacy mechanism to protect sensitive inputs with minimal performance impact.

Result: Extensive experiments on Llama-series models show that CMIF reduces additional inference overhead in TEEs while effectively preserving user data privacy.

Conclusion: CMIF provides an efficient and confidential framework for LLM inference that addresses the limitations of both TEE-only and DP-only approaches, achieving good privacy protection with minimal performance degradation.

Abstract: CPU-based trusted execution environments (TEEs) and differential privacy (DP)
have gained wide applications for private inference. Due to high inference
latency in TEEs, researchers use partition-based approaches that offload linear
model components to GPUs. However, dense nonlinear layers of large language
models (LLMs) result in significant communication overhead between TEEs and
GPUs. DP-based approaches apply random noise to protect data privacy, but this
compromises LLM performance and semantic understanding. To overcome the above
drawbacks, this paper proposes CMIF, a Confidential and efficient Model
Inference Framework. CMIF confidentially deploys the embedding layer in the
client-side TEE and subsequent layers on GPU servers. Meanwhile, it optimizes
the Report-Noisy-Max mechanism to protect sensitive inputs with a slight
decrease in model performance. Extensive experiments on Llama-series models
demonstrate that CMIF reduces additional inference overhead in TEEs while
preserving user data privacy.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: DP-FedLoRA is a privacy-preserving federated fine-tuning framework that combines LoRA adaptation with differential privacy for on-device LLMs, providing strong privacy guarantees while maintaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As on-device LLM systems grow, federated fine-tuning processes sensitive user data, creating significant privacy concerns that need to be addressed within the federated learning framework.

Method: Integrates LoRA-based adaptation with differential privacy. Each client locally clips and perturbs LoRA matrices using Gaussian noise to satisfy (ε, δ)-differential privacy. Provides theoretical analysis of unbiased updates and noise variance bounds.

Result: Experimental results across mainstream benchmarks show competitive performance while offering strong privacy guarantees.

Conclusion: DP-FedLoRA paves the way for scalable and privacy-preserving LLM deployment in on-device environments by effectively balancing privacy protection with model performance.

Abstract: As on-device large language model (LLM) systems become increasingly
prevalent, federated fine-tuning enables advanced language understanding and
generation directly on edge devices; however, it also involves processing
sensitive, user-specific data, raising significant privacy concerns within the
federated learning framework. To address these challenges, we propose
DP-FedLoRA, a privacy-enhanced federated fine-tuning framework that integrates
LoRA-based adaptation with differential privacy in a communication-efficient
setting. Each client locally clips and perturbs its LoRA matrices using
Gaussian noise to satisfy ($\epsilon$, $\delta$)-differential privacy. We
further provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating the unbiased nature of the
updates and deriving bounds on the variance introduced by noise, offering
practical guidance for privacy-budget calibration. Experimental results across
mainstream benchmarks show that DP-FedLoRA delivers competitive performance
while offering strong privacy guarantees, paving the way for scalable and
privacy-preserving LLM deployment in on-device environments.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Character-level perturbations are more effective than token-level attacks for removing LLM watermarks, and genetic algorithm-based attacks can successfully defeat watermark detection even with limited detector access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the misconception that watermark removal requires large perturbations or powerful adversaries, and to demonstrate vulnerabilities in existing LLM watermark schemes under realistic threat models.

Method: Formalized LLM watermark system model, analyzed perturbation types by attack range, proposed character-level perturbations that disrupt tokenization, and developed genetic algorithm-based guided removal attacks using limited black-box detector queries.

Result: Character-level perturbations significantly outperform token-level attacks, GA-based methods show strong removal performance under practical constraints, and adaptive compound attacks can defeat existing defenses.

Conclusion: Existing LLM watermark schemes have significant vulnerabilities, highlighting the urgent need for developing more robust watermarking mechanisms that can withstand character-level perturbation attacks.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) watermarking embeds detectable signals into
generated text for copyright protection, misuse prevention, and content
detection. While prior studies evaluate robustness using watermark removal
attacks, these methods are often suboptimal, creating the misconception that
effective removal requires large perturbations or powerful adversaries.
  To bridge the gap, we first formalize the system model for LLM watermark, and
characterize two realistic threat models constrained on limited access to the
watermark detector. We then analyze how different types of perturbation vary in
their attack range, i.e., the number of tokens they can affect with a single
edit. We observe that character-level perturbations (e.g., typos, swaps,
deletions, homoglyphs) can influence multiple tokens simultaneously by
disrupting the tokenization process. We demonstrate that character-level
perturbations are significantly more effective for watermark removal under the
most restrictive threat model. We further propose guided removal attacks based
on the Genetic Algorithm (GA) that uses a reference detector for optimization.
Under a practical threat model with limited black-box queries to the watermark
detector, our method demonstrates strong removal performance. Experiments
confirm the superiority of character-level perturbations and the effectiveness
of the GA in removing watermarks under realistic constraints. Additionally, we
argue there is an adversarial dilemma when considering potential defenses: any
fixed defense can be bypassed by a suitable perturbation strategy. Motivated by
this principle, we propose an adaptive compound character-level attack.
Experimental results show that this approach can effectively defeat the
defenses. Our findings highlight significant vulnerabilities in existing LLM
watermark schemes and underline the urgency for the development of new robust
mechanisms.

TL;DR: CryptGNN is a secure inference solution for graph neural networks in cloud ML services that protects client data and model parameters using distributed secure multi-party computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable secure third-party GNN model inference in cloud MLaaS while protecting client input data, graph structure, and model parameters from unauthorized access by cloud providers and other parties.

Method: Uses distributed secure multi-party computation (SMPC) techniques for secure message passing and feature transformation layers, works with any number of SMPC parties without requiring trusted servers, and provides provable security even with colluding parties.

Result: Theoretical analysis and empirical experiments demonstrate that CryptGNN achieves both security and efficiency in protecting sensitive data and model parameters during GNN inference.

Conclusion: CryptGNN provides a practical and secure solution for privacy-preserving graph neural network inference in cloud environments, protecting all parties' interests without requiring trusted infrastructure.

Abstract: We present CryptGNN, a secure and effective inference solution for
third-party graph neural network (GNN) models in the cloud, which are accessed
by clients as ML as a service (MLaaS). The main novelty of CryptGNN is its
secure message passing and feature transformation layers using distributed
secure multi-party computation (SMPC) techniques. CryptGNN protects the
client's input data and graph structure from the cloud provider and the
third-party model owner, and it protects the model parameters from the cloud
provider and the clients. CryptGNN works with any number of SMPC parties, does
not require a trusted server, and is provably secure even if P-1 out of P
parties in the cloud collude. Theoretical analysis and empirical experiments
demonstrate the security and efficiency of CryptGNN.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ENSI is a non-interactive secure inference framework that combines optimized CKKS encryption with BitNet LLMs, achieving 8x faster matrix multiplications and 2.6x speedup in softmax operations while reducing bootstrapping to 1%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Secure inference for LLMs faces challenges due to cryptographic protocol complexity and LLMs' massive scale, limiting practical usability of privacy-preserving machine learning.

Method: Co-designs cryptographic protocols with LLM architecture using optimized CKKS encoding with BitNet, integrates sigmoid attention as HE alternative, and embeds bootstrapping in RMSNorm process.

Result: Achieves 8x acceleration in matrix multiplications, 2.6x speedup in softmax inference on CPU, and reduces bootstrapping proportion to just 1% compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: ENSI provides an efficient and practical secure inference framework for LLMs through architectural co-design and optimization strategies, significantly improving performance while maintaining privacy.

Abstract: Secure inference enables privacy-preserving machine learning by leveraging
cryptographic protocols that support computations on sensitive user data
without exposing it. However, integrating cryptographic protocols with large
language models (LLMs) presents significant challenges, as the inherent
complexity of these protocols, together with LLMs' massive parameter scale and
sophisticated architectures, severely limits practical usability. In this work,
we propose ENSI, a novel non-interactive secure inference framework for LLMs,
based on the principle of co-designing the cryptographic protocols and LLM
architecture. ENSI employs an optimized encoding strategy that seamlessly
integrates CKKS scheme with a lightweight LLM variant, BitNet, significantly
reducing the computational complexity of encrypted matrix multiplications. In
response to the prohibitive computational demands of softmax under homomorphic
encryption (HE), we pioneer the integration of the sigmoid attention mechanism
with HE as a seamless, retraining-free alternative. Furthermore, by embedding
the Bootstrapping operation within the RMSNorm process, we efficiently refresh
ciphertexts while markedly decreasing the frequency of costly bootstrapping
invocations. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that ENSI achieves
approximately an 8x acceleration in matrix multiplications and a 2.6x speedup
in softmax inference on CPU compared to state-of-the-art method, with the
proportion of bootstrapping is reduced to just 1%.

*Felix Mächtle,Ashwath Shetty,Jonas Sander,Nils Loose,Sören Pirk,Thomas Eisenbarth*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Researchers identify and exploit a seed vulnerability in diffusion models that enables efficient prompt stealing through seed brute-forcing and genetic algorithm optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt theft poses critical security and privacy concerns as prompts contain significant intellectual and economic value in text-to-image generation systems.

Method: Identified CWE-339 vulnerability in noise generation due to PyTorch's 32-bit seed limitation, developed SeedSnitch for brute-force seed recovery, and created PromptPirate genetic algorithm for prompt stealing using recovered seeds.

Result: 95% of CivitAI images' seeds recoverable in 140 minutes per seed; PromptPirate achieves 8-11% LPIPS improvement over state-of-the-art methods like PromptStealer, P2HP, and CLIP-Interrogator.

Conclusion: The study reveals critical vulnerabilities in diffusion model security, proposes effective countermeasures, and has initiated coordinated mitigation efforts with developers to address the seed generation weakness.

Abstract: Diffusion models have significantly advanced text-to-image generation,
enabling the creation of highly realistic images conditioned on textual prompts
and seeds. Given the considerable intellectual and economic value embedded in
such prompts, prompt theft poses a critical security and privacy concern. In
this paper, we investigate prompt-stealing attacks targeting diffusion models.
We reveal that numerical optimization-based prompt recovery methods are
fundamentally limited as they do not account for the initial random noise used
during image generation. We identify and exploit a noise-generation
vulnerability (CWE-339), prevalent in major image-generation frameworks,
originating from PyTorch's restriction of seed values to a range of $2^{32}$
when generating the initial random noise on CPUs. Through a large-scale
empirical analysis conducted on images shared via the popular platform CivitAI,
we demonstrate that approximately 95% of these images' seed values can be
effectively brute-forced in 140 minutes per seed using our seed-recovery tool,
SeedSnitch. Leveraging the recovered seed, we propose PromptPirate, a genetic
algorithm-based optimization method explicitly designed for prompt stealing.
PromptPirate surpasses state-of-the-art methods, i.e., PromptStealer, P2HP, and
CLIP-Interrogator, achieving an 8-11% improvement in LPIPS similarity.
Furthermore, we introduce straightforward and effective countermeasures that
render seed stealing, and thus optimization-based prompt stealing, ineffective.
We have disclosed our findings responsibly and initiated coordinated mitigation
efforts with the developers to address this critical vulnerability.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper analyzes benign traffic in intrusion detection datasets and finds meaningful sub-categories that can improve multi-class classification performance using unsupervised clustering techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most intrusion detection datasets treat benign traffic as a single large class, but this may not capture meaningful differences in network traffic structure that could improve detection algorithms.

Method: Evaluated structure of benign traffic in NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CIC-IDS 2017 datasets using unsupervised clustering techniques like HDBSCAN and Mean Shift Clustering to identify meaningful sub-categories.

Result: Identified meaningful sub-categories within benign traffic that were previously treated as a single class, showing potential for improved multi-class classification performance.

Conclusion: Taking benign traffic labels at face value overlooks meaningful structural differences; unsupervised clustering can reveal beneficial sub-categories for improving intrusion detection system performance.

Abstract: Supervised machine learning techniques rely on labeled data to achieve high
task performance, but this requires the labels to capture some meaningful
differences in the underlying data structure. For training network intrusion
detection algorithms, most datasets contain a series of attack classes and a
single large benign class which captures all non-attack network traffic. A
review of intrusion detection papers and guides that explicitly state their
data preprocessing steps identified that the majority took the labeled
categories of the dataset at face value when training their algorithms. The
present paper evaluates the structure of benign traffic in several common
intrusion detection datasets (NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CIC-IDS 2017) and
determines whether there are meaningful sub-categories within this traffic
which may improve overall multi-classification performance using common machine
learning techniques. We present an overview of some unsupervised clustering
techniques (e.g., HDBSCAN, Mean Shift Clustering) and show how they
differentially cluster the benign traffic space.

*Felipe Álvarez Barrientos,Tomás Banduc,Isabeau Sirven,Francisco Sahli Costabal*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: WarpPINN-fibers is a physics-informed neural network that improves cardiac motion and strain analysis by incorporating fiber orientation information, outperforming previous methods in accuracy and physiological consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cardiac strain analysis methods lack fiber mechanics, limiting their ability to accurately explain cardiac function and pathologies related to impaired myocardial mechanics.

Method: A physics-informed neural network framework trained to satisfy a hyper-elastic model with three loss components: data-similarity between reference and warped images, tissue incompressibility regularizer, and fiber-stretch penalization using synthetic fibers.

Result: The method improves upon the previous WarpPINN model, effectively controls fiber stretch in synthetic experiments, and outperforms alternative methodologies in landmark-tracking and strain curve prediction on a 15-subject cine-MRI benchmark.

Conclusion: WarpPINN-fibers enables more precise cardiac strain quantification through accurate deformation fields consistent with fiber physiology, using standard MRI without requiring more sophisticated imaging techniques.

Abstract: The contractile motion of the heart is strongly determined by the
distribution of the fibers that constitute cardiac tissue. Strain analysis
informed with the orientation of fibers allows to describe several pathologies
that are typically associated with impaired mechanics of the myocardium, such
as cardiovascular disease. Several methods have been developed to estimate
strain-derived metrics from traditional imaging techniques. However, the
physical models underlying these methods do not include fiber mechanics,
restricting their capacity to accurately explain cardiac function. In this
work, we introduce WarpPINN-fibers, a physics-informed neural network framework
to accurately obtain cardiac motion and strains enhanced by fiber information.
We train our neural network to satisfy a hyper-elastic model and promote fiber
contraction with the goal to predict the deformation field of the heart from
cine magnetic resonance images. For this purpose, we build a loss function
composed of three terms: a data-similarity loss between the reference and the
warped template images, a regularizer enforcing near-incompressibility of
cardiac tissue and a fiber-stretch penalization that controls strain in the
direction of synthetically produced fibers. We show that our neural network
improves the former WarpPINN model and effectively controls fiber stretch in a
synthetic phantom experiment. Then, we demonstrate that WarpPINN-fibers
outperforms alternative methodologies in landmark-tracking and strain curve
prediction for a cine-MRI benchmark with a cohort of 15 healthy volunteers. We
expect that our method will enable a more precise quantification of cardiac
strains through accurate deformation fields that are consistent with fiber
physiology, without requiring imaging techniques more sophisticated than MRI.

*Sarah C. Irvine,Christian Lucas,Diana Krüger,Bianca Guedert,Julian Moosmann,Berit Zeller-Plumhoff*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces virtual staining for 3D X-ray histology using deep learning to generate artificially stained tissue images from micro-CT scans, enabling label-free 3D tissue characterization without physical sectioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: X-ray tomography provides non-invasive 3D imaging but lacks biochemical specificity compared to traditional histological stains. The research aims to bridge this gap by extending virtual staining techniques from optical to X-ray domain.

Method: Used modified CycleGAN network trained on 50+ co-registered micro-CT and toluidine blue-stained histology image pairs from bone-implant samples. Incorporated pixelwise supervision and greyscale consistency terms with patch-based training and data augmentation.

Result: The method outperformed Pix2Pix and standard CycleGAN baselines across SSIM, PSNR, and LPIPS metrics. Successfully reproduced features like new bone formation and generated histologically realistic color outputs while preserving structural detail.

Conclusion: This work successfully introduces virtual staining to 3D X-ray imaging, providing a scalable route for chemically informative, label-free tissue characterization. Some variability in implant degradation depiction indicates need for more training data and refinement.

Abstract: Three-dimensional X-ray histology techniques offer a non-invasive alternative
to conventional 2D histology, enabling volumetric imaging of biological tissues
without the need for physical sectioning or chemical staining. However, the
inherent greyscale image contrast of X-ray tomography limits its biochemical
specificity compared to traditional histological stains. Within digital
pathology, deep learning-based virtual staining has demonstrated utility in
simulating stained appearances from label-free optical images. In this study,
we extend virtual staining to the X-ray domain by applying cross-modality image
translation to generate artificially stained slices from
synchrotron-radiation-based micro-CT scans. Using over 50 co-registered image
pairs of micro-CT and toluidine blue-stained histology from bone-implant
samples, we trained a modified CycleGAN network tailored for limited paired
data. Whole slide histology images were downsampled to match the voxel size of
the CT data, with on-the-fly data augmentation for patch-based training. The
model incorporates pixelwise supervision and greyscale consistency terms,
producing histologically realistic colour outputs while preserving
high-resolution structural detail. Our method outperformed Pix2Pix and standard
CycleGAN baselines across SSIM, PSNR, and LPIPS metrics. Once trained, the
model can be applied to full CT volumes to generate virtually stained 3D
datasets, enhancing interpretability without additional sample preparation.
While features such as new bone formation were able to be reproduced, some
variability in the depiction of implant degradation layers highlights the need
for further training data and refinement. This work introduces virtual staining
to 3D X-ray imaging and offers a scalable route for chemically informative,
label-free tissue characterisation in biomedical research.

TL;DR: Novel dynamic structural parameters integrated into multimodal deep learning improve prediction of postoperative visual recovery in macular hole patients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance prediction accuracy for postoperative visual recovery in idiopathic full-thickness macular hole patients by incorporating dynamic structural parameters and multimodal deep learning.

Method: Used longitudinal OCT dataset at five timepoints, developed stage-specific segmentation model, extracted quantitative/composite/qualitative/dynamic features, built binary logistic regression models with/without dynamic parameters, and created multimodal DL model combining clinical variables, OCT features, and raw images.

Result: Segmentation achieved high accuracy (mean Dice > 0.89). Dynamic recovery rates improved logistic regression AUC, especially at 3-month follow-up. Multimodal DL model outperformed logistic regression with up to 0.12 higher AUC, showing complementary value of raw images and dynamic parameters.

Conclusion: Integration of dynamic parameters into multimodal DL significantly enhances prediction accuracy, representing a promising automated clinical decision support tool for personalized postoperative management in macular hole surgery.

Abstract: Purpose: To introduce novel dynamic structural parameters and evaluate their
integration within a multimodal deep learning (DL) framework for predicting
postoperative visual recovery in idiopathic full-thickness macular hole (iFTMH)
patients. Methods: We utilized a publicly available longitudinal OCT dataset at
five stages (preoperative, 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months). A stage
specific segmentation model delineated related structures, and an automated
pipeline extracted quantitative, composite, qualitative, and dynamic features.
Binary logistic regression models, constructed with and without dynamic
parameters, assessed their incremental predictive value for best-corrected
visual acuity (BCVA). A multimodal DL model combining clinical variables,
OCT-derived features, and raw OCT images was developed and benchmarked against
regression models. Results: The segmentation model achieved high accuracy
across all timepoints (mean Dice > 0.89). Univariate and multivariate analyses
identified base diameter, ellipsoid zone integrity, and macular hole area as
significant BCVA predictors (P < 0.05). Incorporating dynamic recovery rates
consistently improved logistic regression AUC, especially at the 3-month
follow-up. The multimodal DL model outperformed logistic regression, yielding
higher AUCs and overall accuracy at each stage. The difference is as high as
0.12, demonstrating the complementary value of raw image volume and dynamic
parameters. Conclusions: Integrating dynamic parameters into the multimodal DL
model significantly enhances the accuracy of predictions. This fully automated
process therefore represents a promising clinical decision support tool for
personalized postoperative management in macular hole surgery.

### [239] [In-Loop Filtering Using Learned Look-Up Tables for Video Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09494)
*Zhuoyuan Li,Jiacheng Li,Yao Li,Jialin Li,Li Li,Dong Liu,Feng Wu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposes LUT-ILF++, a practical in-loop filtering framework using lookup tables instead of heavy DNN computations, achieving significant bitrate reduction with lower complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural network-based in-loop filtering provides coding gains but has high computational complexity and hardware demands, making it impractical for general use.

Method: Trains DNN with restricted reference range, caches outputs into LUTs, uses multiple filtering LUTs with customized indexing, cross-component indexing, and LUT compaction for storage efficiency.

Result: Achieves 0.82%/2.97%/1.63% and 0.85%/4.11%/2.06% bitrate reduction under AI and RA configurations with much lower time complexity and storage cost than DNN solutions.

Conclusion: LUT-ILF++ provides a practical alternative to DNN-based in-loop filtering with comparable coding gains but significantly reduced computational and storage requirements.

Abstract: In-loop filtering (ILF) is a key technology in video coding standards to
reduce artifacts and enhance visual quality. Recently, neural network-based ILF
schemes have achieved remarkable coding gains, emerging as a powerful candidate
for next-generation video coding standards. However, the use of deep neural
networks (DNN) brings significant computational and time complexity or high
demands for dedicated hardware, making it challenging for general use. To
address this limitation, we study a practical ILF solution by adopting look-up
tables (LUTs). After training a DNN with a restricted reference range for ILF,
all possible inputs are traversed, and the output values of the DNN are cached
into LUTs. During the coding process, the filtering process is performed by
simply retrieving the filtered pixel through locating the input pixels and
interpolating between the cached values, instead of relying on heavy inference
computations. In this paper, we propose a universal LUT-based ILF framework,
termed LUT-ILF++. First, we introduce the cooperation of multiple kinds of
filtering LUTs and propose a series of customized indexing mechanisms to enable
better filtering reference perception with limited storage consumption. Second,
we propose the cross-component indexing mechanism to enable the filtering of
different color components jointly. Third, in order to make our solution
practical for coding uses, we propose the LUT compaction scheme to enable the
LUT pruning, achieving a lower storage cost of the entire solution. The
proposed framework is implemented in the VVC reference software. Experimental
results show that the proposed framework achieves on average 0.82%/2.97%/1.63%
and 0.85%/4.11%/2.06% bitrate reduction for common test sequences, under the AI
and RA configurations, respectively. Compared to DNN-based solutions, our
proposed solution has much lower time complexity and storage cost.

Motivation: Sleep forecasting enables proactive management of sleep quality to improve mental and physical well-being for individuals and healthcare providers.

Method: Adaptive spatial-temporal model (AdaST-Sleep) using convolutional layers for spatial feature interactions, RNN layers for temporal health data, and domain classifier for cross-subject generalization. Tested with various input (3-11 days) and prediction (1-9 days) window sizes.

Result: Consistently outperformed four baseline models, achieving lowest RMSE of 0.282 with 7-day input and 1-day prediction windows. Maintained strong performance for multi-day forecasting and accurately tracked both overall sleep levels and daily fluctuations.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust and adaptable solution for personalized sleep forecasting using sparse data from commercial wearables and domain adaptation techniques.

Abstract: A sleep forecast allows individuals and healthcare providers to anticipate
and proactively address factors influencing restful rest, ultimately improving
mental and physical well-being. This work presents an adaptive spatial and
temporal model (AdaST-Sleep) for predicting sleep scores. Our proposed model
combines convolutional layers to capture spatial feature interactions between
multiple features and recurrent neural network layers to handle longer-term
temporal health-related data. A domain classifier is further integrated to
generalize across different subjects. We conducted several experiments using
five input window sizes (3, 5, 7, 9, 11 days) and five predicting window sizes
(1, 3, 5, 7, 9 days). Our approach consistently outperformed four baseline
models, achieving its lowest RMSE (0.282) with a seven-day input window and a
one-day predicting window. Moreover, the method maintained strong performance
even when forecasting multiple days into the future, demonstrating its
versatility for real-world applications. Visual comparisons reveal that the
model accurately tracks both the overall sleep score level and daily
fluctuations. These findings prove that the proposed framework provides a
robust and adaptable solution for personalized sleep forecasting using sparse
data from commercial wearable devices and domain adaptation techniques.

*Seong-A Park,Jong-Eui Chae,Sungdong Kim,Hyung-Chul Lee,Hyun-Lim Yang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: SNUPHY-M is a self-supervised learning model that analyzes ECG, PPG, and ABP signals simultaneously to extract enriched physiological features for non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring and clinical prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research focuses on single physiological signals, but clinical scenarios require integrated analysis of multiple signals for comprehensive hemodynamic monitoring and patient prognosis management.

Method: The SNUPHY-M model uses self-supervised learning to restore three masked physiological signals (ECG, PPG, ABP) and extracts features reflecting electrical, pressure, and fluid characteristics of the cardiac cycle.

Result: The model significantly outperformed supervised and other SSL models in clinical downstream tasks including hypotension, stroke volume, blood pressure, and age prediction, especially when using non-invasive signals.

Conclusion: SNUPHY-M is the first multi-modal SSL approach for cardiovascular analysis that effectively supports clinical decision-making and enables precise non-invasive diagnostics for early hemodynamic management.

Abstract: In clinical settings, monitoring hemodynamics is crucial for managing patient
prognosis, necessitating the integrated analysis of multiple physiological
signals. While recent research has analyzed single signals such as
electrocardiography (ECG) or photoplethysmography (PPG), there has yet to be a
proposal for an approach that encompasses the complex signal analysis required
in actual clinical scenarios. In this study, we introduce the SNUPHY-M (Seoul
National University hospital PHYsiological signal Masked representation
learning) model extracts physiological features reflecting the electrical,
pressure, and fluid characteristics of the cardiac cycle in the process of
restoring three masked physiological signals based on self-supervised learning
(SSL): ECG, PPG, and arterial blood pressure (ABP) signals. By employing
multiple physical characteristics, the model can extract more enriched features
only using non-invasive signals. We evaluated the model's performance in
clinical downstream tasks such as hypotension, stroke volume, systolic blood
pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and age prediction. Our results showed that
the SNUPHY-M significantly outperformed supervised or SSL models, especially in
prediction tasks using non-invasive signals. To the best of our knowledge,
SNUPHY-M is the first model to apply multi-modal SSL to cardiovascular analysis
involving ECG, PPG, and ABP signals. This approach effectively supports
clinical decision-making and enables precise diagnostics, contributing
significantly to the early diagnosis and management of hemodynamics without
invasiveness.

TL;DR: AI tools show great potential for enhancing signal processing education but face challenges in fairness, inclusivity, and reliability that need technical solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While AI has achieved remarkable technical breakthroughs, the most profound challenges ahead involve ensuring responsible and fair use that genuinely improves human conditions, particularly in educational applications.

Method: The article explores AI applications in signal processing education through two perspectives: addressing technical limitations and practical implementation. It provides primers on core issues like fairness, inclusivity, handling hallucinations, and resource efficiency, illustrated through developing a "smart textbook" with transparency and explainability.

Result: The article presents a framework for using AI tools in signal processing education that addresses key technical and ethical challenges, providing practical guidance for implementation.

Conclusion: AI tools hold significant promise for enhancing engineering education, particularly in signal processing, but require careful attention to fairness, transparency, and reliability to achieve their full potential as educational resources.

Abstract: Powerful artificial intelligence (AI) tools that have emerged in recent years
-- including large language models, automated coding assistants, and advanced
image and speech generation technologies -- are the result of monumental human
achievements. These breakthroughs reflect mastery across multiple technical
disciplines and the resolution of significant technological challenges.
However, some of the most profound challenges may still lie ahead. These
challenges are not purely technical but pertain to the fair and responsible use
of AI in ways that genuinely improve the global human condition. This article
explores one promising application aligned with that vision: the use of AI
tools to facilitate and enhance education, with a specific focus on signal
processing (SP). It presents two interrelated perspectives: identifying and
addressing technical limitations, and applying AI tools in practice to improve
educational experiences. Primers are provided on several core technical issues
that arise when using AI in educational settings, including how to ensure
fairness and inclusivity, handle hallucinated outputs, and achieve efficient
use of resources. These and other considerations -- such as transparency,
explainability, and trustworthiness -- are illustrated through the development
of an immersive, structured, and reliable "smart textbook." The article serves
as a resource for researchers and educators seeking to advance AI's role in

*Harshit Agrawal,Ari Hietanen,Simo Särkkä*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Deep learning approach for CBCT scatter correction that optimizes network resolution to achieve 78x FLOP reduction while maintaining performance, enabling deployment on mobile/edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scatter artifacts degrade CBCT image quality, and existing deep learning methods have large memory footprints that limit deployment on mobile CBCT systems and edge devices.

Method: Examined reconstruction error in down-up sampling of CBCT scatter signal at six resolutions using four interpolation methods. Trained state-of-the-art method across five image resolutions and evaluated FLOPs, inference times, and GPU memory requirements.

Result: Achieved 78-fold reduction in FLOPs while maintaining comparable performance (MAPE: 3.85% vs 4.42%, MSE: 1.34e-2 vs 2.01e-2). Inference time reduced 16x, GPU memory usage reduced 12x. Demonstrated robustness on simulated dataset and real CBCT scans.

Conclusion: Downsampling plays crucial role in deep learning-based scatter estimation. The method enables scatter correction in resource-constrained environments like mobile CBCT and edge devices through substantial reductions in computational requirements.

Abstract: Purpose: Scatter artifacts drastically degrade the image quality of cone-beam
computed tomography (CBCT) scans. Although deep learning-based methods show
promise in estimating scatter from CBCT measurements, their deployment in
mobile CBCT systems or edge devices is still limited due to the large memory
footprint of the networks. This study addresses the issue by applying networks
at varying resolutions and suggesting an optimal one, based on speed and
accuracy.
  Methods: First, the reconstruction error in down-up sampling of CBCT scatter
signal was examined at six resolutions by comparing four interpolation methods.
Next, a recent state-of-the-art method was trained across five image
resolutions and evaluated for the reductions in floating-point operations
(FLOPs), inference times, and GPU memory requirements.
  Results: Reducing the input size and network parameters achieved a 78-fold
reduction in FLOPs compared to the baseline method, while maintaining comarable
performance in terms of mean-absolute-percentage-error (MAPE) and
mean-square-error (MSE). Specifically, the MAPE decreased to 3.85% compared to
4.42%, and the MSE decreased to 1.34 \times 10^{-2} compared to 2.01 \times
10^{-2}. Inference time and GPU memory usage were reduced by factors of 16 and
12, respectively. Further experiments comparing scatter-corrected
reconstructions on a large, simulated dataset and real CBCT scans from water
and Sedentex CT phantoms clearly demonstrated the robustness of our method.
  Conclusion: This study highlights the underappreciated role of downsampling
in deep learning-based scatter estimation. The substantial reduction in FLOPs
and GPU memory requirements achieved by our method enables scatter correction
in resource-constrained environments, such as mobile CBCT and edge devices.

### [244] [Generative Engine Optimization: How to Dominate AI Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08919)
*Mahe Chen,Xiaoxuan Wang,Kaiwen Chen,Nick Koudas*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: AI-powered search engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini) fundamentally differ from traditional search, requiring new Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) strategies that focus on earned media dominance and machine-scannable content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift from traditional ranked-list search to AI-generated synthesized answers challenges existing SEO practices and necessitates a new optimization paradigm for generative search engines.

Method: Conducted large-scale controlled experiments across multiple verticals, languages, and query paraphrases to quantify differences in information sourcing between AI Search and traditional web search (Google).

Result: AI Search shows systematic bias towards earned media (third-party authoritative sources) over brand-owned and social content, differs significantly in domain diversity, freshness, cross-language stability, and sensitivity to phrasing compared to Google.

Conclusion: Proposes GEO framework with actionable strategies: engineer content for machine scannability, dominate earned media for AI-perceived authority, adopt engine-specific approaches, and overcome big brand bias for niche players.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of generative AI-powered search engines like ChatGPT,
Perplexity, and Gemini is fundamentally reshaping information retrieval, moving
from traditional ranked lists to synthesized, citation-backed answers. This
shift challenges established Search Engine Optimization (SEO) practices and
necessitates a new paradigm, which we term Generative Engine Optimization
(GEO).
  This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of AI Search and
traditional web search (Google). Through a series of large-scale, controlled
experiments across multiple verticals, languages, and query paraphrases, we
quantify critical differences in how these systems source information. Our key
findings reveal that AI Search exhibit a systematic and overwhelming bias
towards Earned media (third-party, authoritative sources) over Brand-owned and
Social content, a stark contrast to Google's more balanced mix. We further
demonstrate that AI Search services differ significantly from each other in
their domain diversity, freshness, cross-language stability, and sensitivity to
phrasing.
  Based on these empirical results, we formulate a strategic GEO agenda. We
provide actionable guidance for practitioners, emphasizing the critical need
to: (1) engineer content for machine scannability and justification, (2)
dominate earned media to build AI-perceived authority, (3) adopt
engine-specific and language-aware strategies, and (4) overcome the inherent
"big brand bias" for niche players. Our work provides the foundational
empirical analysis and a strategic framework for achieving visibility in the
new generative search landscape.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Envy-freeness concepts like EF-1 are inappropriate for measuring fairness in personalized recommendation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine why envy-freeness concepts, which have been used in economics and game theory since the 1960s and recently adopted in recommendation systems, are unsuitable for fairness measurement in personalized settings.

Method: This position paper provides an overview of envy-freeness concepts and their historical use in economics and recommendation systems, then analyzes their limitations.

Result: The analysis demonstrates that envy-freeness is not appropriate for fairness measurement in contexts where personalization is involved.

Conclusion: Alternative fairness measures should be developed for personalized recommendation systems, as envy-freeness concepts are fundamentally mismatched for these applications.

Abstract: Envy-freeness and the relaxation to Envy-freeness up to one item (EF-1) have
been used as fairness concepts in the economics, game theory, and social choice
literatures since the 1960s, and have recently gained popularity within the
recommendation systems communities. In this short position paper we will give
an overview of envy-freeness and its use in economics and recommendation
systems; and illustrate why envy is not appropriate to measure fairness for use
in settings where personalization plays a role.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Question answering in radio regulations is legally sensitive and high-stakes, requiring accurate and reliable systems for regulatory compliance.

Method: Proposed a telecom-specific Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline with automated filtering and human validation to create the first multiple-choice evaluation set for this domain, using domain-specific retrieval metrics.

Result: Retriever achieved ~97% accuracy on domain-specific metric. Pipeline improved generation accuracy across all models, with 12% relative improvement for GPT-4o compared to naive document insertion.

Conclusion: Carefully targeted grounding provides a simple yet strong baseline and effective domain-specific solution for regulatory question answering, with all code and dataset made publicly available.

Abstract: We study question answering in the domain of radio regulations, a legally
sensitive and high-stakes area. We propose a telecom-specific
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline and introduce, to our knowledge,
the first multiple-choice evaluation set for this domain, constructed from
authoritative sources using automated filtering and human validation. To assess
retrieval quality, we define a domain-specific retrieval metric, under which
our retriever achieves approximately 97% accuracy. Beyond retrieval, our
approach consistently improves generation accuracy across all tested models. In
particular, while naively inserting documents without structured retrieval
yields only marginal gains for GPT-4o (less than 1%), applying our pipeline
results in nearly a 12% relative improvement. These findings demonstrate that
carefully targeted grounding provides a simple yet strong baseline and an
effective domain-specific solution for regulatory question answering. All code

*Alan Said,Maria Soledad Pera,Michael D. Ekstrand*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Recommender systems research continues to suffer from foundational flaws identified in 2011, with increasing complexity outpacing introspection. The paper calls for paradigm shift toward epistemic humility, human impact, and sustainable practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To revisit and update Xavier Amatriain's 2011 critique of recommender systems research, showing that conceptual, epistemological and infrastructural failures persist despite increased sophistication.

Method: Analysis of recent work in reproducibility, evaluation methodology, environmental impact, and participatory design. Examination of community-led initiatives including workshops, evaluation frameworks, and calls for value-sensitive research.

Result: The field's accelerating complexity has outpaced its introspection, with persistent foundational issues requiring fundamental reframing rather than just technical improvements.

Conclusion: Meaningful change requires not just new metrics or better tooling, but a fundamental reframing of recommender systems research purpose, audience, and knowledge validation - grounded in epistemic humility, human impact, and sustainable practice.

Abstract: In 2011, Xavier Amatriain sounded the alarm: recommender systems research was
"doing it all wrong" [1]. His critique, rooted in statistical misinterpretation
and methodological shortcuts, remains as relevant today as it was then. But
rather than correcting course, we added new layers of sophistication on top of
the same broken foundations. This paper revisits Amatriain's diagnosis and
argues that many of the conceptual, epistemological, and infrastructural
failures he identified still persist, in more subtle or systemic forms. Drawing
on recent work in reproducibility, evaluation methodology, environmental
impact, and participatory design, we showcase how the field's accelerating
complexity has outpaced its introspection. We highlight ongoing community-led
initiatives that attempt to shift the paradigm, including workshops, evaluation
frameworks, and calls for value-sensitive and participatory research. At the
same time, we contend that meaningful change will require not only new metrics
or better tooling, but a fundamental reframing of what recommender systems
research is for, who it serves, and how knowledge is produced and validated.
Our call is not just for technical reform, but for a recommender systems
research agenda grounded in epistemic humility, human impact, and sustainable
practice.

TL;DR: Reduced 8-feature diffusion MRI protocol using AI optimization achieves comparable accuracy to full 15-feature protocol while cutting scan time from 14+ minutes to 14 minutes with preserved parameter fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion MRI protocols for neurite exchange imaging require long scan times, limiting clinical and research applications. A more efficient acquisition scheme is needed.

Method: Data-driven framework using explainable AI with guided recursive feature elimination to identify optimal 8-feature subset from original 15-feature protocol, validated in vivo and benchmarked against alternatives.

Result: Reduced protocol yielded comparable parameter estimates and cortical maps to full protocol, with low estimation errors and minimal impact on test-retest variability. Outperformed theory-driven and heuristic reduction schemes, reducing water exchange time deviation by over two-fold.

Conclusion: The hybrid optimization framework enables viable neurite exchange imaging in 14 minutes without parameter fidelity loss, supporting broader application in neuroscience and clinical research with generalizable protocol design method.

Abstract: The diffusion MRI Neurite Exchange Imaging model offers a promising framework
for probing gray matter microstructure by estimating parameters such as
compartment sizes, diffusivities, and inter-compartmental water exchange time.
However, existing protocols require long scan times. This study proposes a
reduced acquisition scheme for the Connectome 2.0 scanner that preserves model
accuracy while substantially shortening scan duration. We developed a
data-driven framework using explainable artificial intelligence with a guided
recursive feature elimination strategy to identify an optimal 8-feature subset
from a 15-feature protocol. The performance of this optimized protocol was
validated in vivo and benchmarked against the full acquisition and alternative
reduction strategies. Parameter accuracy, preservation of anatomical contrast,
and test-retest reproducibility were assessed. The reduced protocol yielded
parameter estimates and cortical maps comparable to the full protocol, with low
estimation errors in synthetic data and minimal impact on test-retest
variability. Compared to theory-driven and heuristic reduction schemes, the
optimized protocol demonstrated superior robustness, reducing the deviation in
water exchange time estimates by over two-fold. In conclusion, this hybrid
optimization framework enables viable imaging of neurite exchange in 14 minutes
without loss of parameter fidelity. This approach supports the broader
application of exchange-sensitive diffusion magnetic resonance imaging in
neuroscience and clinical research, and offers a generalizable method for
designing efficient acquisition protocols in biophysical parameter mapping.

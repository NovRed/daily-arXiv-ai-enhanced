### [1] [GEM: Empowering LLM for both Embedding Generation and Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04344)
*Caojin Zhang,Qiang Zhang,Ke Li,Sai Vidyaranya Nuthalapati,Benyu Zhang,Jason Liu,Serena Li,Lizhu Zhang,Xiangjun Fan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes GEM, a self-supervised method enabling decoder-only LLMs to generate high-quality text embeddings without compromising their original capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the inefficiency of using separate embedding models in applications like RAG, which complicates systems and causes discrepancies.

Method: Inserts special tokens and manipulates attention masks to generate summarization embeddings, integrable into post-training or fine-tuning.

Result: Significantly improves text embedding performance (MTEB) with minimal impact on NLP tasks (MMLU).

Conclusion: GEM empowers LLMs with state-of-the-art embedding capabilities while preserving their original NLP performance.

Abstract: Large decoder-only language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
generation and reasoning tasks, where they generate text responses given
instructions. However, many applications, e.g., retrieval augmented generation
(RAG), still rely on separate embedding models to generate text embeddings,
which can complicate the system and introduce discrepancies in understanding of
the query between the embedding model and LLMs. To address this limitation, we
propose a simple self-supervised approach, Generative Embedding large language
Model (GEM), that enables any large decoder-only LLM to generate high-quality
text embeddings while maintaining its original text generation and reasoning
capabilities. Our method inserts new special token(s) into a text body, and
generates summarization embedding of the text by manipulating the attention
mask. This method could be easily integrated into post-training or fine tuning
stages of any existing LLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
by applying it to two popular LLM families, ranging from 1B to 8B parameters,
and evaluating the transformed models on both text embedding benchmarks (MTEB)
and NLP benchmarks (MMLU). The results show that our proposed method
significantly improves the original LLMs on MTEB while having a minimal impact
on MMLU. Our strong results indicate that our approach can empower LLMs with
state-of-the-art text embedding capabilities while maintaining their original
NLP performance

### [2] [Effects of Speaker Count, Duration, and Accent Diversity on Zero-Shot Accent Robustness in Low-Resource ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04364)
*Zheng-Xin Yong,Vineel Pratap,Michael Auli,Jean Maillard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Increasing speaker count in ASR training data improves robustness to unseen accents more than increasing audio duration per speaker or accent diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance ASR robustness for diverse accents, especially unseen ones, in low-resource settings.

Method: Studied the impact of speaker count, audio duration per speaker, and accent diversity on ASR performance.

Result: More speakers (with less audio per speaker) improves ASR robustness; accent diversity has minimal impact when speaker count is fixed.

Conclusion: Prioritize increasing speaker count in ASR training for better performance on unseen accents.

Abstract: To build an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that can serve everyone
in the world, the ASR needs to be robust to a wide range of accents including
unseen accents. We systematically study how three different variables in
training data -- the number of speakers, the audio duration per each individual
speaker, and the diversity of accents -- affect ASR robustness towards unseen
accents in a low-resource training regime. We observe that for a fixed number
of ASR training hours, it is more beneficial to increase the number of speakers
(which means each speaker contributes less) than the number of hours
contributed per speaker. We also observe that more speakers enables ASR
performance gains from scaling number of hours. Surprisingly, we observe
minimal benefits to prioritizing speakers with different accents when the
number of speakers is controlled. Our work suggests that practitioners should
prioritize increasing the speaker count in ASR training data composition for
new languages.

### [3] [Mechanistic Decomposition of Sentence Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04373)
*Matthieu Tehenan,Vikram Natarajan,Jonathan Michala,Milton Lin,Juri Opitz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method to decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable components using dictionary learning on token-level representations, revealing linear encoding of semantic and syntactic features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sentence embeddings are opaque; their internal structure and features are not human-interpretable, hindering transparency and control.

Method: Proposes dictionary learning on token-level representations to decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable components, analyzing pooling and latent features.

Result: Reveals that semantic and syntactic aspects are linearly encoded in embeddings, enhancing interpretability.

Conclusion: Bridges token-level and sentence-level interpretability, enabling more transparent and controllable sentence representations.

Abstract: Sentence embeddings are central to modern NLP and AI systems, yet little is
known about their internal structure. While we can compare these embeddings
using measures such as cosine similarity, the contributing features are not
human-interpretable, and the content of an embedding seems untraceable, as it
is masked by complex neural transformations and a final pooling operation that
combines individual token embeddings. To alleviate this issue, we propose a new
method to mechanistically decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable
components, by using dictionary learning on token-level representations. We
analyze how pooling compresses these features into sentence representations,
and assess the latent features that reside in a sentence embedding. This
bridges token-level mechanistic interpretability with sentence-level analysis,
making for more transparent and controllable representations. In our studies,
we obtain several interesting insights into the inner workings of sentence
embedding spaces, for instance, that many semantic and syntactic aspects are
linearly encoded in the embeddings.

### [4] [Hierarchical Text Classification Using Contrastive Learning Informed Path Guided Hierarchy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04381)
*Neeraj Agrawal,Saurabh Kumar,Priyanka Bhatt,Tanishka Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HTC-CLIP combines label hierarchy and text encoding via contrastive learning, improving performance over existing HTC models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HTC models handle label hierarchy and text encoding separately or guide hierarchy in the encoder, missing complementary benefits.

Method: Proposes HTC-CLIP, learning hierarchy-aware text and path-guided hierarchy representations using contrastive learning, pooling outputs for inference.

Result: Achieves 0.99-2.37% improvement in Macro F1 score on two benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: HTC-CLIP effectively combines prior approaches, enhancing hierarchical text classification performance.

Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) has recently gained traction given the
ability to handle complex label hierarchy. This has found applications in
domains like E- commerce, customer care and medicine industry among other
real-world applications. Existing HTC models either encode label hierarchy
separately and mix it with text encoding or guide the label hierarchy structure
in the text encoder. Both approaches capture different characteristics of label
hierarchy and are complementary to each other. In this paper, we propose a
Hierarchical Text Classification using Contrastive Learning Informed Path
guided hierarchy (HTC-CLIP), which learns hierarchy-aware text representation
and text informed path guided hierarchy representation using contrastive
learning. During the training of HTC-CLIP, we learn two different sets of class
probabilities distributions and during inference, we use the pooled output of
both probabilities for each class to get the best of both representations. Our
results show that the two previous approaches can be effectively combined into
one architecture to achieve improved performance. Tests on two public benchmark
datasets showed an improvement of 0.99 - 2.37% in Macro F1 score using HTC-CLIP
over the existing state-of-the-art models.

### [5] [MELABenchv1: Benchmarking Large Language Models against Smaller Fine-Tuned Models for Low-Resource Maltese NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04385)
*Kurt Micallef,Claudia Borg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates 55 LLMs on Maltese, a low-resource language, revealing poor performance, especially in generative tasks. Fine-tuned smaller models outperform larger ones, with pre-training and instruction-tuning in Maltese being key. Fine-tuning, though costly, offers better performance and lower inference costs than prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess LLM performance on low-resource languages like Maltese, which are often overlooked, to advocate for more inclusive language technologies.

Method: Evaluated 55 LLMs on a new Maltese benchmark with 11 tasks, analyzing performance factors like pre-training and fine-tuning vs. prompting.

Result: Many LLMs perform poorly on Maltese, especially in generative tasks. Fine-tuned smaller models excel, with prior Maltese exposure being crucial.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning is more effective than prompting for low-resource languages. Researchers should consider traditional approaches and prioritize inclusive language tech.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, largely due to their
generalisability and ability to perform tasks without additional training.
However, their effectiveness for low-resource languages remains limited. In
this study, we evaluate the performance of 55 publicly available LLMs on
Maltese, a low-resource language, using a newly introduced benchmark covering
11 discriminative and generative tasks. Our experiments highlight that many
models perform poorly, particularly on generative tasks, and that smaller
fine-tuned models often perform better across all tasks. From our
multidimensional analysis, we investigate various factors impacting
performance. We conclude that prior exposure to Maltese during pre-training and
instruction-tuning emerges as the most important factor. We also examine the
trade-offs between fine-tuning and prompting, highlighting that while
fine-tuning requires a higher initial cost, it yields better performance and
lower inference costs. Through this work, we aim to highlight the need for more
inclusive language technologies and recommend that researchers working with
low-resource languages consider more "traditional" language modelling
approaches.

### [6] [Building a Few-Shot Cross-Domain Multilingual NLU Model for Customer Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04389)
*Saurabh Kumar,Sourav Bansal,Neeraj Agrawal,Priyanka Bhatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes an embedder-cum-classifier model for few-shot intent detection in customer care, improving accuracy by 20-23% over SOTA models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of limited annotated domain-specific data in customer care, aiming to generalize intent classification across domains (geography, channel, language).

Method: Uses a supervised fine-tuning approach with isotropic regularizers for domain-specific sentence embedding and multilingual knowledge distillation for cross-domain generalization.

Result: Achieves 20-23% higher accuracy in few-shot intent detection on e-commerce datasets (Canada, Mexico) compared to existing SOTA models.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively generalizes intent classification across domains with minimal labeled data, offering practical value for customer care automation.

Abstract: Customer care is an essential pillar of the e-commerce shopping experience
with companies spending millions of dollars each year, employing automation and
human agents, across geographies (like US, Canada, Mexico, Chile), channels
(like Chat, Interactive Voice Response (IVR)), and languages (like English,
Spanish). SOTA pre-trained models like multilingual-BERT, fine-tuned on
annotated data have shown good performance in downstream tasks relevant to
Customer Care. However, model performance is largely subject to the
availability of sufficient annotated domain-specific data. Cross-domain
availability of data remains a bottleneck, thus building an intent classifier
that generalizes across domains (defined by channel, geography, and language)
with only a few annotations, is of great practical value. In this paper, we
propose an embedder-cum-classifier model architecture which extends
state-of-the-art domain-specific models to other domains with only a few
labeled samples. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning approach with isotropic
regularizers to train a domain-specific sentence embedder and a multilingual
knowledge distillation strategy to generalize this embedder across multiple
domains. The trained embedder, further augmented with a simple linear
classifier can be deployed for new domains. Experiments on Canada and Mexico
e-commerce Customer Care dataset with few-shot intent detection show an
increase in accuracy by 20-23% against the existing state-of-the-art
pre-trained models.

designed to enhance coding-based medical reasoning capabilities in large
language model (LLM) agents. MedAgentGYM comprises 72,413 task instances across
129 categories derived from authentic real-world biomedical scenarios. Tasks
are encapsulated within executable coding environments, each featuring detailed
task descriptions, interactive feedback mechanisms, verifiable ground-truth

(+42.47%), emerging as an affordable and privacy-preserving alternative
competitive with gpt-4o. By offering both a comprehensive benchmark and
accessible, expandable training resources within unified execution
environments, MedAgentGYM delivers an integrated platform to develop LLM-based
coding assistants for advanced biomedical research and practice.

### [8] [Unpacking Let Alone: Human-Scale Models Generalize to a Rare Construction in Form but not Meaning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04408)
*Wesley Scivetti,Tatsuya Aoyama,Ethan Wilcox,Nathan Schneider*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Human-scale language models generalize form but not meaning of rare constructions like LET-ALONE, unlike humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how well language models generalize rare grammatical constructions' form and meaning compared to humans.

Method: Tested human-scale transformer models on the rare LET-ALONE construction using a synthetic benchmark for syntactic and semantic properties.

Result: Models generalized form but failed to generalize meaning, showing an asymmetry in sample efficiency.

Conclusion: Current architectures lack humans' balanced efficiency in learning form and meaning of rare constructions.

Abstract: Humans have a remarkable ability to acquire and understand grammatical
phenomena that are seen rarely, if ever, during childhood. Recent evidence
suggests that language models with human-scale pretraining data may possess a
similar ability by generalizing from frequent to rare constructions. However,
it remains an open question how widespread this generalization ability is, and
to what extent this knowledge extends to meanings of rare constructions, as
opposed to just their forms. We fill this gap by testing human-scale
transformer language models on their knowledge of both the form and meaning of
the (rare and quirky) English LET-ALONE construction. To evaluate our LMs we
construct a bespoke synthetic benchmark that targets syntactic and semantic
properties of the construction. We find that human-scale LMs are sensitive to
form, even when related constructions are filtered from the dataset. However,
human-scale LMs do not make correct generalizations about LET-ALONE's meaning.
These results point to an asymmetry in the current architectures' sample
efficiency between language form and meaning, something which is not present in
human language learners.

TL;DR: EmoRAG is a system for multi-label emotion detection in text, achieving efficient and scalable results without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To predict perceived emotions (e.g., joy, sadness) from text for SemEval-2025 Task 11, Subtask A.

Method: Uses an ensemble of models without additional training.

Result: Comparable performance to top systems, with higher efficiency and scalability.

Conclusion: EmoRAG is effective, easy to implement, and scalable for emotion detection.

Abstract: This paper describes EmoRAG, a system designed to detect perceived emotions
in text for SemEval-2025 Task 11, Subtask A: Multi-label Emotion Detection. We
focus on predicting the perceived emotions of the speaker from a given text
snippet, labeling it with emotions such as joy, sadness, fear, anger, surprise,
and disgust. Our approach does not require additional model training and only
uses an ensemble of models to predict emotions. EmoRAG achieves results
comparable to the best performing systems, while being more efficient,

### [10] [Zero-Shot Open-Schema Entity Structure Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04458)
*Xueqiang Xu,Jinfeng Xiao,James Barry,Mohab Elkaref,Jiaru Zou,Pengcheng Jiang,Yunyi Zhang,Max Giammona,Geeth de Mel,Jiawei Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ZOES is a zero-shot, open-schema method for entity structure extraction that avoids reliance on predefined schemas or annotated data, improving LLMs' performance across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods depend on predefined schemas or annotated datasets, leading to incomplete results. ZOES aims to overcome this limitation.

Method: ZOES uses a mechanism of enrichment, refinement, and unification, leveraging the mutual reinforcement between entities and their structures.

Result: ZOES enhances LLMs' ability to extract complete entity structures across three domains, proving its effectiveness and generalizability.

Conclusion: The enrichment, refinement, and unification mechanism in ZOES offers a principled approach to improving LLM-based entity structure discovery.

Abstract: Entity structure extraction, which aims to extract entities and their
associated attribute-value structures from text, is an essential task for text
understanding and knowledge graph construction. Existing methods based on large
language models (LLMs) typically rely heavily on predefined entity attribute
schemas or annotated datasets, often leading to incomplete extraction results.
To address these challenges, we introduce Zero-Shot Open-schema Entity
Structure Discovery (ZOES), a novel approach to entity structure extraction
that does not require any schema or annotated samples. ZOES operates via a
principled mechanism of enrichment, refinement, and unification, based on the
insight that an entity and its associated structure are mutually reinforcing.
Experiments demonstrate that ZOES consistently enhances LLMs' ability to
extract more complete entity structures across three different domains,
showcasing both the effectiveness and generalizability of the method. These
findings suggest that such an enrichment, refinement, and unification mechanism
may serve as a principled approach to improving the quality of LLM-based entity
structure discovery in various scenarios.

### [11] [Watermarking Degrades Alignment in Language Models: Analysis and Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04462)
*Apurv Verma,NhatHai Phan,Shubhendu Trivedi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how watermarking techniques (Gumbel and KGW) affect LLM alignment (truthfulness, safety, helpfulness), revealing degradation patterns and proposing Alignment Resampling (AR) to restore alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the underexamined effects of watermarking on LLM alignment properties (truthfulness, safety, helpfulness) and mitigate degradations.

Method: Systematic analysis of two watermarking approaches (Gumbel, KGW) across four aligned LLMs, proposing AR for alignment restoration using an external reward model.

Result: Watermarking causes degradation patterns (guard attenuation, amplification). AR recovers baseline alignment with 2-4 samples, maintaining detectability.

Conclusion: AR balances watermark strength and alignment, offering a practical solution for deploying watermarked LLMs responsibly.

Abstract: Watermarking techniques for large language models (LLMs) can significantly
impact output quality, yet their effects on truthfulness, safety, and
helpfulness remain critically underexamined. This paper presents a systematic
analysis of how two popular watermarking approaches-Gumbel and KGW-affect these
core alignment properties across four aligned LLMs. Our experiments reveal two
distinct degradation patterns: guard attenuation, where enhanced helpfulness
undermines model safety, and guard amplification, where excessive caution
reduces model helpfulness. These patterns emerge from watermark-induced shifts
in token distribution, surfacing the fundamental tension that exists between
alignment objectives.
  To mitigate these degradations, we propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an
inference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore
alignment. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in
expected reward score as the sample size is increased and empirically
demonstrate that sampling just 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers
or surpasses baseline (unwatermarked) alignment scores. To overcome the limited
response diversity of standard Gumbel watermarking, our modified implementation
sacrifices strict distortion-freeness while maintaining robust detectability,
ensuring compatibility with AR. Experimental results confirm that AR
successfully recovers baseline alignment in both watermarking approaches, while
maintaining strong watermark detectability. This work reveals the critical
balance between watermark strength and model alignment, providing a simple
inference-time solution to responsibly deploy watermarked LLMs in practice.

### [12] [Aligning Large Language Models with Implicit Preferences from User-Generated Content](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04463)
*Zhaoxuan Tan,Zheng Li,Tianyi Liu,Haodong Wang,Hyokun Yun,Ming Zeng,Pei Chen,Zhihan Zhang,Yifan Gao,Ruijie Wang,Priyanka Nigam,Bing Yin,Meng Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PUGC leverages implicit human preferences in unlabeled user-generated content (UGC) to generate scalable preference data for aligning LLMs, outperforming traditional methods by 9.37%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing preference learning methods rely on costly curated data, limiting scalability. PUGC addresses this by using implicit preferences in UGC.

Method: PUGC transforms UGC into queries and responses, using UGC as reference text for scoring to align models with implicit preferences.

Result: PUGC achieves a 9.37% performance improvement and a 35.93% state-of-the-art win rate, with gains in reward quality and domain-specific alignment.

Conclusion: PUGC offers a scalable, effective solution for aligning LLMs with human values using implicit preferences in UGC.

Abstract: Learning from preference feedback is essential for aligning large language
models (LLMs) with human values and improving the quality of generated
responses. However, existing preference learning methods rely heavily on
curated data from humans or advanced LLMs, which is costly and difficult to
scale. In this work, we present PUGC, a novel framework that leverages implicit
human Preferences in unlabeled User-Generated Content (UGC) to generate
preference data. Although UGC is not explicitly created to guide LLMs in
generating human-preferred responses, it often reflects valuable insights and
implicit preferences from its creators that has the potential to address
readers' questions. PUGC transforms UGC into user queries and generates
responses from the policy model. The UGC is then leveraged as a reference text
for response scoring, aligning the model with these implicit preferences. This
approach improves the quality of preference data while enabling scalable,
domain-specific alignment. Experimental results on Alpaca Eval 2 show that
models trained with DPO and PUGC achieve a 9.37% performance improvement over
traditional methods, setting a 35.93% state-of-the-art length-controlled win
rate using Mistral-7B-Instruct. Further studies highlight gains in reward
quality, domain-specific alignment effectiveness, robustness against UGC
quality, and theory of mind capabilities. Our code and dataset are available at

### [13] [SQLens: An End-to-End Framework for Error Detection and Correction in Text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04494)
*Yue Gong,Chuan Lei,Xiao Qin,Kapil Vaidya,Balakrishnan Narayanaswamy,Tim Kraska*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SQLens is a framework for detecting and correcting semantic errors in LLM-generated SQL queries, improving accuracy and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce semantically incorrect SQL queries, lacking reliability insights, necessitating a solution for error detection and correction.

Method: SQLens integrates database and LLM error signals for fine-grained semantic error detection and correction within SQL clauses.

Result: SQLens outperforms LLM-based self-evaluation by 25.78% in F1 for error detection and boosts execution accuracy by up to 20%.

Conclusion: SQLens effectively enhances the reliability and accuracy of text-to-SQL systems by addressing semantic errors in LLM-generated queries.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language (NL) questions into SQL
queries, enabling non-technical users to interact with structured data. While
large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results on the text-to-SQL
task, they often produce semantically incorrect yet syntactically valid
queries, with limited insight into their reliability. We propose SQLens, an
end-to-end framework for fine-grained detection and correction of semantic
errors in LLM-generated SQL. SQLens integrates error signals from both the
underlying database and the LLM to identify potential semantic errors within
SQL clauses. It further leverages these signals to guide query correction.
Empirical results on two public benchmarks show that SQLens outperforms the
best LLM-based self-evaluation method by 25.78% in F1 for error detection, and
improves execution accuracy of out-of-the-box text-to-SQL systems by up to 20%.

*Kun Zhao,Bohao Yang,Chen Tang,Siyuan Dai,Haoteng Tang,Chenghua Lin,Liang Zhan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLIDE integrates Small (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) for better performance in ambiguous scenarios, and DRE refines this integration for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with ambiguity, while SLMs are robust but vulnerable to adversarial inputs. Combining their strengths can enhance reliability in tasks like dialogue evaluation.

Method: Introduces SLIDE for adaptive weighting of SLMs and LLMs, and DRE for dual-refinement: SLM insights guide LLM evaluations, and SLM adjustments refine LLM scores.

Result: DRE outperforms existing methods, aligning better with human judgment in benchmarks.

Conclusion: Combining SLMs and LLMs yields more reliable evaluation tools, especially for open-ended tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks but struggle with ambiguous
scenarios where multiple valid responses exist, often yielding unreliable
results. Conversely, Small Language Models (SLMs) demonstrate robustness in
such scenarios but are susceptible to misleading or adversarial inputs. We
observed that LLMs handle negative examples effectively, while SLMs excel with
positive examples. To leverage their complementary strengths, we introduce
SLIDE (Small and Large Integrated for Dialogue Evaluation), a method
integrating SLMs and LLMs via adaptive weighting. Building on SLIDE, we further
propose a Dual-Refinement Evaluation (DRE) method to enhance SLM-LLM
integration: (1) SLM-generated insights guide the LLM to produce initial
evaluations; (2) SLM-derived adjustments refine the LLM's scores for improved
accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that DRE outperforms existing methods,
showing stronger alignment with human judgment across diverse benchmarks. This
work illustrates how combining small and large models can yield more reliable
evaluation tools, particularly for open-ended tasks such as dialogue
evaluation.

Motivation: To scrutinize the effectiveness of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in LLM-based translation, as recent work suggests decomposition improves performance.

Method: Empirical analysis comparing step-by-step prompting (e.g., decomposition and refinement) with simpler prompts like "translate again" on LLMs.

Result: No clear evidence that decomposition improves translation; simpler prompts outperform step-by-step methods.

Conclusion: While reasoning may still play a role, the study calls for further exploration of CoT's effectiveness in translation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities for
many tasks, often by explicitly decomposing the task via Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning. Recent work on LLM-based translation designs hand-crafted prompts to
decompose translation, or trains models to incorporate intermediate
steps.~\textit{Translating Step-by-step}~\citep{briakou2024translating}, for
instance, introduces a multi-step prompt with decomposition and refinement of
translation with LLMs, which achieved state-of-the-art results on WMT24. In
this work, we scrutinise this strategy's effectiveness. Empirically, we find no
clear evidence that performance gains stem from explicitly decomposing the
translation process, at least for the models on test; and we show that simply
prompting LLMs to ``translate again'' yields even better results than
human-like step-by-step prompting. Our analysis does not rule out the role of
reasoning, but instead invites future work exploring the factors for CoT's
effectiveness in the context of translation.

### [16] [Is It JUST Semantics? A Case Study of Discourse Particle Understanding in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04534)
*William Sheffield,Kanishka Misra,Valentina Pyatkin,Ashwini Deo,Kyle Mahowald,Junyi Jessy Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can broadly categorize senses of 'just' but struggle with subtle nuances, revealing gaps in understanding discourse particles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' ability to distinguish fine-grained senses of the polyfunctional discourse particle 'just'.

Method: Using expert-labeled data, the study evaluates LLMs' performance in differentiating nuanced uses of 'just'.

Result: LLMs show partial success in broader categorization but fail to fully capture subtle semantic nuances.

Conclusion: LLMs lack full comprehension of discourse particles, indicating room for improvement in semantic understanding.

Abstract: Discourse particles are crucial elements that subtly shape the meaning of
text. These words, often polyfunctional, give rise to nuanced and often quite
disparate semantic/discourse effects, as exemplified by the diverse uses of the
particle "just" (e.g., exclusive, temporal, emphatic). This work investigates
the capacity of LLMs to distinguish the fine-grained senses of English "just",
a well-studied example in formal semantics, using data meticulously created and
labeled by expert linguists. Our findings reveal that while LLMs exhibit some
ability to differentiate between broader categories, they struggle to fully
capture more subtle nuances, highlighting a gap in their understanding of
discourse particles.

*K. O. T. Erziev*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Benchmarking LLMs on unanswerable questions is valuable. A new benchmark and method for dataset modification reveal current models perform poorly on such tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' ability to handle questions with no reasonable answers, highlighting their limitations.

Method: Developed a benchmark for unanswerable questions and a method to modify existing datasets for testing.

Result: Existing models perform significantly below perfection on unanswerable questions.

Conclusion: Testing LLMs on impossible questions is insightful, and current models need improvement in this area.

Abstract: We propose that benchmarking LLMs on questions which have no reasonable
answer actually isn't as silly as it sounds. We also present a benchmark that
allows such testing and a method to modify the existing datasets, and discover
that existing models demonstrate a performance far from the perfect on such
questions. Our code and data artifacts are available at

### [18] [SSA-COMET: Do LLMs Outperform Learned Metrics in Evaluating MT for Under-Resourced African Languages?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04557)
*Senyu Li,Jiayi Wang,Felermino D. M. A. Ali,Colin Cherry,Daniel Deutsch,Eleftheria Briakou,Rui Sousa-Silva,Henrique Lopes Cardoso,Pontus Stenetorp,David Ifeoluwa Adelani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SSA-MTE, a large-scale human-annotated dataset for evaluating machine translation (MT) quality in under-resourced African languages, and develops improved metrics (SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE) that outperform existing solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MT evaluation metrics lack coverage and perform poorly for under-resourced African languages, prompting the need for better datasets and methods.

Method: The authors create SSA-MTE, a dataset with 63,000 annotations for 13 African language pairs, and develop SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE metrics. They also benchmark LLM-based approaches like GPT-4o and Claude.

Result: SSA-COMET models outperform AfriCOMET and compete with top LLMs (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro), especially for low-resource languages like Twi, Luo, and Yoruba.

Conclusion: The work provides open-licensed resources to advance MT evaluation for African languages, demonstrating the effectiveness of SSA-COMET metrics.

Abstract: Evaluating machine translation (MT) quality for under-resourced African
languages remains a significant challenge, as existing metrics often suffer
from limited language coverage and poor performance in low-resource settings.
While recent efforts, such as AfriCOMET, have addressed some of the issues,
they are still constrained by small evaluation sets, a lack of publicly
available training data tailored to African languages, and inconsistent
performance in extremely low-resource scenarios. In this work, we introduce
SSA-MTE, a large-scale human-annotated MT evaluation (MTE) dataset covering 13
African language pairs from the News domain, with over 63,000 sentence-level
annotations from a diverse set of MT systems. Based on this data, we develop
SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE, improved reference-based and reference-free
evaluation metrics. We also benchmark prompting-based approaches using
state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude. Our experimental results show
that SSA-COMET models significantly outperform AfriCOMET and are competitive
with the strongest LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro) evaluated in our study, particularly on
low-resource languages such as Twi, Luo, and Yoruba. All resources are released
under open licenses to support future research.

### [19] [Demonstrations of Integrity Attacks in Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04572)
*Can Zheng,Yuhan Cao,Xiaoning Dong,Tianxing He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how malicious agents in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) can manipulate prompts to bias operations, bypassing detection mechanisms like GPT-4o-mini. It identifies four attack types and emphasizes the need for robust security protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate vulnerabilities in MAS where malicious agents exploit prompt manipulation to serve self-interests without disrupting core functionality, highlighting gaps in current detection systems.

Method: Examines four types of integrity attacks (Scapegoater, Boaster, Self-Dealer, Free-Rider) using strategically crafted prompts to bias MAS behavior and bypass LLM-based monitors.

Result: Demonstrates that prompt manipulation can systematically bias MAS operations, enabling malicious agents to mislead evaluation systems and manipulate collaborators, even bypassing advanced monitors.

Conclusion: Highlights the urgent need for MAS architectures with stronger security protocols, content validation, and monitoring systems capable of comprehensive risk assessment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
natural language understanding, code generation, and complex planning.
Simultaneously, Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have garnered attention for their
potential to enable cooperation among distributed agents. However, from a
multi-party perspective, MAS could be vulnerable to malicious agents that
exploit the system to serve self-interests without disrupting its core
functionality. This work explores integrity attacks where malicious agents
employ subtle prompt manipulation to bias MAS operations and gain various
benefits. Four types of attacks are examined: \textit{Scapegoater}, who
misleads the system monitor to underestimate other agents' contributions;
\textit{Boaster}, who misleads the system monitor to overestimate their own
performance; \textit{Self-Dealer}, who manipulates other agents to adopt
certain tools; and \textit{Free-Rider}, who hands off its own task to others.
We demonstrate that strategically crafted prompts can introduce systematic
biases in MAS behavior and executable instructions, enabling malicious agents
to effectively mislead evaluation systems and manipulate collaborative agents.
Furthermore, our attacks can bypass advanced LLM-based monitors, such as
GPT-4o-mini and o3-mini, highlighting the limitations of current detection
mechanisms. Our findings underscore the critical need for MAS architectures
with robust security protocols and content validation mechanisms, alongside
monitoring systems capable of comprehensive risk scenario assessment.

### [20] [Reasoning or Overthinking: Evaluating Large Language Models on Financial Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04574)
*Dimitris Vamvourellis,Dhagash Mehta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs, including reasoning and non-reasoning models, were tested for zero-shot financial sentiment analysis. GPT-4o without CoT prompting performed best, challenging the assumption that reasoning improves accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how LLMs and prompting strategies perform in financial sentiment analysis compared to human judgment.

Method: Compared proprietary LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3-mini) under System 1/System 2 prompting paradigms and benchmarked against fine-tuned models (FinBERT-Prosus, FinBERT-Tone).

Result: Reasoning did not improve performance; GPT-4o without CoT was most accurate. Linguistic complexity and annotation agreement impacted results, with reasoning causing overthinking.

Conclusion: Fast, intuitive thinking aligns better with human judgment in financial sentiment analysis, challenging the notion that reasoning always improves LLM decisions.

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs), including
reasoning-based and non-reasoning models, in performing zero-shot financial
sentiment analysis. Using the Financial PhraseBank dataset annotated by domain
experts, we evaluate how various LLMs and prompting strategies align with
human-labeled sentiment in a financial context. We compare three proprietary
LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3-mini) under different prompting paradigms that
simulate System 1 (fast and intuitive) or System 2 (slow and deliberate)
thinking and benchmark them against two smaller models (FinBERT-Prosus,
FinBERT-Tone) fine-tuned on financial sentiment analysis. Our findings suggest
that reasoning, either through prompting or inherent model design, does not
improve performance on this task. Surprisingly, the most accurate and
human-aligned combination of model and method was GPT-4o without any
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. We further explore how performance is
impacted by linguistic complexity and annotation agreement levels, uncovering
that reasoning may introduce overthinking, leading to suboptimal predictions.
This suggests that for financial sentiment classification, fast, intuitive
"System 1"-like thinking aligns more closely with human judgment compared to
"System 2"-style slower, deliberative reasoning simulated by reasoning models
or CoT prompting. Our results challenge the default assumption that more
reasoning always leads to better LLM decisions, particularly in high-stakes
financial applications.

### [21] [Are LLMs Reliable Translators of Logical Reasoning Across Lexically Diversified Contexts?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04575)
*Qingchuan Li,Jiatong Li,Zirui Liu,Mingyue Cheng,Yuting Zeng,Qi Liu,Tongxuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SCALe, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to handle lexical diversification in logical reasoning, and proposes MenTaL, a method to improve LLM translators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with lexical diversification in logical reasoning, and existing benchmarks lack diversity, masking this issue.

Method: SCALe benchmarks LLMs by transforming datasets into lexically diversified versions. MenTaL guides LLMs to unify expressions before translation.

Result: Experiments show LLMs fail in handling lexical diversity. MenTaL improves performance via in-context learning and SFT.

Conclusion: SCALe highlights LLMs' limitations, and MenTaL offers a solution to enhance their reliability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic approaches combining large language models (LLMs) with solvers
excels in logical reasoning problems need long reasoning chains. In this
paradigm, LLMs serve as translators, converting natural language reasoning
problems into formal logic formulas. Then reliable symbolic solvers return
correct solutions. Despite their success, we find that LLMs, as translators,
struggle to handle lexical diversification, a common linguistic phenomenon,
indicating that LLMs as logic translators are unreliable in real-world
scenarios. Moreover, existing logical reasoning benchmarks lack lexical
diversity, failing to challenge LLMs' ability to translate such text and thus
obscuring this issue. In this work, we propose SCALe, a benchmark designed to
address this significant gap through **logic-invariant lexical
diversification**. By using LLMs to transform original benchmark datasets into
lexically diversified but logically equivalent versions, we evaluate LLMs'
ability to consistently map diverse expressions to uniform logical symbols on
these new datasets. Experiments using SCALe further confirm that current LLMs
exhibit deficiencies in this capability. Building directly on the deficiencies
identified through our benchmark, we propose a new method, MenTaL, to address
this limitation. This method guides LLMs to first construct a table unifying
diverse expressions before performing translation. Applying MenTaL through
in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) significantly improves the
performance of LLM translators on lexically diversified text. Our code is now
available at https://github.com/wufeiwuwoshihua/LexicalDiver.

### [22] [Selecting Demonstrations for Many-Shot In-Context Learning via Gradient Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04579)
*Jianfei Zhang,Bei Li,Jun Bai,Rumei Li,Yanmeng Wang,Chenghua Lin,Wenge Rong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a gradient matching method for selecting demonstrations in many-shot In-Context Learning (ICL), outperforming random selection on large LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reliance on random demonstration selection in many-shot ICL is a critical challenge, and the paper hypothesizes that data requirements for ICL and fine-tuning are similar.

Method: A gradient matching approach aligns fine-tuning gradients between the entire training set and selected examples to mimic the learning effect of the full dataset.

Result: The method consistently outperforms random selection, improving performance by up to 4% on large LLMs like Qwen2.5-72B and Llama3-70B.

Conclusion: The work enables more reliable and effective many-shot ICL, broadening its applicability.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) for rapid
task adaptation without Fine-Tuning (FT), but its reliance on demonstration
selection remains a critical challenge. While many-shot ICL shows promising
performance through scaled demonstrations, the selection method for many-shot
demonstrations remains limited to random selection in existing work. Since the
conventional instance-level retrieval is not suitable for many-shot scenarios,
we hypothesize that the data requirements for in-context learning and
fine-tuning are analogous. To this end, we introduce a novel gradient matching
approach that selects demonstrations by aligning fine-tuning gradients between
the entire training set of the target task and the selected examples, so as to
approach the learning effect on the entire training set within the selected
examples. Through gradient matching on relatively small models, e.g.,
Qwen2.5-3B or Llama3-8B, our method consistently outperforms random selection
on larger LLMs from 4-shot to 128-shot scenarios across 9 diverse datasets. For
instance, it surpasses random selection by 4% on Qwen2.5-72B and Llama3-70B,
and by around 2% on 5 closed-source LLMs. This work unlocks more reliable and
effective many-shot ICL, paving the way for its broader application.

*Hongjun Liu,Yilun Zhao,Arman Cohan,Chen Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A training-free method, SUCEA, improves fact-checking by rephrasing adversarial claims into simpler sub-claims, enhancing evidence retrieval and label prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of adversarial claims designed to mislead fact-checking systems.

Method: Modular framework with three steps: claim segmentation, iterative evidence retrieval and editing, and evidence aggregation for label prediction.

Result: Significant improvements in retrieval and entailment accuracy, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: SUCEA effectively tackles adversarial claims, enhancing fact-checking robustness.

Abstract: Automatic fact-checking has recently received more attention as a means of
combating misinformation. Despite significant advancements, fact-checking
systems based on retrieval-augmented language models still struggle to tackle
adversarial claims, which are intentionally designed by humans to challenge
fact-checking systems. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free
method designed to rephrase the original claim, making it easier to locate
supporting evidence. Our modular framework, SUCEA, decomposes the task into
three steps: 1) Claim Segmentation and Decontextualization that segments
adversarial claims into independent sub-claims; 2) Iterative Evidence Retrieval
and Claim Editing that iteratively retrieves evidence and edits the subclaim
based on the retrieved evidence; 3) Evidence Aggregation and Label Prediction
that aggregates all retrieved evidence and predicts the entailment label.
Experiments on two challenging fact-checking datasets demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves on both retrieval and entailment label
accuracy, outperforming four strong claim-decomposition-based baselines.

*Yash Kumar Lal,Manikanta Bandham,Mohammad Saqib Hasan,Apoorva Kashi,Mahnaz Koupaee,Niranjan Balasubramanian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MuSciClaims, a benchmark for testing claim verification abilities using multimodal data from scientific figures, highlighting the poor performance of current vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack usability for testing claim verification with multimodal data in scientific figures, creating a gap in evaluating models' abilities.

Method: The authors automatically extract supported claims from articles, manually perturb them to create contradicted claims, and introduce diagnostic tasks to analyze model failures.

Result: Most vision-language models perform poorly (0.3-0.5 F1), with the best model reaching only 0.77 F1. Models are biased toward supported claims and struggle with evidence localization and multimodal aggregation.

Conclusion: The study underscores the limitations of current models in claim verification and calls for improved multimodal reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Assessing scientific claims requires identifying, extracting, and reasoning
with multimodal data expressed in information-rich figures in scientific
literature. Despite the large body of work in scientific QA, figure captioning,
and other multimodal reasoning tasks over chart-based data, there are no
readily usable multimodal benchmarks that directly test claim verification
abilities. To remedy this gap, we introduce a new benchmark MuSciClaims
accompanied by diagnostics tasks. We automatically extract supported claims
from scientific articles, which we manually perturb to produce contradicted
claims. The perturbations are designed to test for a specific set of claim
verification capabilities. We also introduce a suite of diagnostic tasks that
help understand model failures. Our results show most vision-language models
are poor (~0.3-0.5 F1), with even the best model only achieving 0.77 F1. They
are also biased towards judging claims as supported, likely misunderstanding
nuanced perturbations within the claims. Our diagnostics show models are bad at
localizing correct evidence within figures, struggle with aggregating
information across modalities, and often fail to understand basic components of
the figure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance semi-supervised learning by leveraging LLMs for correcting pseudo labels in noisy, real-world data.

Method: Refines pseudo-labeled text from ASR/AST using LLMs and employs data filtering for efficient knowledge transfer.

Result: Achieves 3.77% WER reduction on Mandarin ASR and high BLEU scores (34.0, 64.7) on Spanish-to-English AST tasks.

Conclusion: LESS is adaptable across languages and tasks, with ablation studies offering insights into LLM use for speech processing.

Abstract: We introduce LESS (Large Language Model Enhanced Semi-supervised Learning), a
versatile framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to correct
pseudo labels generated from in-the-wild data. Within the LESS framework,
pseudo-labeled text from Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or Automatic Speech
Translation (AST) of the unsupervised data is refined by an LLM, and augmented
by a data filtering strategy to optimize LLM knowledge transfer efficiency.
Experiments on both Mandarin ASR and Spanish-to-English AST tasks show that
LESS achieves a notable absolute WER reduction of 3.77% on the Wenet Speech
test set, as well as BLEU scores of 34.0 and 64.7 on Callhome and Fisher test
sets respectively. These results validate the adaptability of LESS across
different languages, tasks, and domains. Ablation studies conducted with
various LLMs and prompt configurations provide novel insights into leveraging
LLM-derived knowledge for speech processing applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces $Safe$, a formal verification framework using Lean 4 to detect and mitigate hallucinations in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning by providing step-aware proofs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods like process reward models (PRMs) or self-consistency lack transparency and verifiable evidence for detecting hallucinations in CoT prompting.

Method: Proposes $Safe$, a retrospective framework that formalizes reasoning steps in Lean 4 and provides proofs to identify hallucinations.

Result: Demonstrates significant performance improvement across models and datasets, offering interpretable evidence. Introduces $FormalStep$, a benchmark with 30,809 formal statements.

Conclusion: First use of Lean 4 for verifying LLM-generated content, aligning with formal languages' purpose to ensure robust proof foundations.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has become the de facto method to elicit
reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). However, to mitigate
hallucinations in CoT that are notoriously difficult to detect, current methods
such as process reward models (PRMs) or self-consistency operate as opaque
boxes and do not provide checkable evidence for their judgments, possibly
limiting their effectiveness. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from
the idea that "the gold standard for supporting a mathematical claim is to
provide a proof". We propose a retrospective, step-aware formal verification
framework $Safe$. Rather than assigning arbitrary scores, we strive to
articulate mathematical claims in formal mathematical language Lean 4 at each
reasoning step and provide formal proofs to identify hallucinations. We
evaluate our framework $Safe$ across multiple language models and various
mathematical datasets, demonstrating a significant performance improvement
while offering interpretable and verifiable evidence. We also propose
$FormalStep$ as a benchmark for step correctness theorem proving with $30,809$
formal statements. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first
endeavor to utilize formal mathematical language Lean 4 for verifying natural
language content generated by LLMs, aligning with the reason why formal
mathematical languages were created in the first place: to provide a robust
foundation for hallucination-prone human-written proofs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NLI datasets are limited to CS domains, ignoring non-CS fields like psychology, engineering, and public health.

Method: Created MISMATCHED with 2,700 annotated sentence pairs from non-CS domains and tested SLMs and LLMs as baselines.

Result: Best baseline achieved 78.17% Macro F1, indicating significant potential for improvement.

Conclusion: Incorporating implicit scientific NLI relations in training improves performance; dataset and code are publicly available.

Abstract: Scientific Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of predicting the
semantic relation between a pair of sentences extracted from research articles.
Existing datasets for this task are derived from various computer science (CS)
domains, whereas non-CS domains are completely ignored. In this paper, we
introduce a novel evaluation benchmark for scientific NLI, called MISMATCHED.
The new MISMATCHED benchmark covers three non-CS domains-PSYCHOLOGY,
ENGINEERING, and PUBLIC HEALTH, and contains 2,700 human annotated sentence
pairs. We establish strong baselines on MISMATCHED using both Pre-trained Small
Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our best performing
baseline shows a Macro F1 of only 78.17% illustrating the substantial headroom
for future improvements. In addition to introducing the MISMATCHED benchmark,
we show that incorporating sentence pairs having an implicit scientific NLI
relation between them in model training improves their performance on
scientific NLI. We make our dataset and code publicly available on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve reasoning performance of LLMs via TTS while addressing reduced output diversity in reasoning-optimized models.

Method: Surveyed TTS methods (sampling, search, trajectory optimization) and proposed ADAPT, a diversity-aware prefix tuning approach.

Result: ADAPT achieved 80% accuracy on math tasks with 8x less compute than baselines.

Conclusion: Generative diversity is crucial for TTS effectiveness, and ADAPT offers a compute-efficient solution.

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves the reasoning performance of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by allocating additional compute during inference. We conduct a
structured survey of TTS methods and categorize them into sampling-based,
search-based, and trajectory optimization strategies. We observe that
reasoning-optimized models often produce less diverse outputs, which limits TTS
effectiveness. To address this, we propose ADAPT (A Diversity Aware Prefix
fine-Tuning), a lightweight method that applies prefix tuning with a
diversity-focused data strategy. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks
show that ADAPT reaches 80% accuracy using eight times less compute than strong
baselines. Our findings highlight the essential role of generative diversity in

TL;DR: The paper explores how innovators' subjective perspectives and interpersonal opportunities, modeled using machine learning, predict future creative achievements. Diversity in perspectives fosters innovation, while diversity in backgrounds hinders it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how social structures and personal perspectives influence innovation capacity, leveraging machine learning to model innovators' trajectories.

Method: Uses dynamic language representations to quantify subjective perspectives and innovation opportunities, analyzing data from scientists, inventors, writers, entrepreneurs, and Wikipedia contributors. Includes a natural experiment and AI simulations.

Result: Subjective perspectives predict creative success, while background diversity negatively impacts it. Successful collaborators use common language to integrate diverse experiences.

Conclusion: Perspective diversity is key for innovation, with implications for team assembly and research policy.

Abstract: Existing studies of innovation emphasize the power of social structures to
shape innovation capacity. Emerging machine learning approaches, however,
enable us to model innovators' personal perspectives and interpersonal
innovation opportunities as a function of their prior trajectories of
experience. We theorize then quantify subjective perspectives and innovation
opportunities based on innovator positions within the geometric space of
concepts inscribed by dynamic language representations. Using data on millions
of scientists, inventors, writers, entrepreneurs, and Wikipedia contributors
across the creative domains of science, technology, film, entrepreneurship, and
Wikipedia, here we show that measured subjective perspectives anticipate what
ideas individuals and groups creatively attend to and successfully combine in
future. When perspective and background diversity are decomposed as the angular
difference between collaborators' perspectives on their creation and between
their experiences, the former consistently anticipates creative achievement
while the latter portends its opposite, across all cases and time periods
examined. We analyze a natural experiment and simulate creative collaborations
between AI (large language model) agents designed with various perspective and
background diversity, which are consistent with our observational findings. We
explore mechanisms underlying these findings and identify how successful
collaborators leverage common language to weave together diverse experience
obtained through trajectories of prior work that converge to provoke one
another and innovate. We explore the importance of these findings for team
assembly and research policy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve sentence semantic representation using computationally efficient static word embeddings.

Method: Extracts word embeddings from a pre-trained Sentence Transformer, enhances them with PCA, and applies knowledge distillation or contrastive learning.

Result: Outperforms existing static models and rivals SimCSE on some datasets.

Conclusion: The method effectively removes irrelevant embedding components and adjusts vector norms for better sentence semantics.

Abstract: We propose new static word embeddings optimised for sentence semantic
representation. We first extract word embeddings from a pre-trained Sentence
Transformer, and improve them with sentence-level principal component analysis,
followed by either knowledge distillation or contrastive learning. During
inference, we represent sentences by simply averaging word embeddings, which
requires little computational cost. We evaluate models on both monolingual and
cross-lingual tasks and show that our model substantially outperforms existing
static models on sentence semantic tasks, and even rivals a basic Sentence
Transformer model (SimCSE) on some data sets. Lastly, we perform a variety of
analyses and show that our method successfully removes word embedding
components that are irrelevant to sentence semantics, and adjusts the vector
norms based on the influence of words on sentence semantics.

capabilities is crucial for enabling AI agents to solve complex problems.
However, current models face two major limitations: (1) unreliable tool
planning and invocation due to low-quality instruction datasets (e.g.,
widespread hallucinated API calls), and (2) weak tool reflection abilities
(over 90% of errors cannot be corrected) resulting from static imitation
learning. To address these critical limitations, we propose Tool-MVR, a novel
Tool-Augmented LLM that achieves comprehensive System 2 reasoning through two
key innovations. Specifically, we first introduce Multi-Agent Meta-Verification
(MAMV), a systematic pipeline that rigorously validates APIs, queries, and
reasoning trajectories to construct ToolBench-V, a new high-quality instruction
dataset that addresses the limitation of unreliable tool planning and
invocation. Second, we propose Exploration-based Reflection Learning (EXPLORE),
which enhances tool reflection capabilities by leveraging tool feedback through
a dynamic "Error -> Reflection -> Correction" learning paradigm, resulting in
our reflection dataset ToolBench-R and addressing the critical weakness in tool
reflection. Finally, we obtain Tool-MVR by finetuning open-source LLMs (e.g.,
Qwen-7B) on both ToolBench-V and ToolBench-R. Our experiments demonstrate that
Tool-MVR achieves state-of-the-art performance on StableToolBench, surpassing
both ToolLLM (by 23.9%) and GPT-4 (by 15.3%) while reducing API calls by 31.4%,
with strong generalization capabilities across unseen tools and scenarios.
Additionally, on our proposed RefineToolBench, the first benchmark specifically
designed to evaluate tool reflection capabilities, Tool-MVR achieves a 58.9%
error correction rate, significantly outperforming ToolLLM's 9.1%.

*Thai-Binh Nguyen,Thi Van Nguyen,Quoc Truong Do,Chi Mai Luong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A practical method for generating AVSR datasets from raw video is introduced, enabling robust speech recognition, especially in noisy environments, and demonstrated with Vietnamese.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AVSR models face dataset scarcity for non-English languages, limiting their application. Automated data collection can address this gap.

Method: Refines existing techniques to efficiently generate AVSR datasets from raw video, applied to create a Vietnamese baseline model.

Result: The automatically collected dataset supports a strong baseline AVSR model, performing competitively in clean conditions and excelling in noisy settings.

Conclusion: This approach efficiently expands AVSR to under-resourced languages, offering a scalable solution for dataset generation.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) has gained significant attention
recently due to its robustness against noise, which often challenges
conventional speech recognition systems that rely solely on audio features.
Despite this advantage, AVSR models remain limited by the scarcity of extensive
datasets, especially for most languages beyond English. Automated data
collection offers a promising solution. This work presents a practical approach
to generate AVSR datasets from raw video, refining existing techniques for
improved efficiency and accessibility. We demonstrate its broad applicability
by developing a baseline AVSR model for Vietnamese. Experiments show the
automatically collected dataset enables a strong baseline, achieving
competitive performance with robust ASR in clean conditions and significantly
outperforming them in noisy environments like cocktail parties. This efficient
method provides a pathway to expand AVSR to more languages, particularly
under-resourced ones.

*Vinay Joshi,Pratik Prabhanjan Brahma,Zicheng Liu,Emad Barsoum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TaDA is a training-free KV cache compression method using adaptive quantization and mean centering, reducing memory footprint to 27% of baseline without separate outlier handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV cache memory demands scale poorly with sequence length, hindering scalable deployment of large language models.

Method: TaDA adapts quantization precision to error sensitivity per layer and uses mean centering to avoid outlier handling.

Result: Reduces KV cache memory to 27% of 16-bit baseline while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: TaDA enables scalable, high-performance reasoning in language models for longer contexts and chains of thought.

Abstract: The key-value (KV) cache in transformer models is a critical component for
efficient decoding or inference, yet its memory demands scale poorly with
sequence length, posing a major challenge for scalable deployment of large
language models. Among several approaches to KV cache compression, quantization
of key and value activations has been widely explored. Most KV cache
quantization methods still need to manage sparse and noncontiguous outliers
separately. To address this, we introduce TaDA, a training-free recipe for KV
cache compression with quantization precision that adapts to error sensitivity
across layers and a mean centering to eliminate separate outlier handling. Our
approach yields substantial accuracy improvements for multiple models
supporting various context lengths. Moreover, our approach does not need to
separately manage outlier elements -- a persistent hurdle in most traditional
quantization methods. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
technique reduces KV cache memory footprint to 27% of the original 16-bit
baseline while achieving comparable accuracy. Our method paves the way for
scalable and high-performance reasoning in language models by potentially
enabling inference for longer context length models, reasoning models, and
longer chain of thoughts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Flex-TravelPlanner benchmark evaluates LLMs' dynamic planning skills, revealing gaps in multi-turn adaptability and constraint prioritization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks lack dynamic, multi-turn planning scenarios, limiting evaluation of LLMs' real-world planning capabilities.

Method: Introduces Flex-TravelPlanner with sequential constraint introduction and prioritized competing constraints, testing GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 70B.

Result: Models struggle with multi-turn adaptability and constraint prioritization, with performance impacted by constraint order.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for dynamic benchmarks and suggests improvements for LLMs in complex planning tasks.

Abstract: Real-world planning problems require constant adaptation to changing
requirements and balancing of competing constraints. However, current
benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities primarily focus on
static, single-turn scenarios. We introduce Flex-TravelPlanner, a benchmark
that evaluates language models' ability to reason flexibly in dynamic planning
scenarios. Building on the TravelPlanner dataset~\citep{xie2024travelplanner},
we introduce two novel evaluation settings: (1) sequential constraint
introduction across multiple turns, and (2) scenarios with explicitly
prioritized competing constraints. Our analysis of GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 70B
reveals several key findings: models' performance on single-turn tasks poorly
predicts their ability to adapt plans across multiple turns; constraint
introduction order significantly affects performance; and models struggle with
constraint prioritization, often incorrectly favoring newly introduced lower
priority preferences over existing higher-priority constraints. These findings
highlight the importance of evaluating LLMs in more realistic, dynamic planning
scenarios and suggest specific directions for improving model performance on
complex planning tasks. The code and dataset for our framework are publicly
available at https://github.com/juhyunohh/FlexTravelBench.

### [35] [Normative Conflicts and Shallow AI Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04679)
*Raphaël Millière*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper highlights the inadequacy of current alignment strategies for LLMs, showing they lack deep normative reasoning, making them vulnerable to adversarial attacks despite efforts to instill human-like norms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the growing concerns about the safe deployment of AI systems like LLMs, focusing on the limitations of current alignment methods in preventing misuse.

Method: Analyzes the value alignment problem for LLMs, comparing their normative reasoning to human deliberative reasoning, and evaluates vulnerabilities in existing alignment strategies.

Result: Current alignment methods reinforce shallow behaviors in LLMs, leaving them susceptible to adversarial attacks, unlike humans who use deliberative reasoning to resolve conflicts.

Conclusion: The "shallow alignment" problem underscores the insufficiency of current approaches for AI safety, calling for deeper normative reasoning capabilities in LLMs to mitigate potential harms.

Abstract: The progress of AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) raises
increasingly pressing concerns about their safe deployment. This paper examines
the value alignment problem for LLMs, arguing that current alignment strategies
are fundamentally inadequate to prevent misuse. Despite ongoing efforts to
instill norms such as helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness in LLMs through
fine-tuning based on human preferences, they remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that exploit conflicts between these norms. I argue that this
vulnerability reflects a fundamental limitation of existing alignment methods:
they reinforce shallow behavioral dispositions rather than endowing LLMs with a
genuine capacity for normative deliberation. Drawing from on research in moral
psychology, I show how humans' ability to engage in deliberative reasoning
enhances their resilience against similar adversarial tactics. LLMs, by
contrast, lack a robust capacity to detect and rationally resolve normative
conflicts, leaving them susceptible to manipulation; even recent advances in
reasoning-focused LLMs have not addressed this vulnerability. This ``shallow
alignment'' problem carries significant implications for AI safety and
regulation, suggesting that current approaches are insufficient for mitigating
potential harms posed by increasingly capable AI systems.

TL;DR: MMRefine is a benchmark for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in error refinement across six scenarios and error types, revealing performance bottlenecks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess MLLMs' error detection and correction abilities beyond final accuracy, focusing on reasoning enhancement during inference.

Method: MMRefine evaluates MLLMs using a framework with six scenarios and categorizes errors into six types, testing open and closed models.

Result: Experiments identify bottlenecks and factors limiting refinement performance, suggesting areas for improvement.

Conclusion: MMRefine provides a valuable tool for analyzing and enhancing MLLMs' reasoning capabilities, with publicly available code and dataset.

(MLLMs). As the emphasis shifts toward enhancing reasoning during inference,
MMRefine provides a framework that evaluates MLLMs' abilities to detect and
correct errors across six distinct scenarios beyond just comparing final
accuracy before and after refinement. Furthermore, the benchmark analyzes the
refinement performance by categorizing errors into six error types. Experiments
with various open and closed MLLMs reveal bottlenecks and factors impeding
refinement performance, highlighting areas for improvement in effective
reasoning enhancement. Our code and dataset are publicly available at

### [37] [Recycling the Web: A Method to Enhance Pre-training Data Quality and Quantity for Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04689)
*Thao Nguyen,Yang Li,Olga Golovneva,Luke Zettlemoyer,Sewoong Oh,Ludwig Schmidt,Xian Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: REWIRE, a method to recycle low-quality web data by enriching it, improves model performance by 1.0-2.5 percentage points across tasks, outperforming other synthetic data approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limited growth of high-quality natural data compared to compute supply creates a 'data wall' for pre-training scaling.

Method: Proposes REWIRE, which transforms and enriches discarded low-quality documents to make them useful for training.

Result: Mixing rewritten texts with high-quality data improves performance by 1.0-2.5 points across 22 tasks, outperforming 2x web data and other synthetic methods.

Conclusion: Recycling web texts is a simple and effective approach to scale pre-training data.

Abstract: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves
with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been
relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available
on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the
same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality
texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of
the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall"
of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data
discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web
with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they
could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the
representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at
1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw
texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points
improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only
filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more
effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we
demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming
lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also
outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including
Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge
extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential
for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

*Lu Wei,Liangzhi Li,Tong Xiang,Xiao Liu,Noa Garcia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new taxonomy for detecting implicit hate speech (im-HS) using six codetypes and validates their effectiveness in improving detection across languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of detecting subtle forms of hate speech (im-HS) where traditional methods struggle, aiming to enhance societal harmony and individual well-being.

Method: Two approaches: 1) prompting LLMs to classify sentences, and 2) embedding codetypes during LLM encoding.

Result: Codetypes improve im-HS detection in both Chinese and English datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed taxonomy and methods effectively enhance im-HS detection, demonstrating cross-language applicability.

Abstract: The internet has become a hotspot for hate speech (HS), threatening societal
harmony and individual well-being. While automatic detection methods perform
well in identifying explicit hate speech (ex-HS), they struggle with more
subtle forms, such as implicit hate speech (im-HS). We tackle this problem by
introducing a new taxonomy for im-HS detection, defining six encoding
strategies named codetypes. We present two methods for integrating codetypes
into im-HS detection: 1) prompting large language models (LLMs) directly to
classify sentences based on generated responses, and 2) using LLMs as encoders
with codetypes embedded during the encoding process. Experiments show that the
use of codetypes improves im-HS detection in both Chinese and English datasets,
validating the effectiveness of our approach across different languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STAND is a model-free speculative decoding method that accelerates language model reasoning by leveraging redundant reasoning patterns, reducing latency by 60-65% without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time scaling techniques for language models are computationally expensive, creating a trade-off between performance and efficiency.

Method: STAND uses stochastic adaptive N-gram drafting, Gumbel-Top-K sampling, and data-driven tree construction to predict tokens efficiently.

Result: STAND reduces inference latency by 60-65%, outperforms other methods by 14-28% in throughput, and maintains accuracy.

Conclusion: STAND is a plug-and-play solution for accelerating any language model without additional training.

Abstract: Language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning tasks
through test-time scaling techniques like best-of-N sampling and tree search.
However, these approaches often demand substantial computational resources,
creating a critical trade-off between performance and efficiency. We introduce
STAND (STochastic Adaptive N-gram Drafting), a novel model-free speculative
decoding approach that leverages the inherent redundancy in reasoning
trajectories to achieve significant acceleration without compromising accuracy.
Our analysis reveals that reasoning paths frequently reuse similar reasoning
patterns, enabling efficient model-free token prediction without requiring
separate draft models. By introducing stochastic drafting and preserving
probabilistic information through a memory-efficient logit-based N-gram module,
combined with optimized Gumbel-Top-K sampling and data-driven tree
construction, STAND significantly improves token acceptance rates. Extensive
evaluations across multiple models and reasoning tasks (AIME-2024,
GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench) demonstrate that STAND reduces inference
latency by 60-65% compared to standard autoregressive decoding while
maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, STAND outperforms state-of-the-art
speculative decoding methods by 14-28% in throughput and shows strong
performance even in single-trajectory scenarios, reducing inference latency by
48-58%. As a model-free approach, STAND can be applied to any existing language
model without additional training, being a powerful plug-and-play solution for
accelerating language model reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve translation quality for the low-resource Bhojpuri-Hindi language pair by exploring hyperparameter tuning and data augmentation.

Method: Systematically tested hyperparameters (learning rate, update steps, etc.) and applied augmentation techniques (speed perturbation, SpecAugment). Also used cross-lingual training with Marathi and Bhojpuri data.

Result: Hyperparameter optimization and augmentation techniques significantly improved performance in low-resource settings.

Conclusion: Careful hyperparameter selection and simple augmentation methods enhance translation quality for low-resource languages.

Abstract: This paper presents the submission of IIITH-BUT to the IWSLT 2025 shared task
on speech translation for the low-resource Bhojpuri-Hindi language pair. We
explored the impact of hyperparameter optimisation and data augmentation
techniques on the performance of the SeamlessM4T model fine-tuned for this
specific task. We systematically investigated a range of hyperparameters
including learning rate schedules, number of update steps, warm-up steps, label
smoothing, and batch sizes; and report their effect on translation quality. To
address data scarcity, we applied speed perturbation and SpecAugment and
studied their effect on translation quality. We also examined the use of
cross-lingual signal through joint training with Marathi and Bhojpuri speech
data. Our experiments reveal that careful selection of hyperparameters and the
application of simple yet effective augmentation techniques significantly
improve performance in low-resource settings. We also analysed the translation
hypotheses to understand various kinds of errors that impacted the translation
quality in terms of BLEU.

*Yuru Jiang,Wenxuan Ding,Shangbin Feng,Greg Durrett,Yulia Tsvetkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPARTA ALIGNMENT is an algorithm where multiple LLMs compete and judge each other to improve diversity and reduce biases, outperforming baselines in most tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of diversity and biases in single-model generation and evaluation by leveraging collective competition.

Method: Multiple LLMs form a 'sparta tribe' to compete and judge responses, using an adapted Elo-ranking system to aggregate scores and update preferences.

Result: Outperforms initial models and baselines in 10 out of 12 tasks with a 7.0% average improvement, generalizing better to unseen tasks.

Conclusion: SPARTA ALIGNMENT enables self-evolution of LLMs through collective competition, producing more logical and informative outputs.

Abstract: We propose SPARTA ALIGNMENT, an algorithm to collectively align multiple LLMs
through competition and combat. To complement a single model's lack of
diversity in generation and biases in evaluation, multiple LLMs form a "sparta
tribe" to compete against each other in fulfilling instructions while serving
as judges for the competition of others. For each iteration, one instruction
and two models are selected for a duel, the other models evaluate the two
responses, and their evaluation scores are aggregated through a adapted
elo-ranking based reputation system, where winners/losers of combat gain/lose
weight in evaluating others. The peer-evaluated combat results then become
preference pairs where the winning response is preferred over the losing one,
and all models learn from these preferences at the end of each iteration.
SPARTA ALIGNMENT enables the self-evolution of multiple LLMs in an iterative
and collective competition process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SPARTA ALIGNMENT outperforms initial models and 4 self-alignment baselines
across 10 out of 12 tasks and datasets with 7.0% average improvement. Further
analysis reveals that SPARTA ALIGNMENT generalizes more effectively to unseen
tasks and leverages the expertise diversity of participating models to produce
more logical, direct and informative outputs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces C$^2$EFND, a framework combining LLMs and SLMs for fake news detection, addressing limitations of both methods through collaborative learning and continuous knowledge updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fake news on social media has serious societal impacts. Existing methods (SLMs and LLMs) struggle with training demands, adaptability, and outdated knowledge.

Method: Proposes C$^2$EFND, a multi-round collaborative learning framework integrating LLMs and SLMs, with lifelong knowledge editing and replay-based continual learning.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets, improving accuracy and adaptability in continuous fake news scenarios.

Conclusion: C$^2$EFND effectively addresses fake news detection challenges by leveraging the strengths of LLMs and SLMs while ensuring adaptability and knowledge retention.

Abstract: The widespread dissemination of fake news on social media has significantly
impacted society, resulting in serious consequences. Conventional deep learning
methodologies employing small language models (SLMs) suffer from extensive
supervised training requirements and difficulties adapting to evolving news
environments due to data scarcity and distribution shifts. Large language
models (LLMs), despite robust zero-shot capabilities, fall short in accurately
detecting fake news owing to outdated knowledge and the absence of suitable
demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel Continuous Collaborative
Emergent Fake News Detection (C$^2$EFND) framework to address these challenges.
The C$^2$EFND framework strategically leverages both LLMs' generalization power
and SLMs' classification expertise via a multi-round collaborative learning
framework. We further introduce a lifelong knowledge editing module based on a
Mixture-of-Experts architecture to incrementally update LLMs and a replay-based
continue learning method to ensure SLMs retain prior knowledge without
retraining entirely. Extensive experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets
demonstrate that C$^2$EFND significantly outperforms existed methods,
effectively improving detection accuracy and adaptability in continuous
emergent fake news scenarios.

*Léane Jourdan,Florian Boudin,Richard Dufour,Nicolas Hernandez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore for evaluating text revisions in scientific writing, proposing a hybrid approach combining LLM-as-a-judge and domain-specific metrics for better alignment with human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional metrics focus on similarity rather than meaningful improvements in text revisions, necessitating better evaluation methods.

Method: The study includes manual annotation of revision quality, exploration of reference-free metrics, and analysis of LLM-as-a-judge approaches.

Result: LLMs excel in assessing instruction-following but lack in correctness, while domain-specific metrics offer complementary insights. A hybrid approach proves most reliable.

Conclusion: A hybrid of LLM-as-a-judge and task-specific metrics provides the most accurate evaluation of revision quality in scientific writing.

Abstract: Evaluating text revision in scientific writing remains a challenge, as
traditional metrics such as ROUGE and BERTScore primarily focus on similarity
rather than capturing meaningful improvements. In this work, we analyse and
identify the limitations of these metrics and explore alternative evaluation
methods that better align with human judgments. We first conduct a manual
annotation study to assess the quality of different revisions. Then, we
investigate reference-free evaluation metrics from related NLP domains.
Additionally, we examine LLM-as-a-judge approaches, analysing their ability to
assess revisions with and without a gold reference. Our results show that LLMs
effectively assess instruction-following but struggle with correctness, while
domain-specific metrics provide complementary insights. We find that a hybrid
approach combining LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and task-specific metrics offers
the most reliable assessment of revision quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores LLMs' political opinions by probing their internal mechanisms, moving from single-axis to multi-dimensional analysis to avoid concept confounds. It introduces a four-dimensional framework and dataset for transparent political concept learning, validated through experiments on eight LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misalignment between LLMs' responses and internal intentions, and reliance on single-axis concepts leading to confounds, motivate a deeper probe into LLMs' political states.

Method: A four-dimensional political learning framework and dataset are designed for fine-grained concept vector learning, tested with three representation engineering techniques on eight LLMs.

Result: The vectors disentangle political concept confounds, show semantic validity in detection tasks, and enable interventions to alter LLMs' political leanings in responses.

Conclusion: Multi-dimensional analysis and interpretable representation engineering improve transparency and accuracy in understanding and manipulating LLMs' political opinions.

Abstract: Studies of LLMs' political opinions mainly rely on evaluations of their
open-ended responses. Recent work indicates that there is a misalignment
between LLMs' responses and their internal intentions. This motivates us to
probe LLMs' internal mechanisms and help uncover their internal political
states. Additionally, we found that the analysis of LLMs' political opinions
often relies on single-axis concepts, which can lead to concept confounds. In
this work, we extend the single-axis to multi-dimensions and apply
interpretable representation engineering techniques for more transparent LLM
political concept learning. Specifically, we designed a four-dimensional
political learning framework and constructed a corresponding dataset for
fine-grained political concept vector learning. These vectors can be used to
detect and intervene in LLM internals. Experiments are conducted on eight
open-source LLMs with three representation engineering techniques. Results show
these vectors can disentangle political concept confounds. Detection tasks
validate the semantic meaning of the vectors and show good generalization and
robustness in OOD settings. Intervention Experiments show these vectors can
intervene in LLMs to generate responses with different political leanings.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMSU, a benchmark for evaluating fine-grained perception and reasoning in spoken language understanding, testing 14 SpeechLLMs and identifying areas for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored capabilities of SpeechLLMs in fine-grained perception and complex reasoning in natural speech, given the rich acoustic information beyond text.

Method: Developed MMSU, a benchmark with 5,000 audio-question-answer triplets across 47 tasks, incorporating diverse linguistic phenomena.

Result: Evaluation of 14 SpeechLLMs revealed significant gaps, suggesting future optimization directions.

Conclusion: MMSU sets a new standard for assessing spoken language understanding, aiding the development of advanced human-AI speech interaction systems.

Abstract: Speech inherently contains rich acoustic information that extends far beyond
the textual language. In real-world spoken language understanding, effective
interpretation often requires integrating semantic meaning (e.g., content),
paralinguistic features (e.g., emotions, speed, pitch) and phonological
characteristics (e.g., prosody, intonation, rhythm), which are embedded in
speech. While recent multimodal Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing audio information, their
ability to perform fine-grained perception and complex reasoning in natural
speech remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce MMSU, a
comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for understanding and reasoning
in spoken language. MMSU comprises 5,000 meticulously curated
audio-question-answer triplets across 47 distinct tasks. To ground our
benchmark in linguistic theory, we systematically incorporate a wide range of
linguistic phenomena, including phonetics, prosody, rhetoric, syntactics,
semantics, and paralinguistics. Through a rigorous evaluation of 14 advanced
SpeechLLMs, we identify substantial room for improvement in existing models,
highlighting meaningful directions for future optimization. MMSU establishes a
new standard for comprehensive assessment of spoken language understanding,
providing valuable insights for developing more sophisticated human-AI speech
interaction systems. MMSU benchmark is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically understand how diverse modalities connect to language backbones in MLLMs, addressing a gap in existing literature.

Method: LLM-centric analysis of 125 MLLMs (2021-2025), focusing on architectural strategies, representation learning, and training paradigms.

Result: Identified emerging patterns and proposed a taxonomy for MLLM integration techniques.

Conclusion: Provides a structured overview to guide future development of robust multimodal integration strategies for pre-trained models.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) has transformed
the AI landscape. These models combine pre-trained LLMs with various modality
encoders. This integration requires a systematic understanding of how different
modalities connect to the language backbone. Our survey presents an LLM-centric
analysis of current approaches. We examine methods for transforming and
aligning diverse modal inputs into the language embedding space. This addresses
a significant gap in existing literature. We propose a classification framework
for MLLMs based on three key dimensions. First, we examine architectural
strategies for modality integration. This includes both the specific
integration mechanisms and the fusion level. Second, we categorize
representation learning techniques as either joint or coordinate
representations. Third, we analyze training paradigms, including training
strategies and objective functions. By examining 125 MLLMs developed between
2021 and 2025, we identify emerging patterns in the field. Our taxonomy
provides researchers with a structured overview of current integration
techniques. These insights aim to guide the development of more robust
multimodal integration strategies for future models built on pre-trained
foundations.

*Yujun Zhou,Jiayi Ye,Zipeng Ling,Yufei Han,Yue Huang,Haomin Zhuang,Zhenwen Liang,Kehan Guo,Taicheng Guo,Xiangqi Wang,Xiangliang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FineLogic is a fine-grained framework evaluating LLM logical reasoning across accuracy, stepwise soundness, and alignment, revealing natural language supervision generalizes better while symbolic styles enhance structural reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on final-answer accuracy, missing reasoning quality and structure. FineLogic aims to provide a more rigorous evaluation.

Method: Proposes FineLogic framework, tests four supervision styles (natural language and symbolic), and analyzes their impact on reasoning.

Result: Natural language supervision generalizes well; symbolic styles improve structural reasoning. Fine-tuning enhances step-by-step generation, not shortcuts.

Conclusion: FineLogic offers a rigorous, interpretable evaluation of LLM reasoning, highlighting supervision format's role in reasoning quality.

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a core capability for many applications of large
language models (LLMs), yet existing benchmarks often rely solely on
final-answer accuracy, failing to capture the quality and structure of the
reasoning process. We propose FineLogic, a fine-grained evaluation framework
that assesses logical reasoning across three dimensions: overall benchmark
accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment. In addition,
to better understand how reasoning capabilities emerge, we conduct a
comprehensive study on the effects of supervision format during fine-tuning. We
construct four supervision styles (one natural language and three symbolic
variants) and train LLMs under each. Our findings reveal that natural language
supervision yields strong generalization even on out-of-distribution and
long-context tasks, while symbolic reasoning styles promote more structurally
sound and atomic inference chains. Further, our representation-level probing
shows that fine-tuning primarily improves reasoning behaviors through
step-by-step generation, rather than enhancing shortcut prediction or
internalized correctness. Together, our framework and analysis provide a more
rigorous and interpretable lens for evaluating and improving logical reasoning
in LLMs.

### [48] [Design of intelligent proofreading system for English translation based on CNN and BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04811)
*Feijun Liu,Huifeng Wang,Kun Wang,Yizhen Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A hybrid CNN-BERT model for machine translation proofreading achieves high accuracy and outperforms recent methods by over 10%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve machine translation quality by detecting and correcting errors like word order issues and omissions.

Method: Combines CNN for local n-gram patterns and BERT for context-rich representations, with an error detection component and correction module using GRU decoders and translation memory.

Result: Achieves 90% accuracy, 89.37% F1, and 16.24% MSE, surpassing recent techniques.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach sets a new benchmark for robust proofreading in machine translation.

Abstract: Since automatic translations can contain errors that require substantial
human post-editing, machine translation proofreading is essential for improving
quality. This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach for robust proofreading
that combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) with Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT). In order to extract semantic
information from phrases and expressions, CNN uses a variety of convolution
kernel filters to capture local n-gram patterns. In the meanwhile, BERT creates
context-rich representations of whole sequences by utilizing stacked
bidirectional transformer encoders. Using BERT's attention processes, the
integrated error detection component relates tokens to spot translation
irregularities including word order problems and omissions. The correction
module then uses parallel English-German alignment and GRU decoder models in
conjunction with translation memory to propose logical modifications that
maintain original meaning. A unified end-to-end training process optimized for
post-editing performance is applied to the whole pipeline. The multi-domain
collection of WMT and the conversational dialogues of Open-Subtitles are two of
the English-German parallel corpora used to train the model. Multiple loss
functions supervise detection and correction capabilities. Experiments attain a
90% accuracy, 89.37% F1, and 16.24% MSE, exceeding recent proofreading
techniques by over 10% overall. Comparative benchmarking demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance in identifying and coherently rectifying
mistranslations and omissions.

*Nurul Aisyah,Muhammad Dehan Al Kautsar,Arif Hidayat,Raqib Chowdhury,Fajri Koto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates VLM and LLM performance in grading and providing feedback on handwritten student responses in underrepresented Indonesian schools, revealing handwriting recognition challenges but some utility in LLM feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effectiveness of VLM and LLMs in real-world educational assessment, particularly in underrepresented contexts like Indonesian schools.

Method: Evaluated a VLM and several LLMs on 646 handwritten exam responses (14K+ answers) from grade 4 students in Mathematics and English, covering grading and feedback generation.

Result: VLMs struggled with handwriting recognition, affecting LLM grading accuracy, but LLM feedback retained some usefulness despite imperfect input.

Conclusion: While VLMs and LLMs show promise for educational assessment, handwriting recognition issues and feedback limitations highlight areas for improvement.

Abstract: Although vision-language and large language models (VLM and LLM) offer
promising opportunities for AI-driven educational assessment, their
effectiveness in real-world classroom settings, particularly in
underrepresented educational contexts, remains underexplored. In this study, we
evaluated the performance of a state-of-the-art VLM and several LLMs on 646
handwritten exam responses from grade 4 students in six Indonesian schools,
covering two subjects: Mathematics and English. These sheets contain more than
14K student answers that span multiple choice, short answer, and essay
questions. Assessment tasks include grading these responses and generating
personalized feedback. Our findings show that the VLM often struggles to
accurately recognize student handwriting, leading to error propagation in
downstream LLM grading. Nevertheless, LLM-generated feedback retains some
utility, even when derived from imperfect input, although limitations in
personalization and contextual relevance persist.

### [50] [A Reasoning-Based Approach to Cryptic Crossword Clue Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04824)
*Martin Andrews,Sam Witteveen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: An LLM-based system solves cryptic crossword clues by hypothesizing answers, proposing wordplay explanations, and verifying reasoning steps, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Cryptonite dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cryptic crossword clues are complex language tasks with daily global releases, requiring a system to solve them without relying on crossing words.

Method: The system uses open-licensed LLM components to hypothesize answers, propose wordplay explanations, and verify solutions via codified reasoning steps.

Result: The system achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Cryptonite dataset, with interpretable reasoning provided in Python.

Conclusion: The work presents a novel, interpretable approach to solving cryptic crosswords, advancing the field with verifiable reasoning.

Abstract: Cryptic crossword clues are challenging language tasks for which new test
sets are released daily by major newspapers on a global basis. Each cryptic
clue contains both the definition of the answer to be placed in the crossword
grid (in common with regular crosswords), and 'wordplay' that proves that the
answer is correct (i.e. a human solver can be confident that an answer is
correct without needing crossing words as confirmation). This work describes an
LLM-based reasoning system built from open-licensed components that solves
cryptic clues by (i) hypothesising answers; (ii) proposing wordplay
explanations; and (iii) using a verifier system that operates on codified
reasoning steps. Overall, this system establishes a new state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging Cryptonite dataset of clues from The Times and
The Telegraph newspapers in the UK. Because each proved solution is expressed
in Python, interpretable wordplay reasoning for proven answers is available for
inspection.

### [51] [Joint Evaluation of Answer and Reasoning Consistency for Hallucination Detection in Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04832)
*Changyue Wang,Weihang Su,Qingyao Ai,Yiqun Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RACE is a new framework for detecting hallucinations in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) by analyzing reasoning traces for consistency, uncertainty, alignment, and coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hallucination detection methods fail to address inconsistencies in reasoning traces of LRMs, which are critical for transparency and performance.

Method: RACE evaluates four diagnostic signals: inter-sample consistency, entropy-based answer uncertainty, semantic alignment, and internal coherence of reasoning.

Result: RACE outperforms existing baselines in detecting hallucinations, even when final answers are correct.

Conclusion: RACE provides a robust and generalizable solution for evaluating LRMs, enhancing their reliability.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) extend large language models with explicit,
multi-step reasoning traces to enhance transparency and performance on complex
tasks. However, these reasoning traces can be redundant or logically
inconsistent, making them a new source of hallucination that is difficult to
detect. Existing hallucination detection methods focus primarily on
answer-level uncertainty and often fail to detect hallucinations or logical
inconsistencies arising from the model's reasoning trace. This oversight is
particularly problematic for LRMs, where the explicit thinking trace is not
only an important support to the model's decision-making process but also a key
source of potential hallucination. To this end, we propose RACE (Reasoning and
Answer Consistency Evaluation), a novel framework specifically tailored for
hallucination detection in LRMs. RACE operates by extracting essential
reasoning steps and computing four diagnostic signals: inter-sample consistency
of reasoning traces, entropy-based answer uncertainty, semantic alignment
between reasoning and answers, and internal coherence of reasoning. This joint
analysis enables fine-grained hallucination detection even when the final
answer appears correct. Experiments across datasets and different LLMs
demonstrate that RACE outperforms existing hallucination detection baselines,
offering a robust and generalizable solution for evaluating LRMs. Our code is
available at: https://github.com/bebr2/RACE.

*Dávid Javorský,Ondřej Bojar,François Yvon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MockConf, a student interpreting dataset, and InterAlign, a web-based tool for aligning simultaneous interpreting, addressing gaps in existing parallel corpora and alignment methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and automate simultaneous interpreting, dedicated datasets and tools are needed, as existing resources fail to model long-range interactions and specific divergences between original and interpreted speeches.

Method: The authors collected MockConf, a dataset from student mock conferences, and developed InterAlign, a web-based annotation tool for parallel word and span alignment.

Result: The dataset includes 7 hours of recordings in 5 languages, transcribed and aligned. InterAlign supports annotation and evaluation metrics, with a baseline for automatic alignment.

Conclusion: MockConf and InterAlign are released to the community, providing resources for analyzing and automating simultaneous interpreting tasks.

Abstract: In simultaneous interpreting, an interpreter renders a source speech into
another language with a very short lag, much sooner than sentences are
finished. In order to understand and later reproduce this dynamic and complex
task automatically, we need dedicated datasets and tools for analysis,
monitoring, and evaluation, such as parallel speech corpora, and tools for
their automatic annotation. Existing parallel corpora of translated texts and
associated alignment algorithms hardly fill this gap, as they fail to model
long-range interactions between speech segments or specific types of
divergences (e.g., shortening, simplification, functional generalization)
between the original and interpreted speeches. In this work, we introduce
MockConf, a student interpreting dataset that was collected from Mock
Conferences run as part of the students' curriculum. This dataset contains 7
hours of recordings in 5 European languages, transcribed and aligned at the
level of spans and words. We further implement and release InterAlign, a modern
web-based annotation tool for parallel word and span annotations on long
inputs, suitable for aligning simultaneous interpreting. We propose metrics for
the evaluation and a baseline for automatic alignment. Dataset and tools are
released to the community.

### [53] [Multiple-Choice Question Generation Using Large Language Models: Methodology and Educator Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04851)
*Giorgio Biancini,Alessio Ferrato,Carla Limongelli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using LLMs (Llama 2, Mistral, GPT-3.5) to generate MCQs, showing GPT-3.5 performs best, while highlighting educator reluctance toward AI adoption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual MCQ generation is resource-intensive; LLMs offer a promising solution to streamline this process.

Method: Comparative analysis of three LLMs, injecting knowledge into prompts to control source text and reduce hallucinations.

Result: GPT-3.5 generates the most effective MCQs, though educators remain hesitant about AI adoption.

Conclusion: LLMs have potential to improve MCQ generation and education, but adoption barriers need addressing.

Abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) in educational settings has brought
new learning approaches, transforming the practices of both students and
educators. Among the various technologies driving this transformation, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for creating educational
materials and question answering, but there are still space for new
applications. Educators commonly use Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) to assess
student knowledge, but manually generating these questions is
resource-intensive and requires significant time and cognitive effort. In our
opinion, LLMs offer a promising solution to these challenges. This paper
presents a novel comparative analysis of three widely known LLMs - Llama 2,
Mistral, and GPT-3.5 - to explore their potential for creating informative and
challenging MCQs. In our approach, we do not rely on the knowledge of the LLM,
but we inject the knowledge into the prompt to contrast the hallucinations,
giving the educators control over the test's source text, too. Our experiment
involving 21 educators shows that GPT-3.5 generates the most effective MCQs
across several known metrics. Additionally, it shows that there is still some
reluctance to adopt AI in the educational field. This study sheds light on the
potential of LLMs to generate MCQs and improve the educational experience,
providing valuable insights for the future.

### [54] [Prompting LLMs: Length Control for Isometric Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04855)
*Dávid Javorský,Ondřej Bojar,François Yvon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates isometric machine translation using LLMs, focusing on prompt strategies, few-shot examples, and demonstration selection. It finds that instruction phrasing and extreme examples influence length control, while few-shot prompting improves quality marginally beyond 5 examples. Multiple outputs enhance the length-quality tradeoff.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how prompting strategies, few-shot examples, and demonstration selection affect translation quality and length control in isometric machine translation.

Method: Used eight open-source LLMs of varying sizes, tested different prompting strategies, few-shot examples (5, 10, 20), and demonstration selection under IWSLT Isometric Shared Task 2022 conditions.

Result: Instruction phrasing and extreme examples impact length control; few-shot prompting improves quality marginally beyond 5 examples; multiple outputs enhance the length-quality tradeoff, achieving state-of-the-art performance for some language pairs.

Conclusion: Effective length control in isometric translation requires aligned instructions and extreme examples, while few-shot prompting and multiple outputs optimize the tradeoff between quality and length.

Abstract: In this study, we explore the effectiveness of isometric machine translation
across multiple language pairs (En$\to$De, En$\to$Fr, and En$\to$Es) under the
conditions of the IWSLT Isometric Shared Task 2022. Using eight open-source
large language models (LLMs) of varying sizes, we investigate how different
prompting strategies, varying numbers of few-shot examples, and demonstration
selection influence translation quality and length control. We discover that
the phrasing of instructions, when aligned with the properties of the provided
demonstrations, plays a crucial role in controlling the output length. Our
experiments show that LLMs tend to produce shorter translations only when
presented with extreme examples, while isometric demonstrations often lead to
the models disregarding length constraints. While few-shot prompting generally
enhances translation quality, further improvements are marginal across 5, 10,
and 20-shot settings. Finally, considering multiple outputs allows to notably
improve overall tradeoff between the length and quality, yielding
state-of-the-art performance for some language pairs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates Universal Dependencies (UD) by integrating them into pretrained language models for cross-lingual adversarial paraphrase identification, showing improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored effectiveness of UD in cross-lingual syntactic representation and its potential to enhance pretrained models.

Method: Integrating UD into pretrained language models and testing on a cross-lingual adversarial paraphrase identification task.

Result: UD integration improves accuracy and F1 scores by 3.85% and 6.08% on average, reducing performance gaps with large models and outperforming them in some cases.

Conclusion: UD is validated as effective for out-of-domain tasks, with performance correlated to UD-based similarity scores between languages and English.

Abstract: Universal Dependencies (UD), while widely regarded as the most successful
linguistic framework for cross-lingual syntactic representation, remains
underexplored in terms of its effectiveness. This paper addresses this gap by
integrating UD into pretrained language models and assesses if UD can improve
their performance on a cross-lingual adversarial paraphrase identification
task. Experimental results show that incorporation of UD yields significant
improvements in accuracy and $F_1$ scores, with average gains of 3.85\% and
6.08\% respectively. These enhancements reduce the performance gap between
pretrained models and large language models in some language pairs, and even
outperform the latter in some others. Furthermore, the UD-based similarity
score between a given language and English is positively correlated to the
performance of models in that language. Both findings highlight the validity
and potential of UD in out-of-domain tasks.

*Shiyi Xu,Yiwen Hu,Yingqian Min,Zhipeng Chen,Wayne Xin Zhao,Ji-Rong Wen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ICPC-Eval, a competitive coding benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in realistic competition scenarios, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks and metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks and metrics like LiveCodeBench and Pass@K are inadequate for assessing LLMs' coding and reflective reasoning abilities in real competition settings.

Method: ICPC-Eval includes 118 ICPC contest problems, a robust test case generation method, and a new metric, Refine@K, for iterative solution repair.

Result: Top-tier LLMs like DeepSeek-R1 require multi-turn feedback to unlock reasoning potential, yet still underperform compared to top human teams.

Conclusion: ICPC-Eval provides a challenging and realistic benchmark, highlighting the need for better evaluation of LLMs' complex reasoning abilities.

Abstract: With the significant progress of large reasoning models in complex coding and
reasoning tasks, existing benchmarks, like LiveCodeBench and CodeElo, are
insufficient to evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) in real competition environments. Moreover, current evaluation metrics
such as Pass@K fail to capture the reflective abilities of reasoning models. To
address these challenges, we propose \textbf{ICPC-Eval}, a top-level
competitive coding benchmark designed to probing the frontiers of LLM
reasoning. ICPC-Eval includes 118 carefully curated problems from 11 recent
ICPC contests held in various regions of the world, offering three key
contributions: 1) A challenging realistic ICPC competition scenario, featuring
a problem type and difficulty distribution consistent with actual contests. 2)
A robust test case generation method and a corresponding local evaluation
toolkit, enabling efficient and accurate local evaluation. 3) An effective
test-time scaling evaluation metric, Refine@K, which allows iterative repair of
solutions based on execution feedback. The results underscore the significant
challenge in evaluating complex reasoning abilities: top-tier reasoning models
like DeepSeek-R1 often rely on multi-turn code feedback to fully unlock their
in-context reasoning potential when compared to non-reasoning counterparts.
Furthermore, despite recent advancements in code generation, these models still
lag behind top-performing human teams. We release the benchmark at:

*Alex Pan,Mary-Anne Williams*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Verbose ListOps is a benchmark designed to test LLMs' nested reasoning by converting ListOps computations into lengthy stories, revealing their struggle with state management and intermediate results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to adequately test LLMs' nested reasoning due to unrealistic distractors or conflated context length and reasoning complexity.

Method: Verbose ListOps programmatically transforms ListOps into coherent stories, controlling narrative size and reasoning difficulty while withholding intermediate results.

Result: Leading LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) perform poorly on Verbose ListOps at modest narrative lengths (~10k tokens), despite excelling at raw ListOps.

Conclusion: Verbose ListOps highlights a critical LLM limitation in nested reasoning and state management, offering a framework for targeted improvements beyond context-window expansion.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), whilst great at extracting facts from text,
struggle with nested narrative reasoning. Existing long context and multi-hop
QA benchmarks inadequately test this, lacking realistic distractors or failing
to decouple context length from reasoning complexity, masking a fundamental LLM
limitation. We introduce Verbose ListOps, a novel benchmark that
programmatically transposes ListOps computations into lengthy, coherent
stories. This uniquely forces internal computation and state management of
nested reasoning problems by withholding intermediate results, and offers
fine-grained controls for both narrative size \emph{and} reasoning difficulty.
Whilst benchmarks like LongReason (2025) advance approaches for synthetically
expanding the context size of multi-hop QA problems, Verbose ListOps pinpoints
a specific LLM vulnerability: difficulty in state management for nested
sub-reasoning amongst semantically-relevant, distracting narrative. Our
experiments show that leading LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) collapse
in performance on Verbose ListOps at modest (~10k token) narrative lengths,
despite effortlessly solving raw ListOps equations. Addressing this failure is
paramount for real-world text interpretation which requires identifying key
reasoning points, tracking conceptual intermediate results, and filtering
irrelevant information. Verbose ListOps, and its extensible generation
framework thus enables targeted reasoning enhancements beyond mere
context-window expansion; a critical step to automating the world's knowledge
work.

TL;DR: A hybrid HMM and self-supervised model outperforms fine-tuned multilingual E2E models for low-resource ASR, reducing WER by 32% on Scottish Gaelic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenge the belief that fine-tuning multilingual E2E models is the best approach for low-resource ASR, proposing a better alternative.

Method: Combine hybrid HMMs with self-supervised models for improved data utilization via continued pre-training and semi-supervised training.

Result: Achieves a 32% relative WER reduction over fine-tuned Whisper models on Scottish Gaelic.

Conclusion: Hybrid HMM and self-supervised models are more effective than fine-tuned E2E models for low-resource ASR.

Abstract: An effective approach to the development of ASR systems for low-resource
languages is to fine-tune an existing multilingual end-to-end model. When the
original model has been trained on large quantities of data from many
languages, fine-tuning can be effective with limited training data, even when
the language in question was not present in the original training data. The
fine-tuning approach has been encouraged by the availability of public-domain
E2E models and is widely believed to lead to state-of-the-art results. This
paper, however, challenges that belief. We show that an approach combining
hybrid HMMs with self-supervised models can yield substantially better
performance with limited training data. This combination allows better
utilisation of all available speech and text data through continued
self-supervised pre-training and semi-supervised training. We benchmark our
approach on Scottish Gaelic, achieving WER reductions of 32% relative over our
best fine-tuned Whisper model.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can provide multilingual instructional feedback, improving learning outcomes, especially in low-resource languages when aligned with the student's native language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' effectiveness in providing instructional support across diverse languages, particularly for math-based reasoning tasks.

Method: Simulated tutor-student interactions using LLMs across 11 languages, testing feedback strategies and model choices.

Result: Multilingual hints significantly boost learning, especially in low-resource languages when feedback matches the student's language.

Conclusion: LLMs can enhance multilingual education by offering effective, inclusive feedback, with language alignment being key.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate
formative feedback and instructional hints in English, making them increasingly
relevant for AI-assisted education. However, their ability to provide effective
instructional support across different languages, especially for mathematically
grounded reasoning tasks, remains largely unexamined. In this work, we present
the first large-scale simulation of multilingual tutor-student interactions
using LLMs. A stronger model plays the role of the tutor, generating feedback
in the form of hints, while a weaker model simulates the student. We explore
352 experimental settings across 11 typologically diverse languages, four
state-of-the-art LLMs, and multiple prompting strategies to assess whether
language-specific feedback leads to measurable learning gains. Our study
examines how student input language, teacher feedback language, model choice,
and language resource level jointly influence performance. Results show that
multilingual hints can significantly improve learning outcomes, particularly in
low-resource languages when feedback is aligned with the student's native
language. These findings offer practical insights for developing multilingual,
LLM-based educational tools that are both effective and inclusive.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ConECT, a Czech-to-Polish e-commerce dataset, and shows that adding contextual information (images, metadata) improves NMT quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NMT struggles with word ambiguity and context, especially in domain-specific applications like e-commerce.

Method: Created ConECT dataset (11,400 sentence pairs with images/metadata) and tested vision-language models and text-to-text models with contextual info.

Result: Visual context and additional metadata improved translation quality.

Conclusion: Incorporating contextual information enhances NMT performance; the dataset is publicly available.

Abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has improved translation by using
Transformer-based models, but it still struggles with word ambiguity and
context. This problem is especially important in domain-specific applications,
which often have problems with unclear sentences or poor data quality. Our
research explores how adding information to models can improve translations in
the context of e-commerce data. To this end we create ConECT -- a new
Czech-to-Polish e-commerce product translation dataset coupled with images and
product metadata consisting of 11,400 sentence pairs. We then investigate and
compare different methods that are applicable to context-aware translation. We
test a vision-language model (VLM), finding that visual context aids
translation quality. Additionally, we explore the incorporation of contextual
information into text-to-text models, such as the product's category path or
image descriptions. The results of our study demonstrate that the incorporation
of contextual information leads to an improvement in the quality of machine
translation. We make the new dataset publicly available.

Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' capabilities on challenging algorithmic problems and explore their potential in educational settings.

Method: Testing multiple LLMs on Romanian and English versions of university-level algorithms exams, analyzing problem-solving, consistency, and multilingual performance.

Result: Recent models achieve scores akin to top students, excel in reasoning, but face challenges with graph-based tasks.

Conclusion: LLMs hold promise for enhancing algorithm education through content generation and feedback, with further integration potential.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of
state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) on challenging university-level

reveals that the most recent models not only achieve scores comparable to
top-performing students but also demonstrate robust reasoning skills on
complex, multi-step algorithmic challenges, even though difficulties remain
with graph-based tasks. Building on these findings, we explore the potential of
LLMs to support educational environments through the generation of high-quality
editorial content, offering instructors a powerful tool to enhance student

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes an incremental semi-supervised learning pipeline for fine-tuning ASR models with scarce labeled data, leveraging auxiliary datasets and pseudo-label refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of fine-tuning ASR models for specific domains with limited labeled data by utilizing available unlabeled audio and labeled data from related domains.

Method: Uses an incremental pipeline integrating small in-domain labeled data and auxiliary datasets, followed by pseudo-label refinement via multi-model consensus or NER filtering.

Result: Achieves 4% improvement with auxiliary data; consensus-based filtering provides up to 22.3% and 24.8% relative improvement on Wow and Fisher corpora, respectively.

Conclusion: Consensus-based filtering is most effective, while NER offers competitive performance with lower computational cost.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained ASR models for specific domains is challenging when
labeled data is scarce. But unlabeled audio and labeled data from related
domains are often available. We propose an incremental semi-supervised learning
pipeline that first integrates a small in-domain labeled set and an auxiliary
dataset from a closely related domain, achieving a relative improvement of 4%
over no auxiliary data. Filtering based on multi-model consensus or named
entity recognition (NER) is then applied to select and iteratively refine
pseudo-labels, showing slower performance saturation compared to random
selection. Evaluated on the multi-domain Wow call center and Fisher English
corpora, it outperforms single-step fine-tuning. Consensus-based filtering
outperforms other methods, providing up to 22.3% relative improvement on Wow
and 24.8% on Fisher over single-step fine-tuning with random selection. NER is
the second-best filter, providing competitive performance at a lower
computational cost.

*Yongjie Xiao,Hongru Liang,Peixin Qin,Yao Zhang,Wenqiang Lei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SCOP evaluates LLMs' comprehension skills from a cognitive perspective, revealing gaps in expert-level alignment and reliability, suggesting process-focused improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess whether LLMs' comprehension aligns with experts and identify shortcomings in their reasoning processes.

Method: Proposes SCOP, a framework with five defined comprehension skills, structured testing data, and analysis of open/closed-source LLMs.

Result: LLMs struggle with expert-level comprehension, show biases (e.g., local vs. global info), and may produce correct answers via flawed processes.

Conclusion: Improving LLMs requires focusing on comprehension processes and skill development during training.

Abstract: Despite the great potential of large language models(LLMs) in machine
comprehension, it is still disturbing to fully count on them in real-world
scenarios. This is probably because there is no rational explanation for
whether the comprehension process of LLMs is aligned with that of experts. In
this paper, we propose SCOP to carefully examine how LLMs perform during the
comprehension process from a cognitive view. Specifically, it is equipped with
a systematical definition of five requisite skills during the comprehension
process, a strict framework to construct testing data for these skills, and a
detailed analysis of advanced open-sourced and closed-sourced LLMs using the
testing data. With SCOP, we find that it is still challenging for LLMs to
perform an expert-level comprehension process. Even so, we notice that LLMs
share some similarities with experts, e.g., performing better at comprehending
local information than global information. Further analysis reveals that LLMs
can be somewhat unreliable -- they might reach correct answers through flawed
comprehension processes. Based on SCOP, we suggest that one direction for
improving LLMs is to focus more on the comprehension process, ensuring all
comprehension skills are thoroughly developed during training.

*Zeno Belligoli,Emmanouil Stergiadis,Eran Fainman,Ilya Gusev*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A simple method to control text summary length by adjusting EOS token prediction in loss computation, compatible with various models and decoding methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for controlling text length are complex and incompatible with pre-trained models.

Method: Adjusts the importance of predicting the EOS token in cross-entropy loss to control length.

Result: Effective length control without compromising summary quality, tested on encoder-decoder and GPT-style models.

Conclusion: The proposed method is versatile, simple, and maintains summary quality while controlling length.

Abstract: Controlling the length of generated text can be crucial in various
text-generation tasks, including summarization. Existing methods often require
complex model alterations, limiting compatibility with pre-trained models. We
address these limitations by developing a simple approach for controlling the
length of automatic text summaries by increasing the importance of correctly
predicting the EOS token in the cross-entropy loss computation. The proposed
methodology is agnostic to architecture and decoding algorithms and orthogonal
to other inference-time techniques to control the generation length. We tested
it with encoder-decoder and modern GPT-style LLMs, and show that this method
can control generation length, often without affecting the quality of the
summary.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AR-Checker is a framework for testing LLM robustness by generating semantically equivalent but challenging mathematical problem variants, minimizing data contamination risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often fail unexpectedly on simple reasoning tasks, and existing robustness evaluations rely on limited or hand-crafted templates, risking data contamination.

Method: AR-Checker uses multi-round parallel LLM-based rewriting and verification to generate problem variants dynamically.

Result: AR-Checker performs well on GSM8K, MATH-500, and other benchmarks like MMLU and CommonsenseQA.

Conclusion: AR-Checker effectively tests LLM robustness across diverse tasks, proving its versatility and minimizing contamination risks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved distinguished performance on
various reasoning-intensive tasks. However, LLMs might still face the
challenges of robustness issues and fail unexpectedly in some simple reasoning
tasks. Previous works evaluate the LLM robustness with hand-crafted templates
or a limited set of perturbation rules, indicating potential data contamination
in pre-training or fine-tuning datasets. In this work, inspired by stress
testing in software engineering, we propose a novel framework, Automatic
Robustness Checker (AR-Checker), to generate mathematical problem variants that
maintain the semantic meanings of the original one but might fail the LLMs. The
AR-Checker framework generates mathematical problem variants through
multi-round parallel streams of LLM-based rewriting and verification. Our
framework can generate benchmark variants dynamically for each LLM, thus
minimizing the risk of data contamination. Experiments on GSM8K and MATH-500
demonstrate the strong performance of AR-Checker on mathematical tasks. We also
evaluate AR-Checker on benchmarks beyond mathematics, including MMLU, MMLU-Pro,
and CommonsenseQA, where it also achieves strong performance, further proving
the effectiveness of AR-Checker.

TL;DR: TALL enhances LLM performance for low-resource languages by integrating bilingual translation models and lightweight adapters, improving Hebrew task results efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs underperform in low-resource languages due to limited training data, necessitating innovative solutions like TALL.

Method: TALL combines an LLM with bilingual translation models, using dimension alignment and custom transformers to process low-resource inputs. It freezes pre-trained components and trains lightweight adapters for efficiency.

Result: Experiments on Hebrew show TALL outperforms baselines like direct use, naive translation, and fine-tuning.

Conclusion: TALL effectively boosts LLM performance for low-resource languages with a parameter-efficient approach.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in high-resource languages but struggle
with low-resource languages due to limited training data. This paper presents
TALL (Trainable Architecture for Enhancing LLM Performance in Low-Resource
Languages), which integrates an LLM with two bilingual translation models. TALL
transforms low-resource inputs into high-resource representations, leveraging
the LLM's capabilities while preserving linguistic features through dimension
alignment layers and custom transformers. Our experiments on Hebrew demonstrate
significant improvements over several baselines, including direct use, naive
translation, and fine-tuning approaches. The architecture employs a
parameter-efficient strategy, freezing pre-trained components while training
only lightweight adapter modules, balancing computational efficiency with
performance gains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Debate Speech Evaluation as a benchmark for LLM judges, analyzing their performance against human judges using a dataset of 600 annotated speeches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' ability to evaluate debate speeches, a task requiring deep understanding of argument strength, coherence, style, and tone, which has been understudied in LLM benchmarking.

Method: Leveraged a dataset of 600 annotated debate speeches to compare state-of-the-art LLMs with human judges, analyzing judgment behavior and speech generation.

Result: Larger LLMs approximate human judgments in some aspects but differ overall. Frontier LLMs can generate persuasive speeches at human levels.

Conclusion: Debate Speech Evaluation is a valuable benchmark for LLMs, revealing nuanced differences from human judges and potential in speech generation.

Abstract: We introduce Debate Speech Evaluation as a novel and challenging benchmark
for assessing LLM judges. Evaluating debate speeches requires a deep
understanding of the speech at multiple levels, including argument strength and
relevance, the coherence and organization of the speech, the appropriateness of
its style and tone, and so on. This task involves a unique set of cognitive
abilities that have previously received limited attention in systematic LLM
benchmarking. To explore such skills, we leverage a dataset of over 600
meticulously annotated debate speeches and present the first in-depth analysis
of how state-of-the-art LLMs compare to human judges on this task. Our findings
reveal a nuanced picture: while larger models can approximate individual human
judgments in some respects, they differ substantially in their overall judgment
behavior. We also investigate the ability of frontier LLMs to generate
persuasive, opinionated speeches, showing that models may perform at a human
level on this task.

### [69] [Does It Make Sense to Speak of Introspection in Large Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05068)
*Iulia Comşa,Murray Shanahan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines whether LLMs' self-reports can be considered introspection, analyzing two examples: one invalid and one minimal case.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how to interpret self-reports from LLMs and assess if the concept of introspection applies to them.

Method: Critique of two examples of LLM self-reports: one on creative writing and another on inferring its temperature parameter.

Result: The first example is invalid as introspection, while the second is a minimal case, though likely without consciousness.

Conclusion: Introspection can be minimally applied to LLMs in specific cases, but lacks conscious experience.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit compelling linguistic behaviour, and
sometimes offer self-reports, that is to say statements about their own nature,
inner workings, or behaviour. In humans, such reports are often attributed to a
faculty of introspection and are typically linked to consciousness. This raises
the question of how to interpret self-reports produced by LLMs, given their
increasing linguistic fluency and cognitive capabilities. To what extent (if
any) can the concept of introspection be meaningfully applied to LLMs? Here, we
present and critique two examples of apparent introspective self-report from
LLMs. In the first example, an LLM attempts to describe the process behind its
own ``creative'' writing, and we argue this is not a valid example of
introspection. In the second example, an LLM correctly infers the value of its
own temperature parameter, and we argue that this can be legitimately
considered a minimal example of introspection, albeit one that is (presumably)
not accompanied by conscious experience.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates poor performance of LLMs with RLHF in colloquial subtitle translation, attributing it to reward model divergence. It proposes RIVAL, an adversarial training framework, to align the RM and LLM, improving translation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The unexpected poor performance of LLMs combined with RLHF in colloquial subtitle translation tasks motivated the study. The divergence between the offline reward model and the online LLM was identified as the root cause.

Method: The authors propose RIVAL, an adversarial training framework where the RM and LLM engage in a min-max game. The RM distinguishes strong from weak translations, while the LLM improves to close the gap. Quantitative preference rewards (e.g., BLEU) are also incorporated.

Result: Extensive experiments show that RIVAL significantly improves translation quality compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The adversarial training framework RIVAL effectively addresses the divergence issue between the RM and LLM, enhancing translation performance in colloquial tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess strong multilingual capabilities, and
combining Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with translation
tasks has shown great potential. However, we observe that this paradigm
performs unexpectedly poorly when applied to colloquial subtitle translation
tasks. In this work, we investigate this issue and find that the offline reward
model (RM) gradually diverges from the online LLM due to distributional shift,
ultimately leading to undesirable training outcomes. To address this, we
propose RIVAL, an adversarial training framework that formulates the process as
a min-max game between the RM and the LLM. RIVAL iteratively updates the both
models, with the RM trained to distinguish strong from weak translations
(qualitative preference reward), and the LLM trained to enhance its translation
for closing this gap. To stabilize training and improve generalizability, we
also incorporate quantitative preference reward (e.g., BLEU) into the RM,
enabling reference-free quality modeling aligned with human evaluation. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed adversarial training
framework significantly improves upon translation baselines.

*Soumitra Ghosh,Gopendra Vikram Singh,Shambhavi,Sabarna Choudhury,Asif Ekbal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CESM-100 and SHINES to improve self-harm detection on social media by leveraging nuanced emoji-language interplay, fine-tuning LLMs, and providing explainable predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of self-harm intent on social media is crucial for suicide prevention, but current LLMs struggle with implicit cues in casual language and emojis.

Method: The framework enriches inputs with CESM-100, fine-tunes LLMs for multi-task learning (self-harm detection and intent span detection), and generates explainable rationales.

Result: The approach enhances LLM performance in detection and explanation tasks, addressing ambiguity in self-harm signals.

Conclusion: The SHINES dataset, CESM-100, and framework improve self-harm detection and intent differentiation, with publicly available resources.

Abstract: Self-harm detection on social media is critical for early intervention and
mental health support, yet remains challenging due to the subtle,
context-dependent nature of such expressions. Identifying self-harm intent aids
suicide prevention by enabling timely responses, but current large language
models (LLMs) struggle to interpret implicit cues in casual language and
emojis. This work enhances LLMs' comprehension of self-harm by distinguishing
intent through nuanced language-emoji interplay. We present the Centennial
Emoji Sensitivity Matrix (CESM-100), a curated set of 100 emojis with
contextual self-harm interpretations and the Self-Harm Identification aNd
intent Extraction with Supportive emoji sensitivity (SHINES) dataset, offering
detailed annotations for self-harm labels, casual mentions (CMs), and serious
intents (SIs). Our unified framework: a) enriches inputs using CESM-100; b)
fine-tunes LLMs for multi-task learning: self-harm detection (primary) and
CM/SI span detection (auxiliary); c) generates explainable rationales for
self-harm predictions. We evaluate the framework on three state-of-the-art
LLMs-Llama 3, Mental-Alpaca, and MentalLlama, across zero-shot, few-shot, and
fine-tuned scenarios. By coupling intent differentiation with contextual cues,
our approach commendably enhances LLM performance in both detection and
explanation tasks, effectively addressing the inherent ambiguity in self-harm
signals. The SHINES dataset, CESM-100 and codebase are publicly available at:

TL;DR: The study explores how street-level features like vehicle density, greenery, and cleanliness impact retail performance and user satisfaction in Harbin, China, using AI-assisted perception and urban morphological analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the complex interactions between vehicular accessibility, environmental quality, and pedestrian perception in shaping community-scale streets' commercial vitality.

Method: An interpretable, image-based framework leveraging street view imagery, VisualGLM-6B, and GPT-4-based perception modeling to analyze spatial attributes and construct a Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI).

Result: Moderate vehicle presence enhances access, but excessive parking reduces walkability and satisfaction. Greenery and cleanliness boost satisfaction but weakly affect pricing. Street width moderates vehicle effects.

Conclusion: The study highlights the conditional role of vehicle activity in commerce and demonstrates the feasibility of multimodal AI for urban diagnostics, with implications for urban design and planning.

Abstract: The commercial vitality of community-scale streets in Chinese cities is
shaped by complex interactions between vehicular accessibility, environmental
quality, and pedestrian perception. This study proposes an interpretable,
image-based framework to examine how street-level features -- including parked
vehicle density, greenery, cleanliness, and street width -- impact retail
performance and user satisfaction in Harbin, China. Leveraging street view
imagery and a multimodal large language model (VisualGLM-6B), we construct a
Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI) from Meituan and Dianping data and
analyze its relationship with spatial attributes extracted via GPT-4-based
perception modeling. Our findings reveal that while moderate vehicle presence
may enhance commercial access, excessive on-street parking -- especially in
narrow streets -- erodes walkability and reduces both satisfaction and
shop-level pricing. In contrast, streets with higher perceived greenery and
cleanliness show significantly greater satisfaction scores but only weak
associations with pricing. Street width moderates the effects of vehicle
presence, underscoring the importance of spatial configuration. These results
demonstrate the value of integrating AI-assisted perception with urban
morphological analysis to capture non-linear and context-sensitive drivers of
commercial success. This study advances both theoretical and methodological
frontiers by highlighting the conditional role of vehicle activity in
neighborhood commerce and demonstrating the feasibility of multimodal AI for
perceptual urban diagnostics. The implications extend to urban design, parking
management, and scalable planning tools for community revitalization.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CL-ISR, a framework combining contrastive learning and implicit stance reasoning to detect misleading texts on social media, improving accuracy by capturing semantic differences and implicit stance tendencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misleading texts on social media cause public misunderstanding, panic, and economic losses, necessitating better detection methods.

Method: CL-ISR uses contrastive learning to distinguish truthful from misleading texts and implicit stance reasoning to analyze stance tendencies and topic relationships.

Result: The framework enhances detection accuracy by effectively capturing distinguishing features and implicit information.

Conclusion: CL-ISR significantly improves misleading text detection by integrating contrastive learning and stance reasoning.

Abstract: Misleading text detection on social media platforms is a critical research
area, as these texts can lead to public misunderstanding, social panic and even
economic losses. This paper proposes a novel framework - CL-ISR (Contrastive
Learning and Implicit Stance Reasoning), which combines contrastive learning
and implicit stance reasoning, to improve the detection accuracy of misleading
texts on social media. First, we use the contrastive learning algorithm to
improve the model's learning ability of semantic differences between truthful
and misleading texts. Contrastive learning could help the model to better
capture the distinguishing features between different categories by
constructing positive and negative sample pairs. This approach enables the
model to capture distinguishing features more effectively, particularly in
linguistically complicated situations. Second, we introduce the implicit stance
reasoning module, to explore the potential stance tendencies in the text and
their relationships with related topics. This method is effective for
identifying content that misleads through stance shifting or emotional
manipulation, because it can capture the implicit information behind the text.
Finally, we integrate these two algorithms together to form a new framework,
CL-ISR, which leverages the discriminative power of contrastive learning and
the interpretive depth of stance reasoning to significantly improve detection
effect.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a system combining wav2vec 2.0 and Phi-4 MLLM to improve spoken language assessment, achieving competitive results in the Speak & Improve Challenge 2025.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural models (BERT and wav2vec 2.0) for spoken language assessment have modality-specific limitations—BERT lacks prosodic cues, while wav2vec lacks semantic interpretability.

Method: The proposed system integrates wav2vec 2.0 with Phi-4 MLLM using a score fusion strategy.

Result: The system achieves an RMSE of 0.375, securing second place in the competition, outperforming the baseline (0.444) and close to the top-ranked system (0.364).

Conclusion: The fusion of acoustic and semantic models enhances spoken language assessment, demonstrating competitive performance.

Abstract: A recent line of research on spoken language assessment (SLA) employs neural
models such as BERT and wav2vec 2.0 (W2V) to evaluate speaking proficiency
across linguistic and acoustic modalities. Although both models effectively
capture features relevant to oral competence, each exhibits modality-specific
limitations. BERT-based methods rely on ASR transcripts, which often fail to
capture prosodic and phonetic cues for SLA. In contrast, W2V-based methods
excel at modeling acoustic features but lack semantic interpretability. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a system that integrates W2V with Phi-4
multimodal large language model (MLLM) through a score fusion strategy. The
proposed system achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.375 on the
official test set of the Speak & Improve Challenge 2025, securing second place
in the competition. For comparison, the RMSEs of the top-ranked, third-ranked,
and official baseline systems are 0.364, 0.384, and 0.444, respectively.

*Tanmay Parekh,Kartik Mehta,Ninareh Mehrabi,Kai-Wei Chang,Nanyun Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiCoRe, a divergent-convergent reasoning framework, improves zero-shot event detection by combining open-ended discovery (Dreamer) and task-aligned reasoning (Grounder), outperforming baselines by 4-7% F1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot event detection is challenging for LLMs due to complex event ontologies and domain-specific triggers. DiCoRe addresses this by decoupling the task into divergent and convergent reasoning.

Method: DiCoRe uses Dreamer for open-ended event discovery (divergent reasoning) and Grounder for task-aligned structured predictions (convergent reasoning), with an LLM-Judge for verification.

Result: DiCoRe outperforms prior baselines by 4-7% F1 on six datasets across five domains and nine LLMs.

Conclusion: DiCoRe is a robust zero-shot event detection framework, enhancing coverage and precision through its reasoning approach.

Abstract: Zero-shot Event Detection (ED), the task of identifying event mentions in
natural language text without any training data, is critical for document
understanding in specialized domains. Understanding the complex event ontology,
extracting domain-specific triggers from the passage, and structuring them
appropriately overloads and limits the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs)
for zero-shot ED. To this end, we propose DiCoRe, a divergent-convergent
reasoning framework that decouples the task of ED using Dreamer and Grounder.
Dreamer encourages divergent reasoning through open-ended event discovery,
which helps to boost event coverage. Conversely, Grounder introduces convergent
reasoning to align the free-form predictions with the task-specific
instructions using finite-state machine guided constrained decoding.
Additionally, an LLM-Judge verifies the final outputs to ensure high precision.
Through extensive experiments on six datasets across five domains and nine
LLMs, we demonstrate how DiCoRe consistently outperforms prior zero-shot,
transfer-learning, and reasoning baselines, achieving 4-7% average F1 gains
over the best baseline -- establishing DiCoRe as a strong zero-shot ED
framework.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to study inductive biases in neural language models (LMs) using $m$-local entropy, showing that higher entropy languages are harder for LMs to learn, aligning with human-like sensitivity to local statistical structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether the inductive biases of neural LMs align with human processing constraints by quantitatively analyzing their sensitivity to local language structure.

Method: Introduces $m$-local entropy, an information-theoretic measure, to quantify local uncertainty in languages. Tests on perturbed natural language corpora and PFSA-defined languages using Transformer and LSTM LMs.

Result: Higher $m$-local entropy languages are more challenging for LMs to learn, indicating sensitivity to local statistical structure.

Conclusion: Neural LMs exhibit human-like sensitivity to local language structure, suggesting alignment in inductive biases.

Abstract: Inductive biases are inherent in every machine learning system, shaping how
models generalize from finite data. In the case of neural language models
(LMs), debates persist as to whether these biases align with or diverge from
human processing constraints. To address this issue, we propose a quantitative
framework that allows for controlled investigations into the nature of these
biases. Within our framework, we introduce $m$-local entropy$\unicode{x2013}$an
information-theoretic measure derived from average lossy-context
surprisal$\unicode{x2013}$that captures the local uncertainty of a language by
quantifying how effectively the $m-1$ preceding symbols disambiguate the next
symbol. In experiments on both perturbed natural language corpora and languages
defined by probabilistic finite-state automata (PFSAs), we show that languages
with higher $m$-local entropy are more difficult for Transformer and LSTM LMs
to learn. These results suggest that neural LMs, much like humans, are highly
sensitive to the local statistical structure of a language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve the internal mechanisms of LALMs by analyzing how they perceive and recognize auditory attributes.

Method: Vocabulary projection applied to three state-of-the-art LALMs to track attribute information evolution across layers and token positions.

Result: Attribute information decreases with layer depth when recognition fails; early-layer resolution correlates with better accuracy. LALMs rely more on querying inputs than hidden states.

Conclusion: Findings provide insights into auditory attribute processing and suggest a method to enhance LALMs, guiding future improvements.

Abstract: Understanding the internal mechanisms of large audio-language models (LALMs)
is crucial for interpreting their behavior and improving performance. This work
presents the first in-depth analysis of how LALMs internally perceive and
recognize auditory attributes. By applying vocabulary projection on three
state-of-the-art LALMs, we track how attribute information evolves across
layers and token positions. We find that attribute information generally
decreases with layer depth when recognition fails, and that resolving
attributes at earlier layers correlates with better accuracy. Moreover, LALMs
heavily rely on querying auditory inputs for predicting attributes instead of
aggregating necessary information in hidden states at attribute-mentioning
positions. Based on our findings, we demonstrate a method to enhance LALMs. Our
results offer insights into auditory attribute processing, paving the way for
future improvements.

TL;DR: LLMs are compared to humans in evaluating error severity in image descriptions. Humans show nuanced judgments, while most LLMs misalign, except Doubao and DeepSeek-V3.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if LLMs can accurately replicate human judgments of error severity in natural language generation.

Method: Systematic comparison of human and LLM assessments in unimodal and multimodal settings, focusing on four error types.

Result: Humans show varied severity judgments, influenced by visual context. Most LLMs misalign, except Doubao and DeepSeek-V3, which show better alignment.

Conclusion: LLMs may internalize social norms but lack perceptual grounding for human-like judgments, with DeepSeek-V3 performing best.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated evaluators in
natural language generation, yet it remains unclear whether they can accurately
replicate human judgments of error severity. In this study, we systematically
compare human and LLM assessments of image descriptions containing controlled
semantic errors. We extend the experimental framework of van Miltenburg et al.
(2020) to both unimodal (text-only) and multimodal (text + image) settings,
evaluating four error types: age, gender, clothing type, and clothing colour.
Our findings reveal that humans assign varying levels of severity to different
error types, with visual context significantly amplifying perceived severity
for colour and type errors. Notably, most LLMs assign low scores to gender
errors but disproportionately high scores to colour errors, unlike humans, who
judge both as highly severe but for different reasons. This suggests that these
models may have internalised social norms influencing gender judgments but lack
the perceptual grounding to emulate human sensitivity to colour, which is
shaped by distinct neural mechanisms. Only one of the evaluated LLMs, Doubao,
replicates the human-like ranking of error severity, but it fails to
distinguish between error types as clearly as humans. Surprisingly,
DeepSeek-V3, a unimodal LLM, achieves the highest alignment with human
judgments across both unimodal and multimodal conditions, outperforming even
state-of-the-art multimodal models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Knowledgeable-r1 improves RAG by balancing parametric and contextual knowledge, enhancing robustness and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems overly rely on retrieved contexts, risking inaccuracies and underutilizing the model's inherent knowledge.

Method: Proposes Knowledgeable-r1 with joint sampling and multi-policy distributions to integrate parametric and contextual knowledge.

Result: Significantly boosts robustness and reasoning accuracy, outperforming baselines by 17.07% in counterfactual tasks.

Conclusion: Knowledgeable-r1 effectively balances knowledge utilization, improving RAG performance.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a mainstream method for improving
performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. However,current RAG systems often
place too much emphasis on retrieved contexts. This can lead to reliance on
inaccurate sources and overlook the model's inherent knowledge, especially when
dealing with misleading or excessive information. To resolve this imbalance, we
propose Knowledgeable-r1 that using joint sampling and define multi policy
distributions in knowledge capability exploration to stimulate large language
models'self-integrated utilization of parametric and contextual knowledge.
Experiments show that Knowledgeable-r1 significantly enhances robustness and
reasoning accuracy in both parameters and contextual conflict tasks and general
RAG tasks, especially outperforming baselines by 17.07% in counterfactual
scenarios and demonstrating consistent gains across RAG tasks. Our code are

*Bhavik Chandna,Zubair Bashir,Procheta Sen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how social, demographic, and gender biases are structurally represented in LLMs like GPT-2 and Llama2, identifying localized components responsible for bias and showing their impact on other NLP tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate biases in LLMs by examining their structural representation and effects on model behavior.

Method: Mechanistic interpretability approach, using metrics to identify bias-related edges, systematic ablations, and evaluation across datasets and linguistic variations.

Result: Bias-related computations are localized in a few layers, change with fine-tuning, and their removal reduces bias but affects other NLP tasks.

Conclusion: Biases in LLMs are structurally localized but interconnected with other tasks, highlighting challenges in bias mitigation without unintended consequences.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to exhibit social, demographic, and
gender biases, often as a consequence of the data on which they are trained. In
this work, we adopt a mechanistic interpretability approach to analyze how such
biases are structurally represented within models such as GPT-2 and Llama2.
Focusing on demographic and gender biases, we explore different metrics to
identify the internal edges responsible for biased behavior. We then assess the
stability, localization, and generalizability of these components across
dataset and linguistic variations. Through systematic ablations, we demonstrate
that bias-related computations are highly localized, often concentrated in a
small subset of layers. Moreover, the identified components change across
fine-tuning settings, including those unrelated to bias. Finally, we show that
removing these components not only reduces biased outputs but also affects
other NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition and linguistic acceptability
judgment because of the sharing of important components with these tasks.

*Yeonseok Jeong,Jinsu Kim,Dohyeon Lee,Seung-won Hwang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ECoRAG is a new RAG framework that compresses retrieved documents based on evidentiality, improving LLM performance in ODQA tasks while being cost-efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior compression methods in RAG do not filter non-evidential information, limiting LLM performance.

Method: Proposes ECoRAG, which compresses documents based on evidentiality and retrieves more if evidence is insufficient.

Result: ECoRAG outperforms existing methods in ODQA tasks, reducing latency and token usage.

Conclusion: ECoRAG enhances LLM performance efficiently by focusing on evidentiality in document compression.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in Open-Domain
Question Answering (ODQA) by leveraging external documents through
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To reduce RAG overhead, from longer
context, context compression is necessary. However, prior compression methods
do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, which limit the
performance in LLM-based RAG. We thus propose Evidentiality-guided RAG, or
\textbf{ECoRAG} framework. ECoRAG improves LLM performance by compressing
retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring whether answer generation
is supported by the correct evidence. As an additional step, ECoRAG reflects
whether the compressed content provides sufficient evidence, and if not,
retrieves more until sufficient. Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM
performance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods.
Furthermore, ECoRAG is highly cost-efficient, as it not only reduces latency
but also minimizes token usage by retaining only the necessary information to
generate the correct answer. Code is available at

TL;DR: The Qwen3 Embedding series improves text embedding and reranking using Qwen3 foundation models, with multilingual capabilities and a multi-stage training pipeline. It offers various model sizes and achieves top results in benchmarks like MTEB.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance text embedding and reranking by leveraging Qwen3 LLMs' multilingual understanding and generation, addressing diverse deployment needs.

Method: Uses a multi-stage training pipeline combining unsupervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning, with model merging for robustness. Qwen3 LLMs synthesize diverse training data.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmarks like MTEB and excels in retrieval tasks (code, cross-lingual, multilingual).

Conclusion: The Qwen3 Embedding series is a robust, adaptable solution for embedding and reranking, publicly available under Apache 2.0.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Qwen3 Embedding series, a significant
advancement over its predecessor, the GTE-Qwen series, in text embedding and
reranking capabilities, built upon the Qwen3 foundation models. Leveraging the
Qwen3 LLMs' robust capabilities in multilingual text understanding and
generation, our innovative multi-stage training pipeline combines large-scale
unsupervised pre-training with supervised fine-tuning on high-quality datasets.
Effective model merging strategies further ensure the robustness and
adaptability of the Qwen3 Embedding series. During the training process, the
Qwen3 LLMs serve not only as backbone models but also play a crucial role in
synthesizing high-quality, rich, and diverse training data across multiple
domains and languages, thus enhancing the training pipeline. The Qwen3
Embedding series offers a spectrum of model sizes (0.6B, 4B, 8B) for both
embedding and reranking tasks, addressing diverse deployment scenarios where
users can optimize for either efficiency or effectiveness. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that the Qwen3 Embedding series achieves
state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks. Notably, it excels on the
multilingual evaluation benchmark MTEB for text embedding, as well as in
various retrieval tasks, including code retrieval, cross-lingual retrieval and
multilingual retrieval. To facilitate reproducibility and promote
community-driven research and development, the Qwen3 Embedding models are
publicly available under the Apache 2.0 license.

*Moritz Miller,Bernhard Schölkopf,Siyuan Guo*

TL;DR: The paper explores in-context counterfactual reasoning in large-scale neural language models, demonstrating their ability to predict outcomes under hypothetical scenarios using a synthetic linear regression task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and evaluate the capability of language models in performing counterfactual reasoning without parameter updates, focusing on noise abduction in a controlled setup.

Method: A synthetic linear regression task requiring noise abduction is used to test Transformers' ability for counterfactual reasoning. Key factors like self-attention, model depth, and pre-training data diversity are analyzed.

Result: Language models successfully perform counterfactual reasoning in the synthetic setup, with findings extending to sequential data, hinting at potential for counterfactual story generation.

Conclusion: The study shows Transformers can handle counterfactual reasoning tasks, suggesting broader applicability, including sequential data tasks like story generation.

Abstract: Large-scale neural language models (LMs) exhibit remarkable performance in
in-context learning: the ability to learn and reason the input context on the
fly without parameter update. This work studies in-context counterfactual
reasoning in language models, that is, to predict the consequences of changes
under hypothetical scenarios. We focus on studying a well-defined synthetic
setup: a linear regression task that requires noise abduction, where accurate
prediction is based on inferring and copying the contextual noise from factual
observations. We show that language models are capable of counterfactual
reasoning in this controlled setup and provide insights that counterfactual
reasoning for a broad class of functions can be reduced to a transformation on
in-context observations; we find self-attention, model depth, and data
diversity in pre-training drive performance in Transformers. More
interestingly, our findings extend beyond regression tasks and show that
Transformers can perform noise abduction on sequential data, providing
preliminary evidence on the potential for counterfactual story generation. Our

*Jackson Petty,Michael Y. Hu,Wentao Wang,Shauli Ravfogel,William Merrill,Tal Linzen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The RELIC framework evaluates LLMs' instruction-following ability using language recognition, revealing their limitations with complex tasks and reliance on heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' ability to follow instructions without input-output examples, focusing on language recognition as a measurable task.

Method: Introduces the RELIC framework, which uses synthetic languages to evaluate LLMs' performance on grammar-based tasks, allowing scalable complexity.

Result: Advanced LLMs perform near-chance on complex grammars, with accuracy predictable from grammar and string complexity. Models resort to heuristics for harder tasks.

Conclusion: LLMs struggle with complex instruction-following, highlighting a gap in their reasoning capabilities and the need for improved methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to perform tasks based
only on a specification of the task provided in context, without examples of
inputs and outputs; this ability is referred to as instruction following. We
introduce the Recognition of Languages In-Context (RELIC) framework to evaluate
instruction following using language recognition: the task of determining if a
string is generated by formal grammar. Unlike many standard evaluations of
LLMs' ability to use their context, this task requires composing together a
large number of instructions (grammar productions) retrieved from the context.
Because the languages are synthetic, the task can be increased in complexity as
LLMs' skills improve, and new instances can be automatically generated,
mitigating data contamination. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on RELIC and
find that their accuracy can be reliably predicted from the complexity of the
grammar and the individual example strings, and that even the most advanced
LLMs currently available show near-chance performance on more complex grammars
and samples, in line with theoretical expectations. We also use RELIC to
diagnose how LLMs attempt to solve increasingly difficult reasoning tasks,
finding that as the complexity of the language recognition task increases,
models switch to relying on shallow heuristics instead of following complex
instructions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Common Pile v0.1, an 8TB openly licensed text dataset for LLM pretraining, and validates its effectiveness by training competitive 7B parameter models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address ethical and legal concerns of using unlicensed text for LLM training by providing a high-quality, openly licensed alternative.

Method: Collect and curate text from 30 diverse sources, then train two 7B parameter LLMs (Comma v0.1-1T and Comma v0.1-2T) on the dataset.

Result: The trained models achieve performance comparable to LLMs like Llama 1 and 2 7B, which are trained on unlicensed text.

Conclusion: The Common Pile v0.1 is a viable, ethical alternative for LLM pretraining, with released dataset, code, and model checkpoints.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on enormous quantities of
unlicensed text, a practice that has led to scrutiny due to possible
intellectual property infringement and ethical concerns. Training LLMs on
openly licensed text presents a first step towards addressing these issues, but
prior data collection efforts have yielded datasets too small or low-quality to
produce performant LLMs. To address this gap, we collect, curate, and release
the Common Pile v0.1, an eight terabyte collection of openly licensed text
designed for LLM pretraining. The Common Pile comprises content from 30 sources
that span diverse domains including research papers, code, books,
encyclopedias, educational materials, audio transcripts, and more. Crucially,
we validate our efforts by training two 7 billion parameter LLMs on text from
the Common Pile: Comma v0.1-1T and Comma v0.1-2T, trained on 1 and 2 trillion
tokens respectively. Both models attain competitive performance to LLMs trained
on unlicensed text with similar computational budgets, such as Llama 1 and 2
7B. In addition to releasing the Common Pile v0.1 itself, we also release the
code used in its creation as well as the training mixture and checkpoints for
the Comma v0.1 models.

TL;DR: Self-supervised objectives are explored for low-resource morphological inflection, with autoencoding and CMLM showing effectiveness depending on data availability. Masking based on morpheme boundaries improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scarcity of labeled data for many languages by leveraging self-supervised learning for character-level tasks like morphological inflection.

Method: Training encoder-decoder transformers with 19 languages and 13 auxiliary objectives, comparing autoencoding and character masked language modeling (CMLM).

Result: Autoencoding works best with very limited data, while CMLM excels with more data. Masking based on morpheme boundaries consistently improves performance.

Conclusion: Self-supervised tasks, especially CMLM with morpheme-aware masking, are promising for low-resource morphological modeling.

Abstract: Self-supervised objectives have driven major advances in NLP by leveraging
large-scale unlabeled data, but such resources are scarce for many of the
world's languages. Surprisingly, they have not been explored much for
character-level tasks, where smaller amounts of data have the potential to be
beneficial. We investigate the effectiveness of self-supervised auxiliary tasks
for morphological inflection -- a character-level task highly relevant for
language documentation -- in extremely low-resource settings, training
encoder-decoder transformers for 19 languages and 13 auxiliary objectives.
Autoencoding yields the best performance when unlabeled data is very limited,
while character masked language modeling (CMLM) becomes more effective as data
availability increases. Though objectives with stronger inductive biases
influence model predictions intuitively, they rarely outperform standard CMLM.
However, sampling masks based on known morpheme boundaries consistently
improves performance, highlighting a promising direction for low-resource
morphological modeling.

*Ratna Kandala,Prakash Mondal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A unified system for representing syntactic continuity and discontinuity in natural languages using PSG, DG, and CG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of convergence in frameworks analyzing discontinuous structures.

Method: Integrate Phrase Structure Grammar (PSG), Dependency Grammar (DG), and Categorial Grammar (CG) into a unified mathematical derivation.

Result: Discontinuous and continuous structures can be analyzed through this unified approach.

Conclusion: Proposes a unified representation system for syntactic structures, bridging gaps between existing formalisms.

Abstract: Syntactic discontinuity is a grammatical phenomenon in which a constituent is
split into more than one part because of the insertion of an element which is
not part of the constituent. This is observed in many languages across the
world such as Turkish, Russian, Japanese, Warlpiri, Navajo, Hopi, Dyirbal,
Yidiny etc. Different formalisms/frameworks in current linguistic theory
approach the problem of discontinuous structures in different ways. Each
framework/formalism has widely been viewed as an independent and non-converging
system of analysis. In this paper, we propose a unified system of
representation for both continuity and discontinuity in structures of natural
languages by taking into account three formalisms, in particular, Phrase
Structure Grammar (PSG) for its widely used notion of constituency, Dependency
Grammar (DG) for its head-dependent relations, and Categorial Grammar (CG) for
its focus on functor-argument relations. We attempt to show that discontinuous
expressions as well as continuous structures can be analysed through a unified
mathematical derivation incorporating the representations of linguistic
structure in these three grammar formalisms.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a guided reasoning process for hallucination detection in LLMs, improving accuracy by decomposing text into smaller facts and verifying each against the source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the accuracy of hallucination detection in LLMs by introducing a systematic reasoning process.

Method: A 3-step reasoning process: claim decomposition, sub-claim attribution and entailment classification, and aggregated classification.

Result: Guided reasoning improves hallucination detection performance and provides finer-grained entailment decisions.

Conclusion: The proposed reasoning framework enhances LLM performance in hallucination detection, supported by empirical evidence from intermediate reasoning metrics.

Abstract: A common approach to hallucination detection casts it as a natural language
inference (NLI) task, often using LLMs to classify whether the generated text
is entailed by corresponding reference texts. Since entailment classification
is a complex reasoning task, one would expect that LLMs could benefit from
generating an explicit reasoning process, as in CoT reasoning or the explicit
``thinking'' of recent reasoning models. In this work, we propose that guiding
such models to perform a systematic and comprehensive reasoning process -- one
that both decomposes the text into smaller facts and also finds evidence in the
source for each fact -- allows models to execute much finer-grained and
accurate entailment decisions, leading to increased performance. To that end,
we define a 3-step reasoning process, consisting of (i) claim decomposition,
(ii) sub-claim attribution and entailment classification, and (iii) aggregated
classification, showing that such guided reasoning indeed yields improved
hallucination detection. Following this reasoning framework, we introduce an
analysis scheme, consisting of several metrics that measure the quality of the
intermediate reasoning steps, which provided additional empirical evidence for
the improved quality of our guided reasoning scheme.

TL;DR: Micro-Act improves QA accuracy in RAG systems by hierarchically decomposing knowledge conflicts into fine-grained comparisons, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing knowledge conflicts in RAG systems where retrieved external knowledge contradicts LLMs' parametric knowledge, harming QA performance.

Method: Proposes Micro-Act, a framework with a hierarchical action space to decompose knowledge sources into fine-grained comparisons for better reasoning.

Result: Achieves significant QA accuracy improvements across 5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially temporal and semantic conflicts.

Conclusion: Micro-Act is robust and practical for real-world RAG applications, excelling in both conflict and non-conflict scenarios.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly suffer from Knowledge
Conflicts, where retrieved external knowledge contradicts the inherent,
parametric knowledge of large language models (LLMs). It adversely affects
performance on downstream tasks such as question answering (QA). Existing
approaches often attempt to mitigate conflicts by directly comparing two
knowledge sources in a side-by-side manner, but this can overwhelm LLMs with
extraneous or lengthy contexts, ultimately hindering their ability to identify
and mitigate inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose Micro-Act a
framework with a hierarchical action space that automatically perceives context
complexity and adaptively decomposes each knowledge source into a sequence of
fine-grained comparisons. These comparisons are represented as actionable
steps, enabling reasoning beyond the superficial context. Through extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets, Micro-Act consistently achieves
significant increase in QA accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines across all
5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially in temporal and semantic types
where all baselines fail significantly. More importantly, Micro-Act exhibits
robust performance on non-conflict questions simultaneously, highlighting its
practical value in real-world RAG applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic workflows suffer from error propagation and sub-optimal performance due to poorly designed prompts, limiting reliability and scalability.

Method: ProRefine dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks using textual feedback from LLMs, without additional training or labels.

Result: ProRefine outperforms zero-shot Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3-37% on five benchmark mathematical reasoning datasets.

Conclusion: ProRefine enhances accuracy, enables smaller models to match larger ones, and democratizes high-performing AI, making it scalable and efficient.

Abstract: Agentic workflows, where multiple AI agents collaborate to accomplish complex
tasks like reasoning or planning, are becoming increasingly prevalent. However,
these workflows often suffer from error propagation and sub-optimal
performance, largely due to poorly designed prompts that fail to effectively
guide individual agents. This is a critical problem because it limits the
reliability and scalability of these powerful systems. We introduce ProRefine,
an innovative inference-time prompt optimization method that leverages textual
feedback from large language models (LLMs) to address this challenge. ProRefine
dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional
training or ground truth labels. Evaluated on five benchmark mathematical
reasoning datasets, ProRefine significantly surpasses zero-shot
Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points. This approach not only
boosts accuracy but also allows smaller models to match the performance of
larger ones, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable AI
deployment, and democratizing access to high-performing AI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a constrained optimization method for unlearning sensitive data in LLMs, using a logit-margin flattening loss for forgetting and a hard constraint for retention, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning methods for LLMs often lead to unstable optimization and degraded performance, especially under aggressive forgetting.

Method: Formulates unlearning as constrained optimization: logit-margin flattening loss for forgetting and hard constraint for retention, solved via a scalable primal-dual algorithm.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on TOFU and MUSE benchmarks, effectively removing targeted information while preserving utility.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a stable and efficient solution for LLM unlearning, balancing forgetting and retention effectively.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in real-world settings increasingly
face the need to unlearn sensitive, outdated, or proprietary information.
Existing unlearning methods typically formulate forgetting and retention as a
regularized trade-off, combining both objectives into a single scalarized loss.
This often leads to unstable optimization and degraded performance on retained
data, especially under aggressive forgetting. We propose a new formulation of
LLM unlearning as a constrained optimization problem: forgetting is enforced
via a novel logit-margin flattening loss that explicitly drives the output
distribution toward uniformity on a designated forget set, while retention is
preserved through a hard constraint on a separate retain set. Compared to
entropy-based objectives, our loss is softmax-free, numerically stable, and
maintains non-vanishing gradients, enabling more efficient and robust
optimization. We solve the constrained problem using a scalable primal-dual
algorithm that exposes the trade-off between forgetting and retention through
the dynamics of the dual variable. Evaluations on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks
across diverse LLM architectures demonstrate that our approach consistently
matches or exceeds state-of-the-art baselines, effectively removing targeted
information while preserving downstream utility.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Search Arena, a large-scale dataset for evaluating search-augmented LLMs, revealing insights into user preferences and performance gaps in different settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for search-augmented LLMs are limited in scale and scope, necessitating a more comprehensive and diverse dataset like Search Arena.

Method: The authors crowd-sourced over 24,000 multi-turn interactions, spanning diverse intents and languages, and collected 12,000 human preference votes to analyze user behavior and system performance.

Result: User preferences are influenced by citation count and source type, with community-driven platforms favored. Web search can improve performance in non-search settings but degrades in search-intensive settings without it.

Conclusion: The Search Arena dataset highlights gaps in perceived vs. actual credibility and performance trade-offs, providing a valuable resource for future research.

Abstract: Search-augmented language models combine web search with Large Language
Models (LLMs) to improve response groundedness and freshness. However,
analyzing these systems remains challenging: existing datasets are limited in
scale and narrow in scope, often constrained to static, single-turn,
fact-checking questions. In this work, we introduce Search Arena, a
crowd-sourced, large-scale, human-preference dataset of over 24,000 paired
multi-turn user interactions with search-augmented LLMs. The dataset spans
diverse intents and languages, and contains full system traces with around
12,000 human preference votes. Our analysis reveals that user preferences are
influenced by the number of citations, even when the cited content does not
directly support the attributed claims, uncovering a gap between perceived and
actual credibility. Furthermore, user preferences vary across cited sources,
revealing that community-driven platforms are generally preferred and static
encyclopedic sources are not always appropriate and reliable. To assess
performance across different settings, we conduct cross-arena analyses by
testing search-augmented LLMs in a general-purpose chat environment and
conventional LLMs in search-intensive settings. We find that web search does
not degrade and may even improve performance in non-search settings; however,
the quality in search settings is significantly affected if solely relying on
the model's parametric knowledge. We open-sourced the dataset to support future
research in this direction. Our dataset and code are available at:

*Anirudh Bharadwaj,Chaitanya Malaviya,Nitish Joshi,Mark Yatskar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates biases in language models' preference judgments, linking them to training data artifacts, and proposes a counterfactual data augmentation method to reduce miscalibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models exhibit systematic miscalibration in preference judgments, prioritizing superficial features over substantive qualities, which leads to unreliable evaluations and reward hacking.

Method: The study quantifies biases in preference models using controlled counterfactual pairs and introduces counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) to mitigate these biases.

Result: CDA reduces miscalibration from 39.4% to 32.5% and skew difference from 20.5% to 10.0%, maintaining overall performance.

Conclusion: Targeted debiasing via CDA effectively improves the reliability of preference models.

Abstract: Language models serve as proxies for human preference judgements in alignment
and evaluation, yet they exhibit systematic miscalibration, prioritizing
superficial patterns over substantive qualities. This bias manifests as
overreliance on features like length, structure, and style, leading to issues
like reward hacking and unreliable evaluations. Evidence suggests these biases
originate in artifacts in human training data. In this work, we systematically
investigate the relationship between training data biases and preference model
miscalibration across five idiosyncratic features of language model
generations: length, structure, jargon, sycophancy and vagueness. Using
controlled counterfactual pairs, we first quantify the extent to which
preference models favor responses with magnified biases (skew), finding this
preference occurs in >60% of instances, and model preferences show high
miscalibration (~40%) compared to human preferences. Notably, bias features
only show mild negative correlations to human preference labels (mean r_human =
-0.12) but show moderately strong positive correlations with labels from a
strong reward model (mean r_model = +0.36), suggesting that models may overrely
on spurious cues. To mitigate these issues, we propose a simple post-training
method based on counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) using synthesized
contrastive examples. Finetuning models with CDA reduces average miscalibration
from 39.4% to 32.5% and average absolute skew difference from 20.5% to 10.0%,
while maintaining overall RewardBench performance, showing that targeted
debiasing is effective for building reliable preference models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HSSBench is a new benchmark for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) tasks, addressing gaps in current benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLM benchmarks focus on STEM disciplines, neglecting HSS needs like interdisciplinary thinking and abstract-visual concept linking.

Method: HSSBench includes over 13,000 samples in six categories, generated via a pipeline involving domain experts and automated agents.

Result: Benchmarking 20+ MLLMs shows significant challenges, even for state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: HSSBench aims to inspire research into improving MLLMs' cross-disciplinary reasoning and knowledge integration.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
potential to advance a broad range of domains. However, current benchmarks for
evaluating MLLMs primarily emphasize general knowledge and vertical
step-by-step reasoning typical of STEM disciplines, while overlooking the
distinct needs and potential of the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS). Tasks
in the HSS domain require more horizontal, interdisciplinary thinking and a
deep integration of knowledge across related fields, which presents unique
challenges for MLLMs, particularly in linking abstract concepts with
corresponding visual representations. Addressing this gap, we present HSSBench,
a dedicated benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of MLLMs on HSS tasks
in multiple languages, including the six official languages of the United
Nations. We also introduce a novel data generation pipeline tailored for HSS
scenarios, in which multiple domain experts and automated agents collaborate to
generate and iteratively refine each sample. HSSBench contains over 13,000
meticulously designed samples, covering six key categories. We benchmark more
than 20 mainstream MLLMs on HSSBench and demonstrate that it poses significant
challenges even for state-of-the-art models. We hope that this benchmark will
inspire further research into enhancing the cross-disciplinary reasoning
abilities of MLLMs, especially their capacity to internalize and connect
knowledge across fields.

*Caojin Zhang,Qiang Zhang,Ke Li,Sai Vidyaranya Nuthalapati,Benyu Zhang,Jason Liu,Serena Li,Lizhu Zhang,Xiangjun Fan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GEM, a self-supervised method enabling decoder-only LLMs to generate high-quality text embeddings without compromising their original capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify systems like RAG by eliminating the need for separate embedding models, reducing discrepancies in query understanding.

Method: Insert special tokens and manipulate attention masks to generate summarization embeddings, applicable during post-training or fine-tuning.

Result: GEM significantly improves text embedding performance (MTEB) with minimal impact on NLP tasks (MMLU).

Conclusion: GEM empowers LLMs with state-of-the-art embedding capabilities while preserving their original NLP performance.

Abstract: Large decoder-only language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
generation and reasoning tasks, where they generate text responses given
instructions. However, many applications, e.g., retrieval augmented generation
(RAG), still rely on separate embedding models to generate text embeddings,
which can complicate the system and introduce discrepancies in understanding of
the query between the embedding model and LLMs. To address this limitation, we
propose a simple self-supervised approach, Generative Embedding large language
Model (GEM), that enables any large decoder-only LLM to generate high-quality
text embeddings while maintaining its original text generation and reasoning
capabilities. Our method inserts new special token(s) into a text body, and
generates summarization embedding of the text by manipulating the attention
mask. This method could be easily integrated into post-training or fine tuning
stages of any existing LLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
by applying it to two popular LLM families, ranging from 1B to 8B parameters,
and evaluating the transformed models on both text embedding benchmarks (MTEB)
and NLP benchmarks (MMLU). The results show that our proposed method
significantly improves the original LLMs on MTEB while having a minimal impact
on MMLU. Our strong results indicate that our approach can empower LLMs with
state-of-the-art text embedding capabilities while maintaining their original
NLP performance

*Zheng-Xin Yong,Vineel Pratap,Michael Auli,Jean Maillard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Prioritizing more speakers over longer audio per speaker improves ASR robustness to unseen accents, with minimal benefit from accent diversity when speaker count is fixed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance ASR robustness for diverse accents, especially unseen ones, in low-resource settings.

Method: Study the impact of speaker count, audio duration per speaker, and accent diversity on ASR performance.

Result: More speakers (with less audio each) improves robustness; accent diversity has minimal impact when speaker count is fixed.

Conclusion: Practitioners should focus on increasing speaker count in ASR training for better performance on unseen accents.

Abstract: To build an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that can serve everyone
in the world, the ASR needs to be robust to a wide range of accents including
unseen accents. We systematically study how three different variables in
training data -- the number of speakers, the audio duration per each individual
speaker, and the diversity of accents -- affect ASR robustness towards unseen
accents in a low-resource training regime. We observe that for a fixed number
of ASR training hours, it is more beneficial to increase the number of speakers
(which means each speaker contributes less) than the number of hours
contributed per speaker. We also observe that more speakers enables ASR
performance gains from scaling number of hours. Surprisingly, we observe
minimal benefits to prioritizing speakers with different accents when the
number of speakers is controlled. Our work suggests that practitioners should
prioritize increasing the speaker count in ASR training data composition for
new languages.

*Matthieu Tehenan,Vikram Natarajan,Jonathan Michala,Milton Lin,Juri Opitz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method to decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable components using dictionary learning on token-level representations, revealing linear encoding of semantic and syntactic features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sentence embeddings lack interpretability due to complex neural transformations and pooling operations, making their internal structure unclear.

Method: Proposes dictionary learning on token-level representations to decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable components and analyzes pooling's role in feature compression.

Result: Reveals that semantic and syntactic aspects are linearly encoded in sentence embeddings, enhancing transparency.

Conclusion: Bridges token-level interpretability with sentence-level analysis, enabling more transparent and controllable representations.

Abstract: Sentence embeddings are central to modern NLP and AI systems, yet little is
known about their internal structure. While we can compare these embeddings
using measures such as cosine similarity, the contributing features are not
human-interpretable, and the content of an embedding seems untraceable, as it
is masked by complex neural transformations and a final pooling operation that
combines individual token embeddings. To alleviate this issue, we propose a new
method to mechanistically decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable
components, by using dictionary learning on token-level representations. We
analyze how pooling compresses these features into sentence representations,
and assess the latent features that reside in a sentence embedding. This
bridges token-level mechanistic interpretability with sentence-level analysis,
making for more transparent and controllable representations. In our studies,
we obtain several interesting insights into the inner workings of sentence
embedding spaces, for instance, that many semantic and syntactic aspects are
linearly encoded in the embeddings.

*Neeraj Agrawal,Saurabh Kumar,Priyanka Bhatt,Tanishka Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HTC-CLIP combines hierarchy-aware text and path-guided hierarchy representations using contrastive learning, improving performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HTC models handle label hierarchy separately or guide it in text encoders, but these approaches are complementary and can be combined for better results.

Method: HTC-CLIP uses contrastive learning to learn hierarchy-aware text and path-guided hierarchy representations, pooling both during inference.

Result: HTC-CLIP improves Macro F1 scores by 0.99-2.37% on two benchmark datasets over state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: Combining complementary approaches in HTC-CLIP enhances hierarchical text classification performance effectively.

Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) has recently gained traction given the
ability to handle complex label hierarchy. This has found applications in
domains like E- commerce, customer care and medicine industry among other
real-world applications. Existing HTC models either encode label hierarchy
separately and mix it with text encoding or guide the label hierarchy structure
in the text encoder. Both approaches capture different characteristics of label
hierarchy and are complementary to each other. In this paper, we propose a
Hierarchical Text Classification using Contrastive Learning Informed Path
guided hierarchy (HTC-CLIP), which learns hierarchy-aware text representation
and text informed path guided hierarchy representation using contrastive
learning. During the training of HTC-CLIP, we learn two different sets of class
probabilities distributions and during inference, we use the pooled output of
both probabilities for each class to get the best of both representations. Our
results show that the two previous approaches can be effectively combined into
one architecture to achieve improved performance. Tests on two public benchmark
datasets showed an improvement of 0.99 - 2.37% in Macro F1 score using HTC-CLIP
over the existing state-of-the-art models.

### [99] [MELABenchv1: Benchmarking Large Language Models against Smaller Fine-Tuned Models for Low-Resource Maltese NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04385)
*Kurt Micallef,Claudia Borg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs perform poorly on low-resource languages like Maltese, with fine-tuned smaller models outperforming larger ones. Prior exposure to Maltese and fine-tuning are key to better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLM performance on low-resource languages and identify factors affecting their effectiveness, focusing on Maltese.

Method: Assessed 55 LLMs on a new Maltese benchmark with 11 tasks, analyzing performance and factors like pre-training and fine-tuning.

Result: Smaller fine-tuned models performed better, especially with prior Maltese exposure. Fine-tuning outperforms prompting despite higher initial costs.

Conclusion: Advocates for inclusive language tech and suggests traditional approaches for low-resource languages, emphasizing fine-tuning and prior language exposure.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, largely due to their
generalisability and ability to perform tasks without additional training.
However, their effectiveness for low-resource languages remains limited. In
this study, we evaluate the performance of 55 publicly available LLMs on
Maltese, a low-resource language, using a newly introduced benchmark covering
11 discriminative and generative tasks. Our experiments highlight that many
models perform poorly, particularly on generative tasks, and that smaller
fine-tuned models often perform better across all tasks. From our
multidimensional analysis, we investigate various factors impacting
performance. We conclude that prior exposure to Maltese during pre-training and
instruction-tuning emerges as the most important factor. We also examine the
trade-offs between fine-tuning and prompting, highlighting that while
fine-tuning requires a higher initial cost, it yields better performance and
lower inference costs. Through this work, we aim to highlight the need for more
inclusive language technologies and recommend that researchers working with
low-resource languages consider more "traditional" language modelling
approaches.

*Saurabh Kumar,Sourav Bansal,Neeraj Agrawal,Priyanka Bhatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes an embedder-cum-classifier model to generalize intent classification across domains with few annotations, improving accuracy by 20-23%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Customer care requires domain-specific intent classifiers, but cross-domain data scarcity limits model performance.

Method: Uses supervised fine-tuning with isotropic regularizers and multilingual knowledge distillation to train a domain-specific embedder, then augments it with a linear classifier.

Result: Achieves 20-23% higher accuracy in few-shot intent detection compared to SOTA models.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively generalizes intent classification across domains with minimal labeled data.

Abstract: Customer care is an essential pillar of the e-commerce shopping experience
with companies spending millions of dollars each year, employing automation and
human agents, across geographies (like US, Canada, Mexico, Chile), channels
(like Chat, Interactive Voice Response (IVR)), and languages (like English,
Spanish). SOTA pre-trained models like multilingual-BERT, fine-tuned on
annotated data have shown good performance in downstream tasks relevant to
Customer Care. However, model performance is largely subject to the
availability of sufficient annotated domain-specific data. Cross-domain
availability of data remains a bottleneck, thus building an intent classifier
that generalizes across domains (defined by channel, geography, and language)
with only a few annotations, is of great practical value. In this paper, we
propose an embedder-cum-classifier model architecture which extends
state-of-the-art domain-specific models to other domains with only a few
labeled samples. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning approach with isotropic
regularizers to train a domain-specific sentence embedder and a multilingual
knowledge distillation strategy to generalize this embedder across multiple
domains. The trained embedder, further augmented with a simple linear
classifier can be deployed for new domains. Experiments on Canada and Mexico
e-commerce Customer Care dataset with few-shot intent detection show an
increase in accuracy by 20-23% against the existing state-of-the-art
pre-trained models.

*Wesley Scivetti,Tatsuya Aoyama,Ethan Wilcox,Nathan Schneider*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Human-scale language models generalize form but not meaning of rare constructions like LET-ALONE, unlike humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if language models generalize rare grammatical constructions' form and meaning like humans.

Method: Tested human-scale transformer models on LET-ALONE construction using a synthetic benchmark for syntax and semantics.

Result: Models generalized form but failed to generalize meaning, showing an asymmetry in learning efficiency.

Conclusion: Current architectures lack humans' balanced efficiency in learning form and meaning of rare constructions.

Abstract: Humans have a remarkable ability to acquire and understand grammatical
phenomena that are seen rarely, if ever, during childhood. Recent evidence
suggests that language models with human-scale pretraining data may possess a
similar ability by generalizing from frequent to rare constructions. However,
it remains an open question how widespread this generalization ability is, and
to what extent this knowledge extends to meanings of rare constructions, as
opposed to just their forms. We fill this gap by testing human-scale
transformer language models on their knowledge of both the form and meaning of
the (rare and quirky) English LET-ALONE construction. To evaluate our LMs we
construct a bespoke synthetic benchmark that targets syntactic and semantic
properties of the construction. We find that human-scale LMs are sensitive to
form, even when related constructions are filtered from the dataset. However,
human-scale LMs do not make correct generalizations about LET-ALONE's meaning.
These results point to an asymmetry in the current architectures' sample
efficiency between language form and meaning, something which is not present in
human language learners.

TL;DR: ZOES is a zero-shot, open-schema method for entity structure extraction without predefined schemas or annotations, improving LLMs' performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on predefined schemas or annotated data, leading to incomplete results. ZOES aims to overcome this limitation.

Method: ZOES uses enrichment, refinement, and unification to mutually reinforce entities and their structures.

Result: ZOES enhances LLMs' ability to extract complete entity structures across multiple domains.

Conclusion: The enrichment-refinement-unification mechanism improves LLM-based entity discovery in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Entity structure extraction, which aims to extract entities and their
associated attribute-value structures from text, is an essential task for text
understanding and knowledge graph construction. Existing methods based on large
language models (LLMs) typically rely heavily on predefined entity attribute
schemas or annotated datasets, often leading to incomplete extraction results.
To address these challenges, we introduce Zero-Shot Open-schema Entity
Structure Discovery (ZOES), a novel approach to entity structure extraction
that does not require any schema or annotated samples. ZOES operates via a
principled mechanism of enrichment, refinement, and unification, based on the
insight that an entity and its associated structure are mutually reinforcing.
Experiments demonstrate that ZOES consistently enhances LLMs' ability to
extract more complete entity structures across three different domains,
showcasing both the effectiveness and generalizability of the method. These
findings suggest that such an enrichment, refinement, and unification mechanism
may serve as a principled approach to improving the quality of LLM-based entity
structure discovery in various scenarios.

*Apurv Verma,NhatHai Phan,Shubhendu Trivedi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how watermarking techniques (Gumbel and KGW) affect LLM alignment properties (truthfulness, safety, helpfulness), revealing two degradation patterns. It proposes Alignment Resampling (AR) to mitigate these effects and restore alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the underexamined impact of watermarking on LLM alignment properties like truthfulness, safety, and helpfulness.

Method: Systematic analysis of watermarking effects, introduction of Alignment Resampling (AR) using an external reward model, and modified Gumbel watermarking for diversity.

Result: AR recovers or surpasses baseline alignment scores with 2-4 samples, maintaining watermark detectability. Modified Gumbel ensures compatibility with AR.

Conclusion: The work highlights the balance between watermark strength and alignment, offering a practical solution for deploying watermarked LLMs responsibly.

Abstract: Watermarking techniques for large language models (LLMs) can significantly
impact output quality, yet their effects on truthfulness, safety, and
helpfulness remain critically underexamined. This paper presents a systematic
analysis of how two popular watermarking approaches-Gumbel and KGW-affect these
core alignment properties across four aligned LLMs. Our experiments reveal two
distinct degradation patterns: guard attenuation, where enhanced helpfulness
undermines model safety, and guard amplification, where excessive caution
reduces model helpfulness. These patterns emerge from watermark-induced shifts
in token distribution, surfacing the fundamental tension that exists between
alignment objectives.
  To mitigate these degradations, we propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an
inference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore
alignment. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in
expected reward score as the sample size is increased and empirically
demonstrate that sampling just 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers
or surpasses baseline (unwatermarked) alignment scores. To overcome the limited
response diversity of standard Gumbel watermarking, our modified implementation
sacrifices strict distortion-freeness while maintaining robust detectability,
ensuring compatibility with AR. Experimental results confirm that AR
successfully recovers baseline alignment in both watermarking approaches, while
maintaining strong watermark detectability. This work reveals the critical
balance between watermark strength and model alignment, providing a simple
inference-time solution to responsibly deploy watermarked LLMs in practice.

TL;DR: PUGC leverages implicit preferences in unlabeled user-generated content (UGC) to improve LLM alignment, outperforming traditional methods by 9.37%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing preference learning methods rely on costly curated data, limiting scalability. PUGC addresses this by using UGC, which contains implicit human preferences.

Method: PUGC transforms UGC into queries and responses, using UGC as reference text for scoring to align models with implicit preferences.

Result: Models trained with PUGC and DPO achieve a 9.37% performance boost and a 35.93% state-of-the-art win rate on Alpaca Eval 2.

Conclusion: PUGC offers a scalable, domain-specific solution for LLM alignment, improving reward quality and robustness.

Abstract: Learning from preference feedback is essential for aligning large language
models (LLMs) with human values and improving the quality of generated
responses. However, existing preference learning methods rely heavily on
curated data from humans or advanced LLMs, which is costly and difficult to
scale. In this work, we present PUGC, a novel framework that leverages implicit
human Preferences in unlabeled User-Generated Content (UGC) to generate
preference data. Although UGC is not explicitly created to guide LLMs in
generating human-preferred responses, it often reflects valuable insights and
implicit preferences from its creators that has the potential to address
readers' questions. PUGC transforms UGC into user queries and generates
responses from the policy model. The UGC is then leveraged as a reference text
for response scoring, aligning the model with these implicit preferences. This
approach improves the quality of preference data while enabling scalable,
domain-specific alignment. Experimental results on Alpaca Eval 2 show that
models trained with DPO and PUGC achieve a 9.37% performance improvement over
traditional methods, setting a 35.93% state-of-the-art length-controlled win
rate using Mistral-7B-Instruct. Further studies highlight gains in reward
quality, domain-specific alignment effectiveness, robustness against UGC
quality, and theory of mind capabilities. Our code and dataset are available at

TL;DR: SQLens is a framework for detecting and correcting semantic errors in LLM-generated SQL queries, improving accuracy and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce semantically incorrect SQL queries, lacking reliability insights. SQLens addresses this by fine-grained error detection and correction.

Method: SQLens integrates error signals from the database and LLM to identify and correct semantic errors in SQL clauses.

Result: Outperforms the best LLM-based self-evaluation by 25.78% in F1 for error detection and improves execution accuracy by up to 20%.

Conclusion: SQLens enhances the reliability of text-to-SQL systems by effectively detecting and correcting semantic errors.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language (NL) questions into SQL
queries, enabling non-technical users to interact with structured data. While
large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results on the text-to-SQL
task, they often produce semantically incorrect yet syntactically valid
queries, with limited insight into their reliability. We propose SQLens, an
end-to-end framework for fine-grained detection and correction of semantic
errors in LLM-generated SQL. SQLens integrates error signals from both the
underlying database and the LLM to identify potential semantic errors within
SQL clauses. It further leverages these signals to guide query correction.
Empirical results on two public benchmarks show that SQLens outperforms the
best LLM-based self-evaluation method by 25.78% in F1 for error detection, and
improves execution accuracy of out-of-the-box text-to-SQL systems by up to 20%.

TL;DR: SLIDE integrates Small and Large Language Models (SLMs and LLMs) for better performance in ambiguous scenarios. The Dual-Refinement Evaluation (DRE) method further refines their integration, outperforming existing methods and aligning closely with human judgment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with ambiguity, while SLMs are robust but vulnerable to adversarial inputs. Combining their strengths can improve reliability in tasks like dialogue evaluation.

Method: Introduces SLIDE for adaptive weighting of SLMs and LLMs, and DRE for refining evaluations: SLM insights guide LLM evaluations, and SLM adjustments refine LLM scores.

Result: DRE outperforms existing methods, showing stronger alignment with human judgment in benchmarks.

Conclusion: Combining SLMs and LLMs enhances reliability, especially for open-ended tasks like dialogue evaluation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks but struggle with ambiguous
scenarios where multiple valid responses exist, often yielding unreliable
results. Conversely, Small Language Models (SLMs) demonstrate robustness in
such scenarios but are susceptible to misleading or adversarial inputs. We
observed that LLMs handle negative examples effectively, while SLMs excel with
positive examples. To leverage their complementary strengths, we introduce
SLIDE (Small and Large Integrated for Dialogue Evaluation), a method
integrating SLMs and LLMs via adaptive weighting. Building on SLIDE, we further
propose a Dual-Refinement Evaluation (DRE) method to enhance SLM-LLM
integration: (1) SLM-generated insights guide the LLM to produce initial
evaluations; (2) SLM-derived adjustments refine the LLM's scores for improved
accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that DRE outperforms existing methods,
showing stronger alignment with human judgment across diverse benchmarks. This
work illustrates how combining small and large models can yield more reliable
evaluation tools, particularly for open-ended tasks such as dialogue
evaluation.

TL;DR: The paper questions the effectiveness of explicit decomposition in LLM-based translation, finding no clear evidence for its benefits and showing that simple "translate again" prompts outperform step-by-step methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To scrutinize the effectiveness of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in LLM-based translation, as prior work like 'Translating Step-by-step' claimed state-of-the-art results using multi-step prompts.

Method: Empirical analysis comparing step-by-step prompting with simpler methods like "translate again" prompts.

Result: No clear evidence that explicit decomposition improves translation; simpler prompts yielded better results.

Conclusion: Future work should explore the factors behind CoT's effectiveness in translation, as reasoning may still play a role.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities for
many tasks, often by explicitly decomposing the task via Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning. Recent work on LLM-based translation designs hand-crafted prompts to
decompose translation, or trains models to incorporate intermediate
steps.~\textit{Translating Step-by-step}~\citep{briakou2024translating}, for
instance, introduces a multi-step prompt with decomposition and refinement of
translation with LLMs, which achieved state-of-the-art results on WMT24. In
this work, we scrutinise this strategy's effectiveness. Empirically, we find no
clear evidence that performance gains stem from explicitly decomposing the
translation process, at least for the models on test; and we show that simply
prompting LLMs to ``translate again'' yields even better results than
human-like step-by-step prompting. Our analysis does not rule out the role of
reasoning, but instead invites future work exploring the factors for CoT's
effectiveness in the context of translation.

### [110] [Is It JUST Semantics? A Case Study of Discourse Particle Understanding in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04534)
*William Sheffield,Kanishka Misra,Valentina Pyatkin,Ashwini Deo,Kyle Mahowald,Junyi Jessy Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines LLMs' ability to distinguish fine-grained senses of the discourse particle 'just,' finding limited success in capturing subtle nuances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discourse particles like 'just' have diverse semantic effects, and understanding LLMs' capacity to interpret them is crucial for NLP.

Method: The study uses expert-labeled data to evaluate LLMs' performance in differentiating senses of 'just.'

Result: LLMs can distinguish broader categories but struggle with subtle nuances of 'just.'

Conclusion: The findings highlight a gap in LLMs' understanding of discourse particles, suggesting room for improvement.

Abstract: Discourse particles are crucial elements that subtly shape the meaning of
text. These words, often polyfunctional, give rise to nuanced and often quite
disparate semantic/discourse effects, as exemplified by the diverse uses of the
particle "just" (e.g., exclusive, temporal, emphatic). This work investigates
the capacity of LLMs to distinguish the fine-grained senses of English "just",
a well-studied example in formal semantics, using data meticulously created and
labeled by expert linguists. Our findings reveal that while LLMs exhibit some
ability to differentiate between broader categories, they struggle to fully
capture more subtle nuances, highlighting a gap in their understanding of
discourse particles.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on questions with no reasonable answers, showing current models perform poorly on such tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' ability to handle questions without valid answers, highlighting a gap in current evaluation methods.

Method: Developed a benchmark and a method to modify existing datasets for testing impossible questions.

Result: Existing models perform significantly below perfection on questions without reasonable answers.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for improved LLM evaluation frameworks to address unrealistic or unanswerable questions.

Abstract: We propose that benchmarking LLMs on questions which have no reasonable
answer actually isn't as silly as it sounds. We also present a benchmark that
allows such testing and a method to modify the existing datasets, and discover
that existing models demonstrate a performance far from the perfect on such
questions. Our code and data artifacts are available at

*Senyu Li,Jiayi Wang,Felermino D. M. A. Ali,Colin Cherry,Daniel Deutsch,Eleftheria Briakou,Rui Sousa-Silva,Henrique Lopes Cardoso,Pontus Stenetorp,David Ifeoluwa Adelani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SSA-MTE, a large-scale dataset for evaluating machine translation (MT) quality in under-resourced African languages, and proposes improved metrics (SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE) that outperform existing solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MT evaluation metrics lack coverage and perform poorly for African languages due to limited data and low-resource constraints.

Method: The authors create a human-annotated dataset (SSA-MTE) for 13 African language pairs and develop reference-based (SSA-COMET) and reference-free (SSA-COMET-QE) metrics. They also benchmark LLM-based approaches.

Result: SSA-COMET models outperform AfriCOMET and compete with top LLMs like Gemini 2.5 Pro, especially for low-resource languages.

Conclusion: The study provides open-access resources to advance MT evaluation for African languages, addressing gaps in existing methods.

Abstract: Evaluating machine translation (MT) quality for under-resourced African
languages remains a significant challenge, as existing metrics often suffer
from limited language coverage and poor performance in low-resource settings.
While recent efforts, such as AfriCOMET, have addressed some of the issues,
they are still constrained by small evaluation sets, a lack of publicly
available training data tailored to African languages, and inconsistent
performance in extremely low-resource scenarios. In this work, we introduce
SSA-MTE, a large-scale human-annotated MT evaluation (MTE) dataset covering 13
African language pairs from the News domain, with over 63,000 sentence-level
annotations from a diverse set of MT systems. Based on this data, we develop
SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE, improved reference-based and reference-free
evaluation metrics. We also benchmark prompting-based approaches using
state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude. Our experimental results show
that SSA-COMET models significantly outperform AfriCOMET and are competitive
with the strongest LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro) evaluated in our study, particularly on
low-resource languages such as Twi, Luo, and Yoruba. All resources are released
under open licenses to support future research.

*Can Zheng,Yuhan Cao,Xiaoning Dong,Tianxing He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how malicious agents in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) can exploit prompt manipulation to bias operations, bypassing detection mechanisms like GPT-4o-mini.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate vulnerabilities in MAS where malicious agents subtly manipulate prompts to serve self-interests without disrupting core functionality.

Method: Examines four attack types (Scapegoater, Boaster, Self-Dealer, Free-Rider) using strategically crafted prompts to bias MAS behavior.

Result: Demonstrates that prompt manipulation introduces systematic biases, bypassing advanced LLM-based monitors.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for robust MAS security protocols, content validation, and advanced monitoring systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
natural language understanding, code generation, and complex planning.
Simultaneously, Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have garnered attention for their
potential to enable cooperation among distributed agents. However, from a
multi-party perspective, MAS could be vulnerable to malicious agents that
exploit the system to serve self-interests without disrupting its core
functionality. This work explores integrity attacks where malicious agents
employ subtle prompt manipulation to bias MAS operations and gain various
benefits. Four types of attacks are examined: \textit{Scapegoater}, who
misleads the system monitor to underestimate other agents' contributions;
\textit{Boaster}, who misleads the system monitor to overestimate their own
performance; \textit{Self-Dealer}, who manipulates other agents to adopt
certain tools; and \textit{Free-Rider}, who hands off its own task to others.
We demonstrate that strategically crafted prompts can introduce systematic
biases in MAS behavior and executable instructions, enabling malicious agents
to effectively mislead evaluation systems and manipulate collaborative agents.
Furthermore, our attacks can bypass advanced LLM-based monitors, such as
GPT-4o-mini and o3-mini, highlighting the limitations of current detection
mechanisms. Our findings underscore the critical need for MAS architectures
with robust security protocols and content validation mechanisms, alongside
monitoring systems capable of comprehensive risk scenario assessment.

### [114] [Reasoning or Overthinking: Evaluating Large Language Models on Financial Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04574)
*Dimitris Vamvourellis,Dhagash Mehta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs, including reasoning and non-reasoning models, were tested for zero-shot financial sentiment analysis. GPT-4o without CoT prompting performed best, challenging the assumption that reasoning improves accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how LLMs and prompting strategies perform in financial sentiment analysis compared to human judgment, especially focusing on reasoning vs. non-reasoning approaches.

Method: Three proprietary LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3-mini) were tested under System 1 and System 2 prompting paradigms and compared to fine-tuned smaller models (FinBERT-Prosus, FinBERT-Tone).

Result: Reasoning did not improve performance; GPT-4o without CoT prompting was most accurate. Overthinking from reasoning led to suboptimal predictions.

Conclusion: For financial sentiment analysis, intuitive (System 1) thinking aligns better with human judgment than deliberative (System 2) reasoning, challenging the assumption that more reasoning improves LLM decisions.

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs), including
reasoning-based and non-reasoning models, in performing zero-shot financial
sentiment analysis. Using the Financial PhraseBank dataset annotated by domain
experts, we evaluate how various LLMs and prompting strategies align with
human-labeled sentiment in a financial context. We compare three proprietary
LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3-mini) under different prompting paradigms that
simulate System 1 (fast and intuitive) or System 2 (slow and deliberate)
thinking and benchmark them against two smaller models (FinBERT-Prosus,
FinBERT-Tone) fine-tuned on financial sentiment analysis. Our findings suggest
that reasoning, either through prompting or inherent model design, does not
improve performance on this task. Surprisingly, the most accurate and
human-aligned combination of model and method was GPT-4o without any
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. We further explore how performance is
impacted by linguistic complexity and annotation agreement levels, uncovering
that reasoning may introduce overthinking, leading to suboptimal predictions.
This suggests that for financial sentiment classification, fast, intuitive
"System 1"-like thinking aligns more closely with human judgment compared to
"System 2"-style slower, deliberative reasoning simulated by reasoning models
or CoT prompting. Our results challenge the default assumption that more
reasoning always leads to better LLM decisions, particularly in high-stakes
financial applications.

### [115] [Are LLMs Reliable Translators of Logical Reasoning Across Lexically Diversified Contexts?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04575)
*Qingchuan Li,Jiatong Li,Zirui Liu,Mingyue Cheng,Yuting Zeng,Qi Liu,Tongxuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SCALe, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to handle lexical diversification in logical reasoning, and proposes MenTaL, a method to improve LLM translators' performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with lexical diversification in logical reasoning tasks, and existing benchmarks lack diversity, masking this issue.

Method: Proposes SCALe for benchmarking and MenTaL, a method using tables to unify diverse expressions before translation, applied via in-context learning and SFT.

Result: Experiments confirm LLMs' deficiencies in handling lexical diversification, and MenTaL significantly improves their performance.

Conclusion: SCALe and MenTaL address a critical gap in LLM-based logical reasoning, enhancing reliability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic approaches combining large language models (LLMs) with solvers
excels in logical reasoning problems need long reasoning chains. In this
paradigm, LLMs serve as translators, converting natural language reasoning
problems into formal logic formulas. Then reliable symbolic solvers return
correct solutions. Despite their success, we find that LLMs, as translators,
struggle to handle lexical diversification, a common linguistic phenomenon,
indicating that LLMs as logic translators are unreliable in real-world
scenarios. Moreover, existing logical reasoning benchmarks lack lexical
diversity, failing to challenge LLMs' ability to translate such text and thus
obscuring this issue. In this work, we propose SCALe, a benchmark designed to
address this significant gap through **logic-invariant lexical
diversification**. By using LLMs to transform original benchmark datasets into
lexically diversified but logically equivalent versions, we evaluate LLMs'
ability to consistently map diverse expressions to uniform logical symbols on
these new datasets. Experiments using SCALe further confirm that current LLMs
exhibit deficiencies in this capability. Building directly on the deficiencies
identified through our benchmark, we propose a new method, MenTaL, to address
this limitation. This method guides LLMs to first construct a table unifying
diverse expressions before performing translation. Applying MenTaL through
in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) significantly improves the
performance of LLM translators on lexically diversified text. Our code is now
available at https://github.com/wufeiwuwoshihua/LexicalDiver.

### [116] [Selecting Demonstrations for Many-Shot In-Context Learning via Gradient Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04579)
*Jianfei Zhang,Bei Li,Jun Bai,Rumei Li,Yanmeng Wang,Chenghua Lin,Wenge Rong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a gradient matching method to improve demonstration selection for many-shot In-Context Learning (ICL), outperforming random selection on large LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current many-shot ICL relies on random demonstration selection, which is suboptimal. The paper hypothesizes that data requirements for ICL and fine-tuning are similar, motivating a gradient-based approach.

Method: A gradient matching approach aligns fine-tuning gradients between the entire training set and selected examples, tested on models like Qwen2.5-3B and Llama3-8B.

Result: The method consistently outperforms random selection, achieving up to 4% improvement on large LLMs like Qwen2.5-72B and Llama3-70B.

Conclusion: The gradient matching method enhances many-shot ICL reliability and effectiveness, enabling broader application.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) for rapid
task adaptation without Fine-Tuning (FT), but its reliance on demonstration
selection remains a critical challenge. While many-shot ICL shows promising
performance through scaled demonstrations, the selection method for many-shot
demonstrations remains limited to random selection in existing work. Since the
conventional instance-level retrieval is not suitable for many-shot scenarios,
we hypothesize that the data requirements for in-context learning and
fine-tuning are analogous. To this end, we introduce a novel gradient matching
approach that selects demonstrations by aligning fine-tuning gradients between
the entire training set of the target task and the selected examples, so as to
approach the learning effect on the entire training set within the selected
examples. Through gradient matching on relatively small models, e.g.,
Qwen2.5-3B or Llama3-8B, our method consistently outperforms random selection
on larger LLMs from 4-shot to 128-shot scenarios across 9 diverse datasets. For
instance, it surpasses random selection by 4% on Qwen2.5-72B and Llama3-70B,
and by around 2% on 5 closed-source LLMs. This work unlocks more reliable and
effective many-shot ICL, paving the way for its broader application.

### [117] [SUCEA: Reasoning-Intensive Retrieval for Adversarial Fact-checking through Claim Decomposition and Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04583)
*Hongjun Liu,Yilun Zhao,Arman Cohan,Chen Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A training-free method, SUCEA, improves fact-checking by rephrasing adversarial claims into simpler sub-claims, enhancing evidence retrieval and label prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of adversarial claims in fact-checking systems by making them easier to verify.

Method: SUCEA decomposes claims into sub-claims, iteratively retrieves evidence, edits claims, and aggregates evidence for label prediction.

Result: Outperforms baselines in retrieval and entailment accuracy on two datasets.

Conclusion: SUCEA effectively tackles adversarial claims, improving fact-checking performance.

Abstract: Automatic fact-checking has recently received more attention as a means of
combating misinformation. Despite significant advancements, fact-checking
systems based on retrieval-augmented language models still struggle to tackle
adversarial claims, which are intentionally designed by humans to challenge
fact-checking systems. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free
method designed to rephrase the original claim, making it easier to locate
supporting evidence. Our modular framework, SUCEA, decomposes the task into
three steps: 1) Claim Segmentation and Decontextualization that segments
adversarial claims into independent sub-claims; 2) Iterative Evidence Retrieval
and Claim Editing that iteratively retrieves evidence and edits the subclaim
based on the retrieved evidence; 3) Evidence Aggregation and Label Prediction
that aggregates all retrieved evidence and predicts the entailment label.
Experiments on two challenging fact-checking datasets demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves on both retrieval and entailment label
accuracy, outperforming four strong claim-decomposition-based baselines.

*Yash Kumar Lal,Manikanta Bandham,Mohammad Saqib Hasan,Apoorva Kashi,Mahnaz Koupaee,Niranjan Balasubramanian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MuSciClaims, a benchmark for testing claim verification abilities using multimodal data from scientific figures, highlighting the poor performance of current vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack direct testing of claim verification abilities with multimodal data from scientific figures, creating a gap in evaluating such capabilities.

Method: The authors automatically extract supported claims from scientific articles, manually perturb them to create contradicted claims, and introduce diagnostic tasks to analyze model failures.

Result: Current vision-language models perform poorly (~0.3-0.5 F1), with the best model achieving only 0.77 F1. Models are biased towards judging claims as supported and struggle with evidence localization, multimodal aggregation, and figure comprehension.

Conclusion: The MuSciClaims benchmark reveals significant shortcomings in current models for claim verification, emphasizing the need for improved multimodal reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Assessing scientific claims requires identifying, extracting, and reasoning
with multimodal data expressed in information-rich figures in scientific
literature. Despite the large body of work in scientific QA, figure captioning,
and other multimodal reasoning tasks over chart-based data, there are no
readily usable multimodal benchmarks that directly test claim verification
abilities. To remedy this gap, we introduce a new benchmark MuSciClaims
accompanied by diagnostics tasks. We automatically extract supported claims
from scientific articles, which we manually perturb to produce contradicted
claims. The perturbations are designed to test for a specific set of claim
verification capabilities. We also introduce a suite of diagnostic tasks that
help understand model failures. Our results show most vision-language models
are poor (~0.3-0.5 F1), with even the best model only achieving 0.77 F1. They
are also biased towards judging claims as supported, likely misunderstanding
nuanced perturbations within the claims. Our diagnostics show models are bad at
localizing correct evidence within figures, struggle with aggregating
information across modalities, and often fail to understand basic components of
the figure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance semi-supervised learning by leveraging LLMs for correcting pseudo labels in speech processing tasks.

Method: Refines pseudo-labeled text from ASR/AST using LLMs and employs data filtering for efficient knowledge transfer.

Result: Achieves 3.77% WER reduction on Mandarin ASR and high BLEU scores (34.0, 64.7) on Spanish-to-English AST tasks.

Conclusion: LESS demonstrates adaptability across languages and tasks, with insights on LLM use in speech processing.

Abstract: We introduce LESS (Large Language Model Enhanced Semi-supervised Learning), a
versatile framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to correct
pseudo labels generated from in-the-wild data. Within the LESS framework,
pseudo-labeled text from Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or Automatic Speech
Translation (AST) of the unsupervised data is refined by an LLM, and augmented
by a data filtering strategy to optimize LLM knowledge transfer efficiency.
Experiments on both Mandarin ASR and Spanish-to-English AST tasks show that
LESS achieves a notable absolute WER reduction of 3.77% on the Wenet Speech
test set, as well as BLEU scores of 34.0 and 64.7 on Callhome and Fisher test
sets respectively. These results validate the adaptability of LESS across
different languages, tasks, and domains. Ablation studies conducted with
various LLMs and prompt configurations provide novel insights into leveraging
LLM-derived knowledge for speech processing applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces $Safe$, a formal verification framework using Lean 4 to detect and mitigate hallucinations in Chain-of-Thought prompting for LLMs, improving performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods like PRMs or self-consistency lack verifiable evidence for detecting hallucinations in CoT prompting, limiting their reliability.

Method: Proposes $Safe$, a retrospective, step-aware framework that formalizes reasoning steps in Lean 4 and provides proofs to identify hallucinations.

Result: Demonstrates significant performance improvement across models and datasets, with interpretable evidence. Introduces $FormalStep$, a benchmark for step correctness.

Conclusion: $Safe$ is the first use of Lean 4 for verifying LLM-generated content, aligning with formal languages' original purpose to ensure robust proof foundations.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has become the de facto method to elicit
reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). However, to mitigate
hallucinations in CoT that are notoriously difficult to detect, current methods
such as process reward models (PRMs) or self-consistency operate as opaque
boxes and do not provide checkable evidence for their judgments, possibly
limiting their effectiveness. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from
the idea that "the gold standard for supporting a mathematical claim is to
provide a proof". We propose a retrospective, step-aware formal verification
framework $Safe$. Rather than assigning arbitrary scores, we strive to
articulate mathematical claims in formal mathematical language Lean 4 at each
reasoning step and provide formal proofs to identify hallucinations. We
evaluate our framework $Safe$ across multiple language models and various
mathematical datasets, demonstrating a significant performance improvement
while offering interpretable and verifiable evidence. We also propose
$FormalStep$ as a benchmark for step correctness theorem proving with $30,809$
formal statements. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first
endeavor to utilize formal mathematical language Lean 4 for verifying natural
language content generated by LLMs, aligning with the reason why formal
mathematical languages were created in the first place: to provide a robust
foundation for hallucination-prone human-written proofs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MISMATCHED, a new benchmark for scientific NLI focusing on non-CS domains (PSYCHOLOGY, ENGINEERING, PUBLIC HEALTH), with 2,700 annotated pairs. Baselines using SLMs and LLMs achieve 78.17% Macro F1, showing room for improvement. Training with implicit NLI pairs boosts performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NLI datasets focus on CS domains, neglecting non-CS fields. MISMATCHED addresses this gap by covering diverse scientific domains.

Method: Developed a benchmark (MISMATCHED) with 2,700 annotated sentence pairs from non-CS domains. Evaluated SLMs and LLMs as baselines and explored training with implicit NLI pairs.

Result: Best baseline achieved 78.17% Macro F1, indicating significant potential for improvement. Training with implicit pairs enhanced model performance.

Conclusion: MISMATCHED fills a gap in NLI datasets for non-CS domains. The benchmark and findings encourage further research, with data and code made publicly available.

Abstract: Scientific Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of predicting the
semantic relation between a pair of sentences extracted from research articles.
Existing datasets for this task are derived from various computer science (CS)
domains, whereas non-CS domains are completely ignored. In this paper, we
introduce a novel evaluation benchmark for scientific NLI, called MISMATCHED.
The new MISMATCHED benchmark covers three non-CS domains-PSYCHOLOGY,
ENGINEERING, and PUBLIC HEALTH, and contains 2,700 human annotated sentence
pairs. We establish strong baselines on MISMATCHED using both Pre-trained Small
Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our best performing
baseline shows a Macro F1 of only 78.17% illustrating the substantial headroom
for future improvements. In addition to introducing the MISMATCHED benchmark,
we show that incorporating sentence pairs having an implicit scientific NLI
relation between them in model training improves their performance on
scientific NLI. We make our dataset and code publicly available on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning-optimized models often lack output diversity, limiting TTS effectiveness.

Method: Surveyed TTS methods (sampling, search, trajectory optimization) and proposed ADAPT, a diversity-aware prefix tuning approach.

Result: ADAPT achieves 80% accuracy on math tasks with 8x less compute than baselines.

Conclusion: Generative diversity is crucial for maximizing TTS effectiveness.

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves the reasoning performance of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by allocating additional compute during inference. We conduct a
structured survey of TTS methods and categorize them into sampling-based,
search-based, and trajectory optimization strategies. We observe that
reasoning-optimized models often produce less diverse outputs, which limits TTS
effectiveness. To address this, we propose ADAPT (A Diversity Aware Prefix
fine-Tuning), a lightweight method that applies prefix tuning with a
diversity-focused data strategy. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks
show that ADAPT reaches 80% accuracy using eight times less compute than strong
baselines. Our findings highlight the essential role of generative diversity in
maximizing TTS effectiveness.

TL;DR: The paper explores how innovators' subjective perspectives and interpersonal opportunities, modeled using machine learning, predict creative success. Diversity in perspectives enhances innovation, while diversity in background hinders it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how social structures and personal trajectories shape innovation capacity, leveraging machine learning to model subjective perspectives and opportunities.

Method: Uses dynamic language representations to quantify perspectives and opportunities, analyzing data from scientists, inventors, writers, and others. Includes a natural experiment and AI simulations.

Result: Subjective perspectives predict creative success; perspective diversity boosts innovation, while background diversity does the opposite.

Conclusion: Successful collaborators use common language to combine diverse experiences, highlighting implications for team assembly and research policy.

Abstract: Existing studies of innovation emphasize the power of social structures to
shape innovation capacity. Emerging machine learning approaches, however,
enable us to model innovators' personal perspectives and interpersonal
innovation opportunities as a function of their prior trajectories of
experience. We theorize then quantify subjective perspectives and innovation
opportunities based on innovator positions within the geometric space of
concepts inscribed by dynamic language representations. Using data on millions
of scientists, inventors, writers, entrepreneurs, and Wikipedia contributors
across the creative domains of science, technology, film, entrepreneurship, and
Wikipedia, here we show that measured subjective perspectives anticipate what
ideas individuals and groups creatively attend to and successfully combine in
future. When perspective and background diversity are decomposed as the angular
difference between collaborators' perspectives on their creation and between
their experiences, the former consistently anticipates creative achievement
while the latter portends its opposite, across all cases and time periods
examined. We analyze a natural experiment and simulate creative collaborations
between AI (large language model) agents designed with various perspective and
background diversity, which are consistent with our observational findings. We
explore mechanisms underlying these findings and identify how successful
collaborators leverage common language to weave together diverse experience
obtained through trajectories of prior work that converge to provoke one
another and innovate. We explore the importance of these findings for team
assembly and research policy.

TL;DR: New static word embeddings optimized for sentence semantics, improved via PCA and learning methods, outperform existing models and rival basic Sentence Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance sentence semantic representation with computationally efficient static word embeddings.

Method: Extract embeddings from a pre-trained Sentence Transformer, refine with PCA and either knowledge distillation or contrastive learning, then average word embeddings for sentence representation.

Result: Outperforms existing static models on semantic tasks and rivals basic Sentence Transformers (e.g., SimCSE) in some datasets.

Conclusion: The method effectively removes irrelevant embedding components and adjusts vector norms based on word influence, improving sentence semantics.

Abstract: We propose new static word embeddings optimised for sentence semantic
representation. We first extract word embeddings from a pre-trained Sentence
Transformer, and improve them with sentence-level principal component analysis,
followed by either knowledge distillation or contrastive learning. During
inference, we represent sentences by simply averaging word embeddings, which
requires little computational cost. We evaluate models on both monolingual and
cross-lingual tasks and show that our model substantially outperforms existing
static models on sentence semantic tasks, and even rivals a basic Sentence
Transformer model (SimCSE) on some data sets. Lastly, we perform a variety of
analyses and show that our method successfully removes word embedding
components that are irrelevant to sentence semantics, and adjusts the vector
norms based on the influence of words on sentence semantics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address unreliable tool planning and weak reflection in LLMs due to poor datasets and static learning.

Method: Introduces Multi-Agent Meta-Verification (MAMV) for dataset quality and Exploration-based Reflection Learning (EXPLORE) for dynamic error correction.

Result: Tool-MVR outperforms ToolLLM by 23.9% and GPT-4 by 15.3%, reducing API calls by 31.4%, and achieves 58.9% error correction on RefineToolBench.

Conclusion: Tool-MVR advances LLM tool use with robust planning and reflection, demonstrating superior performance and generalization.

Abstract: Empowering large language models (LLMs) with effective tool utilization
capabilities is crucial for enabling AI agents to solve complex problems.
However, current models face two major limitations: (1) unreliable tool
planning and invocation due to low-quality instruction datasets (e.g.,
widespread hallucinated API calls), and (2) weak tool reflection abilities
(over 90% of errors cannot be corrected) resulting from static imitation
learning. To address these critical limitations, we propose Tool-MVR, a novel
Tool-Augmented LLM that achieves comprehensive System 2 reasoning through two
key innovations. Specifically, we first introduce Multi-Agent Meta-Verification
(MAMV), a systematic pipeline that rigorously validates APIs, queries, and
reasoning trajectories to construct ToolBench-V, a new high-quality instruction
dataset that addresses the limitation of unreliable tool planning and
invocation. Second, we propose Exploration-based Reflection Learning (EXPLORE),
which enhances tool reflection capabilities by leveraging tool feedback through
a dynamic "Error -> Reflection -> Correction" learning paradigm, resulting in
our reflection dataset ToolBench-R and addressing the critical weakness in tool
reflection. Finally, we obtain Tool-MVR by finetuning open-source LLMs (e.g.,
Qwen-7B) on both ToolBench-V and ToolBench-R. Our experiments demonstrate that
Tool-MVR achieves state-of-the-art performance on StableToolBench, surpassing
both ToolLLM (by 23.9%) and GPT-4 (by 15.3%) while reducing API calls by 31.4%,
with strong generalization capabilities across unseen tools and scenarios.
Additionally, on our proposed RefineToolBench, the first benchmark specifically
designed to evaluate tool reflection capabilities, Tool-MVR achieves a 58.9%
error correction rate, significantly outperforming ToolLLM's 9.1%.

*Thai-Binh Nguyen,Thi Van Nguyen,Quoc Truong Do,Chi Mai Luong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to generate AVSR datasets from raw video, improving efficiency and accessibility, and demonstrates its effectiveness with a Vietnamese AVSR model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AVSR systems are robust against noise but limited by dataset scarcity, especially for non-English languages. Automated data collection can address this gap.

Method: The work refines existing techniques to generate AVSR datasets from raw video, focusing on efficiency and accessibility.

Result: The automatically collected dataset enables a strong Vietnamese AVSR baseline, performing competitively in clean conditions and outperforming ASR in noisy environments.

Conclusion: This efficient method expands AVSR accessibility to under-resourced languages, addressing dataset limitations.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) has gained significant attention
recently due to its robustness against noise, which often challenges
conventional speech recognition systems that rely solely on audio features.
Despite this advantage, AVSR models remain limited by the scarcity of extensive
datasets, especially for most languages beyond English. Automated data
collection offers a promising solution. This work presents a practical approach
to generate AVSR datasets from raw video, refining existing techniques for
improved efficiency and accessibility. We demonstrate its broad applicability
by developing a baseline AVSR model for Vietnamese. Experiments show the
automatically collected dataset enables a strong baseline, achieving
competitive performance with robust ASR in clean conditions and significantly
outperforming them in noisy environments like cocktail parties. This efficient
method provides a pathway to expand AVSR to more languages, particularly
under-resourced ones.

*Vinay Joshi,Pratik Prabhanjan Brahma,Zicheng Liu,Emad Barsoum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TaDA is a training-free KV cache compression method using adaptive quantization and mean centering, reducing memory footprint to 27% of baseline while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV cache memory demands scale poorly with sequence length, hindering scalable deployment of large language models.

Method: TaDA adapts quantization precision to error sensitivity and uses mean centering to avoid separate outlier handling.

Result: Reduces KV cache memory to 27% of 16-bit baseline with comparable accuracy.

Conclusion: TaDA enables scalable, high-performance reasoning in language models by supporting longer contexts and chains of thought.

Abstract: The key-value (KV) cache in transformer models is a critical component for
efficient decoding or inference, yet its memory demands scale poorly with
sequence length, posing a major challenge for scalable deployment of large
language models. Among several approaches to KV cache compression, quantization
of key and value activations has been widely explored. Most KV cache
quantization methods still need to manage sparse and noncontiguous outliers
separately. To address this, we introduce TaDA, a training-free recipe for KV
cache compression with quantization precision that adapts to error sensitivity
across layers and a mean centering to eliminate separate outlier handling. Our
approach yields substantial accuracy improvements for multiple models
supporting various context lengths. Moreover, our approach does not need to
separately manage outlier elements -- a persistent hurdle in most traditional
quantization methods. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
technique reduces KV cache memory footprint to 27% of the original 16-bit
baseline while achieving comparable accuracy. Our method paves the way for
scalable and high-performance reasoning in language models by potentially
enabling inference for longer context length models, reasoning models, and
longer chain of thoughts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Flex-TravelPlanner benchmark evaluates LLMs' dynamic planning, revealing gaps in adaptability and constraint prioritization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks lack dynamic, multi-turn planning scenarios, limiting evaluation of LLMs' real-world adaptability.

Method: Introduces sequential constraint introduction and prioritized competing constraints in the TravelPlanner dataset.

Result: Models struggle with multi-turn adaptability and constraint prioritization, with performance impacted by constraint order.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for dynamic benchmarks and suggests improvements for LLMs in complex planning tasks.

Abstract: Real-world planning problems require constant adaptation to changing
requirements and balancing of competing constraints. However, current
benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities primarily focus on
static, single-turn scenarios. We introduce Flex-TravelPlanner, a benchmark
that evaluates language models' ability to reason flexibly in dynamic planning
scenarios. Building on the TravelPlanner dataset~\citep{xie2024travelplanner},
we introduce two novel evaluation settings: (1) sequential constraint
introduction across multiple turns, and (2) scenarios with explicitly
prioritized competing constraints. Our analysis of GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 70B
reveals several key findings: models' performance on single-turn tasks poorly
predicts their ability to adapt plans across multiple turns; constraint
introduction order significantly affects performance; and models struggle with
constraint prioritization, often incorrectly favoring newly introduced lower
priority preferences over existing higher-priority constraints. These findings
highlight the importance of evaluating LLMs in more realistic, dynamic planning
scenarios and suggest specific directions for improving model performance on
complex planning tasks. The code and dataset for our framework are publicly
available at https://github.com/juhyunohh/FlexTravelBench.

### [129] [Normative Conflicts and Shallow AI Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04679)
*Raphaël Millière*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper highlights the inadequacy of current alignment strategies for LLMs, showing their vulnerability to adversarial attacks due to shallow behavioral reinforcement rather than genuine normative reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the growing concerns about the safe deployment of AI systems, particularly LLMs, by examining the limitations of current alignment methods.

Method: Analyzes the value alignment problem for LLMs, comparing their vulnerability to adversarial attacks with human deliberative reasoning capabilities.

Result: Current alignment methods fail to provide LLMs with robust normative reasoning, making them susceptible to manipulation despite advances.

Conclusion: Existing alignment approaches are insufficient for ensuring AI safety, necessitating new methods to address the "shallow alignment" problem.

Abstract: The progress of AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) raises
increasingly pressing concerns about their safe deployment. This paper examines
the value alignment problem for LLMs, arguing that current alignment strategies
are fundamentally inadequate to prevent misuse. Despite ongoing efforts to
instill norms such as helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness in LLMs through
fine-tuning based on human preferences, they remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that exploit conflicts between these norms. I argue that this
vulnerability reflects a fundamental limitation of existing alignment methods:
they reinforce shallow behavioral dispositions rather than endowing LLMs with a
genuine capacity for normative deliberation. Drawing from on research in moral
psychology, I show how humans' ability to engage in deliberative reasoning
enhances their resilience against similar adversarial tactics. LLMs, by
contrast, lack a robust capacity to detect and rationally resolve normative
conflicts, leaving them susceptible to manipulation; even recent advances in
reasoning-focused LLMs have not addressed this vulnerability. This ``shallow
alignment'' problem carries significant implications for AI safety and
regulation, suggesting that current approaches are insufficient for mitigating
potential harms posed by increasingly capable AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance reasoning during inference by evaluating MLLMs' error refinement capabilities beyond just final accuracy.

Method: Introduces MMRefine, a framework assessing refinement across six scenarios and error types, tested with various MLLMs.

(MLLMs). As the emphasis shifts toward enhancing reasoning during inference,
MMRefine provides a framework that evaluates MLLMs' abilities to detect and
correct errors across six distinct scenarios beyond just comparing final
accuracy before and after refinement. Furthermore, the benchmark analyzes the
refinement performance by categorizing errors into six error types. Experiments
with various open and closed MLLMs reveal bottlenecks and factors impeding
refinement performance, highlighting areas for improvement in effective
reasoning enhancement. Our code and dataset are publicly available at

*Thao Nguyen,Yang Li,Olga Golovneva,Luke Zettlemoyer,Sewoong Oh,Ludwig Schmidt,Xian Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: REWIRE recycles low-quality web data by enriching it, improving model performance by 1.0-2.5 percentage points across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the 'data wall' in pre-training by recycling discarded low-quality web data.

Method: Proposes REWIRE, a method to transform and enrich low-quality documents for training.

Result: Mixing rewritten texts with high-quality data improves performance by 1.0-2.5 points across 22 tasks.

Conclusion: Recycling web texts is a simple and effective way to scale pre-training data.

Abstract: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves
with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been
relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available
on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the
same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality
texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of
the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall"
of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data
discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web
with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they
could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the
representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at
1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw
texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points
improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only
filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more
effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we
demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming
lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also
outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including
Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge
extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential
for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

*Lu Wei,Liangzhi Li,Tong Xiang,Xiao Liu,Noa Garcia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a taxonomy for detecting implicit hate speech (im-HS) using six codetypes and validates their effectiveness in improving detection across languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic detection methods struggle with subtle forms of hate speech (im-HS), necessitating a better approach to maintain societal harmony.

Method: Two methods are proposed: 1) prompting LLMs for classification and 2) embedding codetypes during LLM encoding.

Result: Experiments show codetypes enhance im-HS detection in Chinese and English datasets.

Conclusion: The taxonomy and methods improve im-HS detection, demonstrating cross-language applicability.

Abstract: The internet has become a hotspot for hate speech (HS), threatening societal
harmony and individual well-being. While automatic detection methods perform
well in identifying explicit hate speech (ex-HS), they struggle with more
subtle forms, such as implicit hate speech (im-HS). We tackle this problem by
introducing a new taxonomy for im-HS detection, defining six encoding
strategies named codetypes. We present two methods for integrating codetypes
into im-HS detection: 1) prompting large language models (LLMs) directly to
classify sentences based on generated responses, and 2) using LLMs as encoders
with codetypes embedded during the encoding process. Experiments show that the
use of codetypes improves im-HS detection in both Chinese and English datasets,
validating the effectiveness of our approach across different languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STAND (STochastic Adaptive N-gram Drafting) is a model-free speculative decoding method that accelerates language model inference by 60-65% without accuracy loss, outperforming existing methods by 14-28% in throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time scaling techniques like best-of-N sampling and tree search are computationally expensive, creating a trade-off between performance and efficiency.

Method: STAND leverages redundancy in reasoning trajectories, using stochastic drafting, a logit-based N-gram module, Gumbel-Top-K sampling, and data-driven tree construction to predict tokens efficiently.

Result: STAND reduces inference latency by 60-65% while maintaining accuracy and outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 14-28% in throughput.

Conclusion: STAND is a powerful plug-and-play solution for accelerating language model reasoning without additional training, applicable to any existing model.

Abstract: Language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning tasks
through test-time scaling techniques like best-of-N sampling and tree search.
However, these approaches often demand substantial computational resources,
creating a critical trade-off between performance and efficiency. We introduce
STAND (STochastic Adaptive N-gram Drafting), a novel model-free speculative
decoding approach that leverages the inherent redundancy in reasoning
trajectories to achieve significant acceleration without compromising accuracy.
Our analysis reveals that reasoning paths frequently reuse similar reasoning
patterns, enabling efficient model-free token prediction without requiring
separate draft models. By introducing stochastic drafting and preserving
probabilistic information through a memory-efficient logit-based N-gram module,
combined with optimized Gumbel-Top-K sampling and data-driven tree
construction, STAND significantly improves token acceptance rates. Extensive
evaluations across multiple models and reasoning tasks (AIME-2024,
GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench) demonstrate that STAND reduces inference
latency by 60-65% compared to standard autoregressive decoding while
maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, STAND outperforms state-of-the-art
speculative decoding methods by 14-28% in throughput and shows strong
performance even in single-trajectory scenarios, reducing inference latency by
48-58%. As a model-free approach, STAND can be applied to any existing language
model without additional training, being a powerful plug-and-play solution for
accelerating language model reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance speech translation quality for the low-resource Bhojpuri-Hindi language pair by optimizing hyperparameters and applying data augmentation techniques.

Method: Systematically explored hyperparameters (learning rate, update steps, etc.) and data augmentation (speed perturbation, SpecAugment). Also investigated cross-lingual training with Marathi and Bhojpuri data.

Result: Hyperparameter tuning and augmentation techniques significantly improved translation performance. Error analysis identified factors affecting BLEU scores.

Conclusion: Careful hyperparameter selection and simple augmentation methods are effective for low-resource speech translation tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents the submission of IIITH-BUT to the IWSLT 2025 shared task
on speech translation for the low-resource Bhojpuri-Hindi language pair. We
explored the impact of hyperparameter optimisation and data augmentation
techniques on the performance of the SeamlessM4T model fine-tuned for this
specific task. We systematically investigated a range of hyperparameters
including learning rate schedules, number of update steps, warm-up steps, label
smoothing, and batch sizes; and report their effect on translation quality. To
address data scarcity, we applied speed perturbation and SpecAugment and
studied their effect on translation quality. We also examined the use of
cross-lingual signal through joint training with Marathi and Bhojpuri speech
data. Our experiments reveal that careful selection of hyperparameters and the
application of simple yet effective augmentation techniques significantly
improve performance in low-resource settings. We also analysed the translation
hypotheses to understand various kinds of errors that impacted the translation
quality in terms of BLEU.

*Yuru Jiang,Wenxuan Ding,Shangbin Feng,Greg Durrett,Yulia Tsvetkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPARTA ALIGNMENT is an algorithm where multiple LLMs compete and judge each other to improve diversity and reduce biases, outperforming baselines in most tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses lack of diversity and biases in single-model generation and evaluation by leveraging competition among multiple LLMs.

Method: Models form a 'sparta tribe,' compete in duels, and judge each other's responses. Scores are aggregated via an adapted Elo-ranking system, and models learn from preference pairs.

Result: Outperforms initial models and 4 baselines in 10 out of 12 tasks, with a 7.0% average improvement, and generalizes better to unseen tasks.

Conclusion: SPARTA ALIGNMENT enables iterative self-evolution of LLMs through competition, improving output quality and leveraging model diversity.

Abstract: We propose SPARTA ALIGNMENT, an algorithm to collectively align multiple LLMs
through competition and combat. To complement a single model's lack of
diversity in generation and biases in evaluation, multiple LLMs form a "sparta
tribe" to compete against each other in fulfilling instructions while serving
as judges for the competition of others. For each iteration, one instruction
and two models are selected for a duel, the other models evaluate the two
responses, and their evaluation scores are aggregated through a adapted
elo-ranking based reputation system, where winners/losers of combat gain/lose
weight in evaluating others. The peer-evaluated combat results then become
preference pairs where the winning response is preferred over the losing one,
and all models learn from these preferences at the end of each iteration.
SPARTA ALIGNMENT enables the self-evolution of multiple LLMs in an iterative
and collective competition process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SPARTA ALIGNMENT outperforms initial models and 4 self-alignment baselines
across 10 out of 12 tasks and datasets with 7.0% average improvement. Further
analysis reveals that SPARTA ALIGNMENT generalizes more effectively to unseen
tasks and leverages the expertise diversity of participating models to produce
more logical, direct and informative outputs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces C²EFND, a framework combining LLMs and SLMs for fake news detection, addressing data scarcity and adaptability issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fake news on social media causes serious harm, but current methods (SLMs and LLMs) struggle with training demands, adaptability, and outdated knowledge.

Method: C²EFND uses multi-round collaborative learning between LLMs and SLMs, with lifelong knowledge editing for LLMs and replay-based learning for SLMs.

Result: Experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 show C²EFND outperforms existing methods in accuracy and adaptability.

Conclusion: C²EFND effectively addresses fake news detection challenges by leveraging collaborative learning and continuous updates.

Abstract: The widespread dissemination of fake news on social media has significantly
impacted society, resulting in serious consequences. Conventional deep learning
methodologies employing small language models (SLMs) suffer from extensive
supervised training requirements and difficulties adapting to evolving news
environments due to data scarcity and distribution shifts. Large language
models (LLMs), despite robust zero-shot capabilities, fall short in accurately
detecting fake news owing to outdated knowledge and the absence of suitable
demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel Continuous Collaborative
Emergent Fake News Detection (C$^2$EFND) framework to address these challenges.
The C$^2$EFND framework strategically leverages both LLMs' generalization power
and SLMs' classification expertise via a multi-round collaborative learning
framework. We further introduce a lifelong knowledge editing module based on a
Mixture-of-Experts architecture to incrementally update LLMs and a replay-based
continue learning method to ensure SLMs retain prior knowledge without
retraining entirely. Extensive experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets
demonstrate that C$^2$EFND significantly outperforms existed methods,
effectively improving detection accuracy and adaptability in continuous
emergent fake news scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore for evaluating text revisions in scientific writing, proposing a hybrid approach combining LLM-as-a-judge and domain-specific metrics for better alignment with human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional metrics focus on similarity rather than meaningful improvements in text revisions, necessitating better evaluation methods.

Method: The study includes manual annotation of revision quality, exploration of reference-free metrics, and analysis of LLM-as-a-judge approaches.

Result: LLMs excel in assessing instruction-following but lack correctness, while domain-specific metrics offer complementary insights. A hybrid approach proves most reliable.

Conclusion: A hybrid method combining LLM-as-a-judge and task-specific metrics provides the most accurate evaluation of text revision quality.

Abstract: Evaluating text revision in scientific writing remains a challenge, as
traditional metrics such as ROUGE and BERTScore primarily focus on similarity
rather than capturing meaningful improvements. In this work, we analyse and
identify the limitations of these metrics and explore alternative evaluation
methods that better align with human judgments. We first conduct a manual
annotation study to assess the quality of different revisions. Then, we
investigate reference-free evaluation metrics from related NLP domains.
Additionally, we examine LLM-as-a-judge approaches, analysing their ability to
assess revisions with and without a gold reference. Our results show that LLMs
effectively assess instruction-following but struggle with correctness, while
domain-specific metrics provide complementary insights. We find that a hybrid
approach combining LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and task-specific metrics offers
the most reliable assessment of revision quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores LLMs' political opinions by probing their internal mechanisms and extending single-axis analysis to multi-dimensions for clearer political concept learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misalignment between LLMs' responses and internal intentions, and reliance on single-axis concepts leading to confounds, drive the need for deeper analysis.

Method: A four-dimensional political learning framework and dataset are designed for fine-grained concept vector learning, tested with three representation engineering techniques on eight LLMs.

Result: The vectors disentangle political concept confounds, validate semantic meaning, and generalize well in OOD settings. They also enable interventions to alter LLM responses.

Conclusion: Multi-dimensional analysis and interpretable techniques improve transparency and control over LLMs' political opinions.

Abstract: Studies of LLMs' political opinions mainly rely on evaluations of their
open-ended responses. Recent work indicates that there is a misalignment
between LLMs' responses and their internal intentions. This motivates us to
probe LLMs' internal mechanisms and help uncover their internal political
states. Additionally, we found that the analysis of LLMs' political opinions
often relies on single-axis concepts, which can lead to concept confounds. In
this work, we extend the single-axis to multi-dimensions and apply
interpretable representation engineering techniques for more transparent LLM
political concept learning. Specifically, we designed a four-dimensional
political learning framework and constructed a corresponding dataset for
fine-grained political concept vector learning. These vectors can be used to
detect and intervene in LLM internals. Experiments are conducted on eight
open-source LLMs with three representation engineering techniques. Results show
these vectors can disentangle political concept confounds. Detection tasks
validate the semantic meaning of the vectors and show good generalization and
robustness in OOD settings. Intervention Experiments show these vectors can
intervene in LLMs to generate responses with different political leanings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMSU, a benchmark for evaluating fine-grained perception and reasoning in spoken language understanding, testing 14 SpeechLLMs across 47 tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored capabilities of SpeechLLMs in fine-grained perception and complex reasoning in natural speech.

Method: Developed MMSU, a benchmark with 5,000 audio-question-answer triplets covering diverse linguistic phenomena.

Result: Identified significant gaps in existing SpeechLLMs, suggesting areas for future improvement.

Conclusion: MMSU sets a new standard for assessing spoken language understanding and aids in advancing human-AI speech interaction.

Abstract: Speech inherently contains rich acoustic information that extends far beyond
the textual language. In real-world spoken language understanding, effective
interpretation often requires integrating semantic meaning (e.g., content),
paralinguistic features (e.g., emotions, speed, pitch) and phonological
characteristics (e.g., prosody, intonation, rhythm), which are embedded in
speech. While recent multimodal Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing audio information, their
ability to perform fine-grained perception and complex reasoning in natural
speech remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce MMSU, a
comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for understanding and reasoning
in spoken language. MMSU comprises 5,000 meticulously curated
audio-question-answer triplets across 47 distinct tasks. To ground our
benchmark in linguistic theory, we systematically incorporate a wide range of
linguistic phenomena, including phonetics, prosody, rhetoric, syntactics,
semantics, and paralinguistics. Through a rigorous evaluation of 14 advanced
SpeechLLMs, we identify substantial room for improvement in existing models,
highlighting meaningful directions for future optimization. MMSU establishes a
new standard for comprehensive assessment of spoken language understanding,
providing valuable insights for developing more sophisticated human-AI speech
interaction systems. MMSU benchmark is available at

TL;DR: A survey on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) analyzes integration techniques, proposing a classification framework based on architecture, representation learning, and training paradigms to guide future development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding how diverse modalities connect to language backbones in MLLMs and provide a systematic overview of current approaches.

Method: Examines 125 MLLMs (2021-2025), focusing on architectural strategies, representation learning techniques, and training paradigms.

Result: Identifies emerging patterns and proposes a taxonomy for MLLM integration techniques.

Conclusion: The framework offers structured insights to guide robust multimodal integration in future models.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) has transformed
the AI landscape. These models combine pre-trained LLMs with various modality
encoders. This integration requires a systematic understanding of how different
modalities connect to the language backbone. Our survey presents an LLM-centric
analysis of current approaches. We examine methods for transforming and
aligning diverse modal inputs into the language embedding space. This addresses
a significant gap in existing literature. We propose a classification framework
for MLLMs based on three key dimensions. First, we examine architectural
strategies for modality integration. This includes both the specific
integration mechanisms and the fusion level. Second, we categorize
representation learning techniques as either joint or coordinate
representations. Third, we analyze training paradigms, including training
strategies and objective functions. By examining 125 MLLMs developed between
2021 and 2025, we identify emerging patterns in the field. Our taxonomy
provides researchers with a structured overview of current integration
techniques. These insights aim to guide the development of more robust
multimodal integration strategies for future models built on pre-trained
foundations.

Method: Proposes FineLogic for fine-grained evaluation and studies four supervision styles (natural language and symbolic) during fine-tuning.

Result: Natural language supervision generalizes well; symbolic styles enhance structural reasoning. Fine-tuning improves step-by-step generation, not shortcuts.

Conclusion: FineLogic offers a more interpretable way to evaluate and enhance logical reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a core capability for many applications of large
language models (LLMs), yet existing benchmarks often rely solely on
final-answer accuracy, failing to capture the quality and structure of the
reasoning process. We propose FineLogic, a fine-grained evaluation framework
that assesses logical reasoning across three dimensions: overall benchmark
accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment. In addition,
to better understand how reasoning capabilities emerge, we conduct a
comprehensive study on the effects of supervision format during fine-tuning. We
construct four supervision styles (one natural language and three symbolic
variants) and train LLMs under each. Our findings reveal that natural language
supervision yields strong generalization even on out-of-distribution and
long-context tasks, while symbolic reasoning styles promote more structurally
sound and atomic inference chains. Further, our representation-level probing
shows that fine-tuning primarily improves reasoning behaviors through
step-by-step generation, rather than enhancing shortcut prediction or
internalized correctness. Together, our framework and analysis provide a more
rigorous and interpretable lens for evaluating and improving logical reasoning
in LLMs.

### [142] [Design of intelligent proofreading system for English translation based on CNN and BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04811)
*Feijun Liu,Huifeng Wang,Kun Wang,Yizhen Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A hybrid CNN-BERT approach for machine translation proofreading achieves 90% accuracy, outperforming existing methods by 10%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic translations often contain errors needing human post-editing; robust proofreading is essential for quality improvement.

Method: Combines CNN for local n-gram pattern capture and BERT for context-rich sequence representation, with integrated error detection and correction modules.

Result: Achieves 90% accuracy, 89.37% F1, and 16.24% MSE, surpassing recent techniques by over 10%.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach sets a new benchmark for identifying and correcting mistranslations and omissions.

Abstract: Since automatic translations can contain errors that require substantial
human post-editing, machine translation proofreading is essential for improving
quality. This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach for robust proofreading
that combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) with Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT). In order to extract semantic
information from phrases and expressions, CNN uses a variety of convolution
kernel filters to capture local n-gram patterns. In the meanwhile, BERT creates
context-rich representations of whole sequences by utilizing stacked
bidirectional transformer encoders. Using BERT's attention processes, the
integrated error detection component relates tokens to spot translation
irregularities including word order problems and omissions. The correction
module then uses parallel English-German alignment and GRU decoder models in
conjunction with translation memory to propose logical modifications that
maintain original meaning. A unified end-to-end training process optimized for
post-editing performance is applied to the whole pipeline. The multi-domain
collection of WMT and the conversational dialogues of Open-Subtitles are two of
the English-German parallel corpora used to train the model. Multiple loss
functions supervise detection and correction capabilities. Experiments attain a
90% accuracy, 89.37% F1, and 16.24% MSE, exceeding recent proofreading
techniques by over 10% overall. Comparative benchmarking demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance in identifying and coherently rectifying
mistranslations and omissions.

*Nurul Aisyah,Muhammad Dehan Al Kautsar,Arif Hidayat,Raqib Chowdhury,Fajri Koto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates VLM and LLM performance in grading and providing feedback on handwritten student exams in underrepresented Indonesian schools, revealing handwriting recognition challenges but some utility in LLM feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effectiveness of VLM and LLMs in real-world educational settings, particularly in underrepresented contexts like Indonesian schools.

Method: Evaluated a VLM and several LLMs on 646 handwritten exam responses from grade 4 students, covering Math and English, with tasks like grading and feedback generation.

Result: VLMs struggled with handwriting recognition, affecting LLM grading accuracy, but LLM feedback remained somewhat useful despite imperfect input.

Conclusion: While VLMs and LLMs show potential for educational assessment, handwriting recognition issues and feedback limitations highlight areas for improvement.

Abstract: Although vision-language and large language models (VLM and LLM) offer
promising opportunities for AI-driven educational assessment, their
effectiveness in real-world classroom settings, particularly in
underrepresented educational contexts, remains underexplored. In this study, we
evaluated the performance of a state-of-the-art VLM and several LLMs on 646
handwritten exam responses from grade 4 students in six Indonesian schools,
covering two subjects: Mathematics and English. These sheets contain more than
14K student answers that span multiple choice, short answer, and essay
questions. Assessment tasks include grading these responses and generating
personalized feedback. Our findings show that the VLM often struggles to
accurately recognize student handwriting, leading to error propagation in
downstream LLM grading. Nevertheless, LLM-generated feedback retains some
utility, even when derived from imperfect input, although limitations in
personalization and contextual relevance persist.

### [144] [A Reasoning-Based Approach to Cryptic Crossword Clue Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04824)
*Martin Andrews,Sam Witteveen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: An LLM-based system solves cryptic crossword clues by hypothesizing answers, proposing wordplay explanations, and verifying reasoning steps, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Cryptonite dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cryptic crossword clues are complex language tasks with daily new test sets, requiring a system to solve them without relying on crossing words.

Method: The system uses open-licensed LLM components to hypothesize answers, propose wordplay explanations, and verify solutions through codified reasoning steps.

Result: The system achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Cryptonite dataset, with interpretable reasoning provided in Python.

Conclusion: The work presents a novel, interpretable approach to solving cryptic clues, advancing the field of language task automation.

Abstract: Cryptic crossword clues are challenging language tasks for which new test
sets are released daily by major newspapers on a global basis. Each cryptic
clue contains both the definition of the answer to be placed in the crossword
grid (in common with regular crosswords), and 'wordplay' that proves that the
answer is correct (i.e. a human solver can be confident that an answer is
correct without needing crossing words as confirmation). This work describes an
LLM-based reasoning system built from open-licensed components that solves
cryptic clues by (i) hypothesising answers; (ii) proposing wordplay
explanations; and (iii) using a verifier system that operates on codified
reasoning steps. Overall, this system establishes a new state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging Cryptonite dataset of clues from The Times and
The Telegraph newspapers in the UK. Because each proved solution is expressed
in Python, interpretable wordplay reasoning for proven answers is available for
inspection.

### [145] [Joint Evaluation of Answer and Reasoning Consistency for Hallucination Detection in Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04832)
*Changyue Wang,Weihang Su,Qingyao Ai,Yiqun Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RACE is a new framework for detecting hallucinations in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) by analyzing reasoning traces and answer consistency, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hallucination detection methods fail to address inconsistencies in reasoning traces of LRMs, which are critical for transparency and performance.

Method: RACE evaluates reasoning traces using four signals: inter-sample consistency, entropy-based uncertainty, semantic alignment, and internal coherence.

Result: RACE outperforms baselines in detecting hallucinations, even when answers seem correct, across datasets and LLMs.

Conclusion: RACE provides a robust, generalizable solution for evaluating LRMs by addressing reasoning trace inconsistencies.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) extend large language models with explicit,
multi-step reasoning traces to enhance transparency and performance on complex
tasks. However, these reasoning traces can be redundant or logically
inconsistent, making them a new source of hallucination that is difficult to
detect. Existing hallucination detection methods focus primarily on
answer-level uncertainty and often fail to detect hallucinations or logical
inconsistencies arising from the model's reasoning trace. This oversight is
particularly problematic for LRMs, where the explicit thinking trace is not
only an important support to the model's decision-making process but also a key
source of potential hallucination. To this end, we propose RACE (Reasoning and
Answer Consistency Evaluation), a novel framework specifically tailored for
hallucination detection in LRMs. RACE operates by extracting essential
reasoning steps and computing four diagnostic signals: inter-sample consistency
of reasoning traces, entropy-based answer uncertainty, semantic alignment
between reasoning and answers, and internal coherence of reasoning. This joint
analysis enables fine-grained hallucination detection even when the final
answer appears correct. Experiments across datasets and different LLMs
demonstrate that RACE outperforms existing hallucination detection baselines,
offering a robust and generalizable solution for evaluating LRMs. Our code is
available at: https://github.com/bebr2/RACE.

*Dávid Javorský,Ondřej Bojar,François Yvon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MockConf, a dataset for simultaneous interpreting, and InterAlign, a tool for aligning and annotating parallel speech corpora, addressing gaps in existing resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate and analyze simultaneous interpreting, dedicated datasets and tools are needed, as existing resources fail to model long-range interactions and specific divergences in interpreted speech.

Method: The authors collected a student interpreting dataset (MockConf) and developed InterAlign, a web-based tool for parallel word and span annotations.

Result: The dataset includes 7 hours of recordings in 5 languages, transcribed and aligned. InterAlign supports long inputs and provides metrics for evaluation.

Conclusion: MockConf and InterAlign are released to the community, offering resources for advancing simultaneous interpreting research.

Abstract: In simultaneous interpreting, an interpreter renders a source speech into
another language with a very short lag, much sooner than sentences are
finished. In order to understand and later reproduce this dynamic and complex
task automatically, we need dedicated datasets and tools for analysis,
monitoring, and evaluation, such as parallel speech corpora, and tools for
their automatic annotation. Existing parallel corpora of translated texts and
associated alignment algorithms hardly fill this gap, as they fail to model
long-range interactions between speech segments or specific types of
divergences (e.g., shortening, simplification, functional generalization)
between the original and interpreted speeches. In this work, we introduce
MockConf, a student interpreting dataset that was collected from Mock
Conferences run as part of the students' curriculum. This dataset contains 7
hours of recordings in 5 European languages, transcribed and aligned at the
level of spans and words. We further implement and release InterAlign, a modern
web-based annotation tool for parallel word and span annotations on long
inputs, suitable for aligning simultaneous interpreting. We propose metrics for
the evaluation and a baseline for automatic alignment. Dataset and tools are
released to the community.

TL;DR: The paper compares Llama 2, Mistral, and GPT-3.5 for generating MCQs, finding GPT-3.5 most effective, while noting educator reluctance toward AI adoption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the resource-intensive nature of manually creating MCQs by leveraging LLMs, ensuring educator control over source text.

Method: Comparative analysis of three LLMs (Llama 2, Mistral, GPT-3.5) with knowledge injected into prompts to minimize hallucinations.

Result: GPT-3.5 outperforms others in generating effective MCQs, though educators show reluctance toward AI adoption.

Conclusion: LLMs like GPT-3.5 hold promise for MCQ generation, but further work is needed to address educator concerns and improve adoption.

Abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) in educational settings has brought
new learning approaches, transforming the practices of both students and
educators. Among the various technologies driving this transformation, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for creating educational
materials and question answering, but there are still space for new
applications. Educators commonly use Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) to assess
student knowledge, but manually generating these questions is
resource-intensive and requires significant time and cognitive effort. In our
opinion, LLMs offer a promising solution to these challenges. This paper
presents a novel comparative analysis of three widely known LLMs - Llama 2,
Mistral, and GPT-3.5 - to explore their potential for creating informative and
challenging MCQs. In our approach, we do not rely on the knowledge of the LLM,
but we inject the knowledge into the prompt to contrast the hallucinations,
giving the educators control over the test's source text, too. Our experiment
involving 21 educators shows that GPT-3.5 generates the most effective MCQs
across several known metrics. Additionally, it shows that there is still some
reluctance to adopt AI in the educational field. This study sheds light on the
potential of LLMs to generate MCQs and improve the educational experience,
providing valuable insights for the future.

### [148] [Prompting LLMs: Length Control for Isometric Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04855)
*Dávid Javorský,Ondřej Bojar,François Yvon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines isometric machine translation using LLMs, focusing on prompt strategies, few-shot examples, and demonstration selection. Key findings include the importance of instruction phrasing for length control and marginal gains in quality with more examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs perform in isometric translation tasks and how prompting strategies affect translation quality and length control.

Method: Evaluated eight LLMs across En→De, En→Fr, and En→Es language pairs using varying prompts, few-shot examples, and demonstration selections.

Result: Instruction phrasing and demonstration alignment are critical for length control. Few-shot prompting improves quality marginally beyond 5 examples. Multiple outputs enhance the length-quality tradeoff.

Conclusion: LLMs can achieve state-of-the-art isometric translation performance with careful prompt design and output selection, though length control remains challenging.

Abstract: In this study, we explore the effectiveness of isometric machine translation
across multiple language pairs (En$\to$De, En$\to$Fr, and En$\to$Es) under the
conditions of the IWSLT Isometric Shared Task 2022. Using eight open-source
large language models (LLMs) of varying sizes, we investigate how different
prompting strategies, varying numbers of few-shot examples, and demonstration
selection influence translation quality and length control. We discover that
the phrasing of instructions, when aligned with the properties of the provided
demonstrations, plays a crucial role in controlling the output length. Our
experiments show that LLMs tend to produce shorter translations only when
presented with extreme examples, while isometric demonstrations often lead to
the models disregarding length constraints. While few-shot prompting generally
enhances translation quality, further improvements are marginal across 5, 10,
and 20-shot settings. Finally, considering multiple outputs allows to notably
improve overall tradeoff between the length and quality, yielding
state-of-the-art performance for some language pairs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores integrating Universal Dependencies (UD) into pretrained language models to enhance performance in cross-lingual tasks, showing significant improvements in accuracy and F1 scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored effectiveness of UD in cross-lingual syntactic representation and its potential to improve pretrained language models.

Method: Integrating UD into pretrained language models and evaluating performance on a cross-lingual adversarial paraphrase identification task.

Result: UD integration improves accuracy by 3.85% and F1 scores by 6.08%, reducing performance gaps with large language models and outperforming them in some cases.

Conclusion: UD is validated as effective for out-of-domain tasks, with performance correlated to UD-based similarity scores between languages.

Abstract: Universal Dependencies (UD), while widely regarded as the most successful
linguistic framework for cross-lingual syntactic representation, remains
underexplored in terms of its effectiveness. This paper addresses this gap by
integrating UD into pretrained language models and assesses if UD can improve
their performance on a cross-lingual adversarial paraphrase identification
task. Experimental results show that incorporation of UD yields significant
improvements in accuracy and $F_1$ scores, with average gains of 3.85\% and
6.08\% respectively. These enhancements reduce the performance gap between
pretrained models and large language models in some language pairs, and even
outperform the latter in some others. Furthermore, the UD-based similarity
score between a given language and English is positively correlated to the
performance of models in that language. Both findings highlight the validity
and potential of UD in out-of-domain tasks.

*Shiyi Xu,Yiwen Hu,Yingqian Min,Zhipeng Chen,Wayne Xin Zhao,Ji-Rong Wen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ICPC-Eval is a competitive coding benchmark for evaluating LLMs in real competition scenarios, featuring curated ICPC problems, robust evaluation tools, and a new metric, Refine@K.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks and metrics fail to assess LLMs' coding capabilities and reflective reasoning in competitive environments.

Method: ICPC-Eval includes 118 ICPC problems, a test case generation method, a local evaluation toolkit, and the Refine@K metric for iterative solution repair.

Result: Top-tier LLMs like DeepSeek-R1 require multi-turn feedback for optimal performance but still trail top human teams.

Conclusion: ICPC-Eval highlights the challenges in evaluating complex reasoning and the gap between LLMs and human performance in competitive coding.

Abstract: With the significant progress of large reasoning models in complex coding and
reasoning tasks, existing benchmarks, like LiveCodeBench and CodeElo, are
insufficient to evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) in real competition environments. Moreover, current evaluation metrics
such as Pass@K fail to capture the reflective abilities of reasoning models. To
address these challenges, we propose \textbf{ICPC-Eval}, a top-level
competitive coding benchmark designed to probing the frontiers of LLM
reasoning. ICPC-Eval includes 118 carefully curated problems from 11 recent
ICPC contests held in various regions of the world, offering three key
contributions: 1) A challenging realistic ICPC competition scenario, featuring
a problem type and difficulty distribution consistent with actual contests. 2)
A robust test case generation method and a corresponding local evaluation
toolkit, enabling efficient and accurate local evaluation. 3) An effective
test-time scaling evaluation metric, Refine@K, which allows iterative repair of
solutions based on execution feedback. The results underscore the significant
challenge in evaluating complex reasoning abilities: top-tier reasoning models
like DeepSeek-R1 often rely on multi-turn code feedback to fully unlock their
in-context reasoning potential when compared to non-reasoning counterparts.
Furthermore, despite recent advancements in code generation, these models still
lag behind top-performing human teams. We release the benchmark at:

*Alex Pan,Mary-Anne Williams*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Verbose ListOps is a benchmark designed to test LLMs' nested reasoning by transforming ListOps computations into lengthy stories, revealing their difficulty in state management and filtering distractions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to adequately test LLMs' nested reasoning due to unrealistic distractors or conflated context length and reasoning complexity.

Method: Verbose ListOps programmatically converts ListOps computations into long, coherent narratives, withholding intermediate results to force internal computation and state management.

Result: Leading LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) perform poorly on Verbose ListOps at modest narrative lengths (~10k tokens), despite excelling at raw ListOps.

Conclusion: Verbose ListOps highlights a critical LLM vulnerability in nested reasoning and state management, offering a framework for targeted improvements beyond context expansion.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), whilst great at extracting facts from text,
struggle with nested narrative reasoning. Existing long context and multi-hop
QA benchmarks inadequately test this, lacking realistic distractors or failing
to decouple context length from reasoning complexity, masking a fundamental LLM
limitation. We introduce Verbose ListOps, a novel benchmark that
programmatically transposes ListOps computations into lengthy, coherent
stories. This uniquely forces internal computation and state management of
nested reasoning problems by withholding intermediate results, and offers
fine-grained controls for both narrative size \emph{and} reasoning difficulty.
Whilst benchmarks like LongReason (2025) advance approaches for synthetically
expanding the context size of multi-hop QA problems, Verbose ListOps pinpoints
a specific LLM vulnerability: difficulty in state management for nested
sub-reasoning amongst semantically-relevant, distracting narrative. Our
experiments show that leading LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) collapse
in performance on Verbose ListOps at modest (~10k token) narrative lengths,
despite effortlessly solving raw ListOps equations. Addressing this failure is
paramount for real-world text interpretation which requires identifying key
reasoning points, tracking conceptual intermediate results, and filtering
irrelevant information. Verbose ListOps, and its extensible generation
framework thus enables targeted reasoning enhancements beyond mere
context-window expansion; a critical step to automating the world's knowledge
work.

TL;DR: A hybrid HMM and self-supervised model outperforms fine-tuned multilingual ASR models for low-resource languages, achieving a 32% WER reduction on Scottish Gaelic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenge the belief that fine-tuning multilingual E2E models is the best approach for low-resource languages.

Method: Combine hybrid HMMs with self-supervised models for better data utilization through pre-training and semi-supervised training.

Result: 32% relative WER reduction over fine-tuned Whisper model on Scottish Gaelic.

Conclusion: Hybrid HMMs with self-supervised training offer superior performance for low-resource ASR systems.

Abstract: An effective approach to the development of ASR systems for low-resource
languages is to fine-tune an existing multilingual end-to-end model. When the
original model has been trained on large quantities of data from many
languages, fine-tuning can be effective with limited training data, even when
the language in question was not present in the original training data. The
fine-tuning approach has been encouraged by the availability of public-domain
E2E models and is widely believed to lead to state-of-the-art results. This
paper, however, challenges that belief. We show that an approach combining
hybrid HMMs with self-supervised models can yield substantially better
performance with limited training data. This combination allows better
utilisation of all available speech and text data through continued
self-supervised pre-training and semi-supervised training. We benchmark our
approach on Scottish Gaelic, achieving WER reductions of 32% relative over our
best fine-tuned Whisper model.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores LLMs' effectiveness in providing multilingual instructional feedback for math tasks, showing that language-aligned hints improve learning, especially in low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' ability to provide effective instructional support across diverse languages for math reasoning tasks, which remains understudied.

Method: Simulated tutor-student interactions using LLMs across 11 languages, 4 models, and multiple prompting strategies to evaluate feedback impact.

Result: Multilingual hints significantly boost learning, particularly in low-resource languages when feedback matches the student's native language.

Conclusion: The findings support developing inclusive, multilingual LLM-based educational tools with language-aligned feedback.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate
formative feedback and instructional hints in English, making them increasingly
relevant for AI-assisted education. However, their ability to provide effective
instructional support across different languages, especially for mathematically
grounded reasoning tasks, remains largely unexamined. In this work, we present
the first large-scale simulation of multilingual tutor-student interactions
using LLMs. A stronger model plays the role of the tutor, generating feedback
in the form of hints, while a weaker model simulates the student. We explore
352 experimental settings across 11 typologically diverse languages, four
state-of-the-art LLMs, and multiple prompting strategies to assess whether
language-specific feedback leads to measurable learning gains. Our study
examines how student input language, teacher feedback language, model choice,
and language resource level jointly influence performance. Results show that
multilingual hints can significantly improve learning outcomes, particularly in
low-resource languages when feedback is aligned with the student's native
language. These findings offer practical insights for developing multilingual,
LLM-based educational tools that are both effective and inclusive.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ConECT, a Czech-to-Polish e-commerce dataset, and explores context-aware NMT methods, showing improved translation quality with visual and metadata context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NMT struggles with word ambiguity and context, especially in domain-specific applications like e-commerce, where unclear sentences or poor data quality are common.

Method: The study creates the ConECT dataset (11,400 sentence pairs with images/metadata) and tests vision-language models (VLM) and text-to-text models with contextual info (e.g., category paths, image descriptions).

Result: Incorporating contextual information (visual or metadata) improves translation quality.

Conclusion: Context-aware methods enhance NMT for e-commerce, and the ConECT dataset is made public for further research.

Abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has improved translation by using
Transformer-based models, but it still struggles with word ambiguity and
context. This problem is especially important in domain-specific applications,
which often have problems with unclear sentences or poor data quality. Our
research explores how adding information to models can improve translations in
the context of e-commerce data. To this end we create ConECT -- a new
Czech-to-Polish e-commerce product translation dataset coupled with images and
product metadata consisting of 11,400 sentence pairs. We then investigate and
compare different methods that are applicable to context-aware translation. We
test a vision-language model (VLM), finding that visual context aids
translation quality. Additionally, we explore the incorporation of contextual
information into text-to-text models, such as the product's category path or
image descriptions. The results of our study demonstrate that the incorporation
of contextual information leads to an improvement in the quality of machine
translation. We make the new dataset publicly available.

Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' capabilities on challenging algorithmic problems and explore their educational applications.

Method: Testing multiple LLMs on Romanian and English versions of university-level algorithms exams, analyzing problem-solving, consistency, and multilingual performance.

Result: Recent LLMs match top student scores, excel in reasoning, but face challenges with graph-based tasks. They can generate high-quality educational content.

Conclusion: LLMs hold promise for enhancing algorithm education through problem-solving and content generation, though graph tasks remain a challenge.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of
state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) on challenging university-level

reveals that the most recent models not only achieve scores comparable to
top-performing students but also demonstrate robust reasoning skills on
complex, multi-step algorithmic challenges, even though difficulties remain
with graph-based tasks. Building on these findings, we explore the potential of
LLMs to support educational environments through the generation of high-quality
editorial content, offering instructors a powerful tool to enhance student

TL;DR: A semi-supervised learning pipeline improves ASR fine-tuning by leveraging unlabeled audio and auxiliary labeled data, achieving up to 24.8% relative improvement over single-step fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning pretrained ASR models for specific domains is difficult due to scarce labeled data, but unlabeled audio and related-domain labeled data are often available.

Method: Proposes an incremental semi-supervised pipeline integrating small in-domain labeled data and auxiliary data, with filtering (multi-model consensus or NER) to refine pseudo-labels iteratively.

Result: Achieves 4% improvement with auxiliary data, and up to 22.3% (Wow) and 24.8% (Fisher) relative improvement over single-step fine-tuning. Consensus-based filtering performs best.

Conclusion: The pipeline effectively leverages available data for ASR fine-tuning, with consensus-based filtering outperforming other methods, while NER offers a cost-efficient alternative.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained ASR models for specific domains is challenging when
labeled data is scarce. But unlabeled audio and labeled data from related
domains are often available. We propose an incremental semi-supervised learning
pipeline that first integrates a small in-domain labeled set and an auxiliary
dataset from a closely related domain, achieving a relative improvement of 4%
over no auxiliary data. Filtering based on multi-model consensus or named
entity recognition (NER) is then applied to select and iteratively refine
pseudo-labels, showing slower performance saturation compared to random
selection. Evaluated on the multi-domain Wow call center and Fisher English
corpora, it outperforms single-step fine-tuning. Consensus-based filtering
outperforms other methods, providing up to 22.3% relative improvement on Wow
and 24.8% on Fisher over single-step fine-tuning with random selection. NER is
the second-best filter, providing competitive performance at a lower

*Yongjie Xiao,Hongru Liang,Peixin Qin,Yao Zhang,Wenqiang Lei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SCOP evaluates LLMs' comprehension skills from a cognitive perspective, revealing gaps in expert-level performance and unreliable reasoning processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLMs' comprehension aligns with expert processes and identify areas for improvement.

Method: SCOP defines five comprehension skills, constructs testing data, and analyzes open- and closed-source LLMs.

Result: LLMs struggle with expert-level comprehension, show biases (e.g., local vs. global info), and sometimes reach correct answers via flawed reasoning.

Conclusion: Improving LLMs requires focusing on the comprehension process and ensuring all skills are developed during training.

Abstract: Despite the great potential of large language models(LLMs) in machine
comprehension, it is still disturbing to fully count on them in real-world
scenarios. This is probably because there is no rational explanation for
whether the comprehension process of LLMs is aligned with that of experts. In
this paper, we propose SCOP to carefully examine how LLMs perform during the
comprehension process from a cognitive view. Specifically, it is equipped with
a systematical definition of five requisite skills during the comprehension
process, a strict framework to construct testing data for these skills, and a
detailed analysis of advanced open-sourced and closed-sourced LLMs using the
testing data. With SCOP, we find that it is still challenging for LLMs to
perform an expert-level comprehension process. Even so, we notice that LLMs
share some similarities with experts, e.g., performing better at comprehending
local information than global information. Further analysis reveals that LLMs
can be somewhat unreliable -- they might reach correct answers through flawed
comprehension processes. Based on SCOP, we suggest that one direction for
improving LLMs is to focus more on the comprehension process, ensuring all
comprehension skills are thoroughly developed during training.

*Zeno Belligoli,Emmanouil Stergiadis,Eran Fainman,Ilya Gusev*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A simple method to control text length in summaries by adjusting EOS token prediction in loss computation, compatible with various models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for controlling text length in summaries are complex and incompatible with pre-trained models.

Method: Increase the importance of predicting the EOS token in cross-entropy loss, making it model-agnostic.

Result: Effective length control in summaries without compromising quality, tested on encoder-decoder and GPT-style models.

Conclusion: The proposed method is simple, versatile, and maintains summary quality while controlling length.

Abstract: Controlling the length of generated text can be crucial in various
text-generation tasks, including summarization. Existing methods often require
complex model alterations, limiting compatibility with pre-trained models. We
address these limitations by developing a simple approach for controlling the
length of automatic text summaries by increasing the importance of correctly
predicting the EOS token in the cross-entropy loss computation. The proposed
methodology is agnostic to architecture and decoding algorithms and orthogonal
to other inference-time techniques to control the generation length. We tested
it with encoder-decoder and modern GPT-style LLMs, and show that this method
can control generation length, often without affecting the quality of the
summary.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AR-Checker is a framework for testing LLM robustness by generating semantic-preserving mathematical problem variants, minimizing data contamination risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address LLM robustness issues in simple reasoning tasks by avoiding hand-crafted templates and limited perturbation rules.

Method: Uses multi-round parallel streams of LLM-based rewriting and verification to generate problem variants.

Result: Strong performance on GSM8K, MATH-500, MMLU, MMLU-Pro, and CommonsenseQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: AR-Checker effectively evaluates LLM robustness across diverse tasks, proving its versatility.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved distinguished performance on
various reasoning-intensive tasks. However, LLMs might still face the
challenges of robustness issues and fail unexpectedly in some simple reasoning
tasks. Previous works evaluate the LLM robustness with hand-crafted templates
or a limited set of perturbation rules, indicating potential data contamination
in pre-training or fine-tuning datasets. In this work, inspired by stress
testing in software engineering, we propose a novel framework, Automatic
Robustness Checker (AR-Checker), to generate mathematical problem variants that
maintain the semantic meanings of the original one but might fail the LLMs. The
AR-Checker framework generates mathematical problem variants through
multi-round parallel streams of LLM-based rewriting and verification. Our
framework can generate benchmark variants dynamically for each LLM, thus
minimizing the risk of data contamination. Experiments on GSM8K and MATH-500
demonstrate the strong performance of AR-Checker on mathematical tasks. We also
evaluate AR-Checker on benchmarks beyond mathematics, including MMLU, MMLU-Pro,
and CommonsenseQA, where it also achieves strong performance, further proving
the effectiveness of AR-Checker.

TL;DR: TALL enhances LLM performance for low-resource languages by integrating bilingual translation models and lightweight adapters, improving Hebrew tasks significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs underperform in low-resource languages due to limited training data, necessitating innovative solutions like TALL.

Method: TALL combines an LLM with bilingual translation models, using dimension alignment and custom transformers to process low-resource inputs efficiently.

Result: Experiments on Hebrew show TALL outperforms baselines like direct use, naive translation, and fine-tuning.

Conclusion: TALL offers a parameter-efficient, effective solution for enhancing LLMs in low-resource languages.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in high-resource languages but struggle
with low-resource languages due to limited training data. This paper presents
TALL (Trainable Architecture for Enhancing LLM Performance in Low-Resource
Languages), which integrates an LLM with two bilingual translation models. TALL
transforms low-resource inputs into high-resource representations, leveraging
the LLM's capabilities while preserving linguistic features through dimension
alignment layers and custom transformers. Our experiments on Hebrew demonstrate
significant improvements over several baselines, including direct use, naive
translation, and fine-tuning approaches. The architecture employs a
parameter-efficient strategy, freezing pre-trained components while training
only lightweight adapter modules, balancing computational efficiency with
performance gains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Debate Speech Evaluation as a benchmark for LLMs, analyzing their performance against human judges in evaluating debate speeches, revealing nuanced differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' cognitive abilities in evaluating debate speeches, a task requiring deep understanding of argument strength, coherence, style, and tone.

Method: Leveraging a dataset of 600 annotated debate speeches, the study compares state-of-the-art LLMs to human judges and evaluates LLMs' ability to generate persuasive speeches.

Result: Larger LLMs approximate human judgments in some aspects but differ overall; frontier LLMs can generate human-level persuasive speeches.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential and limitations of LLMs in debate speech evaluation and generation, suggesting further exploration of their cognitive capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce Debate Speech Evaluation as a novel and challenging benchmark
for assessing LLM judges. Evaluating debate speeches requires a deep
understanding of the speech at multiple levels, including argument strength and
relevance, the coherence and organization of the speech, the appropriateness of
its style and tone, and so on. This task involves a unique set of cognitive
abilities that have previously received limited attention in systematic LLM
benchmarking. To explore such skills, we leverage a dataset of over 600
meticulously annotated debate speeches and present the first in-depth analysis
of how state-of-the-art LLMs compare to human judges on this task. Our findings
reveal a nuanced picture: while larger models can approximate individual human
judgments in some respects, they differ substantially in their overall judgment
behavior. We also investigate the ability of frontier LLMs to generate
persuasive, opinionated speeches, showing that models may perform at a human
level on this task.

### [163] [Does It Make Sense to Speak of Introspection in Large Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05068)
*Iulia Comşa,Murray Shanahan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines whether LLMs' self-reports can be considered introspection, analyzing two examples: one invalid (creative writing) and one valid (temperature parameter inference).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how to interpret LLMs' self-reports and assess if introspection applies to them, given their linguistic and cognitive abilities.

Method: Critique of two LLM self-report examples: one on creative writing (invalid) and one on inferring its temperature parameter (valid).

Result: The creative writing example lacks introspection, while the temperature parameter inference qualifies as minimal introspection without consciousness.

Conclusion: Introspection can apply to LLMs in limited cases, but without implying consciousness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit compelling linguistic behaviour, and
sometimes offer self-reports, that is to say statements about their own nature,
inner workings, or behaviour. In humans, such reports are often attributed to a
faculty of introspection and are typically linked to consciousness. This raises
the question of how to interpret self-reports produced by LLMs, given their
increasing linguistic fluency and cognitive capabilities. To what extent (if
any) can the concept of introspection be meaningfully applied to LLMs? Here, we
present and critique two examples of apparent introspective self-report from
LLMs. In the first example, an LLM attempts to describe the process behind its
own ``creative'' writing, and we argue this is not a valid example of
introspection. In the second example, an LLM correctly infers the value of its
own temperature parameter, and we argue that this can be legitimately
considered a minimal example of introspection, albeit one that is (presumably)
not accompanied by conscious experience.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates poor performance of LLMs with RLHF in colloquial subtitle translation, attributing it to reward model divergence, and proposes RIVAL, an adversarial training framework to improve results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The unexpected poor performance of LLMs combined with RLHF in colloquial subtitle translation tasks motivated the study. The divergence between the offline reward model and the online LLM was identified as the root cause.

Method: The authors propose RIVAL, an adversarial training framework where the reward model and LLM engage in a min-max game. The reward model is trained to distinguish strong from weak translations, while the LLM improves its translations to bridge the gap. Quantitative preference rewards (e.g., BLEU) are also incorporated for stability.

Result: Extensive experiments show that RIVAL significantly improves translation performance compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The adversarial training framework RIVAL effectively addresses the divergence issue and enhances translation quality in colloquial subtitle tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess strong multilingual capabilities, and
combining Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with translation
tasks has shown great potential. However, we observe that this paradigm
performs unexpectedly poorly when applied to colloquial subtitle translation
tasks. In this work, we investigate this issue and find that the offline reward
model (RM) gradually diverges from the online LLM due to distributional shift,
ultimately leading to undesirable training outcomes. To address this, we
propose RIVAL, an adversarial training framework that formulates the process as
a min-max game between the RM and the LLM. RIVAL iteratively updates the both
models, with the RM trained to distinguish strong from weak translations
(qualitative preference reward), and the LLM trained to enhance its translation
for closing this gap. To stabilize training and improve generalizability, we
also incorporate quantitative preference reward (e.g., BLEU) into the RM,
enabling reference-free quality modeling aligned with human evaluation. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed adversarial training
framework significantly improves upon translation baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CESM-100 and SHINES to improve self-harm detection on social media by leveraging nuanced emoji-language interplay, fine-tuning LLMs, and providing explainable predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of self-harm intent on social media is crucial for suicide prevention, but current LLMs struggle with implicit cues in casual language and emojis.

Method: The framework uses CESM-100 to enrich inputs, fine-tunes LLMs for multi-task learning (self-harm detection and intent span detection), and generates explainable rationales.

Result: The approach significantly improves LLM performance in detection and explanation tasks, addressing ambiguity in self-harm signals.

Conclusion: The SHINES dataset, CESM-100, and framework enhance LLM comprehension of self-harm, aiding timely intervention.

Abstract: Self-harm detection on social media is critical for early intervention and
mental health support, yet remains challenging due to the subtle,
context-dependent nature of such expressions. Identifying self-harm intent aids
suicide prevention by enabling timely responses, but current large language
models (LLMs) struggle to interpret implicit cues in casual language and
emojis. This work enhances LLMs' comprehension of self-harm by distinguishing
intent through nuanced language-emoji interplay. We present the Centennial
Emoji Sensitivity Matrix (CESM-100), a curated set of 100 emojis with
contextual self-harm interpretations and the Self-Harm Identification aNd
intent Extraction with Supportive emoji sensitivity (SHINES) dataset, offering
detailed annotations for self-harm labels, casual mentions (CMs), and serious
intents (SIs). Our unified framework: a) enriches inputs using CESM-100; b)
fine-tunes LLMs for multi-task learning: self-harm detection (primary) and
CM/SI span detection (auxiliary); c) generates explainable rationales for
self-harm predictions. We evaluate the framework on three state-of-the-art
LLMs-Llama 3, Mental-Alpaca, and MentalLlama, across zero-shot, few-shot, and
fine-tuned scenarios. By coupling intent differentiation with contextual cues,
our approach commendably enhances LLM performance in both detection and
explanation tasks, effectively addressing the inherent ambiguity in self-harm
signals. The SHINES dataset, CESM-100 and codebase are publicly available at:

TL;DR: The study explores how street-level features like vehicle density, greenery, and cleanliness impact retail performance and user satisfaction in Harbin, China, using AI-assisted analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the complex interactions between urban street features and commercial vitality, aiding in better urban design and planning.

Method: An image-based framework using street view imagery and AI models (VisualGLM-6B, GPT-4) to analyze spatial attributes and construct a Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI).

Result: Moderate vehicle presence aids commerce, but excessive parking harms walkability. Greenery and cleanliness boost satisfaction but weakly affect pricing. Street width moderates vehicle impacts.

Conclusion: AI-assisted urban analysis reveals non-linear drivers of commercial success, offering insights for urban design, parking management, and scalable planning tools.

Abstract: The commercial vitality of community-scale streets in Chinese cities is
shaped by complex interactions between vehicular accessibility, environmental
quality, and pedestrian perception. This study proposes an interpretable,
image-based framework to examine how street-level features -- including parked
vehicle density, greenery, cleanliness, and street width -- impact retail
performance and user satisfaction in Harbin, China. Leveraging street view
imagery and a multimodal large language model (VisualGLM-6B), we construct a
Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI) from Meituan and Dianping data and
analyze its relationship with spatial attributes extracted via GPT-4-based
perception modeling. Our findings reveal that while moderate vehicle presence
may enhance commercial access, excessive on-street parking -- especially in
narrow streets -- erodes walkability and reduces both satisfaction and
shop-level pricing. In contrast, streets with higher perceived greenery and
cleanliness show significantly greater satisfaction scores but only weak
associations with pricing. Street width moderates the effects of vehicle
presence, underscoring the importance of spatial configuration. These results
demonstrate the value of integrating AI-assisted perception with urban
morphological analysis to capture non-linear and context-sensitive drivers of
commercial success. This study advances both theoretical and methodological
frontiers by highlighting the conditional role of vehicle activity in
neighborhood commerce and demonstrating the feasibility of multimodal AI for
perceptual urban diagnostics. The implications extend to urban design, parking
management, and scalable planning tools for community revitalization.

TL;DR: The paper proposes CL-ISR, a framework combining contrastive learning and implicit stance reasoning, to enhance misleading text detection on social media.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misleading texts on social media cause public misunderstanding, panic, and economic losses, necessitating improved detection methods.

Method: CL-ISR uses contrastive learning for semantic differentiation and implicit stance reasoning to analyze stance tendencies and topic relationships.

Result: The framework improves detection accuracy by effectively capturing distinguishing features and implicit textual information.

Conclusion: CL-ISR significantly enhances misleading text detection by integrating contrastive learning and stance reasoning.

Abstract: Misleading text detection on social media platforms is a critical research
area, as these texts can lead to public misunderstanding, social panic and even
economic losses. This paper proposes a novel framework - CL-ISR (Contrastive
Learning and Implicit Stance Reasoning), which combines contrastive learning
and implicit stance reasoning, to improve the detection accuracy of misleading
texts on social media. First, we use the contrastive learning algorithm to
improve the model's learning ability of semantic differences between truthful
and misleading texts. Contrastive learning could help the model to better
capture the distinguishing features between different categories by
constructing positive and negative sample pairs. This approach enables the
model to capture distinguishing features more effectively, particularly in
linguistically complicated situations. Second, we introduce the implicit stance
reasoning module, to explore the potential stance tendencies in the text and
their relationships with related topics. This method is effective for
identifying content that misleads through stance shifting or emotional
manipulation, because it can capture the implicit information behind the text.
Finally, we integrate these two algorithms together to form a new framework,
CL-ISR, which leverages the discriminative power of contrastive learning and
the interpretive depth of stance reasoning to significantly improve detection
effect.

TL;DR: A system integrating W2V and Phi-4 MLLM improves spoken language assessment by addressing modality-specific limitations of BERT and W2V, achieving competitive RMSE scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BERT and W2V have limitations in SLA—BERT misses prosodic/phonetic cues, while W2V lacks semantic interpretability. A combined approach is needed.

Method: Proposed system integrates W2V with Phi-4 MLLM using score fusion to leverage both acoustic and semantic features.

Result: Achieved RMSE of 0.375, securing second place in the Speak & Improve Challenge 2025.

Conclusion: The fusion of W2V and Phi-4 MLLM effectively addresses modality gaps, enhancing SLA performance.

Abstract: A recent line of research on spoken language assessment (SLA) employs neural
models such as BERT and wav2vec 2.0 (W2V) to evaluate speaking proficiency
across linguistic and acoustic modalities. Although both models effectively
capture features relevant to oral competence, each exhibits modality-specific
limitations. BERT-based methods rely on ASR transcripts, which often fail to
capture prosodic and phonetic cues for SLA. In contrast, W2V-based methods
excel at modeling acoustic features but lack semantic interpretability. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a system that integrates W2V with Phi-4
multimodal large language model (MLLM) through a score fusion strategy. The
proposed system achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.375 on the
official test set of the Speak & Improve Challenge 2025, securing second place
in the competition. For comparison, the RMSEs of the top-ranked, third-ranked,
and official baseline systems are 0.364, 0.384, and 0.444, respectively.

*Tanmay Parekh,Kartik Mehta,Ninareh Mehrabi,Kai-Wei Chang,Nanyun Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiCoRe, a divergent-convergent reasoning framework, improves zero-shot event detection by combining open-ended discovery (Dreamer) and task-aligned reasoning (Grounder), outperforming baselines by 4-7% F1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot event detection is challenging for LLMs due to complex event ontologies and domain-specific triggers. DiCoRe addresses this by decoupling the task into divergent and convergent reasoning.

Method: DiCoRe uses Dreamer for open-ended event discovery (divergent reasoning) and Grounder for task-aligned structured predictions (convergent reasoning), with LLM-Judge for verification.

Result: DiCoRe outperforms baselines on six datasets across five domains, achieving 4-7% average F1 gains.

Conclusion: DiCoRe is a robust zero-shot event detection framework, enhancing LLM utility through divergent-convergent reasoning.

Abstract: Zero-shot Event Detection (ED), the task of identifying event mentions in
natural language text without any training data, is critical for document
understanding in specialized domains. Understanding the complex event ontology,
extracting domain-specific triggers from the passage, and structuring them
appropriately overloads and limits the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs)
for zero-shot ED. To this end, we propose DiCoRe, a divergent-convergent
reasoning framework that decouples the task of ED using Dreamer and Grounder.
Dreamer encourages divergent reasoning through open-ended event discovery,
which helps to boost event coverage. Conversely, Grounder introduces convergent
reasoning to align the free-form predictions with the task-specific
instructions using finite-state machine guided constrained decoding.
Additionally, an LLM-Judge verifies the final outputs to ensure high precision.
Through extensive experiments on six datasets across five domains and nine
LLMs, we demonstrate how DiCoRe consistently outperforms prior zero-shot,
transfer-learning, and reasoning baselines, achieving 4-7% average F1 gains
over the best baseline -- establishing DiCoRe as a strong zero-shot ED
framework.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to study inductive biases in neural language models (LMs) using $m$-local entropy, showing that higher entropy languages are harder for LMs to learn, aligning with human-like sensitivity to local statistical structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether neural LMs' inductive biases align with human processing constraints by investigating how they generalize from finite data.

Method: Introduces $m$-local entropy, an information-theoretic measure, to quantify local uncertainty in languages. Tests on perturbed natural language corpora and PFSA-defined languages using Transformer and LSTM LMs.

Result: Higher $m$-local entropy languages are more difficult for LMs to learn, indicating sensitivity to local statistical structure.

Conclusion: Neural LMs exhibit human-like sensitivity to local statistical structure, suggesting alignment in inductive biases.

Abstract: Inductive biases are inherent in every machine learning system, shaping how
models generalize from finite data. In the case of neural language models
(LMs), debates persist as to whether these biases align with or diverge from
human processing constraints. To address this issue, we propose a quantitative
framework that allows for controlled investigations into the nature of these
biases. Within our framework, we introduce $m$-local entropy$\unicode{x2013}$an
information-theoretic measure derived from average lossy-context
surprisal$\unicode{x2013}$that captures the local uncertainty of a language by
quantifying how effectively the $m-1$ preceding symbols disambiguate the next
symbol. In experiments on both perturbed natural language corpora and languages
defined by probabilistic finite-state automata (PFSAs), we show that languages
with higher $m$-local entropy are more difficult for Transformer and LSTM LMs
to learn. These results suggest that neural LMs, much like humans, are highly
sensitive to the local statistical structure of a language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve the internal mechanisms of LALMs by studying how they perceive and recognize auditory attributes.

Method: Applied vocabulary projection on three state-of-the-art LALMs to track attribute information evolution across layers and token positions.

Result: Found that attribute information decreases with layer depth during recognition failures, and early layer resolution correlates with accuracy. LALMs rely on querying inputs rather than aggregating hidden states.

Conclusion: Provides insights into auditory attribute processing and demonstrates a method to enhance LALMs, guiding future improvements.

Abstract: Understanding the internal mechanisms of large audio-language models (LALMs)
is crucial for interpreting their behavior and improving performance. This work
presents the first in-depth analysis of how LALMs internally perceive and
recognize auditory attributes. By applying vocabulary projection on three
state-of-the-art LALMs, we track how attribute information evolves across
layers and token positions. We find that attribute information generally
decreases with layer depth when recognition fails, and that resolving
attributes at earlier layers correlates with better accuracy. Moreover, LALMs
heavily rely on querying auditory inputs for predicting attributes instead of
aggregating necessary information in hidden states at attribute-mentioning
positions. Based on our findings, we demonstrate a method to enhance LALMs. Our
results offer insights into auditory attribute processing, paving the way for
future improvements.

*Diege Sun,Guanyi Chen,Fan Zhao,Xiaorong Cheng,Tingting He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs as evaluators struggle to match human judgments of error severity in image descriptions, with discrepancies in assessing gender and color errors. Only Doubao and DeepSeek-V3 show partial alignment with human rankings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs can accurately replicate human judgments of error severity in natural language generation, particularly in image descriptions.

Method: Extended van Miltenburg et al.'s framework to unimodal and multimodal settings, evaluating four error types (age, gender, clothing type, color) with human and LLM assessments.

Result: Humans vary severity by error type, with visual context amplifying severity for color and type errors. Most LLMs misjudge gender and color errors, except Doubao and DeepSeek-V3, which align better with human judgments.

Conclusion: LLMs may internalize social norms for gender judgments but lack perceptual grounding for color sensitivity. DeepSeek-V3, despite being unimodal, outperforms multimodal models in aligning with human judgments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated evaluators in
natural language generation, yet it remains unclear whether they can accurately
replicate human judgments of error severity. In this study, we systematically
compare human and LLM assessments of image descriptions containing controlled
semantic errors. We extend the experimental framework of van Miltenburg et al.
(2020) to both unimodal (text-only) and multimodal (text + image) settings,
evaluating four error types: age, gender, clothing type, and clothing colour.
Our findings reveal that humans assign varying levels of severity to different
error types, with visual context significantly amplifying perceived severity
for colour and type errors. Notably, most LLMs assign low scores to gender
errors but disproportionately high scores to colour errors, unlike humans, who
judge both as highly severe but for different reasons. This suggests that these
models may have internalised social norms influencing gender judgments but lack
the perceptual grounding to emulate human sensitivity to colour, which is
shaped by distinct neural mechanisms. Only one of the evaluated LLMs, Doubao,
replicates the human-like ranking of error severity, but it fails to
distinguish between error types as clearly as humans. Surprisingly,
DeepSeek-V3, a unimodal LLM, achieves the highest alignment with human
judgments across both unimodal and multimodal conditions, outperforming even
state-of-the-art multimodal models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Knowledgeable-r1 improves RAG by balancing parametric and contextual knowledge, enhancing robustness and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems over-rely on retrieved contexts, risking inaccuracies and underusing the model's inherent knowledge.

Method: Proposes Knowledgeable-r1 with joint sampling and multi-policy distributions to integrate parametric and contextual knowledge.

Result: Significantly boosts robustness and reasoning accuracy, outperforming baselines by 17.07% in counterfactual scenarios.

Conclusion: Knowledgeable-r1 effectively balances knowledge utilization, improving RAG performance.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a mainstream method for improving
performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. However,current RAG systems often
place too much emphasis on retrieved contexts. This can lead to reliance on
inaccurate sources and overlook the model's inherent knowledge, especially when
dealing with misleading or excessive information. To resolve this imbalance, we
propose Knowledgeable-r1 that using joint sampling and define multi policy
distributions in knowledge capability exploration to stimulate large language
models'self-integrated utilization of parametric and contextual knowledge.
Experiments show that Knowledgeable-r1 significantly enhances robustness and
reasoning accuracy in both parameters and contextual conflict tasks and general
RAG tasks, especially outperforming baselines by 17.07% in counterfactual
scenarios and demonstrating consistent gains across RAG tasks. Our code are

*Bhavik Chandna,Zubair Bashir,Procheta Sen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how social, demographic, and gender biases are structurally represented in LLMs like GPT-2 and Llama2, identifying localized components responsible for biased behavior and showing their impact on other NLP tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate biases in LLMs by examining their structural representation and effects on model performance.

Method: Uses mechanistic interpretability to identify bias-related edges, assesses their stability and localization, and performs systematic ablations to study their impact.

Result: Bias-related computations are highly localized in specific layers and affect other NLP tasks when removed.

Conclusion: Bias mitigation in LLMs requires careful consideration due to shared components with other tasks, highlighting the need for targeted interventions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to exhibit social, demographic, and
gender biases, often as a consequence of the data on which they are trained. In
this work, we adopt a mechanistic interpretability approach to analyze how such
biases are structurally represented within models such as GPT-2 and Llama2.
Focusing on demographic and gender biases, we explore different metrics to
identify the internal edges responsible for biased behavior. We then assess the
stability, localization, and generalizability of these components across
dataset and linguistic variations. Through systematic ablations, we demonstrate
that bias-related computations are highly localized, often concentrated in a
small subset of layers. Moreover, the identified components change across
fine-tuning settings, including those unrelated to bias. Finally, we show that
removing these components not only reduces biased outputs but also affects
other NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition and linguistic acceptability
judgment because of the sharing of important components with these tasks.

*Yeonseok Jeong,Jinsu Kim,Dohyeon Lee,Seung-won Hwang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ECoRAG is a framework that improves LLM performance in ODQA by compressing retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring answer generation is supported by correct evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior compression methods in RAG do not filter non-evidential information, limiting LLM performance.

Method: ECoRAG compresses documents based on evidentiality and retrieves more if evidence is insufficient.

Result: ECoRAG outperforms existing methods in ODQA tasks, reducing latency and token usage.

Conclusion: ECoRAG enhances LLM performance efficiently by focusing on evidentiality in RAG.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in Open-Domain
Question Answering (ODQA) by leveraging external documents through
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To reduce RAG overhead, from longer
context, context compression is necessary. However, prior compression methods
do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, which limit the
performance in LLM-based RAG. We thus propose Evidentiality-guided RAG, or
\textbf{ECoRAG} framework. ECoRAG improves LLM performance by compressing
retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring whether answer generation
is supported by the correct evidence. As an additional step, ECoRAG reflects
whether the compressed content provides sufficient evidence, and if not,
retrieves more until sufficient. Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM
performance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods.
Furthermore, ECoRAG is highly cost-efficient, as it not only reduces latency
but also minimizes token usage by retaining only the necessary information to
generate the correct answer. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance text embedding and reranking capabilities by leveraging Qwen3 LLMs' multilingual understanding and generation strengths.

Method: Multi-stage training pipeline combining unsupervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning, with model merging for robustness. Qwen3 LLMs synthesize diverse training data.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art on benchmarks like MTEB and excels in retrieval tasks (code, cross-lingual, multilingual).

Conclusion: The Qwen3 Embedding series offers versatile, high-performance models for diverse deployment needs, publicly available under Apache 2.0.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Qwen3 Embedding series, a significant
advancement over its predecessor, the GTE-Qwen series, in text embedding and
reranking capabilities, built upon the Qwen3 foundation models. Leveraging the
Qwen3 LLMs' robust capabilities in multilingual text understanding and
generation, our innovative multi-stage training pipeline combines large-scale
unsupervised pre-training with supervised fine-tuning on high-quality datasets.
Effective model merging strategies further ensure the robustness and
adaptability of the Qwen3 Embedding series. During the training process, the
Qwen3 LLMs serve not only as backbone models but also play a crucial role in
synthesizing high-quality, rich, and diverse training data across multiple
domains and languages, thus enhancing the training pipeline. The Qwen3
Embedding series offers a spectrum of model sizes (0.6B, 4B, 8B) for both
embedding and reranking tasks, addressing diverse deployment scenarios where
users can optimize for either efficiency or effectiveness. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that the Qwen3 Embedding series achieves
state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks. Notably, it excels on the
multilingual evaluation benchmark MTEB for text embedding, as well as in
various retrieval tasks, including code retrieval, cross-lingual retrieval and
multilingual retrieval. To facilitate reproducibility and promote
community-driven research and development, the Qwen3 Embedding models are
publicly available under the Apache 2.0 license.

TL;DR: The paper explores in-context counterfactual reasoning in large-scale neural language models, using a synthetic linear regression task to demonstrate their ability to infer and copy contextual noise for accurate predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how language models perform counterfactual reasoning without parameter updates, focusing on noise abduction in a controlled setup.

Method: A synthetic linear regression task requiring noise abduction, analyzed using Transformers to study the role of self-attention, model depth, and pre-training data diversity.

Result: Language models can perform counterfactual reasoning in the synthetic setup, with performance driven by self-attention, model depth, and data diversity. The findings also extend to sequential data, hinting at potential for counterfactual story generation.

Conclusion: Transformers are capable of counterfactual reasoning in controlled tasks, with broader implications for applications like story generation.

Abstract: Large-scale neural language models (LMs) exhibit remarkable performance in
in-context learning: the ability to learn and reason the input context on the
fly without parameter update. This work studies in-context counterfactual
reasoning in language models, that is, to predict the consequences of changes
under hypothetical scenarios. We focus on studying a well-defined synthetic
setup: a linear regression task that requires noise abduction, where accurate
prediction is based on inferring and copying the contextual noise from factual
observations. We show that language models are capable of counterfactual
reasoning in this controlled setup and provide insights that counterfactual
reasoning for a broad class of functions can be reduced to a transformation on
in-context observations; we find self-attention, model depth, and data
diversity in pre-training drive performance in Transformers. More
interestingly, our findings extend beyond regression tasks and show that
Transformers can perform noise abduction on sequential data, providing
preliminary evidence on the potential for counterfactual story generation. Our

*Jackson Petty,Michael Y. Hu,Wentao Wang,Shauli Ravfogel,William Merrill,Tal Linzen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The RELIC framework evaluates LLMs' instruction-following ability using language recognition, showing near-chance performance on complex tasks and reliance on heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' ability to follow instructions without input-output examples, using synthetic languages to avoid data contamination.

Method: Introduces RELIC, a framework for evaluating instruction following via language recognition (determining if a string is generated by formal grammar).

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs perform near-chance on complex grammars, with accuracy predictable from grammar and string complexity.

Conclusion: LLMs struggle with complex instruction following, resorting to heuristics as task difficulty increases.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to perform tasks based
only on a specification of the task provided in context, without examples of
inputs and outputs; this ability is referred to as instruction following. We
introduce the Recognition of Languages In-Context (RELIC) framework to evaluate
instruction following using language recognition: the task of determining if a
string is generated by formal grammar. Unlike many standard evaluations of
LLMs' ability to use their context, this task requires composing together a
large number of instructions (grammar productions) retrieved from the context.
Because the languages are synthetic, the task can be increased in complexity as
LLMs' skills improve, and new instances can be automatically generated,
mitigating data contamination. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on RELIC and
find that their accuracy can be reliably predicted from the complexity of the
grammar and the individual example strings, and that even the most advanced
LLMs currently available show near-chance performance on more complex grammars
and samples, in line with theoretical expectations. We also use RELIC to
diagnose how LLMs attempt to solve increasingly difficult reasoning tasks,
finding that as the complexity of the language recognition task increases,
models switch to relying on shallow heuristics instead of following complex
instructions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Common Pile v0.1, an 8TB openly licensed text dataset for LLM pretraining, and validates its quality by training competitive 7B parameter models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address ethical and legal concerns of using unlicensed text for LLM training by providing a high-quality, openly licensed alternative.

Method: Collect, curate, and release the Common Pile v0.1 from 30 diverse sources, then train two 7B parameter LLMs (Comma v0.1-1T and v0.1-2T) on subsets of the dataset.

Result: The trained models achieve performance comparable to LLMs like Llama 1 and 2 7B, which use unlicensed text.

Conclusion: The Common Pile v0.1 is a viable, ethically sound alternative for LLM pretraining, with released data, code, and model checkpoints to support further research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on enormous quantities of
unlicensed text, a practice that has led to scrutiny due to possible
intellectual property infringement and ethical concerns. Training LLMs on
openly licensed text presents a first step towards addressing these issues, but
prior data collection efforts have yielded datasets too small or low-quality to
produce performant LLMs. To address this gap, we collect, curate, and release
the Common Pile v0.1, an eight terabyte collection of openly licensed text
designed for LLM pretraining. The Common Pile comprises content from 30 sources
that span diverse domains including research papers, code, books,
encyclopedias, educational materials, audio transcripts, and more. Crucially,
we validate our efforts by training two 7 billion parameter LLMs on text from
the Common Pile: Comma v0.1-1T and Comma v0.1-2T, trained on 1 and 2 trillion
tokens respectively. Both models attain competitive performance to LLMs trained
on unlicensed text with similar computational budgets, such as Llama 1 and 2
7B. In addition to releasing the Common Pile v0.1 itself, we also release the
code used in its creation as well as the training mixture and checkpoints for
the Comma v0.1 models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Self-supervised auxiliary tasks improve morphological inflection in low-resource languages, with autoencoding and CMLM being most effective depending on data availability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scarcity of labeled data for many languages by exploring self-supervised objectives for character-level tasks like morphological inflection.

Method: Training encoder-decoder transformers for 19 languages using 13 auxiliary self-supervised tasks, comparing autoencoding and CMLM.

Result: Autoencoding works best with very limited data, while CMLM excels as data increases. Masking based on morpheme boundaries consistently improves performance.

Conclusion: Self-supervised tasks, especially CMLM with morpheme-aware masking, are promising for low-resource morphological modeling.

Abstract: Self-supervised objectives have driven major advances in NLP by leveraging
large-scale unlabeled data, but such resources are scarce for many of the
world's languages. Surprisingly, they have not been explored much for
character-level tasks, where smaller amounts of data have the potential to be
beneficial. We investigate the effectiveness of self-supervised auxiliary tasks
for morphological inflection -- a character-level task highly relevant for
language documentation -- in extremely low-resource settings, training
encoder-decoder transformers for 19 languages and 13 auxiliary objectives.
Autoencoding yields the best performance when unlabeled data is very limited,
while character masked language modeling (CMLM) becomes more effective as data
availability increases. Though objectives with stronger inductive biases
influence model predictions intuitively, they rarely outperform standard CMLM.
However, sampling masks based on known morpheme boundaries consistently
improves performance, highlighting a promising direction for low-resource
morphological modeling.

*Ratna Kandala,Prakash Mondal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified system for analyzing syntactic discontinuity and continuity in natural languages using Phrase Structure Grammar, Dependency Grammar, and Categorial Grammar.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a unified approach for analyzing discontinuous structures across different linguistic frameworks.

Method: Combines Phrase Structure Grammar (constituency), Dependency Grammar (head-dependent relations), and Categorial Grammar (functor-argument relations) into a unified mathematical derivation.

Result: Demonstrates that both discontinuous and continuous structures can be analyzed through this unified system.

Conclusion: Provides a cohesive framework for analyzing syntactic discontinuity and continuity, bridging gaps between existing formalisms.

Abstract: Syntactic discontinuity is a grammatical phenomenon in which a constituent is
split into more than one part because of the insertion of an element which is
not part of the constituent. This is observed in many languages across the
world such as Turkish, Russian, Japanese, Warlpiri, Navajo, Hopi, Dyirbal,
Yidiny etc. Different formalisms/frameworks in current linguistic theory
approach the problem of discontinuous structures in different ways. Each
framework/formalism has widely been viewed as an independent and non-converging
system of analysis. In this paper, we propose a unified system of
representation for both continuity and discontinuity in structures of natural
languages by taking into account three formalisms, in particular, Phrase
Structure Grammar (PSG) for its widely used notion of constituency, Dependency
Grammar (DG) for its head-dependent relations, and Categorial Grammar (CG) for
its focus on functor-argument relations. We attempt to show that discontinuous
expressions as well as continuous structures can be analysed through a unified
mathematical derivation incorporating the representations of linguistic
structure in these three grammar formalisms.

*Ron Eliav,Arie Cattan,Eran Hirsch,Shahaf Bassan,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal,Ido Dagan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a guided reasoning framework for hallucination detection using LLMs, improving accuracy by decomposing text and verifying sub-claims.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NLI-based hallucination detection lacks fine-grained reasoning, which could enhance accuracy.

Method: A 3-step reasoning process: claim decomposition, sub-claim attribution, and aggregated classification.

Result: Guided reasoning improves hallucination detection performance.

Conclusion: Systematic reasoning enhances LLM-based hallucination detection, supported by empirical metrics.

Abstract: A common approach to hallucination detection casts it as a natural language
inference (NLI) task, often using LLMs to classify whether the generated text
is entailed by corresponding reference texts. Since entailment classification
is a complex reasoning task, one would expect that LLMs could benefit from
generating an explicit reasoning process, as in CoT reasoning or the explicit
``thinking'' of recent reasoning models. In this work, we propose that guiding
such models to perform a systematic and comprehensive reasoning process -- one
that both decomposes the text into smaller facts and also finds evidence in the
source for each fact -- allows models to execute much finer-grained and
accurate entailment decisions, leading to increased performance. To that end,
we define a 3-step reasoning process, consisting of (i) claim decomposition,
(ii) sub-claim attribution and entailment classification, and (iii) aggregated
classification, showing that such guided reasoning indeed yields improved
hallucination detection. Following this reasoning framework, we introduce an
analysis scheme, consisting of several metrics that measure the quality of the
intermediate reasoning steps, which provided additional empirical evidence for
the improved quality of our guided reasoning scheme.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Micro-Act improves QA accuracy in RAG systems by adaptively decomposing knowledge conflicts into fine-grained comparisons, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing knowledge conflicts in RAG systems that hinder QA performance by overwhelming LLMs with extraneous context.

Method: Proposes Micro-Act, a framework with a hierarchical action space to decompose knowledge sources into fine-grained comparisons.

Result: Achieves significant QA accuracy improvements across 5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially temporal and semantic.

Conclusion: Micro-Act is robust and practical for real-world RAG applications, handling both conflict and non-conflict questions effectively.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly suffer from Knowledge
Conflicts, where retrieved external knowledge contradicts the inherent,
parametric knowledge of large language models (LLMs). It adversely affects
performance on downstream tasks such as question answering (QA). Existing
approaches often attempt to mitigate conflicts by directly comparing two
knowledge sources in a side-by-side manner, but this can overwhelm LLMs with
extraneous or lengthy contexts, ultimately hindering their ability to identify
and mitigate inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose Micro-Act a
framework with a hierarchical action space that automatically perceives context
complexity and adaptively decomposes each knowledge source into a sequence of
fine-grained comparisons. These comparisons are represented as actionable
steps, enabling reasoning beyond the superficial context. Through extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets, Micro-Act consistently achieves
significant increase in QA accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines across all
5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially in temporal and semantic types
where all baselines fail significantly. More importantly, Micro-Act exhibits
robust performance on non-conflict questions simultaneously, highlighting its
practical value in real-world RAG applications.

TL;DR: ProRefine is a prompt optimization method that improves multi-agent workflows by refining prompts dynamically using LLM feedback, boosting accuracy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic workflows often suffer from error propagation and poor performance due to ineffective prompts, limiting reliability and scalability.

Method: ProRefine dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks using LLM feedback, without requiring additional training or labels.

Result: ProRefine outperforms zero-shot Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3-37 percentage points on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: ProRefine enhances accuracy, enables smaller models to match larger ones, and democratizes access to high-performing AI.

Abstract: Agentic workflows, where multiple AI agents collaborate to accomplish complex
tasks like reasoning or planning, are becoming increasingly prevalent. However,
these workflows often suffer from error propagation and sub-optimal
performance, largely due to poorly designed prompts that fail to effectively
guide individual agents. This is a critical problem because it limits the
reliability and scalability of these powerful systems. We introduce ProRefine,
an innovative inference-time prompt optimization method that leverages textual
feedback from large language models (LLMs) to address this challenge. ProRefine
dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional
training or ground truth labels. Evaluated on five benchmark mathematical
reasoning datasets, ProRefine significantly surpasses zero-shot
Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points. This approach not only
boosts accuracy but also allows smaller models to match the performance of
larger ones, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable AI
deployment, and democratizing access to high-performing AI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a constrained optimization method for unlearning sensitive data in LLMs, using a novel logit-margin flattening loss for stable and efficient forgetting while retaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning methods for LLMs often lead to unstable optimization and degraded performance, especially under aggressive forgetting.

Method: Formulates unlearning as a constrained optimization problem with a logit-margin flattening loss for forgetting and a hard constraint for retention, solved via a scalable primal-dual algorithm.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on TOFU and MUSE benchmarks, effectively removing targeted information while preserving utility.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a robust and efficient solution for unlearning in LLMs, balancing forgetting and retention effectively.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in real-world settings increasingly
face the need to unlearn sensitive, outdated, or proprietary information.
Existing unlearning methods typically formulate forgetting and retention as a
regularized trade-off, combining both objectives into a single scalarized loss.
This often leads to unstable optimization and degraded performance on retained
data, especially under aggressive forgetting. We propose a new formulation of
LLM unlearning as a constrained optimization problem: forgetting is enforced
via a novel logit-margin flattening loss that explicitly drives the output
distribution toward uniformity on a designated forget set, while retention is
preserved through a hard constraint on a separate retain set. Compared to
entropy-based objectives, our loss is softmax-free, numerically stable, and
maintains non-vanishing gradients, enabling more efficient and robust
optimization. We solve the constrained problem using a scalable primal-dual
algorithm that exposes the trade-off between forgetting and retention through
the dynamics of the dual variable. Evaluations on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks
across diverse LLM architectures demonstrate that our approach consistently
matches or exceeds state-of-the-art baselines, effectively removing targeted
information while preserving downstream utility.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Search Arena, a large-scale dataset for evaluating search-augmented LLMs, revealing user preference biases and performance insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for search-augmented LLMs are limited in scale and scope, prompting the need for a more comprehensive evaluation framework.

Method: A crowd-sourced dataset of 24,000 multi-turn interactions with search-augmented LLMs, including 12,000 human preference votes, was created and analyzed.

Result: User preferences are influenced by citation quantity and source type, with community-driven platforms favored. Web search can enhance performance in non-search settings.

Conclusion: The dataset highlights gaps in perceived credibility and source reliability, advocating for better evaluation methods. The dataset is open-sourced for future research.

Abstract: Search-augmented language models combine web search with Large Language
Models (LLMs) to improve response groundedness and freshness. However,
analyzing these systems remains challenging: existing datasets are limited in
scale and narrow in scope, often constrained to static, single-turn,
fact-checking questions. In this work, we introduce Search Arena, a
crowd-sourced, large-scale, human-preference dataset of over 24,000 paired
multi-turn user interactions with search-augmented LLMs. The dataset spans
diverse intents and languages, and contains full system traces with around
12,000 human preference votes. Our analysis reveals that user preferences are
influenced by the number of citations, even when the cited content does not
directly support the attributed claims, uncovering a gap between perceived and
actual credibility. Furthermore, user preferences vary across cited sources,
revealing that community-driven platforms are generally preferred and static
encyclopedic sources are not always appropriate and reliable. To assess
performance across different settings, we conduct cross-arena analyses by
testing search-augmented LLMs in a general-purpose chat environment and
conventional LLMs in search-intensive settings. We find that web search does
not degrade and may even improve performance in non-search settings; however,
the quality in search settings is significantly affected if solely relying on
the model's parametric knowledge. We open-sourced the dataset to support future
research in this direction. Our dataset and code are available at:

### [187] [Flattery, Fluff, and Fog: Diagnosing and Mitigating Idiosyncratic Biases in Preference Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05339)
*Anirudh Bharadwaj,Chaitanya Malaviya,Nitish Joshi,Mark Yatskar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Language models show bias in preference judgments due to training data artifacts, favoring superficial features over substance. A post-training method using counterfactual data augmentation reduces miscalibration and skew.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models often prioritize superficial patterns like length and style over substantive qualities, leading to unreliable evaluations and reward hacking. This work aims to understand and mitigate these biases.

Method: The study quantifies bias in preference models using controlled counterfactual pairs across five features (length, structure, jargon, sycophancy, vagueness). A post-training method, counterfactual data augmentation (CDA), is proposed to debias models.

Result: Preference models favor biased responses in >60% of cases, with ~40% miscalibration vs. human preferences. CDA reduces miscalibration from 39.4% to 32.5% and skew difference from 20.5% to 10.0%, maintaining performance.

Conclusion: Targeted debiasing via CDA effectively mitigates bias in preference models, improving reliability while preserving overall performance.

Abstract: Language models serve as proxies for human preference judgements in alignment
and evaluation, yet they exhibit systematic miscalibration, prioritizing
superficial patterns over substantive qualities. This bias manifests as
overreliance on features like length, structure, and style, leading to issues
like reward hacking and unreliable evaluations. Evidence suggests these biases
originate in artifacts in human training data. In this work, we systematically
investigate the relationship between training data biases and preference model
miscalibration across five idiosyncratic features of language model
generations: length, structure, jargon, sycophancy and vagueness. Using
controlled counterfactual pairs, we first quantify the extent to which
preference models favor responses with magnified biases (skew), finding this
preference occurs in >60% of instances, and model preferences show high
miscalibration (~40%) compared to human preferences. Notably, bias features
only show mild negative correlations to human preference labels (mean r_human =
-0.12) but show moderately strong positive correlations with labels from a
strong reward model (mean r_model = +0.36), suggesting that models may overrely
on spurious cues. To mitigate these issues, we propose a simple post-training
method based on counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) using synthesized
contrastive examples. Finetuning models with CDA reduces average miscalibration
from 39.4% to 32.5% and average absolute skew difference from 20.5% to 10.0%,
while maintaining overall RewardBench performance, showing that targeted

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HSSBench is a new benchmark for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) tasks, addressing gaps in current benchmarks by focusing on interdisciplinary thinking and visual-concept integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLM benchmarks focus on STEM disciplines, neglecting the unique needs of HSS, which requires horizontal, interdisciplinary reasoning and visual-concept linking.

Method: HSSBench includes over 13,000 samples across six categories, generated via a collaborative pipeline involving domain experts and automated agents. It evaluates MLLMs in multiple languages.

Result: Benchmarking over 20 MLLMs shows HSSBench poses significant challenges, even for state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: HSSBench aims to inspire research into improving MLLMs' cross-disciplinary reasoning and knowledge integration capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
potential to advance a broad range of domains. However, current benchmarks for
evaluating MLLMs primarily emphasize general knowledge and vertical
step-by-step reasoning typical of STEM disciplines, while overlooking the
distinct needs and potential of the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS). Tasks
in the HSS domain require more horizontal, interdisciplinary thinking and a
deep integration of knowledge across related fields, which presents unique
challenges for MLLMs, particularly in linking abstract concepts with
corresponding visual representations. Addressing this gap, we present HSSBench,
a dedicated benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of MLLMs on HSS tasks
in multiple languages, including the six official languages of the United
Nations. We also introduce a novel data generation pipeline tailored for HSS
scenarios, in which multiple domain experts and automated agents collaborate to
generate and iteratively refine each sample. HSSBench contains over 13,000
meticulously designed samples, covering six key categories. We benchmark more
than 20 mainstream MLLMs on HSSBench and demonstrate that it poses significant
challenges even for state-of-the-art models. We hope that this benchmark will
inspire further research into enhancing the cross-disciplinary reasoning
abilities of MLLMs, especially their capacity to internalize and connect
knowledge across fields.

### [189] [Dynamic Epsilon Scheduling: A Multi-Factor Adaptive Perturbation Budget for Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04263)
*Alan Mitkiy,James Smith,Hana Satou,Hiroshi Tanaka,Emily Johnson,F Monkey*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dynamic Epsilon Scheduling (DES) adaptively adjusts adversarial perturbation budgets per instance and iteration, improving robustness and accuracy over fixed-budget methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial training uses fixed perturbation budgets, ignoring instance-specific robustness. DES addresses this limitation.

Method: DES integrates gradient-based boundary distance, softmax entropy confidence, and Monte Carlo dropout uncertainty to dynamically adjust budgets.

Result: DES outperforms fixed-budget and prior adaptive methods on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 in robustness and accuracy.

Conclusion: DES introduces a data-driven, instance-aware adversarial training framework with theoretical stability guarantees.

Abstract: Adversarial training is among the most effective strategies for defending
deep neural networks against adversarial examples. A key limitation of existing
adversarial training approaches lies in their reliance on a fixed perturbation
budget, which fails to account for instance-specific robustness
characteristics. While prior works such as IAAT and MMA introduce
instance-level adaptations, they often rely on heuristic or static
approximations of data robustness. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Epsilon
Scheduling (DES), a novel framework that adaptively adjusts the adversarial
perturbation budget per instance and per training iteration. DES integrates
three key factors: (1) the distance to the decision boundary approximated via
gradient-based proxies, (2) prediction confidence derived from softmax entropy,
and (3) model uncertainty estimated via Monte Carlo dropout. By combining these
cues into a unified scheduling strategy, DES tailors the perturbation budget
dynamically to guide more effective adversarial learning. Experimental results
on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that our method consistently improves both
adversarial robustness and standard accuracy compared to fixed-epsilon
baselines and prior adaptive methods. Moreover, we provide theoretical insights
into the stability and convergence of our scheduling policy. This work opens a
new avenue for instance-aware, data-driven adversarial training methods.

### [190] [RSVP: Reasoning Segmentation via Visual Prompting and Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04277)
*Yi Lu,Jiawang Cao,Yongliang Wu,Bozheng Li,Licheng Tang,Yangguang Ji,Chong Wu,Jay Wu,Wenbo Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RSVP bridges the gap between cognitive reasoning and visual perception in MLLMs by integrating reasoning-driven localization with segmentation refinement, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs lack explicit mechanisms for visual grounding and segmentation, creating a disconnect between reasoning and perception.

Method: RSVP is a two-stage framework: reasoning-driven localization with multimodal chain-of-thought prompts, followed by segmentation refinement using a Vision-Language Segmentation Module (VLSM).

Result: RSVP outperforms state-of-the-art methods by +6.5 gIoU and +9.2 cIoU on ReasonSeg, and achieves 49.7 mAP on SegInW in zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: RSVP effectively integrates cognitive reasoning with structured visual understanding, offering a scalable and interpretable solution.

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
reasoning capability while lack explicit mechanisms for visual grounding and
segmentation, creating a gap between cognitive reasoning and visual perception.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Reasoning Segmentation via Visual Prompting
(RSVP), a novel framework that unifies multi-step multimodal reasoning with
grounded visual understanding. RSVP is a two-stage structuralized framework
that integrates reasoning-driven localization with segmentation refinement. In
the reasoning stage, RSVP employs multimodal chain-of-thought visual prompts to
help MLLMs understand queries and infer targets, generating interpretable
region proposals that enhance visual grounding. In segmentation stage, RSVP
refines these proposals with a Vision-Language Segmentation Module (VLSM),
seamlessly integrates textual and visual cues to produce precise segmentation
masks. By explicitly modelling the interaction between multimodal reasoning and
segmentation, RSVP introduces a new paradigm for interpretable reasoning
segmentation. It exploits MLLMs' inherent localization capabilities, enabling
the models to not only reason about objects but also generate structured visual
representations. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RSVP achieves
state-of-the-art performance, surpasses state-of-the-art methods by up to +6.5
gIoU and +9.2 cIoU on ReasonSeg, and achieves 49.7 mAP on SegInW under
zero-shot settings. These results validate RSVP as an effective and scalable
framework for integrating cognitive reasoning with structured visual
understanding.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMRB, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal multi-image reasoning, highlighting gaps in existing MLLM benchmarks and demonstrating the limitations of current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM benchmarks lack comprehensive evaluation of reasoning over multiple images, leaving a gap in understanding MLLMs' capabilities in this area.

Method: The authors create MMRB, a benchmark with 92 sub-tasks for spatial, temporal, and semantic reasoning, using GPT-4o and human-expert annotations. They also propose a sentence-level matching framework for evaluation.

Result: Experiments on 40 MLLMs show open-source models lag behind commercial ones in multi-image reasoning, and reward models struggle with multi-image tasks.

Conclusion: MMRB fills a critical gap in evaluating multi-image reasoning, revealing significant limitations in current MLLMs and reward models.

Abstract: With enhanced capabilities and widespread applications, Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly required to process and reason over
multiple images simultaneously. However, existing MLLM benchmarks focus either
on single-image visual reasoning or on multi-image understanding tasks with
only final-answer evaluation, leaving the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs over
multi-image inputs largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the
$\textbf{Multimodal Multi-image Reasoning Benchmark (MMRB)}$, the first
benchmark designed to evaluate structured visual reasoning across multiple
images. MMRB comprises $\textbf{92 sub-tasks}$ covering spatial, temporal, and
semantic reasoning, with multi-solution, CoT-style annotations generated by
GPT-4o and refined by human experts. A derivative subset is designed to
evaluate multimodal reward models in multi-image scenarios. To support fast and
scalable evaluation, we propose a sentence-level matching framework using
open-source LLMs. Extensive baseline experiments on $\textbf{40 MLLMs}$,
including 9 reasoning-specific models and 8 reward models, demonstrate that
open-source MLLMs still lag significantly behind commercial MLLMs in
multi-image reasoning tasks. Furthermore, current multimodal reward models are
nearly incapable of handling multi-image reward ranking tasks.

*Maksym Ivashechkin,Oscar Mendez,Richard Bowden*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A weakly supervised pipeline for 3D human generation addresses challenges like realism, detail, and control, using diffusion models and transformers for speed and quality improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for 3D human generation lack fine detail, realism, and control, compounded by limited and poorly annotated datasets.

Method: The pipeline involves generating a photorealistic dataset with controllable attributes, mapping image features to 3D point clouds via transformers, and training a point-cloud diffusion model.

Result: Achieves significant speed-ups, improved text-prompt alignment, realism, and rendering quality over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline advances 3D human generation, offering practical improvements and making code and dataset available for further research.

Abstract: 3D human generation is an important problem with a wide range of applications
in computer vision and graphics. Despite recent progress in generative AI such
as diffusion models or rendering methods like Neural Radiance Fields or
Gaussian Splatting, controlling the generation of accurate 3D humans from text
prompts remains an open challenge. Current methods struggle with fine detail,
accurate rendering of hands and faces, human realism, and controlability over
appearance. The lack of diversity, realism, and annotation in human image data
also remains a challenge, hindering the development of a foundational 3D human
model. We present a weakly supervised pipeline that tries to address these
challenges. In the first step, we generate a photorealistic human image dataset
with controllable attributes such as appearance, race, gender, etc using a
state-of-the-art image diffusion model. Next, we propose an efficient mapping
approach from image features to 3D point clouds using a transformer-based
architecture. Finally, we close the loop by training a point-cloud diffusion
model that is conditioned on the same text prompts used to generate the
original samples. We demonstrate orders-of-magnitude speed-ups in 3D human
generation compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, along with
significantly improved text-prompt alignment, realism, and rendering quality.
We will make the code and dataset available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReXVQA is the largest benchmark for VQA in chest radiology, introducing diverse tasks and outperforming human experts with AI models like MedGemma.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI in chest radiology VQA, addressing the lack of diverse and clinically authentic tasks.

Method: Developed ReXVQA with 696K questions and 160K X-rays, evaluated 8 multimodal LLMs, and conducted a human reader study with 3 radiology residents.

Result: MedGemma achieved 83.24% accuracy, surpassing human readers (77.27%). Strong inter-reader agreement among radiologists, variable with AI.

Conclusion: ReXVQA sets a new standard for radiological AI evaluation, enabling next-gen systems with expert-level reasoning. Dataset will be open-sourced.

Abstract: We present ReXVQA, the largest and most comprehensive benchmark for visual
question answering (VQA) in chest radiology, comprising approximately 696,000
questions paired with 160,000 chest X-rays studies across training, validation,
and test sets. Unlike prior efforts that rely heavily on template based
queries, ReXVQA introduces a diverse and clinically authentic task suite
reflecting five core radiological reasoning skills: presence assessment,
location analysis, negation detection, differential diagnosis, and geometric
reasoning. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art multimodal large language models,
including MedGemma-4B-it, Qwen2.5-VL, Janus-Pro-7B, and Eagle2-9B. The
best-performing model (MedGemma) achieves 83.24% overall accuracy. To bridge
the gap between AI performance and clinical expertise, we conducted a
comprehensive human reader study involving 3 radiology residents on 200
randomly sampled cases. Our evaluation demonstrates that MedGemma achieved
superior performance (83.84% accuracy) compared to human readers (best
radiology resident: 77.27%), representing a significant milestone where AI
performance exceeds expert human evaluation on chest X-ray interpretation. The
reader study reveals distinct performance patterns between AI models and human
experts, with strong inter-reader agreement among radiologists while showing
more variable agreement patterns between human readers and AI models. ReXVQA
establishes a new standard for evaluating generalist radiological AI systems,
offering public leaderboards, fine-grained evaluation splits, structured
explanations, and category-level breakdowns. This benchmark lays the foundation
for next-generation AI systems capable of mimicking expert-level clinical
reasoning beyond narrow pathology classification. Our dataset will be

*Delong Chen,Willy Chung,Yejin Bang,Ziwei Ji,Pascale Fung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces WorldPrediction, a video-based benchmark for evaluating AI models' world modeling and procedural planning capabilities, highlighting their current limitations compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unclear ability of current AI models, especially generative ones, to learn world models and perform procedural planning in diverse environments.

Method: Develops WorldPrediction, a discriminative benchmark using visual observations and action equivalents to evaluate models' capabilities in distinguishing proper actions or sequences from distractors.

Result: Current models achieve 57% accuracy on WorldPrediction-WM and 38% on WorldPrediction-PP, significantly lower than human performance.

Conclusion: The benchmark reveals a gap between AI and human capabilities in world modeling and planning, providing a robust framework for future research.

Abstract: Humans are known to have an internal "world model" that enables us to carry
out action planning based on world states. AI agents need to have such a world
model for action planning as well. It is not clear how current AI models,
especially generative models, are able to learn such world models and carry out
procedural planning in diverse environments. We introduce WorldPrediction, a
video-based benchmark for evaluating world modeling and procedural planning
capabilities of different AI models. In contrast to prior benchmarks that focus
primarily on low-level world modeling and robotic motion planning,
WorldPrediction is the first benchmark that emphasizes actions with temporal
and semantic abstraction. Given initial and final world states, the task is to
distinguish the proper action (WorldPrediction-WM) or the properly ordered
sequence of actions (WorldPrediction-PP) from a set of counterfactual
distractors. This discriminative task setup enable us to evaluate different
types of world models and planners and realize a thorough comparison across
different hypothesis. The benchmark represents states and actions using visual
observations. In order to prevent models from exploiting low-level continuity
cues in background scenes, we provide "action equivalents" - identical actions
observed in different contexts - as candidates for selection. This benchmark is
grounded in a formal framework of partially observable semi-MDP, ensuring
better reliability and robustness of the evaluation. We conduct extensive human
filtering and validation on our benchmark and show that current frontier models
barely achieve 57% accuracy on WorldPrediction-WM and 38% on WorldPrediction-PP
whereas humans are able to solve both tasks perfectly.

*Liam Salass,Jerrin Bright,Amir Nazemi,Yuhao Chen,John Zelek,David Clausi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PLUCC introduces a context-driven method for puck detection in hockey videos, leveraging player behavior cues and achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The small size, occlusions, and motion blur of the puck in hockey videos make detection challenging. Players' body and gaze orientation provide strong contextual cues.

Method: PLUCC combines a contextual encoder (player orientations), a feature pyramid encoder (multiscale features), and a gating decoder (channel gating).

Result: PLUCC outperforms baselines with a 12.2% AP improvement and 25% RSLE AP, demonstrating superior detection.

Conclusion: Contextual understanding significantly enhances puck detection, advancing automated sports analysis.

Abstract: Puck detection in ice hockey broadcast videos poses significant challenges
due to the puck's small size, frequent occlusions, motion blur, broadcast
artifacts, and scale inconsistencies due to varying camera zoom and broadcast
camera viewpoints. Prior works focus on appearance-based or motion-based cues
of the puck without explicitly modelling the cues derived from player
behaviour. Players consistently turn their bodies and direct their gaze toward
the puck. Motivated by this strong contextual cue, we propose Puck Localization
Using Contextual Cues (PLUCC), a novel approach for scale-aware and
context-driven single-frame puck detections. PLUCC consists of three
components: (a) a contextual encoder, which utilizes player orientations and
positioning as helpful priors; (b) a feature pyramid encoder, which extracts
multiscale features from the dual encoders; and (c) a gating decoder that
combines latent features with a channel gating mechanism. For evaluation, in
addition to standard average precision, we propose Rink Space Localization
Error (RSLE), a scale-invariant homography-based metric for removing
perspective bias from rink space evaluation. The experimental results of PLUCC
on the PuckDataset dataset demonstrated state-of-the-art detection performance,
surpassing previous baseline methods by an average precision improvement of
12.2% and RSLE average precision of 25%. Our research demonstrates the critical
role of contextual understanding in improving puck detection performance, with
broad implications for automated sports analysis.

*Jubayer Ahmed Bhuiyan Shawon,Hasan Mahmud,Kamrul Hasan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study fine-tunes video transformer models (VideoMAE, ViViT, TimeSformer) on Bangla Sign Language datasets (BdSLW60, BdSLW401), achieving high accuracy and outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve accessibility for the hearing-impaired in Bangladesh by automating Bangla Sign Language (BdSL) recognition.

Method: Fine-tuning video transformers on BdSL datasets, applying data augmentation, and using 10-fold cross-validation for evaluation.

Result: VideoMAE achieved 95.5% accuracy on BdSLW60 and 81.04% on BdSLW401, outperforming traditional approaches.

Conclusion: Video transformers show strong potential for scalable and accurate BdSL recognition, influenced by dataset size and model architecture.

Abstract: Sign Language Recognition (SLR) involves the automatic identification and
classification of sign gestures from images or video, converting them into text
or speech to improve accessibility for the hearing-impaired community. In
Bangladesh, Bangla Sign Language (BdSL) serves as the primary mode of
communication for many individuals with hearing impairments. This study
fine-tunes state-of-the-art video transformer architectures -- VideoMAE, ViViT,
and TimeSformer -- on BdSLW60 (arXiv:2402.08635), a small-scale BdSL dataset
with 60 frequent signs. We standardized the videos to 30 FPS, resulting in
9,307 user trial clips. To evaluate scalability and robustness, the models were
also fine-tuned on BdSLW401 (arXiv:2503.02360), a large-scale dataset with 401
sign classes. Additionally, we benchmark performance against public datasets,
including LSA64 and WLASL. Data augmentation techniques such as random
cropping, horizontal flipping, and short-side scaling were applied to improve
model robustness. To ensure balanced evaluation across folds during model
selection, we employed 10-fold stratified cross-validation on the training set,
while signer-independent evaluation was carried out using held-out test data
from unseen users U4 and U8. Results show that video transformer models
significantly outperform traditional machine learning and deep learning
approaches. Performance is influenced by factors such as dataset size, video
quality, frame distribution, frame rate, and model architecture. Among the
models, the VideoMAE variant (MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics)
achieved the highest accuracies of 95.5% on the frame rate corrected BdSLW60
dataset and 81.04% on the front-facing signs of BdSLW401 -- demonstrating
strong potential for scalable and accurate BdSL recognition.

*Matthew W. Shinkle,Mark D. Lescroart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Activation maximization in DNN-based encoding models predicts and modulates human brain responses to visual stimuli, validated via fMRI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited insight into specific features driving brain responses in DNN-based encoding models.

Method: Apply activation maximization to DNN-based encoding models, extract and downsample activations from Inception V3, use linear regression for fMRI prediction, and validate with human fMRI studies.

Result: Generated images reliably drive targeted brain activity, aligning with known selectivity and enabling exploration of visual cortex responses.

Conclusion: Activation maximization successfully characterizes and modulates human visual system responses, overcoming limitations of generative models.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on visual tasks develop feature
representations that resemble those in the human visual system. Although
DNN-based encoding models can accurately predict brain responses to visual
stimuli, they offer limited insight into the specific features driving these
responses. Here, we demonstrate that activation maximization -- a technique
designed to interpret vision DNNs -- can be applied to DNN-based encoding
models of the human brain. We extract and adaptively downsample activations
from multiple layers of a pretrained Inception V3 network, then use linear
regression to predict fMRI responses. This yields a full image-computable model
of brain responses. Next, we apply activation maximization to generate images
optimized for predicted responses in individual cortical voxels. We find that
these images contain visual characteristics that qualitatively correspond with
known selectivity and enable exploration of selectivity across the visual
cortex. We further extend our method to whole regions of interest (ROIs) of the
brain and validate its efficacy by presenting these images to human
participants in an fMRI study. We find that the generated images reliably drive
activity in targeted regions across both low- and high-level visual areas and
across subjects. These results demonstrate that activation maximization can be
successfully applied to DNN-based encoding models. By addressing key
limitations of alternative approaches that require natively generative models,
our approach enables flexible characterization and modulation of responses
across the human visual system.

*Qiuyu Tang,Bonor Ayambem,Mooi Choo Chuah,Aparna Bharati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Current perturbation-based image protection methods fail to fully prevent diffusion-based editing, sometimes improving results instead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address misuse of diffusion models like Stable Diffusion for misinformation and copyright infringement by evaluating image protection methods.

Method: Tested perturbation-based protection methods across domains (natural scenes, artworks) and editing tasks (image-to-image, style editing).

Result: Protection methods often fail; noise can enhance adherence to prompts, improving edits.

Conclusion: Perturbation-based methods are insufficient for robust protection against diffusion-based editing.

Abstract: The remarkable image generation capabilities of state-of-the-art diffusion
models, such as Stable Diffusion, can also be misused to spread misinformation
and plagiarize copyrighted materials. To mitigate the potential risks
associated with image editing, current image protection methods rely on adding
imperceptible perturbations to images to obstruct diffusion-based editing. A
fully successful protection for an image implies that the output of editing
attempts is an undesirable, noisy image which is completely unrelated to the
reference image. In our experiments with various perturbation-based image
protection methods across multiple domains (natural scene images and artworks)
and editing tasks (image-to-image generation and style editing), we discover
that such protection does not achieve this goal completely. In most scenarios,
diffusion-based editing of protected images generates a desirable output image
which adheres precisely to the guidance prompt. Our findings suggest that
adding noise to images may paradoxically increase their association with given
text prompts during the generation process, leading to unintended consequences
such as better resultant edits. Hence, we argue that perturbation-based methods
may not provide a sufficient solution for robust image protection against
diffusion-based editing.

### [199] [Normalize Filters! Classical Wisdom for Deep Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04401)
*Gustavo Perez,Stella X. Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes filter normalization for deep learning filters to address distortions in responses due to atmospheric transfer, improving robustness and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical image filters are normalized for consistency, but deep learning filters lack such constraints, leading to distorted responses and incorrect outcomes under atmospheric transfer.

Method: The authors introduce filter normalization followed by learnable scaling and shifting, akin to batch normalization, to ensure atmosphere-equivariant filters.

Result: The method improves performance on intensity variation benchmarks, with ResNet34 outperforming CLIP significantly. Filter normalization enhances robustness and generalization.

Conclusion: Integrating classical filtering principles into deep learning via filter normalization regularizes learning, promotes diversity, and improves model robustness and generalization.

Abstract: Classical image filters, such as those for averaging or differencing, are
carefully normalized to ensure consistency, interpretability, and to avoid
artifacts like intensity shifts, halos, or ringing. In contrast, convolutional
filters learned end-to-end in deep networks lack such constraints. Although
they may resemble wavelets and blob/edge detectors, they are not normalized in
the same or any way. Consequently, when images undergo atmospheric transfer,
their responses become distorted, leading to incorrect outcomes. We address
this limitation by proposing filter normalization, followed by learnable
scaling and shifting, akin to batch normalization. This simple yet effective
modification ensures that the filters are atmosphere-equivariant, enabling
co-domain symmetry. By integrating classical filtering principles into deep
learning (applicable to both convolutional neural networks and
convolution-dependent vision transformers), our method achieves significant
improvements on artificial and natural intensity variation benchmarks. Our
ResNet34 could even outperform CLIP by a large margin. Our analysis reveals
that unnormalized filters degrade performance, whereas filter normalization
regularizes learning, promotes diversity, and improves robustness and
generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HMAR improves VAR by using next-scale prediction and masked generation, achieving better image quality, faster training/inference, and flexibility in sampling and editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR's parallel token generation reduces image quality, scales poorly with resolution, and lacks flexibility in sampling. HMAR addresses these issues.

Method: HMAR uses Markovian next-scale prediction and masked generation for high-quality images. It employs block-sparse attention for efficiency.

Result: HMAR outperforms VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive models on ImageNet benchmarks, with faster training/inference and lower memory usage.

Conclusion: HMAR is a superior alternative to VAR, offering improved performance, efficiency, and flexibility for image generation and editing.

Abstract: Visual Auto-Regressive modeling (VAR) has shown promise in bridging the speed
and quality gap between autoregressive image models and diffusion models. VAR
reformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive
resolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all
the tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in
all previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from
reduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a
resolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image
resolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.
  We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image
generation algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction
and masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR
reformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the
prediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its
immediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions.
When predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked
generation procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On
ImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform
parameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. We develop
efficient IO-aware block-sparse attention kernels that allow HMAR to achieve
faster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5x and 1.75x
respectively, as well as over 3x lower inference memory footprint. Finally,
HMAR yields additional flexibility over VAR; its sampling schedule can be
changed without further training, and it can be applied to image editing tasks
in a zero-shot manner.

*Zhaoyang Lv,Maurizio Monge,Ka Chen,Yufeng Zhu,Michael Goesele,Jakob Engel,Zhao Dong,Richard Newcombe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in photorealistic scene reconstruction using egocentric devices, proposing VIBA for precise calibration and a physical image formation model to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook details like rolling-shutter effects and dynamic ranges, leading to less accurate reconstructions.

Method: Uses VIBA for high-frequency trajectory calibration and integrates a physical image formation model into Gaussian Splatting.

Result: Achieves consistent PSNR improvements (+1 dB with VIBA, +1 dB with the image formation model) across diverse lighting conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enhance reconstruction accuracy and are validated on real-world devices.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the challenges associated with using egocentric
devices to photorealistic reconstruct the scene in high dynamic range. Existing
methodologies typically assume using frame-rate 6DoF pose estimated from the
device's visual-inertial odometry system, which may neglect crucial details
necessary for pixel-accurate reconstruction. This study presents two
significant findings. Firstly, in contrast to mainstream work treating RGB
camera as global shutter frame-rate camera, we emphasize the importance of
employing visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) to calibrate the precise
timestamps and movement of the rolling shutter RGB sensing camera in a high
frequency trajectory format, which ensures an accurate calibration of the
physical properties of the rolling-shutter camera. Secondly, we incorporate a
physical image formation model based into Gaussian Splatting, which effectively
addresses the sensor characteristics, including the rolling-shutter effect of
RGB cameras and the dynamic ranges measured by sensors. Our proposed
formulation is applicable to the widely-used variants of Gaussian Splats
representation. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our pipeline using the
open-source Project Aria device under diverse indoor and outdoor lighting
conditions, and further validate it on a Meta Quest3 device. Across all
experiments, we observe a consistent visual enhancement of +1 dB in PSNR by
incorporating VIBA, with an additional +1 dB achieved through our proposed
image formation model. Our complete implementation, evaluation datasets, and

### [202] [Towards Large-Scale Pose-Invariant Face Recognition Using Face Defrontalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04496)
*Patrik Mesec,Alan Jović*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes face defrontalization as a method to improve pose-invariant face recognition, showing better results than frontalization on larger datasets but not on small ones like Multi-PIE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pose-invariant face recognition methods rely on impractical techniques like face frontalization, often evaluated on small datasets, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: The method involves training a face defrontalization model (FFWM) on aligned frontal-profile pairs, then using it to augment training data for a ResNet-50 model with ArcFace loss.

Result: Defrontalization outperforms non-defrontalized models and state-of-the-art frontalization on larger datasets (LFW, AgeDB, CFP) but not on Multi-PIE for extreme poses.

Conclusion: Defrontalization is a promising alternative to frontalization, but current methods may overfit small datasets, highlighting the need for larger-scale evaluations.

Abstract: Face recognition under extreme head poses is a challenging task. Ideally, a
face recognition system should perform well across different head poses, which
is known as pose-invariant face recognition. To achieve pose invariance,
current approaches rely on sophisticated methods, such as face frontalization
and various facial feature extraction model architectures. However, these
methods are somewhat impractical in real-life settings and are typically
evaluated on small scientific datasets, such as Multi-PIE. In this work, we
propose the inverse method of face frontalization, called face
defrontalization, to augment the training dataset of facial feature extraction
model. The method does not introduce any time overhead during the inference
step. The method is composed of: 1) training an adapted face defrontalization
FFWM model on a frontal-profile pairs dataset, which has been preprocessed
using our proposed face alignment method; 2) training a ResNet-50 facial
feature extraction model based on ArcFace loss on a raw and randomly
defrontalized large-scale dataset, where defrontalization was performed with
our previously trained face defrontalization model. Our method was compared
with the existing approaches on four open-access datasets: LFW, AgeDB, CFP, and
Multi-PIE. Defrontalization shows improved results compared to models without
defrontalization, while the proposed adjustments show clear superiority over
the state-of-the-art face frontalization FFWM method on three larger
open-access datasets, but not on the small Multi-PIE dataset for extreme poses
(75 and 90 degrees). The results suggest that at least some of the current
methods may be overfitted to small datasets.

### [203] [FALO: Fast and Accurate LiDAR 3D Object Detection on Resource-Constrained Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04499)
*Shizhong Han,Hsin-Pai Cheng,Hong Cai,Jihad Masri,Soyeb Nagori,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FALO is a hardware-friendly LiDAR 3D detection method offering SOTA accuracy and fast inference on edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with irregular memory access and high computational costs on edge devices.

Method: FALO arranges voxels into a 1D sequence, processes it with ConvDotMix blocks (large-kernel convolutions, Hadamard products, linear layers), and uses implicit grouping for efficiency.

Result: FALO achieves competitive performance on benchmarks (nuScenes, Waymo) and is 1.6~9.8x faster than SOTA on mobile GPUs/NPUs.

Conclusion: FALO is efficient, accurate, and deployable on resource-constrained platforms.

Abstract: Existing LiDAR 3D object detection methods predominantely rely on sparse
convolutions and/or transformers, which can be challenging to run on
resource-constrained edge devices, due to irregular memory access patterns and
high computational costs. In this paper, we propose FALO, a hardware-friendly
approach to LiDAR 3D detection, which offers both state-of-the-art (SOTA)
detection accuracy and fast inference speed. More specifically, given the 3D
point cloud and after voxelization, FALO first arranges sparse 3D voxels into a
1D sequence based on their coordinates and proximity. The sequence is then
processed by our proposed ConvDotMix blocks, consisting of large-kernel
convolutions, Hadamard products, and linear layers. ConvDotMix provides
sufficient mixing capability in both spatial and embedding dimensions, and
introduces higher-order nonlinear interaction among spatial features.
Furthermore, when going through the ConvDotMix layers, we introduce implicit
grouping, which balances the tensor dimensions for more efficient inference and
takes into account the growing receptive field. All these operations are
friendly to run on resource-constrained platforms and proposed FALO can readily
deploy on compact, embedded devices. Our extensive evaluation on LiDAR 3D
detection benchmarks such as nuScenes and Waymo shows that FALO achieves
competitive performance. Meanwhile, FALO is 1.6~9.8x faster than the latest
SOTA on mobile Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and mobile Neural Processing Unit
(NPU).

*Guangyu Shen,Zhihua Li,Xiang Xu,Tianchen Zhao,Zheng Zhang,Dongsheng An,Zhuowen Tu,Yifan Xing,Qin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AuthGuard improves deepfake detection by combining vision and language guidance, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake detection methods fail to generalize to unseen forgeries due to reliance on specific statistical artifacts.

Method: Integrates language guidance via image-text contrastive learning with MLLMs, combines discriminative classification, and incorporates data uncertainty learning.

Result: Achieves AUC gains of 6.15% on DFDC and 16.68% on DF40, with 24.69% improvement in reasoning on DDVQA.

Conclusion: AuthGuard enhances generalization, accuracy, and interpretability in deepfake detection.

Abstract: Existing deepfake detection techniques struggle to keep-up with the
ever-evolving novel, unseen forgeries methods. This limitation stems from their
reliance on statistical artifacts learned during training, which are often tied
to specific generation processes that may not be representative of samples from
new, unseen deepfake generation methods encountered at test time. We propose
that incorporating language guidance can improve deepfake detection
generalization by integrating human-like commonsense reasoning -- such as
recognizing logical inconsistencies and perceptual anomalies -- alongside
statistical cues. To achieve this, we train an expert deepfake vision encoder
by combining discriminative classification with image-text contrastive
learning, where the text is generated by generalist MLLMs using few-shot
prompting. This allows the encoder to extract both language-describable,
commonsense deepfake artifacts and statistical forgery artifacts from
pixel-level distributions. To further enhance robustness, we integrate data
uncertainty learning into vision-language contrastive learning, mitigating
noise in image-text supervision. Our expert vision encoder seamlessly
interfaces with an LLM, further enabling more generalized and interpretable
deepfake detection while also boosting accuracy. The resulting framework,
AuthGuard, achieves state-of-the-art deepfake detection accuracy in both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, achieving AUC gains of 6.15%
on the DFDC dataset and 16.68% on the DF40 dataset. Additionally, AuthGuard
significantly enhances deepfake reasoning, improving performance by 24.69% on
the DDVQA dataset.

### [205] [Pruning Everything, Everywhere, All at Once](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04513)
*Gustavo Henrique do Nascimento,Ian Pons,Anna Helena Reali Costa,Artur Jordao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for simultaneously pruning neurons and layers in deep learning models, using representation similarity to select subnetworks, achieving high sparsity and computational efficiency without significant accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models are computationally expensive as they grow deeper. Pruning structures can reduce complexity, but existing methods prune either neurons or layers, not both. This gap motivates the proposed method.

Method: The method selects subnetworks from layer and neuron pruning based on representation similarity to the parent model using Centered Kernel Alignment, iteratively refining for sparsity.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art pruning techniques, achieving high FLOPs reduction (86.37% and 95.82% for ResNet56 and ResNet110) with minimal accuracy drop and improved robustness.

Conclusion: The work advances pruning by enabling simultaneous neuron and layer pruning, contributing to GreenAI by reducing carbon emissions and opening new research directions.

Abstract: Deep learning stands as the modern paradigm for solving cognitive tasks.
However, as the problem complexity increases, models grow deeper and
computationally prohibitive, hindering advancements in real-world and
resource-constrained applications. Extensive studies reveal that pruning
structures in these models efficiently reduces model complexity and improves
computational efficiency. Successful strategies in this sphere include removing
neurons (i.e., filters, heads) or layers, but not both together. Therefore,
simultaneously pruning different structures remains an open problem. To fill
this gap and leverage the benefits of eliminating neurons and layers at once,
we propose a new method capable of pruning different structures within a model
as follows. Given two candidate subnetworks (pruned models), one from layer
pruning and the other from neuron pruning, our method decides which to choose
by selecting the one with the highest representation similarity to its parent
(the network that generates the subnetworks) using the Centered Kernel
Alignment metric. Iteratively repeating this process provides highly sparse
models that preserve the original predictive ability. Throughout extensive
experiments on standard architectures and benchmarks, we confirm the
effectiveness of our approach and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art
layer and filter pruning techniques. At high levels of Floating Point
Operations reduction, most state-of-the-art methods degrade accuracy, whereas
our approach either improves it or experiences only a minimal drop. Notably, on
the popular ResNet56 and ResNet110, we achieve a milestone of 86.37% and 95.82%
FLOPs reduction. Besides, our pruned models obtain robustness to adversarial
and out-of-distribution samples and take an important step towards GreenAI,
reducing carbon emissions by up to 83.31%. Overall, we believe our work opens a
new chapter in pruning.

*Shuo Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EECD-Net is a multi-stage crack detection method using SRCNN, SCU, and GAT to improve accuracy and energy efficiency, achieving 98.6% accuracy and 33% power reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges of low-resolution imaging and energy constraints in smart terminal devices for real-time road crack detection.

Method: Combines SRCNN for image enhancement, SCU for power-efficient processing, and GAT for multi-scale feature fusion.

Result: Achieves 98.6% accuracy on CrackVision12K, with 33% lower power consumption (5.6 mJ).

Conclusion: EECD-Net offers a scalable, low-power solution for real-time infrastructure monitoring in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Crack detection on road surfaces is a critical measurement technology in the
instrumentation domain, essential for ensuring infrastructure safety and
transportation reliability. However, due to limited energy and low-resolution
imaging, smart terminal devices struggle to maintain real-time monitoring
performance. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-stage
detection approach for road crack detection, EECD-Net, to enhance accuracy and
energy efficiency of instrumentation. Specifically, the sophisticated
Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) is employed to address
the inherent challenges of low-quality images, which effectively enhance image
resolution while preserving critical structural details. Meanwhile, a Spike
Convolution Unit (SCU) with Continuous Integrate-and-Fire (CIF) neurons is
proposed to convert these images into sparse pulse sequences, significantly
reducing power consumption. Additionally, a Gated Attention Transformer (GAT)
module is designed to strategically fuse multi-scale feature representations
through adaptive attention mechanisms, effectively capturing both long-range
dependencies and intricate local crack patterns, and significantly enhancing
detection robustness across varying crack morphologies. The experiments on the
CrackVision12K benchmark demonstrate that EECD-Net achieves a remarkable 98.6\%
detection accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art counterparts such as
Hybrid-Segmentor by a significant 1.5\%. Notably, the EECD-Net maintains
exceptional energy efficiency, consuming merely 5.6 mJ, which is a substantial
33\% reduction compared to baseline implementations. This work pioneers a
transformative approach in instrumentation-based crack detection, offering a
scalable, low-power solution for real-time, large-scale infrastructure
monitoring in resource-constrained environments.

*Heng Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Learnable Separable Kernels (LSKs), a plug-and-play module for single-image super-resolution (SISR) that enhances image frequency components, reducing parameters and computation by over 60% while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SISR methods rely on auxiliary structures for performance boosts, but LSKs aim to directly enhance frequency components for better efficiency and effectiveness.

Method: LSKs are rank-one matrices decomposed into orthogonal, mergeable one-dimensional kernels, designed to enhance frequency components. The method includes interpretable analysis of feature maps.

Result: LSKs reduce parameters and computation by over 60%, improve model performance, and excel with higher upscaling factors. Visualization confirms effective frequency enhancement.

Conclusion: LSKs offer a lightweight, efficient solution for SISR, improving performance and scalability while maintaining interpretability.

Abstract: Existing approaches often enhance the performance of single-image
super-resolution (SISR) methods by incorporating auxiliary structures, such as
specialized loss functions, to indirectly boost the quality of low-resolution
images. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play module called Learnable
Separable Kernels (LSKs), which are formally rank-one matrices designed to
directly enhance image frequency components. We begin by explaining why LSKs
are particularly suitable for SISR tasks from a frequency perspective. Baseline
methods incorporating LSKs demonstrate a significant reduction of over 60\% in
both the number of parameters and computational requirements. This reduction is
achieved through the decomposition of LSKs into orthogonal and mergeable
one-dimensional kernels. Additionally, we perform an interpretable analysis of
the feature maps generated by LSKs. Visualization results reveal the capability
of LSKs to enhance image frequency components effectively. Extensive
experiments show that incorporating LSKs not only reduces the number of
parameters and computational load but also improves overall model performance.
Moreover, these experiments demonstrate that models utilizing LSKs exhibit
superior performance, particularly as the upscaling factor increases.

*Yunhao Gou,Kai Chen,Zhili Liu,Lanqing Hong,Xin Jin,Zhenguo Li,James T. Kwok,Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RACRO enhances multi-modal reasoning by aligning visual captioning with reasoning objectives via reinforcement learning, improving performance and scalability without costly retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending slow-thinking language models to multi-modal tasks is challenging due to high retraining costs for vision-language alignment. Decoupling perception from reasoning introduces the need for faithful and informative visual descriptions.

Method: Proposes RACRO, a reasoning-guided reinforcement learning strategy that optimizes caption rewards to align visual extraction with reasoning goals.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multi-modal benchmarks, with improved visual grounding and scalability.

Conclusion: RACRO enables efficient multi-modal reasoning without costly re-alignment, offering plug-and-play adaptability to advanced reasoning models.

Abstract: Recent advances in slow-thinking language models (e.g., OpenAI-o1 and
DeepSeek-R1) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in complex reasoning tasks
by emulating human-like reflective cognition. However, extending such
capabilities to multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) remains challenging
due to the high cost of retraining vision-language alignments when upgrading
the underlying reasoner LLMs. A straightforward solution is to decouple
perception from reasoning, i.e., converting visual inputs into language
representations (e.g., captions) that are then passed to a powerful text-only
reasoner. However, this decoupling introduces a critical challenge: the visual
extractor must generate descriptions that are both faithful to the image and
informative enough to support accurate downstream reasoning. To address this,
we propose Reasoning-Aligned Perceptual Decoupling via Caption Reward
Optimization (RACRO) - a reasoning-guided reinforcement learning strategy that
aligns the extractor's captioning behavior with the reasoning objective. By
closing the perception-reasoning loop via reward-based optimization, RACRO
significantly enhances visual grounding and extracts reasoning-optimized
representations. Experiments on multi-modal math and science benchmarks show
that the proposed RACRO method achieves state-of-the-art average performance
while enabling superior scalability and plug-and-play adaptation to more
advanced reasoning LLMs without the necessity for costly multi-modal
re-alignment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LGM-Pose introduces a lightweight single-branch network with global modeling for multi-person pose estimation, outperforming multi-branch CNN methods in efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-branch CNN methods for pose estimation lack global context and suffer from high latency due to redundant structures.

Method: Proposes LGM-Pose with MobileViM Block and LARM for global context, and SFusion for multi-scale integration.

Result: Achieves fewer parameters, better performance, and faster speeds on COCO and MPII datasets.

Conclusion: LGM-Pose offers a more efficient and accurate alternative to existing lightweight pose estimation methods.

Abstract: Most of the current top-down multi-person pose estimation lightweight methods
are based on multi-branch parallel pure CNN network architecture, which often
struggle to capture the global context required for detecting semantically
complex keypoints and are hindered by high latency due to their intricate and
redundant structures. In this article, an approximate single-branch lightweight
global modeling network (LGM-Pose) is proposed to address these challenges. In
the network, a lightweight MobileViM Block is designed with a proposed
Lightweight Attentional Representation Module (LARM), which integrates
information within and between patches using the Non-Parametric Transformation
Operation(NPT-Op) to extract global information. Additionally, a novel
Shuffle-Integrated Fusion Module (SFusion) is introduced to effectively
integrate multi-scale information, mitigating performance degradation often
observed in single-branch structures. Experimental evaluations on the COCO and
MPII datasets demonstrate that our approach not only reduces the number of
parameters compared to existing mainstream lightweight methods but also
achieves superior performance and faster processing speeds.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Follow-Your-Creation is a 4D video framework for generating and editing content from monocular video using video inpainting, composite masks, and iterative tuning for consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable flexible 4D video creation and editing from a single monocular video, addressing challenges like camera trajectory changes and user edits.

Method: Uses video inpainting as a generative prior, composite masks for training, and self-iterative tuning for temporal consistency. Includes a temporal packaging module for inference.

Result: Generates high-quality 4D videos with multi-view coherence and supports prompt-based editing, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively leverages prior knowledge for robust 4D video generation and editing, offering superior flexibility and quality.

Abstract: We introduce Follow-Your-Creation, a novel 4D video creation framework
capable of both generating and editing 4D content from a single monocular video
input. By leveraging a powerful video inpainting foundation model as a
generative prior, we reformulate 4D video creation as a video inpainting task,
enabling the model to fill in missing content caused by camera trajectory
changes or user edits. To facilitate this, we generate composite masked
inpainting video data to effectively fine-tune the model for 4D video
generation. Given an input video and its associated camera trajectory, we first
perform depth-based point cloud rendering to obtain invisibility masks that
indicate the regions that should be completed. Simultaneously, editing masks
are introduced to specify user-defined modifications, and these are combined
with the invisibility masks to create a composite masks dataset. During
training, we randomly sample different types of masks to construct diverse and
challenging inpainting scenarios, enhancing the model's generalization and
robustness in various 4D editing and generation tasks. To handle temporal
consistency under large camera motion, we design a self-iterative tuning
strategy that gradually increases the viewing angles during training, where the
model is used to generate the next-stage training data after each fine-tuning
iteration. Moreover, we introduce a temporal packaging module during inference
to enhance generation quality. Our method effectively leverages the prior
knowledge of the base model without degrading its original performance,
enabling the generation of 4D videos with consistent multi-view coherence. In
addition, our approach supports prompt-based content editing, demonstrating
strong flexibility and significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods in
both quality and versatility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HEC for hierarchical continual learning in embodied agents and Task-aware MoILE to reduce forgetting, outperforming other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the neglect of high-level planning in continual learning for embodied intelligence.

Method: Proposes HEC with two learning layers and Task-aware MoILE using clustering and dual routers for LoRA expert selection, with SVD for parameter preservation.

Result: Outperforms others in reducing catastrophic forgetting, retaining prior knowledge while learning new tasks.

Conclusion: HEC and Task-aware MoILE effectively support continual learning in embodied agents.

Abstract: Previous continual learning setups for embodied intelligence focused on
executing low-level actions based on human commands, neglecting the ability to
learn high-level planning and multi-level knowledge. To address these issues,
we propose the Hierarchical Embodied Continual Learning Setups (HEC) that
divide the agent's continual learning process into two layers: high-level
instructions and low-level actions, and define five embodied continual learning
sub-setups. Building on these setups, we introduce the Task-aware Mixture of
Incremental LoRA Experts (Task-aware MoILE) method. This approach achieves task
recognition by clustering visual-text embeddings and uses both a task-level
router and a token-level router to select the appropriate LoRA experts. To
effectively address the issue of catastrophic forgetting, we apply Singular
Value Decomposition (SVD) to the LoRA parameters obtained from prior tasks,
preserving key components while orthogonally training the remaining parts. The
experimental results show that our method stands out in reducing the forgetting
of old tasks compared to other methods, effectively supporting agents in
retaining prior knowledge while continuously learning new tasks.

TL;DR: SmartAvatar is a framework for creating customizable, animation-ready 3D avatars from photos or text, using vision-language models and iterative refinement for high-quality results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based methods lack precise control over human identity, body shape, and animation readiness. SmartAvatar addresses this by integrating vision-language models and parametric human generators.

Method: Leverages VLMs and parametric human generators with an autonomous verification loop. The system iteratively refines avatars by evaluating facial similarity, anatomical plausibility, and prompt alignment.

Result: Outperforms other avatar generation systems in mesh quality, identity fidelity, attribute accuracy, and animation readiness.

Conclusion: SmartAvatar is a versatile tool for realistic, customizable avatar creation, suitable for consumer-grade hardware and downstream applications.

Abstract: SmartAvatar is a vision-language-agent-driven framework for generating fully
rigged, animation-ready 3D human avatars from a single photo or textual prompt.
While diffusion-based methods have made progress in general 3D object
generation, they continue to struggle with precise control over human identity,
body shape, and animation readiness. In contrast, SmartAvatar leverages the
commonsense reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (VLMs) in
combination with off-the-shelf parametric human generators to deliver
high-quality, customizable avatars. A key innovation is an autonomous
verification loop, where the agent renders draft avatars, evaluates facial
similarity, anatomical plausibility, and prompt alignment, and iteratively
adjusts generation parameters for convergence. This interactive, AI-guided
refinement process promotes fine-grained control over both facial and body
features, enabling users to iteratively refine their avatars via
natural-language conversations. Unlike diffusion models that rely on static
pre-trained datasets and offer limited flexibility, SmartAvatar brings users
into the modeling loop and ensures continuous improvement through an LLM-driven
procedural generation and verification system. The generated avatars are fully
rigged and support pose manipulation with consistent identity and appearance,
making them suitable for downstream animation and interactive applications.
Quantitative benchmarks and user studies demonstrate that SmartAvatar
outperforms recent text- and image-driven avatar generation systems in terms of
reconstructed mesh quality, identity fidelity, attribute accuracy, and
animation readiness, making it a versatile tool for realistic, customizable
avatar creation on consumer-grade hardware.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve depth map reliability by addressing unreliable regions while preserving geometric cues, applicable in autonomous driving, robotics, and immersive tech.

Method: Uses a stochastic stage to detect unreliable depth regions and infer structure, followed by a deterministic stage for refinement using uncertainty maps.

Result: Produces dense, artifact-free depth maps with improved reliability, validated by experiments and theoretical analysis.

Conclusion: Sets a new baseline for depth enhancement, demonstrating robustness and scalability in real-world applications.

Abstract: We propose a novel two-stage framework for sensor depth enhancement, called
Perfecting Depth. This framework leverages the stochastic nature of diffusion
models to automatically detect unreliable depth regions while preserving
geometric cues. In the first stage (stochastic estimation), the method
identifies unreliable measurements and infers geometric structure by leveraging
a training-inference domain gap. In the second stage (deterministic
refinement), it enforces structural consistency and pixel-level accuracy using
the uncertainty map derived from the first stage. By combining stochastic
uncertainty modeling with deterministic refinement, our method yields dense,
artifact-free depth maps with improved reliability. Experimental results
demonstrate its effectiveness across diverse real-world scenarios. Furthermore,
theoretical analysis, various experiments, and qualitative visualizations
validate its robustness and scalability. Our framework sets a new baseline for
sensor depth enhancement, with potential applications in autonomous driving,

TL;DR: The paper surveys how deep learning has transformed traditional image matching pipelines, categorizing advancements into learnable replacements and end-to-end modules, and benchmarks methods on key tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image matching pipelines struggle in challenging scenarios, prompting the need for deep learning innovations to enhance robustness and accuracy.

Method: The survey reviews deep learning advancements in two ways: replacing traditional pipeline steps with learnable alternatives and merging steps into end-to-end modules.

Result: Benchmarking shows improved performance in tasks like pose recovery and homography estimation, though challenges remain.

Conclusion: The paper provides a clear taxonomy of deep learning-driven image matching, identifies open challenges, and suggests future research directions.

Abstract: Image matching, which establishes correspondences between two-view images to
recover 3D structure and camera geometry, serves as a cornerstone in computer
vision and underpins a wide range of applications, including visual
localization, 3D reconstruction, and simultaneous localization and mapping
(SLAM). Traditional pipelines composed of ``detector-descriptor, feature
matcher, outlier filter, and geometric estimator'' falter in challenging
scenarios. Recent deep-learning advances have significantly boosted both
robustness and accuracy. This survey adopts a unique perspective by
comprehensively reviewing how deep learning has incrementally transformed the
classical image matching pipeline. Our taxonomy highly aligns with the
traditional pipeline in two key aspects: i) the replacement of individual steps
in the traditional pipeline with learnable alternatives, including learnable
detector-descriptor, outlier filter, and geometric estimator; and ii) the
merging of multiple steps into end-to-end learnable modules, encompassing
middle-end sparse matcher, end-to-end semi-dense/dense matcher, and pose
regressor. We first examine the design principles, advantages, and limitations
of both aspects, and then benchmark representative methods on relative pose
recovery, homography estimation, and visual localization tasks. Finally, we
discuss open challenges and outline promising directions for future research.
By systematically categorizing and evaluating deep learning-driven strategies,
this survey offers a clear overview of the evolving image matching landscape
and highlights key avenues for further innovation.

TL;DR: STARE is a benchmark for evaluating multimodal LLMs on spatial reasoning tasks, showing models struggle with complex visual simulations compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI benchmarks focus on verbal reasoning, neglecting non-verbal, multi-step visual simulation tasks essential for spatial cognition.

Method: STARE includes 4K tasks covering geometric transformations, integrated spatial reasoning, and real-world spatial challenges.

Result: Models perform well on simple 2D tasks but poorly on complex 3D tasks like cube net folding. Humans outperform models but benefit from visual simulations.

Conclusion: Models lack effective use of intermediate visual information, highlighting a gap in spatial reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Spatial cognition is essential for human intelligence, enabling
problem-solving through visual simulations rather than solely relying on verbal
reasoning. However, existing AI benchmarks primarily assess verbal reasoning,
neglecting the complexities of non-verbal, multi-step visual simulation. We
introduce STARE(Spatial Transformations and Reasoning Evaluation), a benchmark
designed to rigorously evaluate multimodal large language models on tasks
better solved through multi-step visual simulation. STARE features 4K tasks
spanning foundational geometric transformations (2D and 3D), integrated spatial
reasoning (cube net folding and tangram puzzles), and real-world spatial
reasoning (perspective and temporal reasoning), reflecting practical cognitive
challenges like object assembly, mechanical diagram interpretation, and
everyday spatial navigation. Our evaluations show that models excel at
reasoning over simpler 2D transformations, but perform close to random chance
on more complex tasks like 3D cube net folding and tangram puzzles that require
multi-step visual simulations. Humans achieve near-perfect accuracy but take
considerable time (up to 28.9s) on complex tasks, significantly speeding up
(down by 7.5 seconds on average) with intermediate visual simulations. In
contrast, models exhibit inconsistent performance gains from visual
simulations, improving on most tasks but declining in specific cases like
tangram puzzles (GPT-4o, o1) and cube net folding (Claude-3.5, Gemini-2.0
Flash), indicating that models may not know how to effectively leverage
intermediate visual information.

TL;DR: TADiSR is a diffusion-based SR framework that improves text fidelity in super-resolved images using text-aware attention and joint segmentation decoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models for image super-resolution often distort text structures, necessitating a solution to preserve text fidelity.

Method: The paper introduces TADiSR, combining text-aware attention and joint segmentation decoders, and a pipeline for synthesizing high-quality images with text masks.

Result: TADiSR enhances text legibility and achieves state-of-the-art performance in super-resolution metrics.

Conclusion: The framework effectively recovers text structures in degraded images and generalizes well to real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The introduction of generative models has significantly advanced image
super-resolution (SR) in handling real-world degradations. However, they often
incur fidelity-related issues, particularly distorting textual structures. In
this paper, we introduce a novel diffusion-based SR framework, namely TADiSR,
which integrates text-aware attention and joint segmentation decoders to
recover not only natural details but also the structural fidelity of text
regions in degraded real-world images. Moreover, we propose a complete pipeline
for synthesizing high-quality images with fine-grained full-image text masks,
combining realistic foreground text regions with detailed background content.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially enhances text
legibility in super-resolved images, achieving state-of-the-art performance
across multiple evaluation metrics and exhibiting strong generalization to
real-world scenarios. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FPSAttention combines FP8 quantization and sparsity for faster video generation without quality loss, achieving 7.09x kernel speedup and 4.96x end-to-end speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Slow inference speeds and high computational demands of diffusion models hinder practical deployment.

Method: Introduces FPSAttention, a joint optimization of FP8 quantization and sparsity with 3D tile-wise granularity, step-aware strategy, and hardware-friendly kernel.

Result: Achieves significant speedups (7.09x kernel, 4.96x end-to-end) without quality degradation on VBench.

Conclusion: FPSAttention enables efficient, high-quality video generation by co-designing quantization and sparsity.

Abstract: Diffusion generative models have become the standard for producing
high-quality, coherent video content, yet their slow inference speeds and high
computational demands hinder practical deployment. Although both quantization
and sparsity can independently accelerate inference while maintaining
generation quality, naively combining these techniques in existing
training-free approaches leads to significant performance degradation due to
the lack of joint optimization.We introduce FPSAttention, a novel
training-aware co-design of FP8 quantization and sparsity for video generation,
with a focus on the 3D bi-directional attention mechanism. Our approach
features three key innovations: 1) A unified 3D tile-wise granularity that
simultaneously supports both quantization and sparsity; 2) A denoising
step-aware strategy that adapts to the noise schedule, addressing the strong
correlation between quantization/sparsity errors and denoising steps; 3) A
native, hardware-friendly kernel that leverages FlashAttention and is
implemented with optimized Hopper architecture features for highly efficient
execution. Trained on Wan2.1's 1.3B and 14B models and evaluated on the VBench
benchmark, FPSAttention achieves a 7.09x kernel speedup for attention
operations and a 4.96x end-to-end speedup for video generation compared to the
BF16 baseline at 720p resolution-without sacrificing generation quality.

*Takayuki Komatsu,Yoshiyuki Ohmura,Kayato Nishitsunoi,Yasuo Kuniyoshi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to apply group decomposition theory in representation learning, combining feature extraction and object segmentation for realistic scenarios, validated on real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of conventional representation learning, which assumes disentangled independent feature axes but fails to account for conditional independence, and to enable real-world application of group decomposition theory.

Method: The study combines feature extraction and object segmentation, replacing pixel translation with feature translation and grouping features under the same transformation.

Result: The proposed method was validated on a practical dataset with real-world objects and backgrounds, showing promise for realistic applications.

Conclusion: The model advances representation learning by addressing prior limitations and may enhance understanding of human object recognition development.

Abstract: The main goal of representation learning is to acquire meaningful
representations from real-world sensory inputs without supervision.
Representation learning explains some aspects of human development. Various
neural network (NN) models have been proposed that acquire empirically good
representations. However, the formulation of a good representation has not been
established. We recently proposed a method for categorizing changes between a
pair of sensory inputs. A unique feature of this approach is that
transformations between two sensory inputs are learned to satisfy algebraic
structural constraints. Conventional representation learning often assumes that
disentangled independent feature axes is a good representation; however, we
found that such a representation cannot account for conditional independence.
To overcome this problem, we proposed a new method using group decomposition in
Galois algebra theory. Although this method is promising for defining a more
general representation, it assumes pixel-to-pixel translation without feature
extraction, and can only process low-resolution images with no background,
which prevents real-world application. In this study, we provide a simple
method to apply our group decomposition theory to a more realistic scenario by
combining feature extraction and object segmentation. We replace pixel
translation with feature translation and formulate object segmentation as
grouping features under the same transformation. We validated the proposed
method on a practical dataset containing both real-world object and background.
We believe that our model will lead to a better understanding of human
development of object recognition in the real world.

*Zhong Ji,Rongshuai Wei,Jingren Liu,Yanwei Pang,Jungong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes FSPCC, a framework for few-shot prototypical concept classification, addressing parametric imbalance and representation misalignment in data-scarce settings. It uses MoLE for parameter-efficient adaptation and cross-module concept guidance for alignment. Results show significant performance gains over existing SEMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SEMs struggle in data-scarce settings due to parametric imbalance and representation misalignment, limiting their interpretability and performance.

Method: FSPCC leverages MoLE for parameter-efficient adaptation, cross-module concept guidance for alignment, multi-level feature preservation, and a geometry-aware concept discrimination loss.

Result: Experiments on six benchmarks show 4.2%-8.7% relative gains in 5-way 5-shot classification, outperforming existing SEMs.

Conclusion: The framework successfully combines concept learning with few-shot adaptation, improving accuracy and interpretability for transparent visual recognition systems.

Abstract: Self-Explainable Models (SEMs) rely on Prototypical Concept Learning (PCL) to
enable their visual recognition processes more interpretable, but they often
struggle in data-scarce settings where insufficient training samples lead to
suboptimal performance.To address this limitation, we propose a Few-Shot
Prototypical Concept Classification (FSPCC) framework that systematically
mitigates two key challenges under low-data regimes: parametric imbalance and
representation misalignment. Specifically, our approach leverages a Mixture of
LoRA Experts (MoLE) for parameter-efficient adaptation, ensuring a balanced
allocation of trainable parameters between the backbone and the PCL
module.Meanwhile, cross-module concept guidance enforces tight alignment
between the backbone's feature representations and the prototypical concept
activation patterns.In addition, we incorporate a multi-level feature
preservation strategy that fuses spatial and semantic cues across various
layers, thereby enriching the learned representations and mitigating the
challenges posed by limited data availability.Finally, to enhance
interpretability and minimize concept overlap, we introduce a geometry-aware
concept discrimination loss that enforces orthogonality among concepts,
encouraging more disentangled and transparent decision boundaries.Experimental
results on six popular benchmarks (CUB-200-2011, mini-ImageNet, CIFAR-FS,
Stanford Cars, FGVC-Aircraft, and DTD) demonstrate that our approach
consistently outperforms existing SEMs by a notable margin, with 4.2%-8.7%
relative gains in 5-way 5-shot classification.These findings highlight the
efficacy of coupling concept learning with few-shot adaptation to achieve both
higher accuracy and clearer model interpretability, paving the way for more
transparent visual recognition systems.

TL;DR: Gen-n-Val is a novel framework using LLMs and VLLMs to generate high-quality synthetic data for computer vision tasks, reducing invalid data and improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing data scarcity and label noise in computer vision tasks by improving synthetic data generation.

Method: Leverages Layer Diffusion, LLMs, and VLLMs for single-object mask generation and validation, refined via TextGrad and image harmonization.

Result: Reduces invalid synthetic data from 50% to 7%, improves mAP by 1% on rare classes, and shows 7.1% mAP improvement in open-vocabulary detection.

Conclusion: Gen-n-Val significantly enhances synthetic data quality and model performance in instance segmentation and object detection.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Large Language Models
(VLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance as agents across various tasks
while data scarcity and label noise remain significant challenges in computer
vision tasks, such as object detection and instance segmentation. A common
solution for resolving these issues is to generate synthetic data. However,
current synthetic data generation methods struggle with issues, such as
multiple objects per mask, inaccurate segmentation, and incorrect category
labels, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce
Gen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer
Diffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality, single-object masks
and diverse backgrounds. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: (1) The LD prompt
agent, an LLM, optimizes prompts for LD to generate high-quality foreground
instance images and segmentation masks. These optimized prompts ensure the
generation of single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and
clean backgrounds. (2) The data validation agent, a VLLM, which filters out
low-quality synthetic instance images. The system prompts for both agents are
refined through TextGrad. Additionally, we use image harmonization to combine
multiple instances within scenes. Compared to state-of-the-art synthetic data
approaches like MosaicFusion, our approach reduces invalid synthetic data from
50% to 7% and improves performance by 1% mAP on rare classes in COCO instance
segmentation with YOLOv9c and YOLO11m. Furthermore, Gen-n-Val shows significant
improvements (7. 1% mAP) over YOLO-Worldv2-M in open-vocabulary object
detection benchmarks with YOLO11m. Moreover, Gen-n-Val improves the performance
of YOLOv9 and YOLO11 families in instance segmentation and object detection.

TL;DR: MARS, a multi-scale aware radiomap super-resolution method, combines CNNs and Transformers to improve radio map reconstruction accuracy by leveraging global and local features, outperforming baselines in MSE and SSIM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate radio map reconstruction from sparse measurements is challenging due to the limitations of traditional methods and deep learning approaches that lack generalization.

Method: MARS integrates CNNs and Transformers with multi-scale feature fusion and residual connections to enhance feature representation across different receptive fields.

Result: MARS outperforms baseline models in MSE and SSIM across various scenes and antenna locations, with low computational cost.

Conclusion: MARS demonstrates strong practical potential for applications like smart cities, IoT, and wireless network planning.

Abstract: Radio maps reflect the spatial distribution of signal strength and are
essential for applications like smart cities, IoT, and wireless network
planning. However, reconstructing accurate radio maps from sparse measurements
remains challenging. Traditional interpolation and inpainting methods lack
environmental awareness, while many deep learning approaches depend on detailed
scene data, limiting generalization. To address this, we propose MARS, a
Multi-scale Aware Radiomap Super-resolution method that combines CNNs and
Transformers with multi-scale feature fusion and residual connections. MARS
focuses on both global and local feature extraction, enhancing feature
representation across different receptive fields and improving reconstruction
accuracy. Experiments across different scenes and antenna locations show that
MARS outperforms baseline models in both MSE and SSIM, while maintaining low
computational cost, demonstrating strong practical potential.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HoliSafe, a comprehensive safety dataset and benchmark for Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and SafeLLaVA, a novel VLM with safety enhancements, achieving state-of-the-art safety performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety-tuning datasets and benchmarks for VLMs are limited, leaving models vulnerable to unseen harmful configurations. Existing methods also lack architectural innovations for intrinsic safety.

Method: The authors propose HoliSafe, a dataset covering all safe/unsafe image-text combinations, and SafeLLaVA, a VLM with a learnable safety meta token and safety head for improved safety and interpretability.

Result: SafeLLaVA trained on HoliSafe achieves top safety performance on multiple benchmarks, and HoliSafe exposes vulnerabilities in existing models.

Conclusion: HoliSafe and SafeLLaVA advance robust and interpretable VLM safety, encouraging further research in multimodal alignment.

Abstract: Despite emerging efforts to enhance the safety of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), current approaches face two main shortcomings. 1) Existing
safety-tuning datasets and benchmarks only partially consider how image-text
interactions can yield harmful content, often overlooking contextually unsafe
outcomes from seemingly benign pairs. This narrow coverage leaves VLMs
vulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely
primarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to
intrinsically strengthen safety. We address these gaps by introducing a
holistic safety dataset and benchmark, HoliSafe, that spans all five
safe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both
training and evaluation. We further propose SafeLLaVA, a novel VLM augmented
with a learnable safety meta token and a dedicated safety head. The meta token
encodes harmful visual cues during training, intrinsically guiding the language
model toward safer responses, while the safety head offers interpretable
harmfulness classification aligned with refusal rationales. Experiments show
that SafeLLaVA, trained on HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety
performance across multiple VLM benchmarks. Additionally, the HoliSafe
benchmark itself reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing models. We hope
that HoliSafe and SafeLLaVA will spur further research into robust and
interpretable VLM safety, expanding future avenues for multimodal alignment.

TL;DR: The paper explores how multimodal language models like LLaVA-Next represent images in their hidden activations, finding linearly decodable ImageNet class features and demonstrating their causality through targeted edits. It also trains Sparse Autoencoders to enhance interpretability and observes increasing modality-sharing in deeper layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how multimodal models internally represent visual inputs and whether these representations are interpretable and causal.

Method: Analyzes LLaVA-Next's hidden activations for ImageNet class features, tests causality via targeted edits, and trains multimodal Sparse Autoencoders to study feature diversity and interpretability.

Result: Identifies linearly decodable and causal image features, creates an interpretable dictionary of multimodal features, and observes increasing modality-sharing in deeper layers.

Conclusion: Multimodal models represent images via interpretable and causal features, with deeper layers showing more shared representations across modalities.

Abstract: Language models can be equipped with multimodal capabilities by fine-tuning
on embeddings of visual inputs. But how do such multimodal models represent
images in their hidden activations? We explore representations of image
concepts within LlaVA-Next, a popular open-source VLLM. We find a diverse set
of ImageNet classes represented via linearly decodable features in the residual
stream. We show that the features are causal by performing targeted edits on
the model output. In order to increase the diversity of the studied linear
features, we train multimodal Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), creating a highly
interpretable dictionary of text and image features. We find that although
model representations across modalities are quite disjoint, they become
increasingly shared in deeper layers.

*Hanxin Wang,Tian Liu,Shu Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores robust few-shot adaptation of pretrained VLMs, proposing partial finetuning of the visual encoder with retrieval and adversarial augmentation to enhance both ID and OOD accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing OOD generalization in few-shot VLM adaptation is critical as models face OOD test data.

Method: Compares adaptation methods, proposes partial finetuning with retrieval and adversarial augmentation, and introduces SRAPF for staged optimization.

Result: SRAPF achieves state-of-the-art ID and OOD accuracy on ImageNet OOD benchmarks.

Conclusion: Partial finetuning with augmentation techniques (retrieval and adversarial) effectively balances ID and OOD accuracy, with SRAPF outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Pretrained VLMs achieve strong performance on downstream tasks when adapted
with just a few labeled examples. As the adapted models inevitably encounter
out-of-distribution (OOD) test data that deviates from the in-distribution (ID)
task-specific training data, enhancing OOD generalization in few-shot
adaptation is critically important. We study robust few-shot VLM adaptation,
aiming to increase both ID and OOD accuracy. By comparing different adaptation
methods (e.g., prompt tuning, linear probing, contrastive finetuning, and full
finetuning), we uncover three key findings: (1) finetuning with proper
hyperparameters significantly outperforms the popular VLM adaptation methods
prompt tuning and linear probing; (2) visual encoder-only finetuning achieves
better efficiency and accuracy than contrastively finetuning both visual and
textual encoders; (3) finetuning the top layers of the visual encoder provides
the best balance between ID and OOD accuracy. Building on these findings, we
propose partial finetuning of the visual encoder empowered with two simple
augmentation techniques: (1) retrieval augmentation which retrieves
task-relevant data from the VLM's pretraining dataset to enhance adaptation,
and (2) adversarial perturbation which promotes robustness during finetuning.
Results show that the former/latter boosts OOD/ID accuracy while slightly
sacrificing the ID/OOD accuracy. Yet, perhaps understandably, naively combining
the two does not maintain their best OOD/ID accuracy. We address this dilemma
with the developed SRAPF, Stage-wise Retrieval Augmentation-based Adversarial
Partial Finetuning. SRAPF consists of two stages: (1) partial finetuning the
visual encoder using both ID and retrieved data, and (2) adversarial partial
finetuning with few-shot ID data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SRAPF
achieves the state-of-the-art ID and OOD accuracy on the ImageNet OOD
benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for assessing AI-generated video quality using a multi-dimensional approach and leverages LLMs for regression, achieving second place in a 2025 challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AIGVs have visual quality defects (noise, blur, etc.) that degrade user experience, necessitating an effective assessment method for regulation and model improvement.

Method: Decomposes AIGV quality into technical, motion, and semantic dimensions, uses encoders for feature representation, and employs an LLM with multi-modal prompts and LoRA fine-tuning for quality regression.

Result: The method secured second place in the NTIRE 2025 Quality Assessment Challenge for AI-generated videos.

Conclusion: The approach effectively assesses AIGV quality, demonstrating its potential for improving content regulation and generative models.

Abstract: The development of AI-Generated Video (AIGV) technology has been remarkable
in recent years, significantly transforming the paradigm of video content
production. However, AIGVs still suffer from noticeable visual quality defects,
such as noise, blurriness, frame jitter and low dynamic degree, which severely
impact the user's viewing experience. Therefore, an effective automatic visual
quality assessment is of great importance for AIGV content regulation and
generative model improvement. In this work, we decompose the visual quality of
AIGVs into three dimensions: technical quality, motion quality, and video
semantics. For each dimension, we design corresponding encoder to achieve
effective feature representation. Moreover, considering the outstanding
performance of large language models (LLMs) in various vision and language
tasks, we introduce a LLM as the quality regression module. To better enable
the LLM to establish reasoning associations between multi-dimensional features
and visual quality, we propose a specially designed multi-modal prompt
engineering framework. Additionally, we incorporate LoRA fine-tuning technology
during the training phase, allowing the LLM to better adapt to specific tasks.
Our proposed method achieved \textbf{second place} in the NTIRE 2025 Quality

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces iDPOE, a novel imitation learning method for predicting dissection trajectories in ESD videos, improving surgical training and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting dissection trajectories in ESD videos can enhance surgical training, but existing methods struggle with uncertainty, geometric symmetries, and generalization.

Method: iDPOE uses a diffusion model for policy learning, captures stochastic trajectories, and incorporates equivariant representations for geometric symmetries.

Result: Experiments on 2000 ESD clips show iDPOE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in trajectory prediction.

Conclusion: iDPOE is the first imitation learning approach for surgical skill development in dissection trajectory prediction, offering robust and accurate results.

Abstract: Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is a well-established technique for
removing epithelial lesions. Predicting dissection trajectories in ESD videos
offers significant potential for enhancing surgical skill training and
simplifying the learning process, yet this area remains underexplored. While
imitation learning has shown promise in acquiring skills from expert
demonstrations, challenges persist in handling uncertain future movements,
learning geometric symmetries, and generalizing to diverse surgical scenarios.
To address these, we introduce a novel approach: Implicit Diffusion Policy with
Equivariant Representations for Imitation Learning (iDPOE). Our method models
expert behavior through a joint state action distribution, capturing the
stochastic nature of dissection trajectories and enabling robust visual
representation learning across various endoscopic views. By incorporating a
diffusion model into policy learning, iDPOE ensures efficient training and
sampling, leading to more accurate predictions and better generalization.
Additionally, we enhance the model's ability to generalize to geometric
symmetries by embedding equivariance into the learning process. To address
state mismatches, we develop a forward-process guided action inference strategy
for conditional sampling. Using an ESD video dataset of nearly 2000 clips,
experimental results show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods,
both explicit and implicit, in trajectory prediction. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first application of imitation learning to surgical
skill development for dissection trajectory prediction.

*Mikhail Kennerley,Angelica Alives-Reviro,Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb,Robby T. Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LAT is a label transfer framework that aligns annotations from diverse datasets into a target label space, improving detection performance without manual relabeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inconsistencies in class semantics and bounding box annotations across datasets hinder generalization in object detection. Existing methods either assume shared taxonomies or require manual effort.

Method: LAT uses dataset-specific detectors to generate pseudo-labels, combines them with ground-truth via a Privileged Proposal Generator (PPG), and refines features with a Semantic Feature Fusion (SFF) module.

Result: LAT improves target-domain detection performance by up to +4.8AP over baselines.

Conclusion: LAT effectively addresses class and spatial misalignments without shared label spaces or manual annotations, enhancing generalization.

Abstract: Combining multiple object detection datasets offers a path to improved
generalisation but is hindered by inconsistencies in class semantics and
bounding box annotations. Some methods to address this assume shared label
taxonomies and address only spatial inconsistencies; others require manual
relabelling, or produce a unified label space, which may be unsuitable when a
fixed target label space is required. We propose Label-Aligned Transfer (LAT),
a label transfer framework that systematically projects annotations from
diverse source datasets into the label space of a target dataset. LAT begins by
training dataset-specific detectors to generate pseudo-labels, which are then
combined with ground-truth annotations via a Privileged Proposal Generator
(PPG) that replaces the region proposal network in two-stage detectors. To
further refine region features, a Semantic Feature Fusion (SFF) module injects
class-aware context and features from overlapping proposals using a
confidence-weighted attention mechanism. This pipeline preserves
dataset-specific annotation granularity while enabling many-to-one label space
transfer across heterogeneous datasets, resulting in a semantically and
spatially aligned representation suitable for training a downstream detector.
LAT thus jointly addresses both class-level misalignments and bounding box
inconsistencies without relying on shared label spaces or manual annotations.
Across multiple benchmarks, LAT demonstrates consistent improvements in
target-domain detection performance, achieving gains of up to +4.8AP over
semi-supervised baselines.

*Shuhan Xu,Siyuan Liang,Hongling Zheng,Yong Luo,Aishan Liu,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are vulnerable to stealthy backdoor attacks, leading to malicious captions. The proposed Semantic Reward Defense (SRD) mitigates these attacks without trigger knowledge, reducing success rates to 5.6%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent studies reveal VLMs' susceptibility to backdoor attacks, where attackers inject imperceptible perturbations to control model outputs, necessitating robust defense mechanisms.

Method: SRD employs reinforcement learning with a Deep Q-Network to apply discrete perturbations to sensitive image regions, guided by a semantic fidelity score to disrupt malicious pathways.

Result: SRD reduces attack success rates to 5.6% while maintaining caption quality on clean inputs with minimal performance drop (<10%).

Conclusion: SRD provides an effective, trigger-agnostic defense against backdoor attacks in multimodal generative models, ensuring robustness without compromising output quality.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in image
captioning, but recent studies show they are vulnerable to backdoor attacks.
Attackers can inject imperceptible perturbations-such as local pixel triggers
or global semantic phrases-into the training data, causing the model to
generate malicious, attacker-controlled captions for specific inputs. These
attacks are hard to detect and defend due to their stealthiness and cross-modal
nature. By analyzing attack samples, we identify two key vulnerabilities: (1)
abnormal attention concentration on specific image regions, and (2) semantic
drift and incoherence in generated captions. To counter this, we propose
Semantic Reward Defense (SRD), a reinforcement learning framework that
mitigates backdoor behavior without prior knowledge of triggers. SRD uses a
Deep Q-Network to learn policies for applying discrete perturbations (e.g.,
occlusion, color masking) to sensitive image regions, aiming to disrupt the
activation of malicious pathways. We design a semantic fidelity score as the
reward signal, which jointly evaluates semantic consistency and linguistic
fluency of the output, guiding the agent toward generating robust yet faithful
captions. Experiments across mainstream VLMs and datasets show SRD reduces
attack success rates to 5.6%, while preserving caption quality on clean inputs
with less than 10% performance drop. SRD offers a trigger-agnostic,
interpretable defense paradigm against stealthy backdoor threats in multimodal
generative models.

### [230] [Physics Informed Capsule Enhanced Variational AutoEncoder for Underwater Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04753)
*Niki Martinel,Rita Pucci*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-stream architecture integrates the Jaffe-McGlamery model with capsule clustering for underwater image enhancement, achieving state-of-the-art results with lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance underwater images by combining physical modeling with feature learning, ensuring adherence to underwater constraints while preserving details.

Method: Uses a dual-stream approach: one stream estimates transmission maps and background light via physics, while the other learns features via capsule clustering. Includes a novel optimization objective for physical and perceptual quality.

Result: Outperforms existing methods by +0.5dB PSNR with one-third FLOPs or +1dB PSNR at similar computational budgets.

Conclusion: The method effectively balances physical accuracy and computational efficiency, setting a new benchmark for underwater image enhancement.

Abstract: We present a novel dual-stream architecture that achieves state-of-the-art
underwater image enhancement by explicitly integrating the Jaffe-McGlamery
physical model with capsule clustering-based feature representation learning.
Our method simultaneously estimates transmission maps and spatially-varying
background light through a dedicated physics estimator while extracting
entity-level features via capsule clustering in a parallel stream. This
physics-guided approach enables parameter-free enhancement that respects
underwater formation constraints while preserving semantic structures and
fine-grained details. Our approach also features a novel optimization objective
ensuring both physical adherence and perceptual quality across multiple spatial
frequencies. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments
across six challenging benchmarks. Results demonstrate consistent improvements
of $+0.5$dB PSNR over the best existing methods while requiring only one-third
of their computational complexity (FLOPs), or alternatively, more than $+1$dB
PSNR improvement when compared to methods with similar computational budgets.

### [231] [Truth in the Few: High-Value Data Selection for Efficient Multi-Modal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04755)
*Shenshen Li,Kaiyuan Deng,Lei Wang,Hao Yang,Chong Peng,Peng Yan,Fumin Shen,Heng Tao Shen,Xing Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper challenges the need for extensive training data in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) by identifying 'cognitive samples'—a sparse subset that triggers meaningful reasoning. It introduces Reasoning Activation Potential (RAP), a data selection paradigm with two estimators (CDE and ACE) and a Difficulty-aware Replacement Module (DRM). RAP achieves superior performance with only 9.3% of data, reducing computational costs by 43%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The assumption that extensive training data is necessary for MLLMs leads to redundancy and high costs. The paper questions whether smaller, high-value datasets can outperform full corpora for multi-modal reasoning.

Method: Proposes RAP, which identifies cognitive samples using two estimators: Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE) and Attention Confidence Estimator (ACE). Also introduces DRM to replace trivial samples with challenging ones.

Result: Experiments on six datasets show RAP achieves better performance with only 9.3% of training data and reduces computational costs by over 43%.

Conclusion: RAP demonstrates that smaller, high-value datasets can effectively replace full corpora for multi-modal reasoning in MLLMs, improving efficiency and reducing costs.

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in complex reasoning tasks via reinforcement learning, it is commonly
believed that extensive training data is necessary for improving multi-modal
reasoning ability, inevitably leading to data redundancy and substantial
computational costs. However, can smaller high-value datasets match or
outperform full corpora for multi-modal reasoning in MLLMs? In this work, we
challenge this assumption through a key observation: meaningful multi-modal
reasoning is triggered by only a sparse subset of training samples, termed
cognitive samples, whereas the majority contribute marginally. Building on this
insight, we propose a novel data selection paradigm termed Reasoning Activation
Potential (RAP), which identifies cognitive samples by estimating each sample's
potential to stimulate genuine multi-modal reasoning by two complementary
estimators: 1) Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE) based on the potential
outcome model principle, eliminates samples that overly rely on language priors
by comparing outputs between multi-modal and text-only inputs; 2) Attention
Confidence Estimator (ACE), which exploits token-level self-attention to
discard samples dominated by irrelevant but over-emphasized tokens in
intermediate reasoning stages. Moreover, we introduce a Difficulty-aware
Replacement Module (DRM) to substitute trivial instances with cognitively
challenging ones, thereby ensuring complexity for robust multi-modal reasoning.
Experiments on six datasets show that our RAP method consistently achieves
superior performance using only 9.3% of the training data, while reducing
computational costs by over 43%. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Leo-ssl/RAP.

### [232] [Toward Better SSIM Loss for Unsupervised Monocular Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04758)
*Yijun Cao,Fuya Luo,Yongjie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new form of SSIM for unsupervised monocular depth learning, replacing multiplication with addition in its components, leading to smoother gradients and better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use conventional SSIM without considering the impact of its components and hyperparameters on training.

Method: Introduces a modified SSIM function using addition instead of multiplication for combining luminance, contrast, and structural similarity components.

Result: The new SSIM loss function achieves higher performance on unsupervised depth estimation, outperforming the baseline on KITTI-2015.

Conclusion: The proposed SSIM modification improves training efficiency and depth estimation accuracy.

Abstract: Unsupervised monocular depth learning generally relies on the photometric
relation among temporally adjacent images. Most of previous works use both mean
absolute error (MAE) and structure similarity index measure (SSIM) with
conventional form as training loss. However, they ignore the effect of
different components in the SSIM function and the corresponding hyperparameters
on the training. To address these issues, this work proposes a new form of
SSIM. Compared with original SSIM function, the proposed new form uses addition
rather than multiplication to combine the luminance, contrast, and structural
similarity related components in SSIM. The loss function constructed with this
scheme helps result in smoother gradients and achieve higher performance on
unsupervised depth estimation. We conduct extensive experiments to determine
the relatively optimal combination of parameters for our new SSIM. Based on the
popular MonoDepth approach, the optimized SSIM loss function can remarkably
outperform the baseline on the KITTI-2015 outdoor dataset.

*Suhan Woo,Seongwon Lee,Jinwoo Jang,Euntai Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HypeVPR introduces a hierarchical embedding framework in hyperbolic space for Visual Place Recognition (VPR), leveraging panoramic views' hierarchical structures for improved performance and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world VPR applications require handling diverse query images from various viewpoints, which the P2E formulation addresses.

Method: HypeVPR uses hyperbolic space for hierarchical feature representation and a coarse-to-fine search strategy for efficient matching.

Result: HypeVPR outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 5x faster retrieval.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances speed and accuracy, making it suitable for real-world VPR applications.

Abstract: When applying Visual Place Recognition (VPR) to real-world mobile robots and
similar applications, perspective-to-equirectangular (P2E) formulation
naturally emerges as a suitable approach to accommodate diverse query images
captured from various viewpoints. In this paper, we introduce HypeVPR, a novel
hierarchical embedding framework in hyperbolic space, designed to address the
unique challenges of P2E VPR. The key idea behind HypeVPR is that visual
environments captured by panoramic views exhibit inherent hierarchical
structures. To leverage this property, we employ hyperbolic space to represent
hierarchical feature relationships and preserve distance properties within the
feature space. To achieve this, we propose a hierarchical feature aggregation
mechanism that organizes local-to-global feature representations within
hyperbolic space. Additionally, HypeVPR adopts an efficient coarse-to-fine
search strategy, optimally balancing speed and accuracy to ensure robust
matching, even between descriptors from different image types. This approach
enables HypeVPR to outperform state-of-the-art methods while significantly
reducing retrieval time, achieving up to 5x faster retrieval across diverse
benchmark datasets. The code and models will be released at
https://github.com/suhan-woo/HypeVPR.git.

*Gaia Di Lorenzo,Federico Tombari,Marc Pollefeys,Daniel Barath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Object-X is a multi-modal 3D object representation framework that encodes rich embeddings (images, point clouds, text) and decodes them into detailed geometric and visual reconstructions, supporting various tasks with high efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack versatility, as they are task-specific and cannot decode embeddings into explicit geometry or reuse them across tasks.

Method: Object-X grounds modalities in a 3D voxel grid, fuses them with object attributes into an unstructured embedding, and uses 3D Gaussian Splatting for reconstruction.

Result: Object-X achieves high-fidelity novel-view synthesis, improved geometric accuracy, competitive task performance, and significantly reduced storage requirements.

Conclusion: Object-X is a scalable, practical solution for multi-modal 3D scene representation, outperforming traditional approaches in versatility and efficiency.

Abstract: Learning effective multi-modal 3D representations of objects is essential for
numerous applications, such as augmented reality and robotics. Existing methods
often rely on task-specific embeddings that are tailored either for semantic
understanding or geometric reconstruction. As a result, these embeddings
typically cannot be decoded into explicit geometry and simultaneously reused
across tasks. In this paper, we propose Object-X, a versatile multi-modal
object representation framework capable of encoding rich object embeddings
(e.g. images, point cloud, text) and decoding them back into detailed geometric
and visual reconstructions. Object-X operates by geometrically grounding the
captured modalities in a 3D voxel grid and learning an unstructured embedding
fusing the information from the voxels with the object attributes. The learned
embedding enables 3D Gaussian Splatting-based object reconstruction, while also
supporting a range of downstream tasks, including scene alignment, single-image
3D object reconstruction, and localization. Evaluations on two challenging
real-world datasets demonstrate that Object-X produces high-fidelity novel-view
synthesis comparable to standard 3D Gaussian Splatting, while significantly
improving geometric accuracy. Moreover, Object-X achieves competitive
performance with specialized methods in scene alignment and localization.
Critically, our object-centric descriptors require 3-4 orders of magnitude less
storage compared to traditional image- or point cloud-based approaches,
establishing Object-X as a scalable and highly practical solution for
multi-modal 3D scene representation.

*Yusuke Matsui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LotusFilter is a fast post-processing module to diversify approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) results by removing redundant vectors using a precomputed cutoff table.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ANNS results can be overly similar, but some applications require diversity alongside similarity. LotusFilter addresses this need.

Method: Precompute a cutoff table of close vectors and greedily remove redundant candidates during filtering.

Result: Operates quickly (0.02 ms/query) in real-world RAG-like settings using OpenAI embeddings.

Conclusion: LotusFilter effectively diversifies ANNS results with minimal latency, suitable for practical applications.

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is an essential building block for
applications like RAG but can sometimes yield results that are overly similar
to each other. In certain scenarios, search results should be similar to the
query and yet diverse. We propose LotusFilter, a post-processing module to
diversify ANNS results. We precompute a cutoff table summarizing vectors that
are close to each other. During the filtering, LotusFilter greedily looks up
the table to delete redundant vectors from the candidates. We demonstrated that
the LotusFilter operates fast (0.02 [ms/query]) in settings resembling
real-world RAG applications, utilizing features such as OpenAI embeddings. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/matsui528/lotf.

### [236] [SupeRANSAC: One RANSAC to Rule Them All](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04803)
*Daniel Barath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SupeRANSAC is a unified RANSAC pipeline improving robustness in computer vision tasks like homography and pose estimation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RANSAC's performance varies across tasks due to implementation details. SupeRANSAC aims for consistent accuracy.

Method: Introduces SupeRANSAC, analyzing techniques for effective RANSAC in vision tasks.

Result: Improves performance, e.g., 6 AUC points for fundamental matrix estimation.

Conclusion: SupeRANSAC significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple vision tasks.

Abstract: Robust estimation is a cornerstone in computer vision, particularly for tasks
like Structure-from-Motion and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping. RANSAC
and its variants are the gold standard for estimating geometric models (e.g.,
homographies, relative/absolute poses) from outlier-contaminated data. Despite
RANSAC's apparent simplicity, achieving consistently high performance across
different problems is challenging. While recent research often focuses on
improving specific RANSAC components (e.g., sampling, scoring), overall
performance is frequently more influenced by the "bells and whistles" (i.e.,
the implementation details and problem-specific optimizations) within a given
library. Popular frameworks like OpenCV and PoseLib demonstrate varying
performance, excelling in some tasks but lagging in others. We introduce
SupeRANSAC, a novel unified RANSAC pipeline, and provide a detailed analysis of
the techniques that make RANSAC effective for specific vision tasks, including
homography, fundamental/essential matrix, and absolute/rigid pose estimation.
SupeRANSAC is designed for consistent accuracy across these tasks, improving
upon the best existing methods by, for example, 6 AUC points on average for
fundamental matrix estimation. We demonstrate significant performance
improvements over the state-of-the-art on multiple problems and datasets. Code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MegaHan97K, a large-scale dataset for mega-category Chinese character recognition, addressing gaps in existing datasets and revealing new challenges and opportunities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate recognition of a vast number of Chinese characters (87,887 in GB18030-2022) for cultural preservation and digital applications, with existing datasets being insufficient.

Method: Creation of MegaHan97K, a dataset with 97,455 categories, including handwritten, historical, and synthetic subsets to balance long-tail distribution.

Result: MegaHan97K supports GB18030-2022, provides balanced samples, and highlights challenges like storage demands and zero-shot learning.

Conclusion: MegaHan97K is a groundbreaking dataset for mega-category recognition, offering significant research potential and addressing critical gaps in the field.

Abstract: Foundational to the Chinese language and culture, Chinese characters
encompass extraordinarily extensive and ever-expanding categories, with the
latest Chinese GB18030-2022 standard containing 87,887 categories. The accurate
recognition of this vast number of characters, termed mega-category
recognition, presents a formidable yet crucial challenge for cultural heritage
preservation and digital applications. Despite significant advances in Optical
Character Recognition (OCR), mega-category recognition remains unexplored due
to the absence of comprehensive datasets, with the largest existing dataset
containing merely 16,151 categories. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce
MegaHan97K, a mega-category, large-scale dataset covering an unprecedented
97,455 categories of Chinese characters. Our work offers three major
contributions: (1) MegaHan97K is the first dataset to fully support the latest
GB18030-2022 standard, providing at least six times more categories than
existing datasets; (2) It effectively addresses the long-tail distribution
problem by providing balanced samples across all categories through its three
distinct subsets: handwritten, historical and synthetic subsets; (3)
Comprehensive benchmarking experiments reveal new challenges in mega-category
scenarios, including increased storage demands, morphologically similar
character recognition, and zero-shot learning difficulties, while also
unlocking substantial opportunities for future research. To the best of our
knowledge, the MetaHan97K is likely the dataset with the largest classes not
only in the field of OCR but may also in the broader domain of pattern
recognition. The dataset is available at

TL;DR: Spike-TBR is a noise-resilient event-based encoding method combining TBR and spiking neurons, outperforming in noisy and clean scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras outperform traditional sensors but struggle with noise when converting event streams for standard vision pipelines.

Method: Proposes Spike-TBR, integrating Temporal Binary Representation (TBR) with spiking neurons for noise resilience. Evaluates four variants across datasets.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance in noisy and clean data, bridging spike-based and frame-based processing.

Conclusion: Spike-TBR offers a robust, noise-resilient solution for event-driven vision applications.

Abstract: Event cameras offer significant advantages over traditional frame-based
sensors, including higher temporal resolution, lower latency and dynamic range.
However, efficiently converting event streams into formats compatible with
standard computer vision pipelines remains a challenging problem, particularly
in the presence of noise. In this paper, we propose Spike-TBR, a novel
event-based encoding strategy based on Temporal Binary Representation (TBR),
addressing its vulnerability to noise by integrating spiking neurons. Spike-TBR
combines the frame-based advantages of TBR with the noise-filtering
capabilities of spiking neural networks, creating a more robust representation
of event streams. We evaluate four variants of Spike-TBR, each using different
spiking neurons, across multiple datasets, demonstrating superior performance
in noise-affected scenarios while improving the results on clean data. Our
method bridges the gap between spike-based and frame-based processing, offering
a simple noise-resilient solution for event-driven vision applications.

Motivation: While adversarial attacks on autonomous vehicle perception tasks are common, few target traffic light detectors. This work addresses this gap.

Method: Proposes a threat model with patches placed under traffic lights and a training strategy for CNNs. Evaluates attacks in universal settings, including real-world tests with printed patches.

Result: Successful targeted red-to-green label-flipping and pictogram classification attacks, validated in lab and real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The study highlights vulnerabilities in traffic light detectors and provides a practical framework for adversarial attacks, with code made publicly available.

Abstract: Realistic adversarial attacks on various camera-based perception tasks of
autonomous vehicles have been successfully demonstrated so far. However, only a
few works considered attacks on traffic light detectors. This work shows how
CNNs for traffic light detection can be attacked with printed patches. We
propose a threat model, where each instance of a traffic light is attacked with
a patch placed under it, and describe a training strategy. We demonstrate
successful adversarial patch attacks in universal settings. Our experiments
show realistic targeted red-to-green label-flipping attacks and attacks on
pictogram classification. Finally, we perform a real-world evaluation with
printed patches and demonstrate attacks in the lab settings with a mobile
traffic light for construction sites and in a test area with stationary traffic
lights. Our code is available at

*Shuo Cao,Yihao Liu,Xiaohui Li. Yuanting Gao. Yu Zhou,Chao Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualX-VSR introduces a dual axial spatial×temporal attention mechanism for real-world video super-resolution, eliminating motion compensation and improving fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based models struggle with pixel-level precision in VSR due to tokenization and sequential attention, and existing solutions have limited receptive fields and rely on optical flow.

Method: Proposes DualX-VSR with dual axial spatial×temporal attention, integrating spatial and temporal information orthogonally without motion compensation.

Result: DualX-VSR achieves high fidelity and superior performance in real-world VSR.

Conclusion: DualX-VSR simplifies structure and enhances spatiotemporal modeling for better real-world VSR results.

Abstract: Transformer-based models like ViViT and TimeSformer have advanced video
understanding by effectively modeling spatiotemporal dependencies. Recent video
generation models, such as Sora and Vidu, further highlight the power of
transformers in long-range feature extraction and holistic spatiotemporal
modeling. However, directly applying these models to real-world video
super-resolution (VSR) is challenging, as VSR demands pixel-level precision,
which can be compromised by tokenization and sequential attention mechanisms.
While recent transformer-based VSR models attempt to address these issues using
smaller patches and local attention, they still face limitations such as
restricted receptive fields and dependence on optical flow-based alignment,
which can introduce inaccuracies in real-world settings. To overcome these
issues, we propose Dual Axial Spatial$\times$Temporal Transformer for
Real-World Video Super-Resolution (DualX-VSR), which introduces a novel dual
axial spatial$\times$temporal attention mechanism that integrates spatial and
temporal information along orthogonal directions. DualX-VSR eliminates the need
for motion compensation, offering a simplified structure that provides a
cohesive representation of spatiotemporal information. As a result, DualX-VSR
achieves high fidelity and superior performance in real-world VSR task.

Motivation: Current perception systems excel in 2D reasoning segmentation but lack comparable frameworks for 3D tasks, relying on explicit human input or pre-defined categories.

Method: Introduces OpenMaskDINO3D with a SEG token and object identifier to process point cloud data and text prompts for accurate 3D segmentation.

Result: Achieves high-precision 3D segmentation mask generation from natural language instructions, validated on ScanNet datasets.

Conclusion: OpenMaskDINO3D effectively bridges the gap in 3D reasoning segmentation, demonstrating robust performance in various tasks.

Abstract: Although perception systems have made remarkable advancements in recent
years, particularly in 2D reasoning segmentation, these systems still rely on
explicit human instruction or pre-defined categories to identify target objects
before executing visual recognition tasks. Such systems have matured
significantly, demonstrating the ability to reason and comprehend implicit user
intentions in two-dimensional contexts, producing accurate segmentation masks
based on complex and implicit query text. However, a comparable framework and
structure for 3D reasoning segmentation remain absent. This paper introduces
OpenMaskDINO3D, a LLM designed for comprehensive 3D understanding and
segmentation. OpenMaskDINO3D processes point cloud data and text prompts to
produce instance segmentation masks, excelling in many 3D tasks. By introducing
a SEG token and object identifier, we achieve high-precision 3D segmentation
mask generation, enabling the model to directly produce accurate point cloud

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel backdoor attack framework for diffusion models in image editing, using invisible triggers via poisoned training data and deep watermarking models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor attacks in image editing rely on visible triggers, which are impractical. The study aims to develop an invisible trigger method for more stealthy attacks.

Method: The proposed framework embeds imperceptible watermarks as backdoor triggers using off-the-shelf deep watermarking models, ensuring normal editing for clean images.

Result: Experiments show high attack success rates across different watermarking models, with analysis confirming the method's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The approach successfully demonstrates the feasibility of invisible backdoor triggers in image editing, highlighting a new vulnerability in diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in both image generation
and editing. However, recent studies have revealed their vulnerability to
backdoor attacks, in which specific patterns embedded in the input can
manipulate the model's behavior. Most existing research in this area has
proposed attack frameworks focused on the image generation pipeline, leaving
backdoor attacks in image editing relatively unexplored. Among the few studies
targeting image editing, most utilize visible triggers, which are impractical
because they introduce noticeable alterations to the input image before
editing. In this paper, we propose a novel attack framework that embeds
invisible triggers into the image editing process via poisoned training data.
We leverage off-the-shelf deep watermarking models to encode imperceptible
watermarks as backdoor triggers. Our goal is to make the model produce the
predefined backdoor target when it receives watermarked inputs, while editing
clean images normally according to the given prompt. With extensive experiments
across different watermarking models, the proposed method achieves promising
attack success rates. In addition, the analysis results of the watermark
characteristics in term of backdoor attack further support the effectiveness of
our approach. The code is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a transformer encoder trained with supervised contrastive learning to model human-like intuition in chess, achieving high performance without deep search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between human intuition-driven planning and engine-based deep search in chess.

Method: Train a transformer encoder using supervised contrastive learning to embed board states into a latent space structured by positional evaluation.

Result: Achieves an estimated Elo rating of 2593 with only a 6-ply beam search, improving with model size and embedding dimensionality.

Conclusion: Latent planning offers a viable alternative to traditional search, generalizable to other perfect-information games.

Abstract: Modern chess engines achieve superhuman performance through deep tree search
and regressive evaluation, while human players rely on intuition to select
candidate moves followed by a shallow search to validate them. To model this
intuition-driven planning process, we train a transformer encoder using
supervised contrastive learning to embed board states into a latent space
structured by positional evaluation. In this space, distance reflects
evaluative similarity, and visualized trajectories display interpretable
transitions between game states. We demonstrate that move selection can occur
entirely within this embedding space by advancing toward favorable regions,
without relying on deep search. Despite using only a 6-ply beam search, our
model achieves an estimated Elo rating of 2593. Performance improves with both
model size and embedding dimensionality, suggesting that latent planning may
offer a viable alternative to traditional search. Although we focus on chess,
the proposed embedding-based planning method can be generalized to other
perfect-information games where state evaluations are learnable. All source

Conclusion: Current models lack comprehensive spatial reasoning and fine-grained perception for 3D scenes beyond object-level tasks.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding has made notable progress in localizing objects within
complex 3D scenes. However, grounding referring expressions beyond objects in
3D scenes remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Anywhere3D-Bench, a
holistic 3D visual grounding benchmark consisting of 2,632 referring
expression-3D bounding box pairs spanning four different grounding levels:
human-activity areas, unoccupied space beyond objects, objects in the scene,
and fine-grained object parts. We assess a range of state-of-the-art 3D visual
grounding methods alongside large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs) on Anywhere3D-Bench. Experimental results reveal that space-level and
part-level visual grounding pose the greatest challenges: space-level tasks
require a more comprehensive spatial reasoning ability, for example, modeling
distances and spatial relations within 3D space, while part-level tasks demand
fine-grained perception of object composition. Even the best performance model,
OpenAI o4-mini, achieves only 23.57% accuracy on space-level tasks and 33.94%
on part-level tasks, significantly lower than its performance on area-level and
object-level tasks. These findings underscore a critical gap in current models'
capacity to understand and reason about 3D scene beyond object-level semantics.

### [246] [Generating Synthetic Stereo Datasets using 3D Gaussian Splatting and Expert Knowledge Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04908)
*Filip Slezak,Magnus K. Gjerde,Joakim B. Haurum,Ivan Nikolov,Morten S. Laursen,Thomas B. Moeslund*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based pipeline for stereo dataset generation outperforms NeRF-based methods, with cleaner disparity estimates from FoundationStereo improving zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an efficient alternative to NeRF-based methods for stereo dataset generation and improve zero-shot generalization performance.

Method: Utilizes 3DGS for dataset generation, combining reconstructed geometry and FoundationStereo depth estimates in an expert knowledge transfer setup.

Result: 3DGS-generated datasets with FoundationStereo disparity estimates yield better zero-shot generalization, while direct geometry use introduces noise.

Conclusion: 3DGS offers low-cost, high-fidelity dataset creation but requires further exploration for robustness in challenging settings.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based pipeline for
stereo dataset generation, offering an efficient alternative to Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF)-based methods. To obtain useful geometry estimates, we explore
utilizing the reconstructed geometry from the explicit 3D representations as
well as depth estimates from the FoundationStereo model in an expert knowledge
transfer setup. We find that when fine-tuning stereo models on 3DGS-generated
datasets, we demonstrate competitive performance in zero-shot generalization
benchmarks. When using the reconstructed geometry directly, we observe that it
is often noisy and contains artifacts, which propagate noise to the trained
model. In contrast, we find that the disparity estimates from FoundationStereo
are cleaner and consequently result in a better performance on the zero-shot
generalization benchmarks. Our method highlights the potential for low-cost,
high-fidelity dataset creation and fast fine-tuning for deep stereo models.
Moreover, we also reveal that while the latest Gaussian Splatting based methods
have achieved superior performance on established benchmarks, their robustness
falls short in challenging in-the-wild settings warranting further exploration.

*Antoine Laurent,Jean Mélou,Catherine Schwab,Rolande Simon-Millot,Sophie Féret,Thomas Sagory,Carole Fritz,Jean-Denis Durou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper discusses the importance of tailored 3D digitization methods for heritage objects, emphasizing that no single method fits all cases and collaboration between heritage and digital experts is key.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to digitize heritage objects is widely accepted, but the diversity of objects requires adaptable methods rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.

Method: The study uses objects from the mus{\'e}e d'Arch{\'e}ologie nationale to illustrate the diversity of photographic 3D digitization methods and the need for method adaptation.

Result: No single digitization method is universally suitable; the best method depends on the object's characteristics and the intended use of its digital twin.

Conclusion: Absolute classification of 3D digitization methods is impractical; instead, the focus should be on selecting the most suitable tool for each object through collaborative decision-making.

Abstract: The need to digitize heritage objects is now widely accepted. This article
presents the very fashionable context of the creation of ''digital twins''. It
illustrates the diversity of photographic 3D digitization methods, but this is
not its only objective. Using a selection of objects from the collections of
the mus{\'e}e d'Arch{\'e}ologie nationale, it shows that no single method is
suitable for all cases. Rather, the method to be recommended for a given object
should be the result of a concerted choice between those involved in heritage
and those involved in the digital domain, as each new object may require the
adaptation of existing tools. It would therefore be pointless to attempt an
absolute classification of 3D digitization methods. On the contrary, we need to
find the digital tool best suited to each object, taking into account not only
its characteristics, but also the future use of its digital twin.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CzechLynx is a large-scale dataset for Eurasian lynx identification, pose estimation, and segmentation, featuring real and synthetic images with diverse annotations and evaluation protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of open-access datasets for individual animal identification and pose estimation, specifically for the Eurasian lynx, and to support benchmarking and method development.

Method: The dataset combines 30k real camera trap images with 100k synthetic images generated via Unity and text-to-texture modeling, annotated with masks, identity labels, and skeletons. Three evaluation protocols are defined for testing generalization.

Result: CzechLynx includes 219 unique lynx individuals, spans 15 years, and covers two distinct regions, providing a robust resource for research.

Conclusion: CzechLynx is a valuable benchmark for advancing models in animal re-identification and related tasks, with potential broader applications.

Abstract: We introduce CzechLynx, the first large-scale, open-access dataset for
individual identification, 2D pose estimation, and instance segmentation of the
Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx). CzechLynx includes more than 30k camera trap images
annotated with segmentation masks, identity labels, and 20-point skeletons and
covers 219 unique individuals across 15 years of systematic monitoring in two
geographically distinct regions: Southwest Bohemia and the Western Carpathians.
To increase the data variability, we create a complementary synthetic set with
more than 100k photorealistic images generated via a Unity-based pipeline and
diffusion-driven text-to-texture modeling, covering diverse environments,
poses, and coat-pattern variations. To allow testing generalization across
spatial and temporal domains, we define three tailored evaluation
protocols/splits: (i) geo-aware, (ii) time-aware open-set, and (iii) time-aware
closed-set. This dataset is targeted to be instrumental in benchmarking
state-of-the-art models and the development of novel methods for not just
individual animal re-identification.

*Yong Sun,Yipeng Wang,Junyu Shi,Zhiyuan Zhang,Yanmei Xiao,Lei Zhu,Manxi Jiang,Qiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Video-Based Embryo Grading using TLM videos to predict embryo quality, introducing the CoSTeM framework for holistic assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI methods for IVF embryo selection lack holistic quality assessment or are confounded by external factors, limiting clinical utility.

Method: Introduces CoSTeM, a framework with morphological and morphokinetic branches to analyze TLM videos, combining static and dynamic features.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance in grading embryos, validated on a dataset of 2,500 TLM videos.

Conclusion: Provides a robust AI framework for embryo selection, with plans to release the dataset and code.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has recently shown promise in automated embryo
selection for In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF). However, current approaches either
address partial embryo evaluation lacking holistic quality assessment or target
clinical outcomes inevitably confounded by extra-embryonic factors, both
limiting clinical utility. To bridge this gap, we propose a new task called
Video-Based Embryo Grading - the first paradigm that directly utilizes
full-length time-lapse monitoring (TLM) videos to predict embryologists'
overall quality assessments. To support this task, we curate a real-world
clinical dataset comprising over 2,500 TLM videos, each annotated with a
grading label indicating the overall quality of embryos. Grounded in clinical
decision-making principles, we propose a Complementary Spatial-Temporal Pattern
Mining (CoSTeM) framework that conceptually replicates embryologists'
evaluation process. The CoSTeM comprises two branches: (1) a morphological
branch using a Mixture of Cross-Attentive Experts layer and a Temporal
Selection Block to select discriminative local structural features, and (2) a
morphokinetic branch employing a Temporal Transformer to model global
developmental trajectories, synergistically integrating static and dynamic
determinants for grading embryos. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
the superiority of our design. This work provides a valuable methodological
framework for AI-assisted embryo selection. The dataset and source code will be
publicly available upon acceptance.

*Igor Meleshin,Anna Chistyakova,Anastasia Antsiferova,Dmitriy Vatolin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes designing robustness into IQA models via architectural changes, like orthogonal information flow and norm-preserving operations, instead of relying on adversarial training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional IQA models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and data-driven defenses may not be the best solution. The paper explores robustness as a design feature rather than a learned trait.

Method: The approach enforces orthogonal information flow and norm-preserving operations, followed by pruning and fine-tuning, to create a robust IQA architecture.

Result: The proposed architecture resists adversarial attacks without adversarial training or major modifications to the original model.

Conclusion: The work advocates for engineering robustness into perceptual models through design, shifting focus from data-driven optimization.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models are increasingly relied upon to
evaluate image quality in real-world systems -- from compression and
enhancement to generation and streaming. Yet their adoption brings a
fundamental risk: these models are inherently unstable. Adversarial
manipulations can easily fool them, inflating scores and undermining trust.
Traditionally, such vulnerabilities are addressed through data-driven defenses
-- adversarial retraining, regularization, or input purification. But what if
this is the wrong lens? What if robustness in perceptual models is not
something to learn but something to design? In this work, we propose a
provocative idea: robustness as an architectural prior. Rather than training
models to resist perturbations, we reshape their internal structure to suppress
sensitivity from the ground up. We achieve this by enforcing orthogonal
information flow, constraining the network to norm-preserving operations -- and
further stabilizing the system through pruning and fine-tuning. The result is a
robust IQA architecture that withstands adversarial attacks without requiring
adversarial training or significant changes to the original model. This
approach suggests a shift in perspective: from optimizing robustness through
data to engineering it through design.

*Hong Gao,Yiming Bao,Xuezhan Tu,Bin Zhong,Minling Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APVR is a training-free framework for hour-level video understanding, using hierarchical visual retrieval to overcome computational limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of processing hour-long videos efficiently due to computational constraints and inefficient temporal information extraction.

Method: APVR combines Pivot Frame Retrieval (semantic expansion and multi-modal scoring) and Pivot Token Retrieval (query-aware token selection) for hierarchical visual retrieval.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on LongVideoBench and VideoMME, surpassing both training-free and training-based methods.

Conclusion: APVR effectively enables hour-long video processing with semantic fidelity and integrates seamlessly with existing MLLM architectures.

Abstract: Current video-based multimodal large language models struggle with hour-level
video understanding due to computational constraints and inefficient
information extraction from extensive temporal sequences. We propose APVR
(Adaptive Pivot Visual information Retrieval), a training-free framework that
addresses the memory wall limitation through hierarchical visual information
retrieval. APVR operates via two complementary components: Pivot Frame
Retrieval employs semantic expansion and multi-modal confidence scoring to
identify semantically relevant video frames, while Pivot Token Retrieval
performs query-aware attention-driven token selection within the pivot frames.
This dual granularity approach enables processing of hour-long videos while
maintaining semantic fidelity. Experimental validation on LongVideoBench and
VideoMME demonstrates significant performance improvements, establishing
state-of-the-art results for not only training-free but also training-based
approaches while providing plug-and-play integration capability with existing
MLLM architectures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FEAT is a Transformer model for dynamic medical video synthesis, addressing spatial-temporal-channel dependencies with efficient attention mechanisms and fine-grained guidance, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Transformer-based methods for medical video synthesis suffer from insufficient channel interactions, high computational complexity, and coarse denoising guidance.

Method: FEAT introduces sequential spatial-temporal-channel attention, linear-complexity attention designs, and a residual value guidance module for fine-grained noise adaptation.

Result: FEAT-S matches or outperforms Endora with fewer parameters, while FEAT-L surpasses all comparison methods in performance and scalability.

Conclusion: FEAT offers an efficient and scalable solution for high-quality dynamic medical video synthesis, with demonstrated superiority over existing approaches.

Abstract: Synthesizing high-quality dynamic medical videos remains a significant
challenge due to the need for modeling both spatial consistency and temporal
dynamics. Existing Transformer-based approaches face critical limitations,
including insufficient channel interactions, high computational complexity from
self-attention, and coarse denoising guidance from timestep embeddings when
handling varying noise levels. In this work, we propose FEAT, a
full-dimensional efficient attention Transformer, which addresses these issues
through three key innovations: (1) a unified paradigm with sequential
spatial-temporal-channel attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies
across all dimensions, (2) a linear-complexity design for attention mechanisms
in each dimension, utilizing weighted key-value attention and global channel
attention, and (3) a residual value guidance module that provides fine-grained
pixel-level guidance to adapt to different noise levels. We evaluate FEAT on
standard benchmarks and downstream tasks, demonstrating that FEAT-S, with only
23\% of the parameters of the state-of-the-art model Endora, achieves
comparable or even superior performance. Furthermore, FEAT-L surpasses all
comparison methods across multiple datasets, showcasing both superior
effectiveness and scalability. Code is available at

*Mélisande Teng,Arthur Ouaknine,Etienne Laliberté,Yoshua Bengio,David Rolnick,Hugo Larochelle*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for tree crown segmentation in drone imagery, comparing it with other methods like Mask R-CNN, and introduces BalSAM, which integrates elevation data for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional forest monitoring methods are costly and labor-intensive. Drone remote sensing and computer vision, especially pre-trained models like SAM, offer scalable solutions for individual tree mapping.

Method: The study compares SAM-based methods for tree crown segmentation in boreal, temperate, and tropical forests, integrating Digital Surface Model (DSM) data. BalSAM, a model combining SAM and DSM, is introduced and evaluated.

Result: SAM out-of-the-box underperforms Mask R-CNN, but BalSAM shows promise, especially in plantations. End-to-end tuning of SAM and DSM integration are identified as effective strategies.

Conclusion: While SAM alone isn't superior to Mask R-CNN, integrating DSM and fine-tuning SAM (as in BalSAM) offers potential for scalable tree crown segmentation in diverse forest types.

Abstract: Information on trees at the individual level is crucial for monitoring forest
ecosystems and planning forest management. Current monitoring methods involve
ground measurements, requiring extensive cost, time and labor. Advances in
drone remote sensing and computer vision offer great potential for mapping
individual trees from aerial imagery at broad-scale. Large pre-trained vision
models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), represent a particularly
compelling choice given limited labeled data. In this work, we compare methods
leveraging SAM for the task of automatic tree crown instance segmentation in
high resolution drone imagery in three use cases: 1) boreal plantations, 2)
temperate forests and 3) tropical forests. We also study the integration of
elevation data into models, in the form of Digital Surface Model (DSM)
information, which can readily be obtained at no additional cost from RGB drone
imagery. We present BalSAM, a model leveraging SAM and DSM information, which
shows potential over other methods, particularly in the context of plantations.
We find that methods using SAM out-of-the-box do not outperform a custom Mask
R-CNN, even with well-designed prompts. However, efficiently tuning SAM
end-to-end and integrating DSM information are both promising avenues for tree
crown instance segmentation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TextVidBench, a benchmark for long-video text question answering, addressing limitations in existing datasets and proposing a method to enhance model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for short-video Text-Visual Question Answering (ViteVQA) lack long-video coverage and comprehensive evaluation, limiting assessment of multimodal large language models (MLLMs).

Method: The authors propose TextVidBench with cross-domain long-video coverage, a three-stage evaluation framework, and high-quality annotations. They also introduce IT-Rope, temporal prompt engineering, non-uniform positional encoding, and lightweight fine-tuning.

Result: TextVidBench challenges existing models, and the proposed method improves long-video text understanding.

Conclusion: TextVidBench fills a gap in long-video evaluation, and the proposed enhancements offer insights for advancing MLLMs in this domain.

Abstract: Despite recent progress on the short-video Text-Visual Question Answering
(ViteVQA) task - largely driven by benchmarks such as M4-ViteVQA - existing
datasets still suffer from limited video duration and narrow evaluation scopes,
making it difficult to adequately assess the growing capabilities of powerful
multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To address these limitations, we
introduce TextVidBench, the first benchmark specifically designed for
long-video text question answering (>3 minutes). TextVidBench makes three key
contributions: 1) Cross-domain long-video coverage: Spanning 9 categories
(e.g., news, sports, gaming), with an average video length of 2306 seconds,
enabling more realistic evaluation of long-video understanding. 2) A
three-stage evaluation framework: "Text Needle-in-Haystack -> Temporal
Grounding -> Text Dynamics Captioning". 3) High-quality fine-grained
annotations: Containing over 5,000 question-answer pairs with detailed semantic
labeling. Furthermore, we propose an efficient paradigm for improving large
models through: (i) introducing the IT-Rope mechanism and temporal prompt
engineering to enhance temporal perception, (ii) adopting non-uniform
positional encoding to better handle long video sequences, and (iii) applying
lightweight fine-tuning on video-text data. Extensive experiments on multiple
public datasets as well as TextVidBench demonstrate that our new benchmark
presents significant challenges to existing models, while our proposed method
offers valuable insights into improving long-video scene text understanding
capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach to Image Super Resolution (ISR) using Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) modeling, addressing limitations of prior work (VARSR) with hierarchical tokenization and preference optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the fixed-resolution limitation and reliance on large datasets/models in VARSR, the authors propose a more efficient and scalable solution for ISR.

Method: The method includes a Hierarchical Image Tokenization for multi-scale representation and a Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) term to guide the transformer.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art ISR results with a smaller architecture (300M params) and no external data, enabling multi-scale super-resolution in one pass.

Conclusion: The proposed components enable efficient, high-quality ISR without the drawbacks of prior methods, marking advancements in VAR-based super-resolution.

Abstract: In this paper we tackle Image Super Resolution (ISR), using recent advances
in Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) modeling. VAR iteratively estimates the
residual in latent space between gradually increasing image scales, a process
referred to as next-scale prediction. Thus, the strong priors learned during
pre-training align well with the downstream task (ISR). To our knowledge, only
VARSR has exploited this synergy so far, showing promising results. However,
due to the limitations of existing residual quantizers, VARSR works only at a
fixed resolution, i.e. it fails to map intermediate outputs to the
corresponding image scales. Additionally, it relies on a 1B transformer
architecture (VAR-d24), and leverages a large-scale private dataset to achieve
state-of-the-art results. We address these limitations through two novel
components: a) a Hierarchical Image Tokenization approach with a multi-scale
image tokenizer that progressively represents images at different scales while
simultaneously enforcing token overlap across scales, and b) a Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) regularization term that, relying solely on the
LR and HR tokenizations, encourages the transformer to produce the latter over
the former. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a quantizer is
trained to force semantically consistent residuals at different scales, and the
first time that preference-based optimization is used to train a VAR. Using
these two components, our model can denoise the LR image and super-resolve at
half and full target upscale factors in a single forward pass. Additionally, we
achieve \textit{state-of-the-art results on ISR}, while using a small model
(300M params vs ~1B params of VARSR), and without using external training data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PATS is a novel temporal sampling method for sports skill assessment, preserving full movement patterns and outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video sampling disrupts temporal continuity, hindering accurate skill evaluation.

Method: PATS adaptively segments videos to ensure complete movement execution, repeating across segments for coherence.

Result: PATS achieves higher accuracy (+0.65% to +3.05%) and significant gains in challenging domains (e.g., +26.22% in bouldering).

Conclusion: PATS effectively adapts to diverse activities, advancing automated skill assessment for real-world use.

Abstract: Automated sports skill assessment requires capturing fundamental movement
patterns that distinguish expert from novice performance, yet current video
sampling methods disrupt the temporal continuity essential for proficiency
evaluation. To this end, we introduce Proficiency-Aware Temporal Sampling
(PATS), a novel sampling strategy that preserves complete fundamental movements
within continuous temporal segments for multi-view skill assessment. PATS
adaptively segments videos to ensure each analyzed portion contains full
execution of critical performance components, repeating this process across
multiple segments to maximize information coverage while maintaining temporal
coherence. Evaluated on the EgoExo4D benchmark with SkillFormer, PATS surpasses
the state-of-the-art accuracy across all viewing configurations (+0.65% to
+3.05%) and delivers substantial gains in challenging domains (+26.22%
bouldering, +2.39% music, +1.13% basketball). Systematic analysis reveals that
PATS successfully adapts to diverse activity characteristics-from
high-frequency sampling for dynamic sports to fine-grained segmentation for
sequential skills-demonstrating its effectiveness as an adaptive approach to
temporal sampling that advances automated skill assessment for real-world
applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CSTR-CLIP, a model for Chinese scene text retrieval, addressing layout diversity challenges. It outperforms previous methods by 18.82% and offers faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chinese scene text retrieval is complex due to diverse layouts, and existing English-based solutions underperform.

Method: Proposes CSTR-CLIP, integrating global visual info and multi-granularity alignment training in a two-stage process.

Result: CSTR-CLIP outperforms state-of-the-art by 18.82% and handles diverse layouts effectively.

Conclusion: The model and new benchmark (DL-CSVTR) advance Chinese text retrieval, with dataset/code released for research.

Abstract: Chinese scene text retrieval is a practical task that aims to search for
images containing visual instances of a Chinese query text. This task is
extremely challenging because Chinese text often features complex and diverse
layouts in real-world scenes. Current efforts tend to inherit the solution for
English scene text retrieval, failing to achieve satisfactory performance. In
this paper, we establish a Diversified Layout benchmark for Chinese Street View
Text Retrieval (DL-CSVTR), which is specifically designed to evaluate retrieval
performance across various text layouts, including vertical, cross-line, and
partial alignments. To address the limitations in existing methods, we propose
Chinese Scene Text Retrieval CLIP (CSTR-CLIP), a novel model that integrates
global visual information with multi-granularity alignment training. CSTR-CLIP
applies a two-stage training process to overcome previous limitations, such as
the exclusion of visual features outside the text region and reliance on
single-granularity alignment, thereby enabling the model to effectively handle
diverse text layouts. Experiments on existing benchmark show that CSTR-CLIP
outperforms the previous state-of-the-art model by 18.82% accuracy and also
provides faster inference speed. Further analysis on DL-CSVTR confirms the
superior performance of CSTR-CLIP in handling various text layouts. The dataset
and code will be publicly available to facilitate research in Chinese scene
text retrieval.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper discusses advancements in monocular depth estimation using deep learning, highlighting challenges in generalization and recent methods like Depth Anything for zero-shot estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve monocular depth estimation by leveraging deep learning to learn depth features from annotated datasets and address challenges like domain generalization.

Method: Methods include multi-scale fusion networks, reinterpreting regression as classification, incorporating priors, and using affine-invariant loss for multi-dataset training.

Result: Depth Anything shows leading performance in zero-shot depth estimation, excelling in structural detail extraction but struggles with metric depth accuracy.

Conclusion: While progress has been made, challenges like metric depth accuracy persist, with Depth Anything emerging as a strong solution for structural depth estimation.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation aims to determine the depth of each pixel from an
RGB image captured by a monocular camera. The development of deep learning has
significantly advanced this field by facilitating the learning of depth
features from some well-annotated datasets
\cite{Geiger_Lenz_Stiller_Urtasun_2013,silberman2012indoor}. Eigen \textit{et
al.} \cite{eigen2014depth} first introduce a multi-scale fusion network for
depth regression. Following this, subsequent improvements have come from
reinterpreting the regression task as a classification problem
\cite{bhat2021adabins,Li_Wang_Liu_Jiang_2022}, incorporating additional priors
\cite{shao2023nddepth,yang2023gedepth}, and developing more effective objective
function \cite{xian2020structure,Yin_Liu_Shen_Yan_2019}. Despite these
advances, generalizing to unseen domains remains a challenge. Recently, several
methods have employed affine-invariant loss to enable multi-dataset joint
training \cite{MiDaS,ZeroDepth,guizilini2023towards,Dany}. Among them, Depth
Anything \cite{Dany} has shown leading performance in zero-shot monocular depth
estimation. While it struggles to estimate accurate metric depth due to the
lack of explicit depth cues, it excels at extracting structural information
from unseen images, producing structure-detailed monocular depth.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel pipeline generates synthetic 3D point cloud data using 3D Gaussian Splatting and Gaussian Opacity Fields, avoiding costly real-world data collection. Models trained on this synthetic data achieved high accuracy, even outperforming real-data-trained models in some cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world 3D point cloud data collection and annotation are expensive and labor-intensive, necessitating a cost-effective synthetic alternative.

Method: The pipeline uses 3DGS and GOF to create realistic 3D assets of agricultural vehicles, placed in a simulated environment with a LiDAR simulator. Models like PointNet++, Point Transformer V3, and OACNN were trained and validated solely on synthetic data.

Result: Point Transformer V3 achieved a remarkable 91.35% mIoU without real data training. Synthetic data sometimes outperformed real data, and models generalized well to unseen mesh models.

Conclusion: Synthetic data generation is a viable and flexible alternative to real-world data, enabling high-performance model training without the associated costs.

Abstract: Training neural networks for tasks such as 3D point cloud semantic
segmentation demands extensive datasets, yet obtaining and annotating
real-world point clouds is costly and labor-intensive. This work aims to
introduce a novel pipeline for generating realistic synthetic data, by
leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Gaussian Opacity Fields (GOF) to
generate 3D assets of multiple different agricultural vehicles instead of using
generic models. These assets are placed in a simulated environment, where the
point clouds are generated using a simulated LiDAR. This is a flexible approach
that allows changing the LiDAR specifications without incurring additional
costs. We evaluated the impact of synthetic data on segmentation models such as
PointNet++, Point Transformer V3, and OACNN, by training and validating the
models only on synthetic data. Remarkably, the PTv3 model had an mIoU of
91.35\%, a noteworthy result given that the model had neither been trained nor
validated on any real data. Further studies even suggested that in certain
scenarios the models trained only on synthetically generated data performed
better than models trained on real-world data. Finally, experiments
demonstrated that the models can generalize across semantic classes, enabling
accurate predictions on mesh models they were never trained on.

*Jaehoon Choi,Dongki Jung,Christopher Maxey,Yonghan Lee,Sungmin Eum,Dinesh Manocha,Heesung Kwon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UAV4D is a framework for photorealistic rendering of UAV-captured dynamic scenes with multiple moving pedestrians, addressing monocular camera challenges and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dynamic neural rendering methods struggle with UAV-captured scenarios, especially monocular setups and top-down perspectives with multiple small, moving humans, which lack representation in datasets.

Method: Combines a 3D foundation model and human mesh reconstruction to reconstruct scenes and humans, resolves scale ambiguity via human-scene contact points, and uses SMPL and background mesh to initialize Gaussian splats for rendering.

Result: Achieves 1.5 dB PSNR improvement and superior visual sharpness in novel view synthesis on three UAV datasets.

Conclusion: UAV4D effectively addresses UAV-specific challenges and outperforms existing methods in rendering dynamic scenes.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in dynamic neural rendering, existing
methods fail to address the unique challenges posed by UAV-captured scenarios,
particularly those involving monocular camera setups, top-down perspective, and
multiple small, moving humans, which are not adequately represented in existing
datasets. In this work, we introduce UAV4D, a framework for enabling
photorealistic rendering for dynamic real-world scenes captured by UAVs.
Specifically, we address the challenge of reconstructing dynamic scenes with
multiple moving pedestrians from monocular video data without the need for
additional sensors. We use a combination of a 3D foundation model and a human
mesh reconstruction model to reconstruct both the scene background and humans.
We propose a novel approach to resolve the scene scale ambiguity and place both
humans and the scene in world coordinates by identifying human-scene contact
points. Additionally, we exploit the SMPL model and background mesh to
initialize Gaussian splats, enabling holistic scene rendering. We evaluated our
method on three complex UAV-captured datasets: VisDrone, Manipal-UAV, and
Okutama-Action, each with distinct characteristics and 10~50 humans. Our
results demonstrate the benefits of our approach over existing methods in novel
view synthesis, achieving a 1.5 dB PSNR improvement and superior visual
sharpness.

*Oliver Krumpek,Oliver Heimann,Jörg Krüger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel physical annotation system for generating ML training data in automated optical inspection, using in-situ interaction and projector guidance to improve accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between human expertise and automated data generation, enabling non-IT experts to contribute to ML training pipelines and prevent loss of valuable training samples.

Method: Uses calibrated, tracked pointers to capture physical trajectories and contours on objects, transforming them into standardized annotations. Includes a projector-based interface for visual guidance.

Result: Preliminary results confirm feasibility, with accurate trajectory capture and seamless integration with CVAT for ML workflows.

Conclusion: The system offers a more intuitive and efficient annotation method, enhancing ML data generation for automated optical inspection.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel physical annotation system designed to generate
training data for automated optical inspection. The system uses pointer-based
in-situ interaction to transfer the valuable expertise of trained inspection
personnel directly into a machine learning (ML) training pipeline. Unlike
conventional screen-based annotation methods, our system captures physical
trajectories and contours directly on the object, providing a more intuitive
and efficient way to label data. The core technology uses calibrated, tracked
pointers to accurately record user input and transform these spatial
interactions into standardised annotation formats that are compatible with
open-source annotation software. Additionally, a simple projector-based
interface projects visual guidance onto the object to assist users during the
annotation process, ensuring greater accuracy and consistency. The proposed
concept bridges the gap between human expertise and automated data generation,
enabling non-IT experts to contribute to the ML training pipeline and
preventing the loss of valuable training samples. Preliminary evaluation
results confirm the feasibility of capturing detailed annotation trajectories
and demonstrate that integration with CVAT streamlines the workflow for
subsequent ML tasks. This paper details the system architecture, calibration
procedures and interface design, and discusses its potential contribution to
future ML data generation for automated optical inspection.

*Guangzhao Li,Yanming Yang,Chenxi Song,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowDirector is an inversion-free video editing framework using ODEs and attention-guided masking for coherent, localized edits, outperforming inversion-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing temporal inconsistencies and degraded structural fidelity in inversion-based video editing methods.

Method: Uses ODEs for smooth transitions in data space, attention-guided masking for localized edits, and guidance-enhanced editing for semantic alignment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in instruction adherence, temporal consistency, and background preservation.

Conclusion: FlowDirector sets a new paradigm for efficient, coherent video editing without inversion.

Abstract: Text-driven video editing aims to modify video content according to natural
language instructions. While recent training-free approaches have made progress
by leveraging pre-trained diffusion models, they typically rely on
inversion-based techniques that map input videos into the latent space, which
often leads to temporal inconsistencies and degraded structural fidelity. To
address this, we propose FlowDirector, a novel inversion-free video editing
framework. Our framework models the editing process as a direct evolution in
data space, guiding the video via an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) to
smoothly transition along its inherent spatiotemporal manifold, thereby
preserving temporal coherence and structural details. To achieve localized and
controllable edits, we introduce an attention-guided masking mechanism that
modulates the ODE velocity field, preserving non-target regions both spatially
and temporally. Furthermore, to address incomplete edits and enhance semantic
alignment with editing instructions, we present a guidance-enhanced editing
strategy inspired by Classifier-Free Guidance, which leverages differential
signals between multiple candidate flows to steer the editing trajectory toward
stronger semantic alignment without compromising structural consistency.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks demonstrate that FlowDirector achieves
state-of-the-art performance in instruction adherence, temporal consistency,
and background preservation, establishing a new paradigm for efficient and
coherent video editing without inversion.

Result: LLMs show promise for Vietnamese DAR but face issues like domain adaptation and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Future research should focus on dataset development, model optimization, and multimodal integration to advance Vietnamese DAR.

Abstract: Vietnamese document analysis and recognition (DAR) is a crucial field with
applications in digitization, information retrieval, and automation. Despite
advancements in OCR and NLP, Vietnamese text recognition faces unique
challenges due to its complex diacritics, tonal variations, and lack of
large-scale annotated datasets. Traditional OCR methods often struggle with
real-world document variations, while deep learning approaches have shown
promise but remain limited by data scarcity and generalization issues.
Recently, large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models have
demonstrated remarkable improvements in text recognition and document
understanding, offering a new direction for Vietnamese DAR. However, challenges
such as domain adaptation, multimodal learning, and computational efficiency
persist. This survey provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques in
Vietnamese document recognition, highlights key limitations, and explores how
LLMs can revolutionize the field. We discuss future research directions,
including dataset development, model optimization, and the integration of
multimodal approaches for improved document intelligence. By addressing these
gaps, we aim to foster advancements in Vietnamese DAR and encourage
community-driven solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance real image editing by improving instruction adherence and content preservation, while scaling data and integrating VLM with diffusion models.

Method: Developed a meta-info data curation pipeline, joint learning for diffusion and reward losses, and evaluated on real image benchmarks.

Result: Achieved a 56.1% usability rate, outperforming SeedEdit 1.6 (38.4%), GPT4o (37.1%), and Gemini 2.0 (30.3%).

Conclusion: SeedEdit 3.0 offers a superior trade-off in real image editing, validated by benchmark performance.

Abstract: We introduce SeedEdit 3.0, in companion with our T2I model Seedream 3.0 [22],
which significantly improves over our previous version [27] in both aspects of
edit instruction following and image content (e.g., ID/IP) preservation on real
image inputs. Additional to model upgrading with T2I, in this report, we
present several key improvements. First, we develop an enhanced data curation
pipeline with a meta-info paradigm and meta-info embedding strategy that help
mix images from multiple data sources. This allows us to scale editing data
effectively, and meta information is helpfult to connect VLM with diffusion
model more closely. Second, we introduce a joint learning pipeline for
computing a diffusion loss and a reward loss. Finally, we evaluate SeedEdit 3.0
on our testing benchmarks, for real image editing, where it achieves a best
trade-off between multiple aspects, yielding a high usability rate of 56.1%,
compared to SeedEdit 1.6 (38.4%), GPT4o (37.1%) and Gemini 2.0 (30.3%).

*HaoTian Lan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Multimodal Street Evaluation Framework (MSEF) combining vision and language models to assess streetscapes, achieving high accuracy and alignment with resident perceptions while revealing nuanced urban dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current street metrics lack the ability to capture subjective perceptions crucial for inclusive urban design, necessitating a framework that integrates objective and subjective evaluations.

Method: The study develops MSEF by fusing a vision transformer (VisualGLM-6B) with GPT-4, fine-tuned using LoRA and P-Tuning v2 on 15,000 annotated street-view images from Harbin, China.

Result: MSEF achieves an F1 score of 0.84 on objective features and 89.3% agreement with resident perceptions, uncovering context-dependent contradictions and nonlinear patterns in urban perception.

Conclusion: MSEF bridges sensory data and socio-affective inference, offering methodological innovation and practical utility for urban planning aligned with SDG 11.

Abstract: While objective street metrics derived from imagery or GIS have become
standard in urban analytics, they remain insufficient to capture subjective
perceptions essential to inclusive urban design. This study introduces a novel
Multimodal Street Evaluation Framework (MSEF) that fuses a vision transformer
(VisualGLM-6B) with a large language model (GPT-4), enabling interpretable
dual-output assessment of streetscapes. Leveraging over 15,000 annotated
street-view images from Harbin, China, we fine-tune the framework using LoRA
and P-Tuning v2 for parameter-efficient adaptation. The model achieves an F1
score of 0.84 on objective features and 89.3 percent agreement with aggregated
resident perceptions, validated across stratified socioeconomic geographies.
Beyond classification accuracy, MSEF captures context-dependent contradictions:
for instance, informal commerce boosts perceived vibrancy while simultaneously
reducing pedestrian comfort. It also identifies nonlinear and semantically
contingent patterns -- such as the divergent perceptual effects of
architectural transparency across residential and commercial zones -- revealing
the limits of universal spatial heuristics. By generating natural-language
rationales grounded in attention mechanisms, the framework bridges sensory data
with socio-affective inference, enabling transparent diagnostics aligned with
SDG 11. This work offers both methodological innovation in urban perception
modeling and practical utility for planning systems seeking to reconcile
infrastructural precision with lived experience.

*Haosong Liu,Yuge Cheng,Zihan Liu,Aiyue Chen,Yiwu Yao,Chen Chen,Jingwen Leng,Yu Feng,Minyi Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASTRAEA is an automatic framework for optimizing video diffusion transformers (vDiTs), achieving significant speedups (up to 13.2x on 8 GPUs) with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational demands of vDiTs limit practical deployment; existing acceleration methods rely on heuristics, reducing applicability.

Method: ASTRAEA introduces a lightweight token selection mechanism, GPU-parallel sparse attention, and an evolutionary algorithm to optimize token reduction.

Result: Achieves up to 2.4x speedup on a single GPU (13.2x on 8 GPUs) with <0.5% loss in VBench score.

Conclusion: ASTRAEA effectively balances speed and quality, making vDiTs more practical for deployment.

Abstract: Video diffusion transformers (vDiTs) have made impressive progress in
text-to-video generation, but their high computational demands present major
challenges for practical deployment. While existing acceleration methods reduce
workload at various granularities, they often rely on heuristics, limiting
their applicability.
  We introduce ASTRAEA, an automatic framework that searches for near-optimal
configurations for vDiT-based video generation. At its core, ASTRAEA proposes a
lightweight token selection mechanism and a memory-efficient, GPU-parallel
sparse attention strategy, enabling linear reductions in execution time with
minimal impact on generation quality. To determine optimal token reduction for
different timesteps, we further design a search framework that leverages a
classic evolutionary algorithm to automatically determine the distribution of
the token budget effectively. Together, ASTRAEA achieves up to 2.4x inference
speedup on a single GPU with great scalability (up to 13.2x speedup on 8 GPUs)
while retaining better video quality compared to the state-of-the-art methods
(<0.5% loss on the VBench score compared to the baseline vDiT models).

*Revant Teotia,Candace Ross,Karen Ullrich,Sumit Chopra,Adriana Romero-Soriano,Melissa Hall,Matthew J. Muckley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DIM-CIM, a reference-free framework to measure diversity and generalization in text-to-image models, addressing gaps in existing evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for text-to-image models either rely on reference datasets or lack specificity, limiting adaptability and interpretability.

Method: The authors propose the DIM-CIM framework, which measures default-mode diversity and generalization capacity, and construct the COCO-DIMCIM benchmark using COCO concepts and LLM-augmented captions.

Result: Scaling model parameters improves generalization but reduces default-mode diversity. DIM-CIM identifies fine-grained failure cases and shows a strong correlation (0.85) between training data diversity and model diversity.

Conclusion: DIM-CIM offers a flexible, interpretable framework for evaluating text-to-image models, enhancing understanding of their performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models have achieved impressive
quality and consistency. However, this has come at the cost of representation
diversity. While automatic evaluation methods exist for benchmarking model
diversity, they either require reference image datasets or lack specificity
about the kind of diversity measured, limiting their adaptability and
interpretability. To address this gap, we introduce the Does-it/Can-it
framework, DIM-CIM, a reference-free measurement of default-mode diversity
("Does" the model generate images with expected attributes?) and generalization
capacity ("Can" the model generate diverse attributes for a particular
concept?). We construct the COCO-DIMCIM benchmark, which is seeded with COCO
concepts and captions and augmented by a large language model. With
COCO-DIMCIM, we find that widely-used models improve in generalization at the
cost of default-mode diversity when scaling from 1.5B to 8.1B parameters.
DIMCIM also identifies fine-grained failure cases, such as attributes that are
generated with generic prompts but are rarely generated when explicitly
requested. Finally, we use DIMCIM to evaluate the training data of a T2I model
and observe a correlation of 0.85 between diversity in training images and
default-mode diversity. Our work provides a flexible and interpretable
framework for assessing T2I model diversity and generalization, enabling a more
comprehensive understanding of model performance.

*Benedikt Hopf,Radu Timofte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Practical Manipulation Model (PMM) to improve deepfake detection under non-ideal conditions by expanding forgery types and adding degradations, achieving better robustness and performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake detection models struggle with non-ideal conditions and are easily circumvented. The paper aims to enhance robustness and generality by simulating real-world degradations and diverse forgeries.

Method: Developed PMM with Poisson blending, diverse masks, generator artifacts, and distractors. Added strong degradations to training images to improve detector robustness.

Result: Achieved significant improvements: 3.51% and 6.21% AUC increases on DFDC and DFDCP datasets, respectively, over the state-of-the-art LAA backbone.

Conclusion: PMM enhances deepfake detection robustness and performance, addressing limitations of previous detectors under non-ideal conditions.

Abstract: Modern deepfake detection models have achieved strong performance even on the
challenging cross-dataset task. However, detection performance under non-ideal
conditions remains very unstable, limiting success on some benchmark datasets
and making it easy to circumvent detection. Inspired by the move to a more
real-world degradation model in the area of image super-resolution, we have
developed a Practical Manipulation Model (PMM) that covers a larger set of
possible forgeries. We extend the space of pseudo-fakes by using Poisson
blending, more diverse masks, generator artifacts, and distractors.
Additionally, we improve the detectors' generality and robustness by adding
strong degradations to the training images. We demonstrate that these changes
not only significantly enhance the model's robustness to common image
degradations but also improve performance on standard benchmark datasets.
Specifically, we show clear increases of $3.51\%$ and $6.21\%$ AUC on the DFDC
and DFDCP datasets, respectively, over the s-o-t-a LAA backbone. Furthermore,
we highlight the lack of robustness in previous detectors and our improvements
in this regard. Code can be found at https://github.com/BenediktHopf/PMM

TL;DR: CIVET framework evaluates VLMs' understanding of object properties and relations, revealing limitations in accuracy, positional bias, and relational comprehension compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically assess VLMs' scene comprehension, addressing gaps in standardized evaluation and uncontrolled biases.

Method: Introduces CIVET, a controlled framework for evaluating VLMs using noise-free stimuli, testing five state-of-the-art models.

Result: VLMs recognize limited basic properties, depend on object position, and struggle with relations, lagging behind human accuracy.

Conclusion: Current VLMs lack robust scene understanding, highlighting the need for improved models and evaluation methods.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved competitive performance in
various tasks, their comprehension of the underlying structure and semantics of
a scene remains understudied. To investigate the understanding of VLMs, we
study their capability regarding object properties and relations in a
controlled and interpretable manner. To this scope, we introduce CIVET, a novel
and extensible framework for systematiC evaluatIon Via controllEd sTimuli.
CIVET addresses the lack of standardized systematic evaluation for assessing
VLMs' understanding, enabling researchers to test hypotheses with statistical
rigor. With CIVET, we evaluate five state-of-the-art VLMs on exhaustive sets of
stimuli, free from annotation noise, dataset-specific biases, and uncontrolled
scene complexity. Our findings reveal that 1) current VLMs can accurately
recognize only a limited set of basic object properties; 2) their performance
heavily depends on the position of the object in the scene; 3) they struggle to
understand basic relations among objects. Furthermore, a comparative evaluation
with human annotators reveals that VLMs still fall short of achieving
human-level accuracy.

Result: FRED provides densely annotated data, evaluation protocols, and standard metrics for reproducible benchmarking.

Conclusion: FRED aims to advance research in high-speed drone perception and multimodal spatiotemporal understanding.

Abstract: Small, fast, and lightweight drones present significant challenges for
traditional RGB cameras due to their limitations in capturing fast-moving
objects, especially under challenging lighting conditions. Event cameras offer
an ideal solution, providing high temporal definition and dynamic range, yet
existing benchmarks often lack fine temporal resolution or drone-specific
motion patterns, hindering progress in these areas. This paper introduces the
Florence RGB-Event Drone dataset (FRED), a novel multimodal dataset
specifically designed for drone detection, tracking, and trajectory
forecasting, combining RGB video and event streams. FRED features more than 7
hours of densely annotated drone trajectories, using 5 different drone models
and including challenging scenarios such as rain and adverse lighting
conditions. We provide detailed evaluation protocols and standard metrics for
each task, facilitating reproducible benchmarking. The authors hope FRED will

TL;DR: The paper proposes a non-neural-network method for through-the-wall radar human activity recognition, using micro-Doppler signatures and topological similarity for classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To revisit traditional signal processing methods with strong physical interpretability, avoiding reliance on neural networks for human activity recognition in TWR.

Method: Generates range-time and Doppler-time maps, segments micro-Doppler signatures using active contour models, discretizes features into point clouds, and calculates topological similarity with templates using the Mapper algorithm.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness through numerical simulations and measured experiments.

Conclusion: The method successfully achieves intelligent recognition without neural networks, offering a physically interpretable alternative.

Abstract: After a few years of research in the field of through-the-wall radar (TWR)
human activity recognition (HAR), I found that we seem to be stuck in the
mindset of training on radar image data through neural network models. The
earliest related works in this field based on template matching did not require
a training process, and I believe they have never died. Because these methods
possess a strong physical interpretability and are closer to the basis of
theoretical signal processing research. In this paper, I would like to try to
return to the original path by attempting to eschew neural networks to achieve
the TWR HAR task and challenge to achieve intelligent recognition as neural
network models. In detail, the range-time map and Doppler-time map of TWR are
first generated. Then, the initial regions of the human target foreground and
noise background on the maps are determined using corner detection method, and
the micro-Doppler signature is segmented using the multiphase active contour
model. The micro-Doppler segmentation feature is discretized into a
two-dimensional point cloud. Finally, the topological similarity between the
resulting point cloud and the point clouds of the template data is calculated
using Mapper algorithm to obtain the recognition results. The effectiveness of
the proposed method is demonstrated by numerical simulated and measured
experiments. The open-source code of this work is released at:

TL;DR: TAO introduces a granular video anomaly detection framework integrating fine-grained object detection, segmentation, and tracking for precise anomaly localization without threshold tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VAD methods lack finer-grained analysis (e.g., anomalous pixels), limiting anomaly detection breadth.

Method: TAO transforms anomaly detection into pixel-level tracking, linking scores to segmentation and tracking tasks.

Result: TAO achieves superior accuracy and robustness in anomaly detection benchmarks.

Conclusion: TAO advances VAD by unifying fine-grained anomaly detection and tracking, eliminating threshold tuning.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial in scenarios such as surveillance
and autonomous driving, where timely detection of unexpected activities is
essential. Although existing methods have primarily focused on detecting
anomalous objects in videos -- either by identifying anomalous frames or
objects -- they often neglect finer-grained analysis, such as anomalous pixels,
which limits their ability to capture a broader range of anomalies. To address
this challenge, we propose a new framework called Track Any Anomalous Object
(TAO), which introduces a granular video anomaly detection pipeline that, for
the first time, integrates the detection of multiple fine-grained anomalous
objects into a unified framework. Unlike methods that assign anomaly scores to
every pixel, our approach transforms the problem into pixel-level tracking of
anomalous objects. By linking anomaly scores to downstream tasks such as
segmentation and tracking, our method removes the need for threshold tuning and
achieves more precise anomaly localization in long and complex video sequences.
Experiments demonstrate that TAO sets new benchmarks in accuracy and
robustness. Project page available online.

TL;DR: TAPFM introduces a single-GPU method for adapting pathology foundation models (PFMs) using vision transformer attention for multiple instance learning (MIL), outperforming benchmarks in mutation prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting pretrained PFMs for clinical tasks is challenging due to weak WSI-level labels, requiring MIL for effective analysis.

Method: TAPFM uses ViT attention for MIL aggregation, optimizing feature representations and attention weights while maintaining separate computational graphs for stable training.

Result: TAPFM outperforms conventional methods in mutation prediction for bladder cancer and lung adenocarcinoma, handling multi-label classification effectively.

Conclusion: TAPFM enables practical adaptation of PFMs on standard hardware for diverse clinical applications.

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
analyzing whole slide images (WSIs). However, adapting these pretrained PFMs
for specific clinical tasks presents considerable challenges, primarily due to
the availability of only weak (WSI-level) labels for gigapixel images,
necessitating multiple instance learning (MIL) paradigm for effective WSI
analysis. This paper proposes a novel approach for single-GPU \textbf{T}ask
\textbf{A}daptation of \textbf{PFM}s (TAPFM) that uses vision transformer
(\vit) attention for MIL aggregation while optimizing both for feature
representations and attention weights. The proposed approach maintains separate
computational graphs for MIL aggregator and the PFM to create stable training
dynamics that align with downstream task objectives during end-to-end
adaptation. Evaluated on mutation prediction tasks for bladder cancer and lung
adenocarcinoma across institutional and TCGA cohorts, TAPFM consistently
outperforms conventional approaches, with H-Optimus-0 (TAPFM) outperforming the

### [275] [MokA: Multimodal Low-Rank Adaptation for MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05191)
*Yake Wei,Yu Miao,Dongzhan Zhou,Di Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multimodal low-rank Adaptation (MokA), a fine-tuning strategy for MLLMs that addresses unimodal and cross-modal adaptation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal fine-tuning methods, borrowed from LLMs, overlook multimodal differences, limiting modality utilization.

Method: Proposes MokA, using modality-specific parameters for unimodal compression and enhancing cross-modal interaction.

Result: Experiments across diverse multimodal scenarios and LLM backbones show consistent improvements.

Conclusion: MokA offers a targeted solution for efficient MLLM adaptation, enabling further exploration.

Abstract: In this paper, we reveal that most current efficient multimodal fine-tuning
methods are hindered by a key limitation: they are directly borrowed from LLMs,
often neglecting the intrinsic differences of multimodal scenarios and even
affecting the full utilization of all modalities. Inspired by our empirical
observation, we argue that unimodal adaptation and cross-modal adaptation are
two essential parts for the effective fine-tuning of MLLMs. From this
perspective, we propose Multimodal low-rank Adaptation (MokA), a
multimodal-aware efficient fine-tuning strategy that takes multimodal
characteristics into consideration. It compresses unimodal information by
modality-specific parameters while explicitly enhancing cross-modal
interaction, ensuring both unimodal and cross-modal adaptation. Extensive
experiments cover three representative multimodal scenarios (audio-visual-text,
visual-text, and speech-text), and multiple LLM backbones (LLaMA2/3, Qwen2,
Qwen2.5-VL, etc). Consistent improvements indicate the efficacy and versatility
of the proposed method. Ablation studies and efficiency evaluation are also
conducted to fully asses our method. Overall, we think MokA provides a more
targeted solution for efficient adaptation of MLLMs, paving the way for further
exploration. The project page is at https://gewu-lab.github.io/MokA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A vision-aided autonomous reflector system enhances mmWave communication in NLoS conditions by dynamically steering signals using a motorized metallic plate, achieving significant signal strength gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable mmWave communication in NLoS conditions is challenging, especially in urban or infrastructure-limited environments, necessitating innovative solutions.

Method: The system uses a monocular camera to detect ArUco markers on nodes, estimate angles of arrival, and align a reflector in real time for optimal signal redirection.

Result: Experiments show a 23 dB average gain in signal strength and a 0.89 probability of maintaining reception above -65 dB, outperforming static/no-reflector baselines.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates potential for resilient and adaptive mmWave connectivity in complex environments.

Abstract: Reliable millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication in non-line-of-sight (NLoS)
conditions remains a major challenge for both military and civilian operations,
especially in urban or infrastructure-limited environments. This paper presents
a vision-aided autonomous reflector system designed to enhance mmWave link
performance by dynamically steering signal reflections using a motorized
metallic plate. The proposed system leverages a monocular camera to detect
ArUco markers on allied transmitter and receiver nodes, estimate their angles
of arrival, and align the reflector in real time for optimal signal
redirection. This approach enables selective beam coverage by serving only
authenticated targets with visible markers and reduces the risk of unintended
signal exposure. The designed prototype, built on a Raspberry Pi 4 and
low-power hardware, operates autonomously without reliance on external
infrastructure or GPS. Experimental results at 60\,GHz demonstrate a 23\,dB
average gain in received signal strength and an 0.89 probability of maintaining
signal reception above a target threshold of -65 dB in an indoor environment,
far exceeding the static and no-reflector baselines. These results demonstrate
the system's potential for resilient and adaptive mmWave connectivity in
complex and dynamic environments.

*Yuxin Wen,Yangsibo Huang,Tom Goldstein,Ravi Kumar,Badih Ghazi,Chiyuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates cross-modality memorization in vision-language models, revealing gaps in information transfer between modalities and proposing a baseline mitigation method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand neural network memorization, especially in multimodal settings, addressing both unintentional memorization of sensitive data and effective knowledge acquisition.

Method: Uses a synthetic persona dataset to train models on one modality and evaluate performance in another, quantifying memorization and transferability.

Result: Facts learned in one modality transfer to another, but with a significant gap in recall between source and target modalities, observed across various scenarios.

Conclusion: Proposes a baseline method to mitigate the gap and encourages future research for more robust multimodal learning techniques.

Abstract: Understanding what and how neural networks memorize during training is
crucial, both from the perspective of unintentional memorization of potentially
sensitive information and from the standpoint of effective knowledge
acquisition for real-world, knowledge-intensive tasks. While previous studies
primarily investigate memorization within a single modality, such as text
memorization in large language models or image memorization in diffusion
models, unified multimodal models are becoming increasingly prevalent in
practical applications. In this work, we focus on the unique characteristics of
cross-modality memorization and conduct a systematic study centered on
vision-language models. To facilitate controlled experiments, we first
introduce a synthetic persona dataset comprising diverse synthetic person
images and textual descriptions. We quantify factual knowledge memorization and
cross-modal transferability by training models on a single modality and
evaluating their performance in the other. Our results reveal that facts
learned in one modality transfer to the other, but a significant gap exists
between recalling information in the source and target modalities. Furthermore,
we observe that this gap exists across various scenarios, including more
capable models, machine unlearning, and the multi-hop case. At the end, we
propose a baseline method to mitigate this challenge. We hope our study can
inspire future research on developing more robust multimodal learning
techniques to enhance cross-modal transferability.

*Yani Zhang,Dongming Wu,Hao Shi,Yingfei Liu,Tiancai Wang,Haoqiang Fan,Xingping Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper questions if embodied 3D grounding benefits from detection models and finds detection models outperform grounding models. It introduces DEGround, a framework combining detection and grounding, achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether embodied 3D grounding truly benefits from detection models and to address limitations in current grounding methods.

Method: Proposes DEGround, integrating DETR queries for detection and grounding, with regional activation and query-wise modulation modules for better language understanding.

Result: DEGround outperforms BIP3D by 7.52% on the EmbodiedScan validation set.

Conclusion: Detection models can outperform grounding models, and DEGround effectively combines detection and grounding for improved performance.

Abstract: Embodied 3D grounding aims to localize target objects described in human
instructions from ego-centric viewpoint. Most methods typically follow a
two-stage paradigm where a trained 3D detector's optimized backbone parameters
are used to initialize a grounding model. In this study, we explore a
fundamental question: Does embodied 3D grounding benefit enough from detection?
To answer this question, we assess the grounding performance of detection
models using predicted boxes filtered by the target category. Surprisingly,
these detection models without any instruction-specific training outperform the
grounding models explicitly trained with language instructions. This indicates
that even category-level embodied 3D grounding may not be well resolved, let
alone more fine-grained context-aware grounding. Motivated by this finding, we
propose DEGround, which shares DETR queries as object representation for both
DEtection and Grounding and enables the grounding to benefit from basic
category classification and box detection. Based on this framework, we further
introduce a regional activation grounding module that highlights
instruction-related regions and a query-wise modulation module that
incorporates sentence-level semantic into the query representation,
strengthening the context-aware understanding of language instructions.
Remarkably, DEGround outperforms state-of-the-art model BIP3D by 7.52\% at
overall accuracy on the EmbodiedScan validation set. The source code will be
publicly available at https://github.com/zyn213/DEGround.

*Yanbo Wang,Ziyi Wang,Wenzhao Zheng,Jie Zhou,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OGGSplat is a method for semantic-aware 3D scene reconstruction from sparse views, using open Gaussians and RGB-semantic consistent inpainting for improved field-of-view expansion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient and generalizable 3D reconstruction from sparse views, driven by applications like virtual reality and embodied AI, where existing methods fall short.

Method: OGGSplat initializes open Gaussians from sparse views, applies an RGB-semantic consistent inpainting module, and optimizes Gaussian parameters progressively.

Result: The method achieves semantic-aware reconstruction and outperforms in semantic and generative quality, as shown on the Gaussian Outpainting benchmark.

Conclusion: OGGSplat offers a promising solution for semantic-aware 3D reconstruction from sparse views, with practical applicability demonstrated via smartphone-captured images.

Abstract: Reconstructing semantic-aware 3D scenes from sparse views is a challenging
yet essential research direction, driven by the demands of emerging
applications such as virtual reality and embodied AI. Existing per-scene
optimization methods require dense input views and incur high computational
costs, while generalizable approaches often struggle to reconstruct regions
outside the input view cone. In this paper, we propose OGGSplat, an open
Gaussian growing method that expands the field-of-view in generalizable 3D
reconstruction. Our key insight is that the semantic attributes of open
Gaussians provide strong priors for image extrapolation, enabling both semantic
consistency and visual plausibility. Specifically, once open Gaussians are
initialized from sparse views, we introduce an RGB-semantic consistent
inpainting module applied to selected rendered views. This module enforces
bidirectional control between an image diffusion model and a semantic diffusion
model. The inpainted regions are then lifted back into 3D space for efficient
and progressive Gaussian parameter optimization. To evaluate our method, we
establish a Gaussian Outpainting (GO) benchmark that assesses both semantic and
generative quality of reconstructed open-vocabulary scenes. OGGSplat also
demonstrates promising semantic-aware scene reconstruction capabilities when
provided with two view images captured directly from a smartphone camera.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Follow-Your-Motion, an efficient two-stage framework for video motion transfer using a spatial-temporal decoupled LoRA to improve motion consistency and tuning efficiency in large video diffusion transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion-transfer methods suffer from motion inconsistency and inefficiency due to spatial-temporal coupling in 3D attention operators and time-consuming fine-tuning.

Method: Proposes a spatial-temporal decoupled LoRA for attention architecture and introduces sparse motion sampling and adaptive RoPE to accelerate tuning. Also introduces MotionBench, a benchmark for diverse motion types.

Result: Extensive evaluations on MotionBench demonstrate the superiority of Follow-Your-Motion in maintaining motion consistency and efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses motion inconsistency and tuning inefficiency, validated by the new benchmark.

Abstract: Recently, breakthroughs in the video diffusion transformer have shown
remarkable capabilities in diverse motion generations. As for the
motion-transfer task, current methods mainly use two-stage Low-Rank Adaptations
(LoRAs) finetuning to obtain better performance. However, existing
adaptation-based motion transfer still suffers from motion inconsistency and
tuning inefficiency when applied to large video diffusion transformers. Naive
two-stage LoRA tuning struggles to maintain motion consistency between
generated and input videos due to the inherent spatial-temporal coupling in the
3D attention operator. Additionally, they require time-consuming fine-tuning
processes in both stages. To tackle these issues, we propose
Follow-Your-Motion, an efficient two-stage video motion transfer framework that
finetunes a powerful video diffusion transformer to synthesize complex
motion.Specifically, we propose a spatial-temporal decoupled LoRA to decouple
the attention architecture for spatial appearance and temporal motion
processing. During the second training stage, we design the sparse motion
sampling and adaptive RoPE to accelerate the tuning speed. To address the lack
of a benchmark for this field, we introduce MotionBench, a comprehensive
benchmark comprising diverse motion, including creative camera motion, single
object motion, multiple object motion, and complex human motion. We show
extensive evaluations on MotionBench to verify the superiority of
Follow-Your-Motion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DSG-World is an end-to-end framework for 3D Gaussian World modeling using dual state observations to address occlusion issues and ensure consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing world modeling methods struggle with training complexity, 3D/physical consistency, or multi-stage processing due to occlusions.

Method: Leverages dual perturbed observations to build segmentation-aware Gaussian fields, enforcing photometric/semantic consistency and using pseudo intermediate states for alignment.

Result: Achieves stable, complete reconstruction with high-fidelity rendering and object-level manipulation, generalizing well to novel views and states.

Conclusion: DSG-World offers an efficient, explicit solution for 3D reconstruction and simulation, outperforming traditional methods.

Abstract: Building an efficient and physically consistent world model from limited
observations is a long standing challenge in vision and robotics. Many existing
world modeling pipelines are based on implicit generative models, which are
hard to train and often lack 3D or physical consistency. On the other hand,
explicit 3D methods built from a single state often require multi-stage
processing-such as segmentation, background completion, and inpainting-due to
occlusions. To address this, we leverage two perturbed observations of the same
scene under different object configurations. These dual states offer
complementary visibility, alleviating occlusion issues during state transitions
and enabling more stable and complete reconstruction. In this paper, we present
DSG-World, a novel end-to-end framework that explicitly constructs a 3D
Gaussian World model from Dual State observations. Our approach builds dual
segmentation-aware Gaussian fields and enforces bidirectional photometric and
semantic consistency. We further introduce a pseudo intermediate state for
symmetric alignment and design collaborative co-pruning trategies to refine
geometric completeness. DSG-World enables efficient real-to-simulation transfer
purely in the explicit Gaussian representation space, supporting high-fidelity
rendering and object-level scene manipulation without relying on dense
observations or multi-stage pipelines. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong
generalization to novel views and scene states, highlighting the effectiveness
of our approach for real-world 3D reconstruction and simulation.

TL;DR: MonkeyOCR introduces a vision-language model using the SRR triplet paradigm for efficient and accurate document parsing, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify and improve document parsing by avoiding complex multi-tool pipelines and inefficient large models.

Method: Uses the Structure-Recognition-Relation (SRR) triplet paradigm to decompose parsing into layout analysis, content identification, and logical ordering.

Result: Outperforms MinerU by 5.1% on average, with significant gains on formulas (+15.0%) and tables (+8.6%). Faster processing (0.84 pages/sec) and efficient deployment on a single GPU.

Conclusion: MonkeyOCR achieves state-of-the-art performance with a scalable and efficient approach, validated by the comprehensive MonkeyDoc dataset.

Abstract: We introduce MonkeyOCR, a vision-language model for document parsing that
advances the state of the art by leveraging a Structure-Recognition-Relation
(SRR) triplet paradigm. This design simplifies what would otherwise be a
complex multi-tool pipeline (as in MinerU's modular approach) and avoids the
inefficiencies of processing full pages with giant end-to-end models (e.g.,
large multimodal LLMs like Qwen-VL). In SRR, document parsing is abstracted
into three fundamental questions - "Where is it?" (structure), "What is it?"
(recognition), and "How is it organized?" (relation) - corresponding to layout
analysis, content identification, and logical ordering. This focused
decomposition balances accuracy and speed: it enables efficient, scalable
processing without sacrificing precision. To train and evaluate this approach,
we introduce the MonkeyDoc (the most comprehensive document parsing dataset to
date), with 3.9 million instances spanning over ten document types in both
Chinese and English. Experiments show that MonkeyOCR outperforms MinerU by an
average of 5.1%, with particularly notable improvements on challenging content
such as formulas (+15.0%) and tables (+8.6%). Remarkably, our 3B-parameter
model surpasses much larger and top-performing models, including Qwen2.5-VL
(72B) and Gemini 2.5 Pro, achieving state-of-the-art average performance on
English document parsing tasks. In addition, MonkeyOCR processes multi-page
documents significantly faster (0.84 pages per second compared to 0.65 for
MinerU and 0.12 for Qwen2.5-VL-7B). The 3B model can be efficiently deployed
for inference on a single NVIDIA 3090 GPU. Code and models will be released at
https://github.com/Yuliang-Liu/MonkeyOCR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM-TTA improves medical image segmentation by adapting SAM at test time, addressing input and semantic discrepancies without losing generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM lacks adaptability to medical domains, and existing adaptations like MedSAM reduce generalization. SAM-TTA aims to preserve SAM's generalization while enhancing medical segmentation.

Method: SAM-TTA includes SBCT for input-level adaptation and DUMT for semantic-level alignment, using consistency learning without retraining.

Result: Outperforms existing TTA methods and MedSAM in some cases, validated on five datasets.

Conclusion: SAM-TTA sets a new paradigm for universal medical image segmentation by balancing performance and generalization.

Abstract: Universal medical image segmentation using the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
remains challenging due to its limited adaptability to medical domains.
Existing adaptations, such as MedSAM, enhance SAM's performance in medical
imaging but at the cost of reduced generalization to unseen data. Therefore, in
this paper, we propose SAM-aware Test-Time Adaptation (SAM-TTA), a
fundamentally different pipeline that preserves the generalization of SAM while
improving its segmentation performance in medical imaging via a test-time
framework. SAM-TTA tackles two key challenges: (1) input-level discrepancies
caused by differences in image acquisition between natural and medical images
and (2) semantic-level discrepancies due to fundamental differences in object
definition between natural and medical domains (e.g., clear boundaries vs.
ambiguous structures). Specifically, our SAM-TTA framework comprises (1)
Self-adaptive Bezier Curve-based Transformation (SBCT), which adaptively
converts single-channel medical images into three-channel SAM-compatible inputs
while maintaining structural integrity, to mitigate the input gap between
medical and natural images, and (2) Dual-scale Uncertainty-driven Mean Teacher
adaptation (DUMT), which employs consistency learning to align SAM's internal
representations to medical semantics, enabling efficient adaptation without
auxiliary supervision or expensive retraining. Extensive experiments on five
public datasets demonstrate that our SAM-TTA outperforms existing TTA
approaches and even surpasses fully fine-tuned models such as MedSAM in certain
scenarios, establishing a new paradigm for universal medical image
segmentation. Code can be found at https://github.com/JianghaoWu/SAM-TTA.

TL;DR: MoViX is a self-supervised framework for robust 3-DoF localization in GPS-denied, off-road environments, addressing perceptual ambiguities and seasonal shifts by learning invariant representations and using motion-informed sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in GPS-denied, off-road environments include perceptual ambiguities from repetitive vegetation and seasonal appearance shifts, making alignment with outdated satellite imagery difficult.

Method: MoViX uses pose-dependent positive sampling, hard negative mining, motion-informed frame sampling, and a lightweight temporal aggregator. It integrates with Monte Carlo Localization and employs entropy-guided temperature scaling.

Result: MoViX localizes within 25 meters 93% of the time and within 50 meters 100% of the time on the TartanDrive 2.0 dataset, outperforming baselines without environment-specific tuning.

Conclusion: MoViX demonstrates robust localization in challenging environments and generalizes well to unseen regions and different platforms, offering a scalable solution for off-road navigation.

Abstract: Robust cross-view 3-DoF localization in GPS-denied, off-road environments
remains challenging due to (1) perceptual ambiguities from repetitive
vegetation and unstructured terrain, and (2) seasonal shifts that significantly
alter scene appearance, hindering alignment with outdated satellite imagery. To
address this, we introduce MoViX, a self-supervised cross-view video
localization framework that learns viewpoint- and season-invariant
representations while preserving directional awareness essential for accurate
localization. MoViX employs a pose-dependent positive sampling strategy to
enhance directional discrimination and temporally aligned hard negative mining
to discourage shortcut learning from seasonal cues. A motion-informed frame
sampler selects spatially diverse frames, and a lightweight temporal aggregator
emphasizes geometrically aligned observations while downweighting ambiguous
ones. At inference, MoViX runs within a Monte Carlo Localization framework,
using a learned cross-view matching module in place of handcrafted models.
Entropy-guided temperature scaling enables robust multi-hypothesis tracking and
confident convergence under visual ambiguity. We evaluate MoViX on the
TartanDrive 2.0 dataset, training on under 30 minutes of data and testing over
12.29 km. Despite outdated satellite imagery, MoViX localizes within 25 meters
of ground truth 93% of the time, and within 50 meters 100% of the time in
unseen regions, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines without
environment-specific tuning. We further demonstrate generalization on a
real-world off-road dataset from a geographically distinct site with a
different robot platform.

TL;DR: LeanPO, a reference-free method, addresses likelihood displacement in Video-LLMs by reformulating rewards and using self-generated preference data, improving performance and alignment with human trustworthiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing preference alignment techniques in Video-LLMs, like DPO, inadvertently decrease the likelihood of target responses, worsening with video complexity.

Method: Proposes LeanPO, which reformulates rewards as average likelihood and uses a self-generated preference data pipeline with dynamic label smoothing.

Result: LeanPO enhances Video-LLM performance, boosts baselines, and aligns preferences with human trustworthiness efficiently.

Conclusion: LeanPO provides a reliable and efficient solution for Video-LLM preference alignment, mitigating unintended drops in likelihood.

Abstract: Most Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) adopt preference alignment
techniques, e.g., DPO~\citep{rafailov2024dpo}, to optimize the reward margin
between a winning response ($y_w$) and a losing response ($y_l$). However, the
likelihood displacement observed in DPO indicates that both $\log \pi_\theta
(y_w\mid x)$ and $\log \pi_\theta (y_l\mid x) $ often decrease during training,
inadvertently boosting the probabilities of non-target responses. In this
paper, we systematically revisit this phenomenon from LLMs to Video-LLMs,
showing that it intensifies when dealing with the redundant complexity of video
content. To alleviate the impact of this phenomenon, we propose \emph{Lean
Preference Optimization} (LeanPO), a reference-free approach that reformulates
the implicit reward as the average likelihood of the response with respect to
the policy model. A key component of LeanPO is the reward-trustworthiness
correlated self-generated preference data pipeline, which carefully infuses
relevant prior knowledge into the model while continuously refining the
preference data via self-reflection. This allows the policy model to obtain
high-quality paired data and accurately estimate the newly defined reward, thus
mitigating the unintended drop. In addition, we introduce a dynamic label
smoothing strategy that mitigates the impact of noise in responses from diverse
video content, preventing the model from overfitting to spurious details.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that LeanPO significantly enhances the
performance of state-of-the-art Video-LLMs, consistently boosting baselines of
varying capacities with minimal additional training overhead. Moreover, LeanPO
offers a simple yet effective solution for aligning Video-LLM preferences with
human trustworthiness, paving the way toward the reliable and efficient
Video-LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper explores using Foundation Models (FM) to improve generalization in Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) for ID cards across diverse countries, highlighting the importance of bona fide images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of limited generalization in PAD systems due to privacy constraints and small training datasets.

Method: Utilizing FM with zero-shot and fine-tuning approaches, tested on Chilean ID datasets and an open-set from Finland, Spain, and Slovakia.

Result: Bona fide images are crucial for achieving generalization in PAD systems.

Conclusion: FM can enhance PAD generalization, with bona fide images playing a key role.

Abstract: Nowadays, one of the main challenges in presentation attack detection (PAD)
on ID cards is obtaining generalisation capabilities for a diversity of
countries that are issuing ID cards. Most PAD systems are trained on one, two,
or three ID documents because of privacy protection concerns. As a result, they
do not obtain competitive results for commercial purposes when tested in an
unknown new ID card country. In this scenario, Foundation Models (FM) trained
on huge datasets can help to improve generalisation capabilities. This work
intends to improve and benchmark the capabilities of FM and how to use them to
adapt the generalisation on PAD of ID Documents. Different test protocols were
used, considering zero-shot and fine-tuning and two different ID card datasets.
One private dataset based on Chilean IDs and one open-set based on three ID
countries: Finland, Spain, and Slovakia. Our findings indicate that bona fide
images are the key to generalisation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TF-CoVR is a new benchmark for temporally fine-grained Composed Video Retrieval (CoVR), focusing on gymnastics and diving, with 180K triplets. It improves over existing benchmarks by linking queries to multiple target videos. The proposed TF-CoVR-Base model enhances retrieval performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CoVR benchmarks lack the ability to capture subtle, fast-paced temporal differences, limiting their practical usefulness.

Method: TF-CoVR-Base uses a two-stage framework: (i) pre-training a video encoder for fine-grained action classification, and (ii) aligning queries with videos via contrastive learning.

Result: TF-CoVR-Base improves zero-shot mAP@50 from 5.92 to 7.51 and raises fine-tuned state-of-the-art from 19.83 to 25.82.

Conclusion: TF-CoVR addresses the gap in temporally fine-grained CoVR, and TF-CoVR-Base demonstrates superior performance, setting a new benchmark for the field.

Abstract: Composed Video Retrieval (CoVR) retrieves a target video given a query video
and a modification text describing the intended change. Existing CoVR
benchmarks emphasize appearance shifts or coarse event changes and therefore do
not test the ability to capture subtle, fast-paced temporal differences. We
introduce TF-CoVR, the first large-scale benchmark dedicated to temporally
fine-grained CoVR. TF-CoVR focuses on gymnastics and diving and provides 180K
triplets drawn from FineGym and FineDiving. Previous CoVR benchmarks focusing
on temporal aspect, link each query to a single target segment taken from the
same video, limiting practical usefulness. In TF-CoVR, we instead construct
each <query, modification> pair by prompting an LLM with the label differences
between clips drawn from different videos; every pair is thus associated with
multiple valid target videos (3.9 on average), reflecting real-world tasks such
as sports-highlight generation. To model these temporal dynamics we propose
TF-CoVR-Base, a concise two-stage training framework: (i) pre-train a video
encoder on fine-grained action classification to obtain temporally
discriminative embeddings; (ii) align the composed query with candidate videos
using contrastive learning. We conduct the first comprehensive study of image,

*Nan Wang,Yuantao Chen,Lixing Xiao,Weiqing Xiao,Bohan Li,Zhaoxi Chen,Chongjie Ye,Shaocong Xu,Saining Zhang,Ziyang Yan,Pierre Merriaux,Lei Lei,Tianfan Xue,Hao Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-scale bilateral grid to unify appearance codes and bilateral grids, improving geometric accuracy in dynamic autonomous driving scene reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world scenarios often lack perfect photometric consistency, limiting the effectiveness of existing methods like appearance codes and bilateral grids. Accurate geometry is crucial for autonomous driving.

Method: A novel multi-scale bilateral grid is introduced to combine appearance codes and bilateral grids, addressing photometric inconsistency and optimizing geometry.

Result: The method outperforms appearance codes and bilateral grids, showing strong results on Waymo, NuScenes, Argoverse, and PandaSet datasets. It reduces floaters caused by photometric inconsistency.

Conclusion: The multi-scale bilateral grid significantly enhances geometric accuracy, making it valuable for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Neural rendering techniques, including NeRF and Gaussian Splatting (GS), rely
on photometric consistency to produce high-quality reconstructions. However, in
real-world scenarios, it is challenging to guarantee perfect photometric
consistency in acquired images. Appearance codes have been widely used to
address this issue, but their modeling capability is limited, as a single code
is applied to the entire image. Recently, the bilateral grid was introduced to
perform pixel-wise color mapping, but it is difficult to optimize and constrain
effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale bilateral grid that
unifies appearance codes and bilateral grids. We demonstrate that this approach
significantly improves geometric accuracy in dynamic, decoupled autonomous
driving scene reconstruction, outperforming both appearance codes and bilateral
grids. This is crucial for autonomous driving, where accurate geometry is
important for obstacle avoidance and control. Our method shows strong results
across four datasets: Waymo, NuScenes, Argoverse, and PandaSet. We further
demonstrate that the improvement in geometry is driven by the multi-scale
bilateral grid, which effectively reduces floaters caused by photometric
inconsistency.

TL;DR: Rectified Point Flow unifies point cloud registration and shape assembly as a conditional generative problem, learning a velocity field for point transport and achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of pairwise point cloud registration and multi-part shape assembly with a unified, symmetry-aware approach.

Method: Learns a continuous point-wise velocity field to transport noisy points to target positions, recovering part poses without symmetry labels.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks, with joint training enhancing accuracy.

Conclusion: The unified formulation and self-supervised learning enable effective handling of symmetries and shared geometric priors, improving performance.

Abstract: We introduce Rectified Point Flow, a unified parameterization that formulates
pairwise point cloud registration and multi-part shape assembly as a single
conditional generative problem. Given unposed point clouds, our method learns a
continuous point-wise velocity field that transports noisy points toward their
target positions, from which part poses are recovered. In contrast to prior
work that regresses part-wise poses with ad-hoc symmetry handling, our method
intrinsically learns assembly symmetries without symmetry labels. Together with
a self-supervised encoder focused on overlapping points, our method achieves a
new state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks spanning pairwise
registration and shape assembly. Notably, our unified formulation enables
effective joint training on diverse datasets, facilitating the learning of
shared geometric priors and consequently boosting accuracy. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework using geometry-grounded long-term spatial memory improves video world models' consistency by addressing forgetting issues in autoregressive generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video world models struggle with maintaining scene consistency due to limited temporal context, leading to forgetting.

Method: Introduces a geometry-grounded long-term spatial memory framework with mechanisms for storing and retrieving information, trained on custom datasets.

Result: Improved quality, consistency, and context length compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The framework advances long-term consistent world generation in video models.

Abstract: Emerging world models autoregressively generate video frames in response to
actions, such as camera movements and text prompts, among other control
signals. Due to limited temporal context window sizes, these models often
struggle to maintain scene consistency during revisits, leading to severe
forgetting of previously generated environments. Inspired by the mechanisms of
human memory, we introduce a novel framework to enhancing long-term consistency
of video world models through a geometry-grounded long-term spatial memory. Our
framework includes mechanisms to store and retrieve information from the
long-term spatial memory and we curate custom datasets to train and evaluate
world models with explicitly stored 3D memory mechanisms. Our evaluations show
improved quality, consistency, and context length compared to relevant
baselines, paving the way towards long-term consistent world generation.

TL;DR: RaySt3R recasts 3D shape completion as a novel view synthesis problem, using a transformer to predict depth maps and masks from query rays, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D shape completion methods lack consistency, are computationally expensive, and struggle with sharp boundaries.

Method: Uses a feedforward transformer to predict depth maps, object masks, and confidence scores from query rays, fusing predictions across views.

Result: Outperforms baselines by up to 44% in 3D chamfer distance on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: RaySt3R effectively addresses limitations of current methods, offering a robust solution for 3D shape completion.

Abstract: 3D shape completion has broad applications in robotics, digital twin
reconstruction, and extended reality (XR). Although recent advances in 3D
object and scene completion have achieved impressive results, existing methods
lack 3D consistency, are computationally expensive, and struggle to capture
sharp object boundaries. Our work (RaySt3R) addresses these limitations by
recasting 3D shape completion as a novel view synthesis problem. Specifically,
given a single RGB-D image and a novel viewpoint (encoded as a collection of
query rays), we train a feedforward transformer to predict depth maps, object
masks, and per-pixel confidence scores for those query rays. RaySt3R fuses
these predictions across multiple query views to reconstruct complete 3D
shapes. We evaluate RaySt3R on synthetic and real-world datasets, and observe
it achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the baselines on all
datasets by up to 44% in 3D chamfer distance. Project page:

TL;DR: The paper introduces Vision Concept Transformer (VCT) and Stable Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT) to improve explainable AI in medicine by combining concept and image features, ensuring accuracy and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) overlook intrinsic image features and lack stability under perturbations, limiting their medical application.

Method: Proposes VCT and SVCT, leveraging vision transformers and conceptual layers, with SVCT incorporating Denoised Diffusion Smoothing for stability.

Result: VCT and SVCT maintain accuracy and interpretability on four medical datasets, with SVCT providing stable explanations under perturbations.

Conclusion: SVCT addresses the limitations of CBMs, offering a faithful and interpretable solution for medical AI applications.

Abstract: Transparency is a paramount concern in the medical field, prompting
researchers to delve into the realm of explainable AI (XAI). Among these XAI
methods, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to restrict the model's latent
space to human-understandable high-level concepts by generating a conceptual
layer for extracting conceptual features, which has drawn much attention
recently. However, existing methods rely solely on concept features to
determine the model's predictions, which overlook the intrinsic feature
embeddings within medical images. To address this utility gap between the
original models and concept-based models, we propose Vision Concept Transformer
(VCT). Furthermore, despite their benefits, CBMs have been found to negatively
impact model performance and fail to provide stable explanations when faced
with input perturbations, which limits their application in the medical field.
To address this faithfulness issue, this paper further proposes the Stable
Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT) based on VCT, which leverages the vision
transformer (ViT) as its backbone and incorporates a conceptual layer. SVCT
employs conceptual features to enhance decision-making capabilities by fusing
them with image features and ensures model faithfulness through the integration
of Denoised Diffusion Smoothing. Comprehensive experiments on four medical
datasets demonstrate that our VCT and SVCT maintain accuracy while remaining
interpretable compared to baselines. Furthermore, even when subjected to
perturbations, our SVCT model consistently provides faithful explanations, thus
meeting the needs of the medical field.

TL;DR: EOC-Bench is introduced to evaluate object-centric embodied cognition in dynamic egocentric scenarios, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on static scenes, neglecting dynamic interactions. EOC-Bench aims to fill this gap for better MLLM evaluation.

Method: EOC-Bench includes 3,277 annotated QA pairs across temporal categories (Past, Present, Future) and uses a mixed-format human-in-the-loop annotation framework.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations of various MLLMs are conducted, showing EOC-Bench's effectiveness in assessing embodied object cognition.

Conclusion: EOC-Bench advances MLLMs' embodied object cognitive capabilities, providing a foundation for reliable core models in embodied systems.

Abstract: The emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has driven
breakthroughs in egocentric vision applications. These applications necessitate
persistent, context-aware understanding of objects, as users interact with
tools in dynamic and cluttered environments. However, existing embodied
benchmarks primarily focus on static scene exploration, emphasizing object's
appearance and spatial attributes while neglecting the assessment of dynamic
changes arising from users' interactions. To address this gap, we introduce
EOC-Bench, an innovative benchmark designed to systematically evaluate
object-centric embodied cognition in dynamic egocentric scenarios. Specially,
EOC-Bench features 3,277 meticulously annotated QA pairs categorized into three
temporal categories: Past, Present, and Future, covering 11 fine-grained
evaluation dimensions and 3 visual object referencing types. To ensure thorough
assessment, we develop a mixed-format human-in-the-loop annotation framework
with four types of questions and design a novel multi-scale temporal accuracy
metric for open-ended temporal evaluation. Based on EOC-Bench, we conduct
comprehensive evaluations of various proprietary, open-source, and object-level
MLLMs. EOC-Bench serves as a crucial tool for advancing the embodied object
cognitive capabilities of MLLMs, establishing a robust foundation for
developing reliable core models for embodied systems.

TL;DR: Proposes Aligned Tokenizer (AliTok) for autoregressive image generation, improving token modeling with unidirectional dependencies and achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image tokenizers encode tokens with bidirectional dependencies, hindering autoregressive models.

Method: Uses a causal decoder for unidirectional dependencies, prefix tokens, and two-stage training for consistency.

Result: Achieves gFID 1.50 (177M params) and 1.35 (662M params), surpassing diffusion methods with faster sampling.

Conclusion: AliTok aligns tokenizer and autoregressive model, enhancing performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Autoregressive image generation aims to predict the next token based on
previous ones. However, existing image tokenizers encode tokens with
bidirectional dependencies during the compression process, which hinders the
effective modeling by autoregressive models. In this paper, we propose a novel
Aligned Tokenizer (AliTok), which utilizes a causal decoder to establish
unidirectional dependencies among encoded tokens, thereby aligning the token
modeling approach between the tokenizer and autoregressive model. Furthermore,
by incorporating prefix tokens and employing two-stage tokenizer training to
enhance reconstruction consistency, AliTok achieves great reconstruction
performance while being generation-friendly. On ImageNet-256 benchmark, using a
standard decoder-only autoregressive model as the generator with only 177M
parameters, AliTok achieves a gFID score of 1.50 and an IS of 305.9. When the
parameter count is increased to 662M, AliTok achieves a gFID score of 1.35,
surpassing the state-of-the-art diffusion method with 10x faster sampling
speed. The code and weights are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeedVR2 is a one-step diffusion-based video restoration model that improves efficiency and performance for high-resolution videos using adaptive window attention and adversarial training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based VR methods are computationally expensive, and extending distillation-based approaches to VR, especially for high-resolution videos, is challenging.

Method: Proposes SeedVR2 with adaptive window attention (dynamically adjusted window size) and adversarial training, enhanced by feature matching loss for stability.

Result: SeedVR2 achieves comparable or better performance than existing VR methods in a single step.

Conclusion: SeedVR2 effectively addresses high-resolution VR challenges with improved efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based video restoration (VR) demonstrate
significant improvement in visual quality, yet yield a prohibitive
computational cost during inference. While several distillation-based
approaches have exhibited the potential of one-step image restoration,
extending existing approaches to VR remains challenging and underexplored,
particularly when dealing with high-resolution video in real-world settings. In
this work, we propose a one-step diffusion-based VR model, termed as SeedVR2,
which performs adversarial VR training against real data. To handle the
challenging high-resolution VR within a single step, we introduce several
enhancements to both model architecture and training procedures. Specifically,
an adaptive window attention mechanism is proposed, where the window size is
dynamically adjusted to fit the output resolutions, avoiding window
inconsistency observed under high-resolution VR using window attention with a
predefined window size. To stabilize and improve the adversarial post-training
towards VR, we further verify the effectiveness of a series of losses,
including a proposed feature matching loss without significantly sacrificing
training efficiency. Extensive experiments show that SeedVR2 can achieve
comparable or even better performance compared with existing VR approaches in a
single step.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance region-level visual understanding by combining segmentation and semantic generation in a lightweight, efficient framework.

Method: Extends SAM 2 with LLMs, introduces Semantic Perceiver for feature transformation, and uses a refined dataset of 1.5M images and 0.6M videos.

Result: PAM runs 1.2-2.4x faster, uses less GPU memory, and performs well on diverse tasks.

Conclusion: PAM is a practical, efficient baseline for future region-level visual understanding research.

Abstract: We present Perceive Anything Model (PAM), a conceptually straightforward and
efficient framework for comprehensive region-level visual understanding in
images and videos. Our approach extends the powerful segmentation model SAM 2
by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling simultaneous object
segmentation with the generation of diverse, region-specific semantic outputs,
including categories, label definition, functional explanations, and detailed
captions. A key component, Semantic Perceiver, is introduced to efficiently
transform SAM 2's rich visual features, which inherently carry general vision,
localization, and semantic priors into multi-modal tokens for LLM
comprehension. To support robust multi-granularity understanding, we also
develop a dedicated data refinement and augmentation pipeline, yielding a
high-quality dataset of 1.5M image and 0.6M video region-semantic annotations,
including novel region-level streaming video caption data. PAM is designed for
lightweightness and efficiency, while also demonstrates strong performance
across a diverse range of region understanding tasks. It runs 1.2-2.4x faster
and consumes less GPU memory than prior approaches, offering a practical
solution for real-world applications. We believe that our effective approach
will serve as a strong baseline for future research in region-level visual
understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing ambiguities in semantic matching for symmetric objects or repeated parts using large pre-trained vision models.

Method: Training an adapter to refine features via 3D-aware pseudo-labeling, including chaining, cyclic consistency filtering, and 3D spherical prototype mapping.

Result: Achieves over 4% absolute gain on SPair-71k and 7% improvement over methods with similar supervision.

Conclusion: The approach simplifies training extension to other data sources and reduces dependency on dataset-specific annotations.

Abstract: Finding correspondences between semantically similar points across images and
object instances is one of the everlasting challenges in computer vision. While
large pre-trained vision models have recently been demonstrated as effective
priors for semantic matching, they still suffer from ambiguities for symmetric
objects or repeated object parts. We propose to improve semantic correspondence
estimation via 3D-aware pseudo-labeling. Specifically, we train an adapter to
refine off-the-shelf features using pseudo-labels obtained via 3D-aware
chaining, filtering wrong labels through relaxed cyclic consistency, and 3D
spherical prototype mapping constraints. While reducing the need for dataset
specific annotations compared to prior work, we set a new state-of-the-art on
SPair-71k by over 4% absolute gain and by over 7% against methods with similar
supervision requirements. The generality of our proposed approach simplifies
extension of training to other data sources, which we demonstrate in our
experiments.

TL;DR: MARBLE is a method for material editing in images using CLIP-space embeddings and pre-trained text-to-image models, enabling blending and fine-grained control over material attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve exemplar-based material editing by leveraging CLIP-space and pre-trained models for better control and blending of material properties.

Method: Uses CLIP-space embeddings to find material directions, identifies a denoising UNet block for material attribution, and employs a shallow network for parametric control over attributes like roughness and glow.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative analysis shows MARBLE's effectiveness in material editing, including multiple edits in one pass and painting applications.

Conclusion: MARBLE advances material editing by combining CLIP-space embeddings with pre-trained models, offering precise control and versatility.

Abstract: Editing materials of objects in images based on exemplar images is an active
area of research in computer vision and graphics. We propose MARBLE, a method
for performing material blending and recomposing fine-grained material
properties by finding material embeddings in CLIP-space and using that to
control pre-trained text-to-image models. We improve exemplar-based material
editing by finding a block in the denoising UNet responsible for material
attribution. Given two material exemplar-images, we find directions in the
CLIP-space for blending the materials. Further, we can achieve parametric
control over fine-grained material attributes such as roughness, metallic,
transparency, and glow using a shallow network to predict the direction for the
desired material attribute change. We perform qualitative and quantitative
analysis to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method. We also present
the ability of our method to perform multiple edits in a single forward pass

TL;DR: ProJo4D is a progressive joint optimization framework for 4D scene understanding, outperforming prior methods in future state prediction, novel view rendering, and material estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for estimating physics from visual data are limited by error accumulation in sequential optimization and fail in direct joint optimization due to non-convexity.

Method: ProJo4D progressively optimizes geometry, appearance, physical state, and material properties based on parameter sensitivity.

Result: ProJo4D outperforms prior work on PAC-NeRF and Spring-Gaus datasets in 4D future state prediction, novel view rendering, and material estimation.

Conclusion: ProJo4D effectively addresses the challenges of physically grounded 4D scene understanding, offering scalable and accurate results.

Abstract: Neural rendering has made significant strides in 3D reconstruction and novel
view synthesis. With the integration with physics, it opens up new
applications. The inverse problem of estimating physics from visual data,
however, still remains challenging, limiting its effectiveness for applications
like physically accurate digital twin creation in robotics and XR. Existing
methods that incorporate physics into neural rendering frameworks typically
require dense multi-view videos as input, making them impractical for scalable,
real-world use. When presented with sparse multi-view videos, the sequential
optimization strategy used by existing approaches introduces significant error
accumulation, e.g., poor initial 3D reconstruction leads to bad material
parameter estimation in subsequent stages. Instead of sequential optimization,
directly optimizing all parameters at the same time also fails due to the
highly non-convex and often non-differentiable nature of the problem. We
propose ProJo4D, a progressive joint optimization framework that gradually
increases the set of jointly optimized parameters guided by their sensitivity,
leading to fully joint optimization over geometry, appearance, physical state,
and material property. Evaluations on PAC-NeRF and Spring-Gaus datasets show
that ProJo4D outperforms prior work in 4D future state prediction, novel view
rendering of future state, and material parameter estimation, demonstrating its
effectiveness in physically grounded 4D scene understanding. For demos, please

*Haoyuan Li,Yanpeng Zhou,Yufei Gao,Tao Tang,Jianhua Han,Yujie Yuan,Dave Zhenyu Chen,Jiawang Bian,Hang Xu,Xiaodan Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes 3D Vision-Language Models (VLMs), categorizing them into object-centric, image-based, and scene-centric approaches, and identifies performance gaps in scene-centric models due to limited 3D encoder reliance and ineffective pretraining. It introduces a new dataset to improve 3D understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why 3D scene-centric VLMs underperform compared to object-centric and 2D image-based approaches, and to address their limitations in leveraging 3D scene encoders.

Method: Categorizes 3D VLMs, conducts in-depth analysis of scene-centric models, and introduces a novel 3D Relevance Discrimination QA dataset to disrupt shortcut learning.

Result: Scene-centric VLMs over-rely on linguistic cues, underutilize 3D encoders, and show limited benefits from data scaling. The new dataset aims to improve 3D understanding.

Conclusion: Advanced evaluation and strategies are needed to enhance 3D understanding in VLMs, with the proposed dataset as a step toward addressing current limitations.

Abstract: Remarkable progress in 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has spurred interest
in extending them to 3D settings for tasks like 3D Question Answering, Dense
Captioning, and Visual Grounding. Unlike 2D VLMs that typically process images
through an image encoder, 3D scenes, with their intricate spatial structures,
allow for diverse model architectures. Based on their encoder design, this
paper categorizes recent 3D VLMs into 3D object-centric, 2D image-based, and 3D
scene-centric approaches. Despite the architectural similarity of 3D
scene-centric VLMs to their 2D counterparts, they have exhibited comparatively
lower performance compared with the latest 3D object-centric and 2D image-based
approaches. To understand this gap, we conduct an in-depth analysis, revealing
that 3D scene-centric VLMs show limited reliance on the 3D scene encoder, and
the pre-train stage appears less effective than in 2D VLMs. Furthermore, we
observe that data scaling benefits are less pronounced on larger datasets. Our
investigation suggests that while these models possess cross-modal alignment
capabilities, they tend to over-rely on linguistic cues and overfit to frequent
answer distributions, thereby diminishing the effective utilization of the 3D
encoder. To address these limitations and encourage genuine 3D scene
understanding, we introduce a novel 3D Relevance Discrimination QA dataset
designed to disrupt shortcut learning and improve 3D understanding. Our
findings highlight the need for advanced evaluation and improved strategies for
better 3D understanding in 3D VLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PM-Loss, a regularization loss using a pointmap to improve depth map quality in 3D Gaussian Splatting, addressing fragmentation issues at object boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depth maps in 3DGS pipelines often suffer from fragmented or sparse point clouds at object boundaries, degrading rendering quality.

Method: Proposes PM-Loss, a regularization loss leveraging a pre-trained transformer's pointmap to enforce geometric smoothness, enhancing depth maps.

Result: The method improves depth maps, leading to better rendering results across various architectures and scenes.

Conclusion: PM-Loss effectively addresses depth discontinuity issues, enhancing 3DGS performance for novel view synthesis.

Abstract: Depth maps are widely used in feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
pipelines by unprojecting them into 3D point clouds for novel view synthesis.
This approach offers advantages such as efficient training, the use of known
camera poses, and accurate geometry estimation. However, depth discontinuities
at object boundaries often lead to fragmented or sparse point clouds, degrading
rendering quality -- a well-known limitation of depth-based representations. To
tackle this issue, we introduce PM-Loss, a novel regularization loss based on a
pointmap predicted by a pre-trained transformer. Although the pointmap itself
may be less accurate than the depth map, it effectively enforces geometric
smoothness, especially around object boundaries. With the improved depth map,
our method significantly improves the feed-forward 3DGS across various
architectures and scenes, delivering consistently better rendering results. Our

Conclusion: CG-AV-Counting is a comprehensive benchmark, and AV-Reasoner shows promise but has limitations in generalization.

Abstract: Despite progress in video understanding, current MLLMs struggle with counting

of clue annotations, and weak multimodal coverage. In this paper, we introduce
CG-AV-Counting, a manually-annotated clue-grounded counting benchmark with
1,027 multimodal questions and 5,845 annotated clues over 497 long videos. It
supports both black-box and white-box evaluation, serving as a comprehensive
testbed for both end-to-end and reasoning-based counting. To explore ways to
improve model's counting capability, we propose AV-Reasoner, a model trained

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to multimodal domains is challenging due to coarse visual regions, limited math perception, and reliance on external tools.

Method: Proposes MINT-CoT, which interleaves visual tokens into CoT via an Interleave Token, supported by a dataset and three-stage training (text-only SFT, interleaved SFT, and RL).

Result: MINT-CoT-7B outperforms baselines by +34.08% (MathVista), +28.78% (GeoQA), and +23.2% (MMStar).

Conclusion: MINT-CoT effectively integrates visual and textual reasoning for math problems, validated by strong benchmark performance.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has widely enhanced mathematical reasoning in Large
Language Models (LLMs), but it still remains challenging for extending it to
multimodal domains. Existing works either adopt a similar textual reasoning for
image input, or seek to interleave visual signals into mathematical CoT.
However, they face three key limitations for math problem-solving: reliance on
coarse-grained box-shaped image regions, limited perception of vision encoders
on math content, and dependence on external capabilities for visual
modification. In this paper, we propose MINT-CoT, introducing Mathematical
INterleaved Tokens for Chain-of-Thought visual reasoning. MINT-CoT adaptively
interleaves relevant visual tokens into textual reasoning steps via an
Interleave Token, which dynamically selects visual regions of any shapes within
math figures. To empower this capability, we construct the MINT-CoT dataset,
containing 54K mathematical problems aligning each reasoning step with visual
regions at the token level, accompanied by a rigorous data generation pipeline.
We further present a three-stage MINT-CoT training strategy, progressively
combining text-only CoT SFT, interleaved CoT SFT, and interleaved CoT RL, which
derives our MINT-CoT-7B model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method for effective visual interleaved reasoning in
mathematical domains, where MINT-CoT-7B outperforms the baseline model by
+34.08% on MathVista, +28.78% on GeoQA, and +23.2% on MMStar, respectively. Our

TL;DR: VideoMarathon introduces a large-scale dataset for hour-long video instruction-following, enabling training of Video-LMMs like Hour-LLaVA, which outperforms benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the scarcity of annotated long videos for training Video-LMMs, the paper aims to improve long-form video-language understanding.

Method: Developed VideoMarathon, a dataset with 9,700 hours of diverse long videos and 3.3M QA pairs, and proposed Hour-LLaVA, a model with memory augmentation for efficient hour-long video processing.

Result: Hour-LLaVA achieves top performance on long video-language benchmarks, validating the dataset's quality and model's effectiveness.

Conclusion: VideoMarathon and Hour-LLaVA advance long-form video understanding, demonstrating the potential of large-scale annotated datasets and efficient models.

Abstract: Recent long-form video-language understanding benchmarks have driven progress
in video large multimodal models (Video-LMMs). However, the scarcity of
well-annotated long videos has left the training of hour-long Video-LLMs
underexplored. To close this gap, we present VideoMarathon, a large-scale
hour-long video instruction-following dataset. This dataset includes around
9,700 hours of long videos sourced from diverse domains, ranging from 3 to 60
minutes per video. Specifically, it contains 3.3M high-quality QA pairs,
spanning six fundamental topics: temporality, spatiality, object, action,
scene, and event. Compared to existing video instruction datasets,
VideoMarathon significantly extends training video durations up to 1 hour, and
supports 22 diverse tasks requiring both short- and long-term video
comprehension. Building on VideoMarathon, we propose Hour-LLaVA, a powerful and
efficient Video-LMM for hour-scale video-language modeling. It enables
hour-long video training and inference at 1-FPS sampling by leveraging a memory
augmentation module, which adaptively integrates user question-relevant and
spatiotemporal-informative semantics from a cached full video context. In our
experiments, Hour-LLaVA achieves the best performance on multiple long
video-language benchmarks, demonstrating the high quality of the VideoMarathon
dataset and the superiority of the Hour-LLaVA model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoMolmo is a multimodal model for spatio-temporal localization, combining LLM reasoning with temporal attention and mask fusion for improved accuracy and coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video-based approaches lack contextual understanding and generalization, which VideoMolmo aims to address by integrating language models and temporal reasoning.

Method: VideoMolmo uses a temporal module with attention for frame consistency and a mask fusion pipeline for bidirectional point propagation. It decomposes the task into LLM-generated coordinates and sequential mask fusion.

Result: VideoMolmo outperforms existing models in spatio-temporal pointing accuracy and reasoning, validated on a curated dataset and benchmarks like VPoS-Bench, Refer-VOS, and Reasoning VOS.

Conclusion: VideoMolmo advances spatio-temporal localization by leveraging multimodal fusion and temporal reasoning, with publicly available code and models.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal localization is vital for precise interactions across diverse
domains, from biological research to autonomous navigation and interactive
interfaces. Current video-based approaches, while proficient in tracking, lack
the sophisticated reasoning capabilities of large language models, limiting
their contextual understanding and generalization. We introduce VideoMolmo, a
large multimodal model tailored for fine-grained spatio-temporal pointing
conditioned on textual descriptions. Building upon the Molmo architecture,
VideoMolmo incorporates a temporal module utilizing an attention mechanism to
condition each frame on preceding frames, ensuring temporal consistency.
Additionally, our novel temporal mask fusion pipeline employs SAM2 for
bidirectional point propagation, significantly enhancing coherence across video
sequences. This two-step decomposition, i.e., first using the LLM to generate
precise pointing coordinates, then relying on a sequential mask-fusion module
to produce coherent segmentation, not only simplifies the task for the language
model but also enhances interpretability. Due to the lack of suitable datasets,
we curate a comprehensive dataset comprising 72k video-caption pairs annotated
with 100k object points. To evaluate the generalization of VideoMolmo, we
introduce VPoS-Bench, a challenging out-of-distribution benchmark spanning five
real-world scenarios: Cell Tracking, Egocentric Vision, Autonomous Driving,
Video-GUI Interaction, and Robotics. We also evaluate our model on Referring
Video Object Segmentation (Refer-VOS) and Reasoning VOS tasks. In comparison to
existing models, VideoMolmo substantially improves spatio-temporal pointing
accuracy and reasoning capability. Our code and models are publicly available
at https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/VideoMolmo.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A pipeline for generating defurnished indoor spaces using textured meshes and multi-view panoramas, guided by a simplified defurnished mesh and ControlNet inpainting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create high-quality defurnished replicas of indoor spaces, addressing limitations of existing methods like blurry outputs from neural radiance fields or hallucinations in RGB-D inpainting.

Method: Segment and remove furniture from the mesh, extend planes, fill holes to create a simplified defurnished mesh (SDM). Use SDM to guide furniture removal in panoramas via ControlNet inpainting, leveraging Canny edges from depth and normal images.

Result: Produces higher quality defurnished assets compared to neural radiance fields (blurry) and RGB-D inpainting (hallucinations).

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline effectively generates accurate and high-quality defurnished indoor spaces by combining geometric guidance with advanced inpainting techniques.

Abstract: We present a pipeline for generating defurnished replicas of indoor spaces
represented as textured meshes and corresponding multi-view panoramic images.
To achieve this, we first segment and remove furniture from the mesh
representation, extend planes, and fill holes, obtaining a simplified
defurnished mesh (SDM). This SDM acts as an ``X-ray'' of the scene's underlying
structure, guiding the defurnishing process. We extract Canny edges from depth
and normal images rendered from the SDM. We then use these as a guide to remove
the furniture from panorama images via ControlNet inpainting. This control
signal ensures the availability of global geometric information that may be
hidden from a particular panoramic view by the furniture being removed. The
inpainted panoramas are used to texture the mesh. We show that our approach
produces higher quality assets than methods that rely on neural radiance
fields, which tend to produce blurry low-resolution images, or RGB-D
inpainting, which is highly susceptible to hallucinations.

*Xingjian Ran,Yixuan Li,Linning Xu,Mulin Yu,Bo Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DirectLayout is a framework for generating 3D indoor layouts from text descriptions using LLMs, addressing challenges in open-vocabulary and fine-grained instruction alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing layout generation methods overfit to datasets or rely on rigid constraints, limiting flexibility and alignment with user instructions.

Method: DirectLayout uses LLMs for spatial reasoning, decomposing generation into BEV layout, 3D lifting, and refinement, aided by CoT Activation and CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward.

Result: The framework achieves high semantic consistency, generalization, and physical plausibility in 3D scene synthesis.

Conclusion: DirectLayout advances layout generation by leveraging LLMs for flexible, instruction-aligned, and realistic 3D indoor scenes.

Abstract: Realistic 3D indoor scene synthesis is vital for embodied AI and digital
content creation. It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object
generation and layout generation. While recent generative models have
significantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout
generation remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either
overfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize
numerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate
scenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user
instructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates
numerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial
reasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the
generation into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting
it into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial
reasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we
employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset.
Additionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance
generalization and spatial planning. During inference, DirectLayout addresses
asset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context
learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves
impressive semantic consistency, generalization and physical plausibility.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel task called omnimodal referring expression segmentation (ORES) and proposes a framework (RAS) to enhance segmentation models with multimodal interactions for complex queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image segmentation models lack comprehensive semantic understanding for vision-language prompts, limiting user-friendly interactions.

Method: Proposes the RAS framework, which augments segmentation models with a mask-centric large multimodal model to handle arbitrary prompts (text or text plus visual entities).

Result: RAS demonstrates superior performance on ORES, RES, and GRES tasks, validated using new datasets MaskGroups-2M and MaskGroups-HQ.

Conclusion: The RAS framework effectively bridges the gap in multimodal segmentation tasks, enabling advanced vision-language interactions.

Abstract: Recent image segmentation models have advanced to segment images into
high-quality masks for visual entities, and yet they cannot provide
comprehensive semantic understanding for complex queries based on both language
and vision. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in applications that
require user-friendly interactions driven by vision-language prompts. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a novel task of omnimodal referring expression
segmentation (ORES). In this task, a model produces a group of masks based on
arbitrary prompts specified by text only or text plus reference visual
entities. To address this new challenge, we propose a novel framework to "Refer
to Any Segmentation Mask Group" (RAS), which augments segmentation models with
complex multimodal interactions and comprehension via a mask-centric large
multimodal model. For training and benchmarking ORES models, we create datasets
MaskGroups-2M and MaskGroups-HQ to include diverse mask groups specified by
text and reference entities. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate
superior performance of RAS on our new ORES task, as well as classic referring
expression segmentation (RES) and generalized referring expression segmentation
(GRES) tasks. Project page: https://Ref2Any.github.io.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates how Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) process visual inputs, revealing that only ~5% of attention heads (visual heads) are crucial. It introduces SparseMM, a KV-Cache optimization strategy for efficient MLLM inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and optimize the visual processing in MLLMs by leveraging the sparsity of active attention heads.

Method: A training-free framework identifies visual heads, followed by SparseMM, which allocates asymmetric computation budgets based on head-level visual relevance.

Result: SparseMM achieves 1.38x real-time acceleration, 52% memory reduction, and maintains performance parity.

Conclusion: The sparsity of visual heads enables efficient MLLM inference, with SparseMM offering superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are commonly derived by extending
pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with visual capabilities. In this
work, we investigate how MLLMs process visual inputs by analyzing their
attention mechanisms. We reveal a surprising sparsity phenomenon: only a small
subset (approximately less than 5%) of attention heads in LLMs actively
contribute to visual understanding, termed visual heads. To identify these
heads efficiently, we design a training-free framework that quantifies
head-level visual relevance through targeted response analysis. Building on
this discovery, we introduce SparseMM, a KV-Cache optimization strategy that
allocates asymmetric computation budgets to heads in LLMs based on their visual
scores, leveraging the sparity of visual heads for accelerating the inference
of MLLMs. Compared with prior KV-Cache acceleration methods that ignore the
particularity of visual, SparseMM prioritizes stress and retaining visual
semantics during decoding. Extensive evaluations across mainstream multimodal
benchmarks demonstrate that SparseMM achieves superior accuracy-efficiency
trade-offs. Notably, SparseMM delivers 1.38x real-time acceleration and 52%
memory reduction during generation while maintaining performance parity on
efficiency test. Our project is open sourced at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in capturing and reconstructing light propagation, especially indirect light, in multi-view videos.

Method: Extends neural radiance caching to time-resolved data, enabling infinite-bounce radiance storage and accurate light transport modeling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction, view synthesis, and decomposition of direct/indirect light, with novel relighting capabilities.

Conclusion: The system advances inverse rendering by handling complex light transport and enabling new applications like time-resolved relighting.

Abstract: We present the first system for physically based, neural inverse rendering
from multi-viewpoint videos of propagating light. Our approach relies on a
time-resolved extension of neural radiance caching -- a technique that
accelerates inverse rendering by storing infinite-bounce radiance arriving at
any point from any direction. The resulting model accurately accounts for
direct and indirect light transport effects and, when applied to captured
measurements from a flash lidar system, enables state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction in the presence of strong indirect light. Further, we
demonstrate view synthesis of propagating light, automatic decomposition of
captured measurements into direct and indirect components, as well as novel
capabilities such as multi-view time-resolved relighting of captured scenes.

TL;DR: FreeTimeGS introduces a flexible 4D representation for dynamic 3D scenes, improving motion handling and rendering quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with complex motions due to rigid deformation fields.

Method: Proposes FreeTimeGS, a 4D representation with Gaussian primitives at arbitrary time/locations and motion functions.

Result: Outperforms recent methods in rendering quality on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: FreeTimeGS offers superior flexibility and performance for dynamic 3D scene reconstruction.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes with
complex motions. Some recent works define 3D Gaussian primitives in the
canonical space and use deformation fields to map canonical primitives to
observation spaces, achieving real-time dynamic view synthesis. However, these
methods often struggle to handle scenes with complex motions due to the
difficulty of optimizing deformation fields. To overcome this problem, we
propose FreeTimeGS, a novel 4D representation that allows Gaussian primitives
to appear at arbitrary time and locations. In contrast to canonical Gaussian
primitives, our representation possesses the strong flexibility, thus improving
the ability to model dynamic 3D scenes. In addition, we endow each Gaussian
primitive with an motion function, allowing it to move to neighboring regions
over time, which reduces the temporal redundancy. Experiments results on
several datasets show that the rendering quality of our method outperforms
recent methods by a large margin.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoMathQA is a benchmark for evaluating models on temporally extended, multimodal mathematical reasoning in videos, covering diverse domains and real-world challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mathematical reasoning in videos requires integrating fine-grained visual, textual, and auditory cues over time, posing a unique challenge beyond static images or text.

Method: The benchmark includes 10 mathematical domains with videos of varying lengths, annotated by experts, and features three reasoning challenges: direct problem solving, conceptual transfer, and deep instructional comprehension.

Result: The benchmark provides a systematic framework to evaluate models' ability to reason across modalities and time, revealing limitations of current approaches.

Conclusion: VideoMathQA establishes a foundation for advancing models in multimodal, temporally extended mathematical reasoning, with publicly available resources for further research.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning in real-world video settings presents a fundamentally
different challenge than in static images or text. It requires interpreting
fine-grained visual information, accurately reading handwritten or digital
text, and integrating spoken cues, often dispersed non-linearly over time. In
such multimodal contexts, success hinges not just on perception, but on
selectively identifying and integrating the right contextual details from a
rich and noisy stream of content. To this end, we introduce VideoMathQA, a
benchmark designed to evaluate whether models can perform such temporally
extended cross-modal reasoning on videos. The benchmark spans 10 diverse
mathematical domains, covering videos ranging from 10 seconds to over 1 hour.
It requires models to interpret structured visual content, understand
instructional narratives, and jointly ground concepts across visual, audio, and
textual modalities. We employ graduate-level experts to ensure high quality,
totaling over $920$ man-hours of annotation. To reflect real-world scenarios,
questions are designed around three core reasoning challenges: direct problem
solving, where answers are grounded in the presented question; conceptual
transfer, which requires applying learned methods to new problems; and deep
instructional comprehension, involving multi-step reasoning over extended
explanations and partially worked-out solutions. Each question includes
multi-step reasoning annotations, enabling fine-grained diagnosis of model
capabilities. Through this benchmark, we highlight the limitations of existing
approaches and establish a systematic evaluation framework for models that must
reason, rather than merely perceive, across temporally extended and
modality-rich mathematical problem settings. Our benchmark and evaluation code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Contrastive Flow Matching enhances conditional flow uniqueness in diffusion models, improving training speed, reducing de-noising steps, and lowering FID scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In conditional settings, flow uniqueness is not guaranteed, leading to ambiguous generations. This work aims to enforce uniqueness across conditional flows.

Method: Introduces Contrastive Flow Matching, adding a contrastive objective to maximize dissimilarities between predicted flows from arbitrary sample pairs.

Result: Improves training speed (up to 9x), reduces de-noising steps (up to 5x), and lowers FID scores (up to 8.9) compared to standard flow matching.

Conclusion: Contrastive Flow Matching effectively enhances condition separation and performance in diffusion models.

Abstract: Unconditional flow-matching trains diffusion models to transport samples from
a source distribution to a target distribution by enforcing that the flows
between sample pairs are unique. However, in conditional settings (e.g.,
class-conditioned models), this uniqueness is no longer guaranteed--flows from
different conditions may overlap, leading to more ambiguous generations. We
introduce Contrastive Flow Matching, an extension to the flow matching
objective that explicitly enforces uniqueness across all conditional flows,
enhancing condition separation. Our approach adds a contrastive objective that
maximizes dissimilarities between predicted flows from arbitrary sample pairs.
We validate Contrastive Flow Matching by conducting extensive experiments
across varying model architectures on both class-conditioned (ImageNet-1k) and
text-to-image (CC3M) benchmarks. Notably, we find that training models with
Contrastive Flow Matching (1) improves training speed by a factor of up to 9x,
(2) requires up to 5x fewer de-noising steps and (3) lowers FID by up to 8.9
compared to training the same models with flow matching. We release our code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dynamic Epsilon Scheduling (DES) adaptively adjusts adversarial perturbation budgets per instance and iteration, improving robustness and accuracy over fixed-budget methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial training uses fixed perturbation budgets, ignoring instance-specific robustness. DES addresses this gap.

Method: DES integrates gradient-based boundary distance, softmax entropy confidence, and Monte Carlo dropout uncertainty to dynamically schedule perturbations.

Result: DES outperforms fixed-budget and prior adaptive methods on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 in robustness and accuracy.

Conclusion: DES introduces a data-driven, instance-aware adversarial training framework with theoretical stability guarantees.

Abstract: Adversarial training is among the most effective strategies for defending
deep neural networks against adversarial examples. A key limitation of existing
adversarial training approaches lies in their reliance on a fixed perturbation
budget, which fails to account for instance-specific robustness
characteristics. While prior works such as IAAT and MMA introduce
instance-level adaptations, they often rely on heuristic or static
approximations of data robustness. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Epsilon
Scheduling (DES), a novel framework that adaptively adjusts the adversarial
perturbation budget per instance and per training iteration. DES integrates
three key factors: (1) the distance to the decision boundary approximated via
gradient-based proxies, (2) prediction confidence derived from softmax entropy,
and (3) model uncertainty estimated via Monte Carlo dropout. By combining these
cues into a unified scheduling strategy, DES tailors the perturbation budget
dynamically to guide more effective adversarial learning. Experimental results
on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that our method consistently improves both
adversarial robustness and standard accuracy compared to fixed-epsilon
baselines and prior adaptive methods. Moreover, we provide theoretical insights
into the stability and convergence of our scheduling policy. This work opens a
new avenue for instance-aware, data-driven adversarial training methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs lack explicit mechanisms for visual grounding and segmentation, creating a disconnect between reasoning and perception.

Method: RSVP is a two-stage framework: reasoning-driven localization with multimodal prompts and segmentation refinement via a Vision-Language Segmentation Module (VLSM).

Result: RSVP outperforms state-of-the-art methods by +6.5 gIoU and +9.2 cIoU on ReasonSeg and achieves 49.7 mAP on SegInW in zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: RSVP effectively integrates cognitive reasoning with structured visual understanding, offering a scalable and interpretable framework.

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
reasoning capability while lack explicit mechanisms for visual grounding and
segmentation, creating a gap between cognitive reasoning and visual perception.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Reasoning Segmentation via Visual Prompting
(RSVP), a novel framework that unifies multi-step multimodal reasoning with
grounded visual understanding. RSVP is a two-stage structuralized framework
that integrates reasoning-driven localization with segmentation refinement. In
the reasoning stage, RSVP employs multimodal chain-of-thought visual prompts to
help MLLMs understand queries and infer targets, generating interpretable
region proposals that enhance visual grounding. In segmentation stage, RSVP
refines these proposals with a Vision-Language Segmentation Module (VLSM),
seamlessly integrates textual and visual cues to produce precise segmentation
masks. By explicitly modelling the interaction between multimodal reasoning and
segmentation, RSVP introduces a new paradigm for interpretable reasoning
segmentation. It exploits MLLMs' inherent localization capabilities, enabling
the models to not only reason about objects but also generate structured visual
representations. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RSVP achieves
state-of-the-art performance, surpasses state-of-the-art methods by up to +6.5
gIoU and +9.2 cIoU on ReasonSeg, and achieves 49.7 mAP on SegInW under
zero-shot settings. These results validate RSVP as an effective and scalable
framework for integrating cognitive reasoning with structured visual
understanding.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMRB, the first benchmark for evaluating multimodal multi-image reasoning, highlighting gaps in current MLLM capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack evaluation of MLLMs' reasoning over multiple images, leaving their capabilities underexplored.

Method: MMRB includes 92 sub-tasks for spatial, temporal, and semantic reasoning, with GPT-4o and human-annotated solutions. A sentence-level matching framework is proposed for scalable evaluation.

Result: Open-source MLLMs lag behind commercial ones in multi-image reasoning, and reward models struggle with multi-image ranking tasks.

Conclusion: MMRB fills a critical gap in evaluating MLLMs' multi-image reasoning, revealing significant performance disparities and challenges for future research.

Abstract: With enhanced capabilities and widespread applications, Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly required to process and reason over
multiple images simultaneously. However, existing MLLM benchmarks focus either
on single-image visual reasoning or on multi-image understanding tasks with
only final-answer evaluation, leaving the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs over
multi-image inputs largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the
$\textbf{Multimodal Multi-image Reasoning Benchmark (MMRB)}$, the first
benchmark designed to evaluate structured visual reasoning across multiple
images. MMRB comprises $\textbf{92 sub-tasks}$ covering spatial, temporal, and
semantic reasoning, with multi-solution, CoT-style annotations generated by
GPT-4o and refined by human experts. A derivative subset is designed to
evaluate multimodal reward models in multi-image scenarios. To support fast and
scalable evaluation, we propose a sentence-level matching framework using
open-source LLMs. Extensive baseline experiments on $\textbf{40 MLLMs}$,
including 9 reasoning-specific models and 8 reward models, demonstrate that
open-source MLLMs still lag significantly behind commercial MLLMs in
multi-image reasoning tasks. Furthermore, current multimodal reward models are
nearly incapable of handling multi-image reward ranking tasks.

*Maksym Ivashechkin,Oscar Mendez,Richard Bowden*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A weakly supervised pipeline for 3D human generation addresses challenges in realism, diversity, and control by combining image diffusion models, transformer-based mapping, and point-cloud diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming limitations in current 3D human generation methods, such as lack of fine detail, realism, and control, while addressing data diversity and annotation issues.

Method: 1) Generate a photorealistic human image dataset with controllable attributes using an image diffusion model. 2) Map image features to 3D point clouds via a transformer. 3) Train a point-cloud diffusion model conditioned on text prompts.

Result: Achieves faster 3D human generation, improved text-prompt alignment, realism, and rendering quality compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The pipeline offers a scalable solution for high-quality 3D human generation, with potential for broad applications in vision and graphics.

Abstract: 3D human generation is an important problem with a wide range of applications
in computer vision and graphics. Despite recent progress in generative AI such
as diffusion models or rendering methods like Neural Radiance Fields or
Gaussian Splatting, controlling the generation of accurate 3D humans from text
prompts remains an open challenge. Current methods struggle with fine detail,
accurate rendering of hands and faces, human realism, and controlability over
appearance. The lack of diversity, realism, and annotation in human image data
also remains a challenge, hindering the development of a foundational 3D human
model. We present a weakly supervised pipeline that tries to address these
challenges. In the first step, we generate a photorealistic human image dataset
with controllable attributes such as appearance, race, gender, etc using a
state-of-the-art image diffusion model. Next, we propose an efficient mapping
approach from image features to 3D point clouds using a transformer-based
architecture. Finally, we close the loop by training a point-cloud diffusion
model that is conditioned on the same text prompts used to generate the
original samples. We demonstrate orders-of-magnitude speed-ups in 3D human
generation compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, along with
significantly improved text-prompt alignment, realism, and rendering quality.
We will make the code and dataset available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReXVQA is the largest benchmark for VQA in chest radiology, evaluating AI models and human experts, with MedGemma outperforming humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI in radiological reasoning, bridging the gap between AI and clinical expertise.

Method: Introduces ReXVQA with 696K questions and 160K X-rays, testing 8 models and conducting a human reader study.

Result: MedGemma achieved 83.24% accuracy, surpassing human readers (77.27%).

Conclusion: ReXVQA sets a new standard for radiological AI, enabling next-generation systems with expert-level reasoning.

Abstract: We present ReXVQA, the largest and most comprehensive benchmark for visual
question answering (VQA) in chest radiology, comprising approximately 696,000
questions paired with 160,000 chest X-rays studies across training, validation,
and test sets. Unlike prior efforts that rely heavily on template based
queries, ReXVQA introduces a diverse and clinically authentic task suite
reflecting five core radiological reasoning skills: presence assessment,
location analysis, negation detection, differential diagnosis, and geometric
reasoning. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art multimodal large language models,
including MedGemma-4B-it, Qwen2.5-VL, Janus-Pro-7B, and Eagle2-9B. The
best-performing model (MedGemma) achieves 83.24% overall accuracy. To bridge
the gap between AI performance and clinical expertise, we conducted a
comprehensive human reader study involving 3 radiology residents on 200
randomly sampled cases. Our evaluation demonstrates that MedGemma achieved
superior performance (83.84% accuracy) compared to human readers (best
radiology resident: 77.27%), representing a significant milestone where AI
performance exceeds expert human evaluation on chest X-ray interpretation. The
reader study reveals distinct performance patterns between AI models and human
experts, with strong inter-reader agreement among radiologists while showing
more variable agreement patterns between human readers and AI models. ReXVQA
establishes a new standard for evaluating generalist radiological AI systems,
offering public leaderboards, fine-grained evaluation splits, structured
explanations, and category-level breakdowns. This benchmark lays the foundation
for next-generation AI systems capable of mimicking expert-level clinical
reasoning beyond narrow pathology classification. Our dataset will be
open-sourced at https://huggingface.co/datasets/rajpurkarlab/ReXVQA

### [321] [WorldPrediction: A Benchmark for High-level World Modeling and Long-horizon Procedural Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04363)
*Delong Chen,Willy Chung,Yejin Bang,Ziwei Ji,Pascale Fung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces WorldPrediction, a video-based benchmark to evaluate AI models' world modeling and procedural planning capabilities, highlighting their current limitations compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI lacks clear mechanisms for learning world models and procedural planning, unlike humans. A benchmark is needed to evaluate these capabilities in diverse environments.

Method: WorldPrediction uses a discriminative task setup with visual observations, focusing on temporal and semantic abstraction. It includes action equivalents to avoid low-level cue exploitation.

Result: Current AI models achieve 57% accuracy on WorldPrediction-WM and 38% on WorldPrediction-PP, while humans perform perfectly.

Conclusion: The benchmark reveals significant gaps in AI's world modeling and planning abilities, emphasizing the need for improved models.

Abstract: Humans are known to have an internal "world model" that enables us to carry
out action planning based on world states. AI agents need to have such a world
model for action planning as well. It is not clear how current AI models,
especially generative models, are able to learn such world models and carry out
procedural planning in diverse environments. We introduce WorldPrediction, a
video-based benchmark for evaluating world modeling and procedural planning
capabilities of different AI models. In contrast to prior benchmarks that focus
primarily on low-level world modeling and robotic motion planning,
WorldPrediction is the first benchmark that emphasizes actions with temporal
and semantic abstraction. Given initial and final world states, the task is to
distinguish the proper action (WorldPrediction-WM) or the properly ordered
sequence of actions (WorldPrediction-PP) from a set of counterfactual
distractors. This discriminative task setup enable us to evaluate different
types of world models and planners and realize a thorough comparison across
different hypothesis. The benchmark represents states and actions using visual
observations. In order to prevent models from exploiting low-level continuity
cues in background scenes, we provide "action equivalents" - identical actions
observed in different contexts - as candidates for selection. This benchmark is
grounded in a formal framework of partially observable semi-MDP, ensuring
better reliability and robustness of the evaluation. We conduct extensive human
filtering and validation on our benchmark and show that current frontier models
barely achieve 57% accuracy on WorldPrediction-WM and 38% on WorldPrediction-PP
whereas humans are able to solve both tasks perfectly.

### [322] [Ice Hockey Puck Localization Using Contextual Cues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04365)
*Liam Salass,Jerrin Bright,Amir Nazemi,Yuhao Chen,John Zelek,David Clausi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PLUCC introduces a context-driven method for puck detection in hockey videos, leveraging player behavior cues and achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The puck's small size, occlusions, and motion blur make detection challenging. Player behavior (body orientation, gaze) provides strong contextual cues.

Method: PLUCC combines a contextual encoder (player orientations), feature pyramid encoder (multiscale features), and gating decoder (channel gating).

Result: PLUCC improves average precision by 12.2% and RSLE by 25% over baselines.

Conclusion: Contextual understanding significantly enhances puck detection, benefiting automated sports analysis.

Abstract: Puck detection in ice hockey broadcast videos poses significant challenges
due to the puck's small size, frequent occlusions, motion blur, broadcast
artifacts, and scale inconsistencies due to varying camera zoom and broadcast
camera viewpoints. Prior works focus on appearance-based or motion-based cues
of the puck without explicitly modelling the cues derived from player
behaviour. Players consistently turn their bodies and direct their gaze toward
the puck. Motivated by this strong contextual cue, we propose Puck Localization
Using Contextual Cues (PLUCC), a novel approach for scale-aware and
context-driven single-frame puck detections. PLUCC consists of three
components: (a) a contextual encoder, which utilizes player orientations and
positioning as helpful priors; (b) a feature pyramid encoder, which extracts
multiscale features from the dual encoders; and (c) a gating decoder that
combines latent features with a channel gating mechanism. For evaluation, in
addition to standard average precision, we propose Rink Space Localization
Error (RSLE), a scale-invariant homography-based metric for removing
perspective bias from rink space evaluation. The experimental results of PLUCC
on the PuckDataset dataset demonstrated state-of-the-art detection performance,
surpassing previous baseline methods by an average precision improvement of
12.2% and RSLE average precision of 25%. Our research demonstrates the critical
role of contextual understanding in improving puck detection performance, with
broad implications for automated sports analysis.

*Jubayer Ahmed Bhuiyan Shawon,Hasan Mahmud,Kamrul Hasan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study fine-tunes video transformer models (VideoMAE, ViViT, TimeSformer) on Bangla Sign Language datasets (BdSLW60, BdSLW401) for sign language recognition, achieving high accuracy and demonstrating scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve accessibility for the hearing-impaired community in Bangladesh by automating the recognition of Bangla Sign Language (BdSL) using advanced video transformer models.

Method: Fine-tuning state-of-the-art video transformer architectures on BdSL datasets, applying data augmentation, and using 10-fold stratified cross-validation for evaluation.

Result: VideoMAE achieved the highest accuracies (95.5% on BdSLW60, 81.04% on BdSLW401), outperforming traditional methods.

Conclusion: Video transformers are effective for scalable and accurate BdSL recognition, with performance influenced by dataset size, video quality, and model architecture.

Abstract: Sign Language Recognition (SLR) involves the automatic identification and
classification of sign gestures from images or video, converting them into text
or speech to improve accessibility for the hearing-impaired community. In
Bangladesh, Bangla Sign Language (BdSL) serves as the primary mode of
communication for many individuals with hearing impairments. This study
fine-tunes state-of-the-art video transformer architectures -- VideoMAE, ViViT,
and TimeSformer -- on BdSLW60 (arXiv:2402.08635), a small-scale BdSL dataset
with 60 frequent signs. We standardized the videos to 30 FPS, resulting in
9,307 user trial clips. To evaluate scalability and robustness, the models were
also fine-tuned on BdSLW401 (arXiv:2503.02360), a large-scale dataset with 401
sign classes. Additionally, we benchmark performance against public datasets,
including LSA64 and WLASL. Data augmentation techniques such as random
cropping, horizontal flipping, and short-side scaling were applied to improve
model robustness. To ensure balanced evaluation across folds during model
selection, we employed 10-fold stratified cross-validation on the training set,
while signer-independent evaluation was carried out using held-out test data
from unseen users U4 and U8. Results show that video transformer models
significantly outperform traditional machine learning and deep learning
approaches. Performance is influenced by factors such as dataset size, video
quality, frame distribution, frame rate, and model architecture. Among the
models, the VideoMAE variant (MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics)
achieved the highest accuracies of 95.5% on the frame rate corrected BdSLW60
dataset and 81.04% on the front-facing signs of BdSLW401 -- demonstrating
strong potential for scalable and accurate BdSL recognition.

### [324] [Visualizing and Controlling Cortical Responses Using Voxel-Weighted Activation Maximization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04379)
*Matthew W. Shinkle,Mark D. Lescroart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Activation maximization is applied to DNN-based encoding models to interpret brain responses, generating images that drive targeted fMRI activity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited insight of DNN-based encoding models into specific features driving brain responses.

Method: Extract and downsample activations from Inception V3, use linear regression for fMRI prediction, and apply activation maximization to generate optimized images.

Result: Generated images reliably drive activity in targeted brain regions, validating the method's efficacy.

Conclusion: Activation maximization successfully interprets DNN-based encoding models, enabling flexible characterization of the human visual system.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on visual tasks develop feature
representations that resemble those in the human visual system. Although
DNN-based encoding models can accurately predict brain responses to visual
stimuli, they offer limited insight into the specific features driving these
responses. Here, we demonstrate that activation maximization -- a technique
designed to interpret vision DNNs -- can be applied to DNN-based encoding
models of the human brain. We extract and adaptively downsample activations
from multiple layers of a pretrained Inception V3 network, then use linear
regression to predict fMRI responses. This yields a full image-computable model
of brain responses. Next, we apply activation maximization to generate images
optimized for predicted responses in individual cortical voxels. We find that
these images contain visual characteristics that qualitatively correspond with
known selectivity and enable exploration of selectivity across the visual
cortex. We further extend our method to whole regions of interest (ROIs) of the
brain and validate its efficacy by presenting these images to human
participants in an fMRI study. We find that the generated images reliably drive
activity in targeted regions across both low- and high-level visual areas and
across subjects. These results demonstrate that activation maximization can be
successfully applied to DNN-based encoding models. By addressing key
limitations of alternative approaches that require natively generative models,
our approach enables flexible characterization and modulation of responses
across the human visual system.

### [325] [Is Perturbation-Based Image Protection Disruptive to Image Editing?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04394)
*Qiuyu Tang,Bonor Ayambem,Mooi Choo Chuah,Aparna Bharati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Current perturbation-based image protection methods fail to fully prevent diffusion-based editing, as noise can paradoxically improve adherence to text prompts, leading to better edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the misuse of diffusion models for spreading misinformation and plagiarizing copyrighted materials by evaluating the effectiveness of perturbation-based image protection.

Method: Experiments with various perturbation-based protection methods across domains (natural scenes, artworks) and editing tasks (image-to-image, style editing).

Result: Perturbation-based protection does not fully obstruct editing; noise can enhance adherence to prompts, improving edits.

Conclusion: Perturbation-based methods are insufficient for robust image protection against diffusion-based editing.

Abstract: The remarkable image generation capabilities of state-of-the-art diffusion
models, such as Stable Diffusion, can also be misused to spread misinformation
and plagiarize copyrighted materials. To mitigate the potential risks
associated with image editing, current image protection methods rely on adding
imperceptible perturbations to images to obstruct diffusion-based editing. A
fully successful protection for an image implies that the output of editing
attempts is an undesirable, noisy image which is completely unrelated to the
reference image. In our experiments with various perturbation-based image
protection methods across multiple domains (natural scene images and artworks)
and editing tasks (image-to-image generation and style editing), we discover
that such protection does not achieve this goal completely. In most scenarios,
diffusion-based editing of protected images generates a desirable output image
which adheres precisely to the guidance prompt. Our findings suggest that
adding noise to images may paradoxically increase their association with given
text prompts during the generation process, leading to unintended consequences
such as better resultant edits. Hence, we argue that perturbation-based methods
may not provide a sufficient solution for robust image protection against
diffusion-based editing.

### [326] [Normalize Filters! Classical Wisdom for Deep Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04401)
*Gustavo Perez,Stella X. Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes filter normalization for deep learning filters to address distortions in responses due to atmospheric transfer, improving performance and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical image filters are normalized for consistency, but deep learning filters lack such constraints, leading to distorted responses and incorrect outcomes under atmospheric transfer.

Method: Introduces filter normalization followed by learnable scaling and shifting, akin to batch normalization, to ensure atmosphere-equivariant filters.

Result: Significant improvements on benchmarks; ResNet34 outperforms CLIP. Normalization enhances diversity, robustness, and generalization.

Conclusion: Filter normalization integrates classical principles into deep learning, addressing limitations of unnormalized filters and improving model performance.

Abstract: Classical image filters, such as those for averaging or differencing, are
carefully normalized to ensure consistency, interpretability, and to avoid
artifacts like intensity shifts, halos, or ringing. In contrast, convolutional
filters learned end-to-end in deep networks lack such constraints. Although
they may resemble wavelets and blob/edge detectors, they are not normalized in
the same or any way. Consequently, when images undergo atmospheric transfer,
their responses become distorted, leading to incorrect outcomes. We address
this limitation by proposing filter normalization, followed by learnable
scaling and shifting, akin to batch normalization. This simple yet effective
modification ensures that the filters are atmosphere-equivariant, enabling
co-domain symmetry. By integrating classical filtering principles into deep
learning (applicable to both convolutional neural networks and
convolution-dependent vision transformers), our method achieves significant
improvements on artificial and natural intensity variation benchmarks. Our
ResNet34 could even outperform CLIP by a large margin. Our analysis reveals
that unnormalized filters degrade performance, whereas filter normalization
regularizes learning, promotes diversity, and improves robustness and
generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HMAR improves image generation by addressing VAR's issues with quality, sequence length, and retraining needs, using next-scale prediction and masked generation for faster, higher-quality results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of VAR, such as reduced image quality, superlinear sequence length scaling, and inflexible sampling schedules.

Method: HMAR uses next-scale prediction as a Markovian process and controllable multi-step masked generation for token prediction.

Result: HMAR matches or outperforms VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines on ImageNet benchmarks, with faster training/inference and lower memory usage.

Conclusion: HMAR offers superior flexibility, efficiency, and performance compared to VAR, enabling zero-shot image editing and adaptable sampling schedules.

Abstract: Visual Auto-Regressive modeling (VAR) has shown promise in bridging the speed
and quality gap between autoregressive image models and diffusion models. VAR
reformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive
resolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all
the tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in
all previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from
reduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a
resolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image
resolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.
  We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image
generation algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction
and masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR
reformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the
prediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its
immediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions.
When predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked
generation procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On
ImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform
parameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. We develop
efficient IO-aware block-sparse attention kernels that allow HMAR to achieve
faster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5x and 1.75x
respectively, as well as over 3x lower inference memory footprint. Finally,
HMAR yields additional flexibility over VAR; its sampling schedule can be
changed without further training, and it can be applied to image editing tasks
in a zero-shot manner.

*Zhaoyang Lv,Maurizio Monge,Ka Chen,Yufeng Zhu,Michael Goesele,Jakob Engel,Zhao Dong,Richard Newcombe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in photorealistic scene reconstruction using egocentric devices, proposing VIBA for precise calibration and a physical image formation model to improve accuracy, achieving consistent visual enhancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods often overlook details like precise timestamps and rolling-shutter effects in RGB cameras, leading to less accurate reconstructions.

Method: The study uses visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) for precise calibration and integrates a physical image formation model into Gaussian Splatting to address sensor characteristics.

Result: Experiments show a +1 dB PSNR improvement with VIBA and an additional +1 dB with the proposed image formation model.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enhance photorealistic reconstruction accuracy, validated on Project Aria and Meta Quest3 devices.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the challenges associated with using egocentric
devices to photorealistic reconstruct the scene in high dynamic range. Existing
methodologies typically assume using frame-rate 6DoF pose estimated from the
device's visual-inertial odometry system, which may neglect crucial details
necessary for pixel-accurate reconstruction. This study presents two
significant findings. Firstly, in contrast to mainstream work treating RGB
camera as global shutter frame-rate camera, we emphasize the importance of
employing visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) to calibrate the precise
timestamps and movement of the rolling shutter RGB sensing camera in a high
frequency trajectory format, which ensures an accurate calibration of the
physical properties of the rolling-shutter camera. Secondly, we incorporate a
physical image formation model based into Gaussian Splatting, which effectively
addresses the sensor characteristics, including the rolling-shutter effect of
RGB cameras and the dynamic ranges measured by sensors. Our proposed
formulation is applicable to the widely-used variants of Gaussian Splats
representation. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our pipeline using the
open-source Project Aria device under diverse indoor and outdoor lighting
conditions, and further validate it on a Meta Quest3 device. Across all
experiments, we observe a consistent visual enhancement of +1 dB in PSNR by
incorporating VIBA, with an additional +1 dB achieved through our proposed
image formation model. Our complete implementation, evaluation datasets, and
recording profile are available at

*Patrik Mesec,Alan Jović*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes face defrontalization to improve pose-invariant face recognition, outperforming frontalization methods on larger datasets but not on small ones like Multi-PIE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pose-invariant face recognition methods rely on impractical face frontalization and are often evaluated on small datasets, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: The method involves training a face defrontalization model (FFWM) on aligned frontal-profile pairs, then using it to augment training data for a ResNet-50 model with ArcFace loss.

Result: Defrontalization improves performance on larger datasets (LFW, AgeDB, CFP) but not on Multi-PIE for extreme poses, suggesting overfitting in current methods.

Conclusion: Face defrontalization is a viable alternative to frontalization, especially for larger datasets, but small datasets may still pose challenges.

Abstract: Face recognition under extreme head poses is a challenging task. Ideally, a
face recognition system should perform well across different head poses, which
is known as pose-invariant face recognition. To achieve pose invariance,
current approaches rely on sophisticated methods, such as face frontalization
and various facial feature extraction model architectures. However, these
methods are somewhat impractical in real-life settings and are typically
evaluated on small scientific datasets, such as Multi-PIE. In this work, we
propose the inverse method of face frontalization, called face
defrontalization, to augment the training dataset of facial feature extraction
model. The method does not introduce any time overhead during the inference
step. The method is composed of: 1) training an adapted face defrontalization
FFWM model on a frontal-profile pairs dataset, which has been preprocessed
using our proposed face alignment method; 2) training a ResNet-50 facial
feature extraction model based on ArcFace loss on a raw and randomly
defrontalized large-scale dataset, where defrontalization was performed with
our previously trained face defrontalization model. Our method was compared
with the existing approaches on four open-access datasets: LFW, AgeDB, CFP, and
Multi-PIE. Defrontalization shows improved results compared to models without
defrontalization, while the proposed adjustments show clear superiority over
the state-of-the-art face frontalization FFWM method on three larger
open-access datasets, but not on the small Multi-PIE dataset for extreme poses
(75 and 90 degrees). The results suggest that at least some of the current
methods may be overfitted to small datasets.

*Shizhong Han,Hsin-Pai Cheng,Hong Cai,Jihad Masri,Soyeb Nagori,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FALO is a hardware-friendly LiDAR 3D detection method offering SOTA accuracy and fast inference on edge devices by using 1D sequences and ConvDotMix blocks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LiDAR 3D detection methods struggle with irregular memory access and high computational costs, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained devices.

Method: FALO arranges sparse 3D voxels into a 1D sequence and processes them with ConvDotMix blocks (large-kernel convolutions, Hadamard products, linear layers) and implicit grouping for efficient inference.

Result: FALO achieves competitive performance on benchmarks (nuScenes, Waymo) and is 1.6~9.8x faster than SOTA on mobile GPU/NPU.

Conclusion: FALO is a practical solution for LiDAR 3D detection on edge devices, balancing accuracy and speed.

Abstract: Existing LiDAR 3D object detection methods predominantely rely on sparse
convolutions and/or transformers, which can be challenging to run on
resource-constrained edge devices, due to irregular memory access patterns and
high computational costs. In this paper, we propose FALO, a hardware-friendly
approach to LiDAR 3D detection, which offers both state-of-the-art (SOTA)
detection accuracy and fast inference speed. More specifically, given the 3D
point cloud and after voxelization, FALO first arranges sparse 3D voxels into a
1D sequence based on their coordinates and proximity. The sequence is then
processed by our proposed ConvDotMix blocks, consisting of large-kernel
convolutions, Hadamard products, and linear layers. ConvDotMix provides
sufficient mixing capability in both spatial and embedding dimensions, and
introduces higher-order nonlinear interaction among spatial features.
Furthermore, when going through the ConvDotMix layers, we introduce implicit
grouping, which balances the tensor dimensions for more efficient inference and
takes into account the growing receptive field. All these operations are
friendly to run on resource-constrained platforms and proposed FALO can readily
deploy on compact, embedded devices. Our extensive evaluation on LiDAR 3D
detection benchmarks such as nuScenes and Waymo shows that FALO achieves
competitive performance. Meanwhile, FALO is 1.6~9.8x faster than the latest
SOTA on mobile Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and mobile Neural Processing Unit
(NPU).

*Guangyu Shen,Zhihua Li,Xiang Xu,Tianchen Zhao,Zheng Zhang,Dongsheng An,Zhuowen Tu,Yifan Xing,Qin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AuthGuard improves deepfake detection by combining vision-language contrastive learning and uncertainty learning, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake detection methods fail to generalize to unseen forgeries due to reliance on training-specific statistical artifacts. Language guidance is proposed to enhance generalization by integrating commonsense reasoning.

Method: Train a vision encoder using discriminative classification and image-text contrastive learning, with text generated by MLLMs. Integrate data uncertainty learning to mitigate supervision noise. Combine the encoder with an LLM for interpretability.

Result: AuthGuard achieves significant AUC gains (6.15% on DFDC, 16.68% on DF40) and improves reasoning performance by 24.69% on DDVQA.

Conclusion: AuthGuard sets a new benchmark for deepfake detection by leveraging language guidance and uncertainty learning, enhancing both accuracy and interpretability.

Abstract: Existing deepfake detection techniques struggle to keep-up with the
ever-evolving novel, unseen forgeries methods. This limitation stems from their
reliance on statistical artifacts learned during training, which are often tied
to specific generation processes that may not be representative of samples from
new, unseen deepfake generation methods encountered at test time. We propose
that incorporating language guidance can improve deepfake detection
generalization by integrating human-like commonsense reasoning -- such as
recognizing logical inconsistencies and perceptual anomalies -- alongside
statistical cues. To achieve this, we train an expert deepfake vision encoder
by combining discriminative classification with image-text contrastive
learning, where the text is generated by generalist MLLMs using few-shot
prompting. This allows the encoder to extract both language-describable,
commonsense deepfake artifacts and statistical forgery artifacts from
pixel-level distributions. To further enhance robustness, we integrate data
uncertainty learning into vision-language contrastive learning, mitigating
noise in image-text supervision. Our expert vision encoder seamlessly
interfaces with an LLM, further enabling more generalized and interpretable
deepfake detection while also boosting accuracy. The resulting framework,
AuthGuard, achieves state-of-the-art deepfake detection accuracy in both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, achieving AUC gains of 6.15%
on the DFDC dataset and 16.68% on the DF40 dataset. Additionally, AuthGuard
significantly enhances deepfake reasoning, improving performance by 24.69% on
the DDVQA dataset.

### [332] [Pruning Everything, Everywhere, All at Once](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04513)
*Gustavo Henrique do Nascimento,Ian Pons,Anna Helena Reali Costa,Artur Jordao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new pruning method simultaneously removes neurons and layers in deep learning models, improving computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models become computationally prohibitive as they grow deeper. Existing pruning methods focus on removing either neurons or layers, but not both, leaving room for improvement.

Method: The proposed method selects the best pruned subnetwork (from layer or neuron pruning) based on representation similarity to the parent model using Centered Kernel Alignment. This process is iterated to achieve highly sparse models.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art pruning techniques, achieving up to 95.82% FLOPs reduction on ResNet models while maintaining or improving accuracy. It also enhances robustness and reduces carbon emissions by 83.31%.

Conclusion: This work advances pruning by enabling simultaneous removal of neurons and layers, offering a scalable and efficient solution for resource-constrained applications.

Abstract: Deep learning stands as the modern paradigm for solving cognitive tasks.
However, as the problem complexity increases, models grow deeper and
computationally prohibitive, hindering advancements in real-world and
resource-constrained applications. Extensive studies reveal that pruning
structures in these models efficiently reduces model complexity and improves
computational efficiency. Successful strategies in this sphere include removing
neurons (i.e., filters, heads) or layers, but not both together. Therefore,
simultaneously pruning different structures remains an open problem. To fill
this gap and leverage the benefits of eliminating neurons and layers at once,
we propose a new method capable of pruning different structures within a model
as follows. Given two candidate subnetworks (pruned models), one from layer
pruning and the other from neuron pruning, our method decides which to choose
by selecting the one with the highest representation similarity to its parent
(the network that generates the subnetworks) using the Centered Kernel
Alignment metric. Iteratively repeating this process provides highly sparse
models that preserve the original predictive ability. Throughout extensive
experiments on standard architectures and benchmarks, we confirm the
effectiveness of our approach and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art
layer and filter pruning techniques. At high levels of Floating Point
Operations reduction, most state-of-the-art methods degrade accuracy, whereas
our approach either improves it or experiences only a minimal drop. Notably, on
the popular ResNet56 and ResNet110, we achieve a milestone of 86.37% and 95.82%
FLOPs reduction. Besides, our pruned models obtain robustness to adversarial
and out-of-distribution samples and take an important step towards GreenAI,
reducing carbon emissions by up to 83.31%. Overall, we believe our work opens a
new chapter in pruning.

*Shuo Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EECD-Net proposes a multi-stage approach for road crack detection, combining SRCNN, SCU, and GAT to enhance accuracy and energy efficiency, achieving 98.6% accuracy and 33% power reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges of low-quality images and high energy consumption in smart terminal devices for real-time road crack monitoring.

Method: Uses SRCNN for image enhancement, SCU for power-efficient image conversion, and GAT for multi-scale feature fusion.

Result: Achieves 98.6% detection accuracy and 5.6 mJ energy consumption, outperforming Hybrid-Segmentor by 1.5%.

Conclusion: EECD-Net offers a scalable, low-power solution for real-time infrastructure monitoring in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Crack detection on road surfaces is a critical measurement technology in the
instrumentation domain, essential for ensuring infrastructure safety and
transportation reliability. However, due to limited energy and low-resolution
imaging, smart terminal devices struggle to maintain real-time monitoring
performance. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-stage
detection approach for road crack detection, EECD-Net, to enhance accuracy and
energy efficiency of instrumentation. Specifically, the sophisticated
Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) is employed to address
the inherent challenges of low-quality images, which effectively enhance image
resolution while preserving critical structural details. Meanwhile, a Spike
Convolution Unit (SCU) with Continuous Integrate-and-Fire (CIF) neurons is
proposed to convert these images into sparse pulse sequences, significantly
reducing power consumption. Additionally, a Gated Attention Transformer (GAT)
module is designed to strategically fuse multi-scale feature representations
through adaptive attention mechanisms, effectively capturing both long-range
dependencies and intricate local crack patterns, and significantly enhancing
detection robustness across varying crack morphologies. The experiments on the
CrackVision12K benchmark demonstrate that EECD-Net achieves a remarkable 98.6\%
detection accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art counterparts such as
Hybrid-Segmentor by a significant 1.5\%. Notably, the EECD-Net maintains
exceptional energy efficiency, consuming merely 5.6 mJ, which is a substantial
33\% reduction compared to baseline implementations. This work pioneers a
transformative approach in instrumentation-based crack detection, offering a
scalable, low-power solution for real-time, large-scale infrastructure
monitoring in resource-constrained environments.

### [334] [Enhancing Frequency for Single Image Super-Resolution with Learnable Separable Kernels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04555)
*Heng Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Learnable Separable Kernels (LSKs), a plug-and-play module for single-image super-resolution (SISR), reducing parameters and computation by over 60% while improving performance, especially at higher upscaling factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SISR methods rely on indirect enhancements like specialized loss functions. LSKs aim to directly improve image frequency components for better efficiency and performance.

Method: LSKs are rank-one matrices decomposed into orthogonal, mergeable one-dimensional kernels. They enhance frequency components and are analyzed interpretably via feature maps.

Result: Incorporating LSKs reduces parameters and computation by over 60% and improves model performance, particularly with higher upscaling factors.

Conclusion: LSKs offer a direct, efficient, and effective solution for SISR, outperforming baseline methods in both resource reduction and performance enhancement.

Abstract: Existing approaches often enhance the performance of single-image
super-resolution (SISR) methods by incorporating auxiliary structures, such as
specialized loss functions, to indirectly boost the quality of low-resolution
images. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play module called Learnable
Separable Kernels (LSKs), which are formally rank-one matrices designed to
directly enhance image frequency components. We begin by explaining why LSKs
are particularly suitable for SISR tasks from a frequency perspective. Baseline
methods incorporating LSKs demonstrate a significant reduction of over 60\% in
both the number of parameters and computational requirements. This reduction is
achieved through the decomposition of LSKs into orthogonal and mergeable
one-dimensional kernels. Additionally, we perform an interpretable analysis of
the feature maps generated by LSKs. Visualization results reveal the capability
of LSKs to enhance image frequency components effectively. Extensive
experiments show that incorporating LSKs not only reduces the number of
parameters and computational load but also improves overall model performance.
Moreover, these experiments demonstrate that models utilizing LSKs exhibit
superior performance, particularly as the upscaling factor increases.

*Yunhao Gou,Kai Chen,Zhili Liu,Lanqing Hong,Xin Jin,Zhenguo Li,James T. Kwok,Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RACRO enhances multi-modal reasoning by aligning visual captioning with reasoning objectives, avoiding costly retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending slow-thinking LLMs to multi-modal tasks is challenging due to vision-language alignment costs.

Method: Proposes RACRO, a reinforcement learning strategy optimizing captions for reasoning alignment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks, improving scalability and adaptability.

Conclusion: RACRO offers a scalable solution for multi-modal reasoning without expensive re-alignment.

Abstract: Recent advances in slow-thinking language models (e.g., OpenAI-o1 and
DeepSeek-R1) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in complex reasoning tasks
by emulating human-like reflective cognition. However, extending such
capabilities to multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) remains challenging
due to the high cost of retraining vision-language alignments when upgrading
the underlying reasoner LLMs. A straightforward solution is to decouple
perception from reasoning, i.e., converting visual inputs into language
representations (e.g., captions) that are then passed to a powerful text-only
reasoner. However, this decoupling introduces a critical challenge: the visual
extractor must generate descriptions that are both faithful to the image and
informative enough to support accurate downstream reasoning. To address this,
we propose Reasoning-Aligned Perceptual Decoupling via Caption Reward
Optimization (RACRO) - a reasoning-guided reinforcement learning strategy that
aligns the extractor's captioning behavior with the reasoning objective. By
closing the perception-reasoning loop via reward-based optimization, RACRO
significantly enhances visual grounding and extracts reasoning-optimized
representations. Experiments on multi-modal math and science benchmarks show
that the proposed RACRO method achieves state-of-the-art average performance
while enabling superior scalability and plug-and-play adaptation to more
advanced reasoning LLMs without the necessity for costly multi-modal
re-alignment.

*Biao Guo,Fangmin Guo,Guibo Luo,Xiaonan Luo,Feng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight single-branch network (LGM-Pose) is proposed for multi-person pose estimation, addressing global context and latency issues in existing CNN-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CNN-based methods struggle with global context and high latency due to complex structures.

Method: LGM-Pose uses a MobileViM Block with Lightweight Attentional Representation Module (LARM) and Non-Parametric Transformation Operation (NPT-Op) for global modeling, plus a Shuffle-Integrated Fusion Module (SFusion) for multi-scale integration.

Result: The method reduces parameters, outperforms existing lightweight methods, and achieves faster speeds on COCO and MPII datasets.

Conclusion: LGM-Pose offers an efficient solution for lightweight pose estimation with improved performance and speed.

Abstract: Most of the current top-down multi-person pose estimation lightweight methods
are based on multi-branch parallel pure CNN network architecture, which often
struggle to capture the global context required for detecting semantically
complex keypoints and are hindered by high latency due to their intricate and
redundant structures. In this article, an approximate single-branch lightweight
global modeling network (LGM-Pose) is proposed to address these challenges. In
the network, a lightweight MobileViM Block is designed with a proposed
Lightweight Attentional Representation Module (LARM), which integrates
information within and between patches using the Non-Parametric Transformation
Operation(NPT-Op) to extract global information. Additionally, a novel
Shuffle-Integrated Fusion Module (SFusion) is introduced to effectively
integrate multi-scale information, mitigating performance degradation often
observed in single-branch structures. Experimental evaluations on the COCO and
MPII datasets demonstrate that our approach not only reduces the number of
parameters compared to existing mainstream lightweight methods but also
achieves superior performance and faster processing speeds.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Follow-Your-Creation is a 4D video framework for generating and editing content from monocular video using video inpainting as a generative prior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable flexible and high-quality 4D video creation and editing from single-view inputs.

Method: Uses video inpainting with composite masks, depth-based rendering, and self-iterative tuning for temporal consistency.

Result: Generates 4D videos with multi-view coherence and supports prompt-based editing, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively leverages prior knowledge for robust and versatile 4D video creation and editing.

Abstract: We introduce Follow-Your-Creation, a novel 4D video creation framework
capable of both generating and editing 4D content from a single monocular video
input. By leveraging a powerful video inpainting foundation model as a
generative prior, we reformulate 4D video creation as a video inpainting task,
enabling the model to fill in missing content caused by camera trajectory
changes or user edits. To facilitate this, we generate composite masked
inpainting video data to effectively fine-tune the model for 4D video
generation. Given an input video and its associated camera trajectory, we first
perform depth-based point cloud rendering to obtain invisibility masks that
indicate the regions that should be completed. Simultaneously, editing masks
are introduced to specify user-defined modifications, and these are combined
with the invisibility masks to create a composite masks dataset. During
training, we randomly sample different types of masks to construct diverse and
challenging inpainting scenarios, enhancing the model's generalization and
robustness in various 4D editing and generation tasks. To handle temporal
consistency under large camera motion, we design a self-iterative tuning
strategy that gradually increases the viewing angles during training, where the
model is used to generate the next-stage training data after each fine-tuning
iteration. Moreover, we introduce a temporal packaging module during inference
to enhance generation quality. Our method effectively leverages the prior
knowledge of the base model without degrading its original performance,
enabling the generation of 4D videos with consistent multi-view coherence. In
addition, our approach supports prompt-based content editing, demonstrating
strong flexibility and significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods in
both quality and versatility.

*Ziqi Jia,Anmin Wang,Xiaoyang Qu,Xiaowen Yang,Jianzong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Hierarchical Embodied Continual Learning (HEC) and Task-aware MoILE method to address high-level planning and catastrophic forgetting in continual learning for embodied agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing setups neglect high-level planning and multi-level knowledge in continual learning for embodied intelligence.

Method: Divides learning into high-level instructions and low-level actions, uses Task-aware MoILE with clustering and dual routers for LoRA experts, and applies SVD to mitigate forgetting.

Result: Outperforms others in reducing catastrophic forgetting, enabling agents to retain prior knowledge while learning new tasks.

Conclusion: HEC and Task-aware MoILE effectively address hierarchical learning and forgetting in continual learning for embodied agents.

Abstract: Previous continual learning setups for embodied intelligence focused on
executing low-level actions based on human commands, neglecting the ability to
learn high-level planning and multi-level knowledge. To address these issues,
we propose the Hierarchical Embodied Continual Learning Setups (HEC) that
divide the agent's continual learning process into two layers: high-level
instructions and low-level actions, and define five embodied continual learning
sub-setups. Building on these setups, we introduce the Task-aware Mixture of
Incremental LoRA Experts (Task-aware MoILE) method. This approach achieves task
recognition by clustering visual-text embeddings and uses both a task-level
router and a token-level router to select the appropriate LoRA experts. To
effectively address the issue of catastrophic forgetting, we apply Singular
Value Decomposition (SVD) to the LoRA parameters obtained from prior tasks,
preserving key components while orthogonally training the remaining parts. The
experimental results show that our method stands out in reducing the forgetting
of old tasks compared to other methods, effectively supporting agents in
retaining prior knowledge while continuously learning new tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SmartAvatar is a framework for creating customizable, animation-ready 3D avatars from photos or text, using vision-language models and iterative refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack precise control over human identity, body shape, and animation readiness. SmartAvatar addresses this by integrating VLMs and parametric human generators.

Method: Leverages VLMs and parametric generators with an autonomous verification loop for iterative refinement via natural-language feedback.

Result: Outperforms other systems in mesh quality, identity fidelity, and animation readiness, suitable for consumer hardware.

Conclusion: SmartAvatar offers a versatile, user-involved approach for high-quality avatar generation, surpassing diffusion-based methods.

Abstract: SmartAvatar is a vision-language-agent-driven framework for generating fully
rigged, animation-ready 3D human avatars from a single photo or textual prompt.
While diffusion-based methods have made progress in general 3D object
generation, they continue to struggle with precise control over human identity,
body shape, and animation readiness. In contrast, SmartAvatar leverages the
commonsense reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (VLMs) in
combination with off-the-shelf parametric human generators to deliver
high-quality, customizable avatars. A key innovation is an autonomous
verification loop, where the agent renders draft avatars, evaluates facial
similarity, anatomical plausibility, and prompt alignment, and iteratively
adjusts generation parameters for convergence. This interactive, AI-guided
refinement process promotes fine-grained control over both facial and body
features, enabling users to iteratively refine their avatars via
natural-language conversations. Unlike diffusion models that rely on static
pre-trained datasets and offer limited flexibility, SmartAvatar brings users
into the modeling loop and ensures continuous improvement through an LLM-driven
procedural generation and verification system. The generated avatars are fully
rigged and support pose manipulation with consistent identity and appearance,
making them suitable for downstream animation and interactive applications.
Quantitative benchmarks and user studies demonstrate that SmartAvatar
outperforms recent text- and image-driven avatar generation systems in terms of
reconstructed mesh quality, identity fidelity, attribute accuracy, and
animation readiness, making it a versatile tool for realistic, customizable
avatar creation on consumer-grade hardware.

TL;DR: A two-stage framework, Perfecting Depth, enhances sensor depth by combining stochastic uncertainty modeling and deterministic refinement for reliable, artifact-free depth maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address unreliable depth regions in sensor data while preserving geometric cues, improving depth map reliability for applications like autonomous driving and robotics.

Method: 1. Stochastic estimation: Detects unreliable regions and infers geometry using a domain gap. 2. Deterministic refinement: Ensures structural consistency and accuracy using uncertainty maps.

Result: Produces dense, artifact-free depth maps with improved reliability, validated by experiments and theoretical analysis.

Conclusion: The framework sets a new baseline for depth enhancement, with broad applications in autonomous systems and immersive technologies.

Abstract: We propose a novel two-stage framework for sensor depth enhancement, called
Perfecting Depth. This framework leverages the stochastic nature of diffusion
models to automatically detect unreliable depth regions while preserving
geometric cues. In the first stage (stochastic estimation), the method
identifies unreliable measurements and infers geometric structure by leveraging
a training-inference domain gap. In the second stage (deterministic
refinement), it enforces structural consistency and pixel-level accuracy using
the uncertainty map derived from the first stage. By combining stochastic
uncertainty modeling with deterministic refinement, our method yields dense,
artifact-free depth maps with improved reliability. Experimental results
demonstrate its effectiveness across diverse real-world scenarios. Furthermore,
theoretical analysis, various experiments, and qualitative visualizations
validate its robustness and scalability. Our framework sets a new baseline for
sensor depth enhancement, with potential applications in autonomous driving,
robotics, and immersive technologies.

TL;DR: This survey reviews how deep learning has transformed traditional image matching pipelines, categorizing methods into step replacements and end-to-end modules, and benchmarks them on key tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image matching pipelines struggle in challenging scenarios, prompting the need to explore deep learning's impact on improving robustness and accuracy.

Method: The survey categorizes deep learning approaches into replacing individual pipeline steps (e.g., learnable detector-descriptor) and merging steps into end-to-end modules (e.g., pose regressor).

Result: Benchmarking shows improved performance in tasks like pose recovery and homography estimation, but limitations and challenges remain.

Conclusion: The survey provides a clear taxonomy of deep learning-driven image matching, highlighting open challenges and future research directions.

Abstract: Image matching, which establishes correspondences between two-view images to
recover 3D structure and camera geometry, serves as a cornerstone in computer
vision and underpins a wide range of applications, including visual
localization, 3D reconstruction, and simultaneous localization and mapping
(SLAM). Traditional pipelines composed of ``detector-descriptor, feature
matcher, outlier filter, and geometric estimator'' falter in challenging
scenarios. Recent deep-learning advances have significantly boosted both
robustness and accuracy. This survey adopts a unique perspective by
comprehensively reviewing how deep learning has incrementally transformed the
classical image matching pipeline. Our taxonomy highly aligns with the
traditional pipeline in two key aspects: i) the replacement of individual steps
in the traditional pipeline with learnable alternatives, including learnable
detector-descriptor, outlier filter, and geometric estimator; and ii) the
merging of multiple steps into end-to-end learnable modules, encompassing
middle-end sparse matcher, end-to-end semi-dense/dense matcher, and pose
regressor. We first examine the design principles, advantages, and limitations
of both aspects, and then benchmark representative methods on relative pose
recovery, homography estimation, and visual localization tasks. Finally, we
discuss open challenges and outline promising directions for future research.
By systematically categorizing and evaluating deep learning-driven strategies,
this survey offers a clear overview of the evolving image matching landscape
and highlights key avenues for further innovation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STARE is a benchmark for evaluating multimodal LLMs on spatial reasoning tasks, showing models struggle with complex visual simulations compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI benchmarks focus on verbal reasoning, neglecting non-verbal, multi-step visual simulations crucial for spatial cognition.

Method: STARE includes 4K tasks across geometric transformations, integrated spatial reasoning, and real-world challenges.

Result: Models perform well on simple 2D tasks but poorly on complex 3D tasks; humans outperform but benefit from visual simulations.

Conclusion: Models lack effective use of intermediate visual information, highlighting a gap in spatial reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Spatial cognition is essential for human intelligence, enabling
problem-solving through visual simulations rather than solely relying on verbal
reasoning. However, existing AI benchmarks primarily assess verbal reasoning,
neglecting the complexities of non-verbal, multi-step visual simulation. We
introduce STARE(Spatial Transformations and Reasoning Evaluation), a benchmark
designed to rigorously evaluate multimodal large language models on tasks
better solved through multi-step visual simulation. STARE features 4K tasks
spanning foundational geometric transformations (2D and 3D), integrated spatial
reasoning (cube net folding and tangram puzzles), and real-world spatial
reasoning (perspective and temporal reasoning), reflecting practical cognitive
challenges like object assembly, mechanical diagram interpretation, and
everyday spatial navigation. Our evaluations show that models excel at
reasoning over simpler 2D transformations, but perform close to random chance
on more complex tasks like 3D cube net folding and tangram puzzles that require
multi-step visual simulations. Humans achieve near-perfect accuracy but take
considerable time (up to 28.9s) on complex tasks, significantly speeding up
(down by 7.5 seconds on average) with intermediate visual simulations. In
contrast, models exhibit inconsistent performance gains from visual
simulations, improving on most tasks but declining in specific cases like
tangram puzzles (GPT-4o, o1) and cube net folding (Claude-3.5, Gemini-2.0
Flash), indicating that models may not know how to effectively leverage
intermediate visual information.

Result: The framework enhances text legibility and achieves state-of-the-art performance in super-resolution metrics.

Conclusion: TADiSR effectively addresses text distortion in SR, demonstrating strong generalization in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The introduction of generative models has significantly advanced image
super-resolution (SR) in handling real-world degradations. However, they often
incur fidelity-related issues, particularly distorting textual structures. In
this paper, we introduce a novel diffusion-based SR framework, namely TADiSR,
which integrates text-aware attention and joint segmentation decoders to
recover not only natural details but also the structural fidelity of text
regions in degraded real-world images. Moreover, we propose a complete pipeline
for synthesizing high-quality images with fine-grained full-image text masks,
combining realistic foreground text regions with detailed background content.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially enhances text

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FPSAttention introduces a joint optimization of FP8 quantization and sparsity for video generation, achieving significant speedups without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Slow inference speeds and high computational demands of diffusion models hinder practical deployment.

Method: Combines FP8 quantization and sparsity with a 3D tile-wise granularity, denoising step-aware strategy, and hardware-friendly kernel.

Result: 7.09x kernel speedup for attention and 4.96x end-to-end speedup for video generation at 720p.

Conclusion: FPSAttention effectively accelerates video generation while maintaining quality.

Abstract: Diffusion generative models have become the standard for producing
high-quality, coherent video content, yet their slow inference speeds and high
computational demands hinder practical deployment. Although both quantization
and sparsity can independently accelerate inference while maintaining
generation quality, naively combining these techniques in existing
training-free approaches leads to significant performance degradation due to
the lack of joint optimization.We introduce FPSAttention, a novel
training-aware co-design of FP8 quantization and sparsity for video generation,
with a focus on the 3D bi-directional attention mechanism. Our approach
features three key innovations: 1) A unified 3D tile-wise granularity that
simultaneously supports both quantization and sparsity; 2) A denoising
step-aware strategy that adapts to the noise schedule, addressing the strong
correlation between quantization/sparsity errors and denoising steps; 3) A
native, hardware-friendly kernel that leverages FlashAttention and is
implemented with optimized Hopper architecture features for highly efficient
execution. Trained on Wan2.1's 1.3B and 14B models and evaluated on the VBench
benchmark, FPSAttention achieves a 7.09x kernel speedup for attention
operations and a 4.96x end-to-end speedup for video generation compared to the
BF16 baseline at 720p resolution-without sacrificing generation quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve representation learning by combining feature extraction and object segmentation, addressing limitations of prior work and validating it on real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of conventional representation learning, which assumes disentangled independent feature axes but fails to account for conditional independence, and to extend the applicability of group decomposition theory to realistic scenarios.

Method: The study introduces a method combining feature extraction and object segmentation, replacing pixel translation with feature translation and grouping features under the same transformation.

Result: The proposed method was validated on a practical dataset with real-world objects and backgrounds, showing promise for real-world applications.

Conclusion: The model advances representation learning and may enhance understanding of human object recognition development.

Abstract: The main goal of representation learning is to acquire meaningful
representations from real-world sensory inputs without supervision.
Representation learning explains some aspects of human development. Various
neural network (NN) models have been proposed that acquire empirically good
representations. However, the formulation of a good representation has not been
established. We recently proposed a method for categorizing changes between a
pair of sensory inputs. A unique feature of this approach is that
transformations between two sensory inputs are learned to satisfy algebraic
structural constraints. Conventional representation learning often assumes that
disentangled independent feature axes is a good representation; however, we
found that such a representation cannot account for conditional independence.
To overcome this problem, we proposed a new method using group decomposition in
Galois algebra theory. Although this method is promising for defining a more
general representation, it assumes pixel-to-pixel translation without feature
extraction, and can only process low-resolution images with no background,
which prevents real-world application. In this study, we provide a simple
method to apply our group decomposition theory to a more realistic scenario by
combining feature extraction and object segmentation. We replace pixel
translation with feature translation and formulate object segmentation as
grouping features under the same transformation. We validated the proposed
method on a practical dataset containing both real-world object and background.
We believe that our model will lead to a better understanding of human
development of object recognition in the real world.

Motivation: Existing self-explainable models struggle in low-data settings due to suboptimal performance. The goal is to enhance interpretability and accuracy under such constraints.

Method: Proposes FSPCC with MoLE for parameter-efficient adaptation, cross-module guidance for alignment, multi-level feature fusion, and a geometry-aware loss for concept discrimination.

Result: Outperforms existing SEMs by 4.2%-8.7% in 5-way 5-shot classification across six benchmarks.

Conclusion: FSPCC effectively combines concept learning with few-shot adaptation, achieving higher accuracy and clearer interpretability, advancing transparent visual recognition.

Abstract: Self-Explainable Models (SEMs) rely on Prototypical Concept Learning (PCL) to
enable their visual recognition processes more interpretable, but they often
struggle in data-scarce settings where insufficient training samples lead to
suboptimal performance.To address this limitation, we propose a Few-Shot
Prototypical Concept Classification (FSPCC) framework that systematically
mitigates two key challenges under low-data regimes: parametric imbalance and
representation misalignment. Specifically, our approach leverages a Mixture of
LoRA Experts (MoLE) for parameter-efficient adaptation, ensuring a balanced
allocation of trainable parameters between the backbone and the PCL
module.Meanwhile, cross-module concept guidance enforces tight alignment
between the backbone's feature representations and the prototypical concept
activation patterns.In addition, we incorporate a multi-level feature
preservation strategy that fuses spatial and semantic cues across various
layers, thereby enriching the learned representations and mitigating the
challenges posed by limited data availability.Finally, to enhance
interpretability and minimize concept overlap, we introduce a geometry-aware
concept discrimination loss that enforces orthogonality among concepts,
encouraging more disentangled and transparent decision boundaries.Experimental
results on six popular benchmarks (CUB-200-2011, mini-ImageNet, CIFAR-FS,
Stanford Cars, FGVC-Aircraft, and DTD) demonstrate that our approach
consistently outperforms existing SEMs by a notable margin, with 4.2%-8.7%
relative gains in 5-way 5-shot classification.These findings highlight the
efficacy of coupling concept learning with few-shot adaptation to achieve both
higher accuracy and clearer model interpretability, paving the way for more
transparent visual recognition systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gen-n-Val is a novel framework using LLMs and VLLMs to generate high-quality synthetic data for computer vision tasks, reducing invalid data and improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing data scarcity and label noise in computer vision tasks like object detection and instance segmentation by improving synthetic data quality.

Method: Uses Layer Diffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs in a two-agent system: one optimizes prompts for LD to generate single-object masks, and the other validates data quality. System prompts are refined via TextGrad, and image harmonization combines instances.

Result: Reduces invalid synthetic data from 50% to 7%, improves rare-class performance by 1% mAP in COCO, and shows 7.1% mAP improvement in open-vocabulary detection.

Conclusion: Gen-n-Val significantly enhances synthetic data quality and model performance in instance segmentation and object detection.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Large Language Models
(VLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance as agents across various tasks
while data scarcity and label noise remain significant challenges in computer
vision tasks, such as object detection and instance segmentation. A common
solution for resolving these issues is to generate synthetic data. However,
current synthetic data generation methods struggle with issues, such as
multiple objects per mask, inaccurate segmentation, and incorrect category
labels, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce
Gen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer
Diffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality, single-object masks
and diverse backgrounds. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: (1) The LD prompt
agent, an LLM, optimizes prompts for LD to generate high-quality foreground
instance images and segmentation masks. These optimized prompts ensure the
generation of single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and
clean backgrounds. (2) The data validation agent, a VLLM, which filters out
low-quality synthetic instance images. The system prompts for both agents are
refined through TextGrad. Additionally, we use image harmonization to combine
multiple instances within scenes. Compared to state-of-the-art synthetic data
approaches like MosaicFusion, our approach reduces invalid synthetic data from
50% to 7% and improves performance by 1% mAP on rare classes in COCO instance
segmentation with YOLOv9c and YOLO11m. Furthermore, Gen-n-Val shows significant
improvements (7. 1% mAP) over YOLO-Worldv2-M in open-vocabulary object
detection benchmarks with YOLO11m. Moreover, Gen-n-Val improves the performance
of YOLOv9 and YOLO11 families in instance segmentation and object detection.

*Chuyun Deng,Na Liu,Wei Xie,Lianming Xu,Li Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MARS is a novel method combining CNNs and Transformers for accurate radio map reconstruction from sparse measurements, outperforming baselines in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods lack environmental awareness, and deep learning approaches often require detailed scene data, limiting generalization.

Method: MARS integrates CNNs and Transformers with multi-scale feature fusion and residual connections for global and local feature extraction.

Result: MARS achieves better MSE and SSIM scores than baselines across various scenes and antenna locations, with low computational cost.

Conclusion: MARS demonstrates strong practical potential for radio map reconstruction in applications like smart cities and IoT.

Abstract: Radio maps reflect the spatial distribution of signal strength and are
essential for applications like smart cities, IoT, and wireless network
planning. However, reconstructing accurate radio maps from sparse measurements
remains challenging. Traditional interpolation and inpainting methods lack
environmental awareness, while many deep learning approaches depend on detailed
scene data, limiting generalization. To address this, we propose MARS, a
Multi-scale Aware Radiomap Super-resolution method that combines CNNs and
Transformers with multi-scale feature fusion and residual connections. MARS
focuses on both global and local feature extraction, enhancing feature
representation across different receptive fields and improving reconstruction
accuracy. Experiments across different scenes and antenna locations show that
MARS outperforms baseline models in both MSE and SSIM, while maintaining low
computational cost, demonstrating strong practical potential.

### [349] [HoliSafe: Holistic Safety Benchmarking and Modeling with Safety Meta Token for Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04704)
*Youngwan Lee,Kangsan Kim,Kwanyong Park,Ilcahe Jung,Soojin Jang,Seanie Lee,Yong-Ju Lee,Sung Ju Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HoliSafe, a comprehensive safety dataset and benchmark for Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and SafeLLaVA, a novel VLM with safety enhancements, achieving state-of-the-art safety performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM safety approaches are limited by partial coverage of harmful content and reliance on data-centric tuning, leaving models vulnerable to unseen threats.

Method: Proposes HoliSafe, a dataset covering all safe/unsafe image-text combinations, and SafeLLaVA, a VLM with a safety meta token and dedicated safety head for intrinsic safety.

Result: SafeLLaVA trained on HoliSafe achieves top safety performance, and HoliSafe exposes vulnerabilities in existing models.

Conclusion: HoliSafe and SafeLLaVA advance robust and interpretable VLM safety, encouraging further research in multimodal alignment.

Abstract: Despite emerging efforts to enhance the safety of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), current approaches face two main shortcomings. 1) Existing
safety-tuning datasets and benchmarks only partially consider how image-text
interactions can yield harmful content, often overlooking contextually unsafe
outcomes from seemingly benign pairs. This narrow coverage leaves VLMs
vulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely
primarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to
intrinsically strengthen safety. We address these gaps by introducing a
holistic safety dataset and benchmark, HoliSafe, that spans all five
safe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both
training and evaluation. We further propose SafeLLaVA, a novel VLM augmented
with a learnable safety meta token and a dedicated safety head. The meta token
encodes harmful visual cues during training, intrinsically guiding the language
model toward safer responses, while the safety head offers interpretable
harmfulness classification aligned with refusal rationales. Experiments show
that SafeLLaVA, trained on HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety
performance across multiple VLM benchmarks. Additionally, the HoliSafe
benchmark itself reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing models. We hope
that HoliSafe and SafeLLaVA will spur further research into robust and
interpretable VLM safety, expanding future avenues for multimodal alignment.

TL;DR: The paper investigates how multimodal models like LlaVA-Next represent images in hidden activations, revealing linearly decodable ImageNet class features and causal relationships through targeted edits. It also explores shared representations across modalities using Sparse Autoencoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the hidden representations of image concepts in multimodal language models and enhance interpretability of cross-modal features.

Method: Analyzes LlaVA-Next's hidden activations for ImageNet class features, performs causal tests via targeted edits, and trains multimodal Sparse Autoencoders to study feature diversity and modality sharing.

Result: Identifies linearly decodable and causal image features, with deeper layers showing increased sharing of representations between text and images.

Conclusion: Multimodal models exhibit disjoint but increasingly shared representations across modalities, with potential for improved interpretability through tools like Sparse Autoencoders.

Abstract: Language models can be equipped with multimodal capabilities by fine-tuning
on embeddings of visual inputs. But how do such multimodal models represent
images in their hidden activations? We explore representations of image
concepts within LlaVA-Next, a popular open-source VLLM. We find a diverse set
of ImageNet classes represented via linearly decodable features in the residual
stream. We show that the features are causal by performing targeted edits on
the model output. In order to increase the diversity of the studied linear
features, we train multimodal Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), creating a highly
interpretable dictionary of text and image features. We find that although
model representations across modalities are quite disjoint, they become
increasingly shared in deeper layers.

### [351] [Robust Few-Shot Vision-Language Model Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04713)
*Hanxin Wang,Tian Liu,Shu Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores robust few-shot adaptation of pretrained VLMs, proposing partial finetuning with retrieval and adversarial augmentation to enhance both ID and OOD accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve OOD generalization in few-shot VLM adaptation, addressing the gap in current methods.

Method: Compares adaptation methods, proposes partial finetuning with retrieval and adversarial augmentation, and introduces SRAPF for staged optimization.

Result: SRAPF achieves state-of-the-art ID and OOD accuracy on ImageNet benchmarks.

Conclusion: Partial finetuning with strategic augmentation (SRAPF) effectively balances and boosts ID and OOD performance.

Abstract: Pretrained VLMs achieve strong performance on downstream tasks when adapted
with just a few labeled examples. As the adapted models inevitably encounter
out-of-distribution (OOD) test data that deviates from the in-distribution (ID)
task-specific training data, enhancing OOD generalization in few-shot
adaptation is critically important. We study robust few-shot VLM adaptation,
aiming to increase both ID and OOD accuracy. By comparing different adaptation
methods (e.g., prompt tuning, linear probing, contrastive finetuning, and full
finetuning), we uncover three key findings: (1) finetuning with proper
hyperparameters significantly outperforms the popular VLM adaptation methods
prompt tuning and linear probing; (2) visual encoder-only finetuning achieves
better efficiency and accuracy than contrastively finetuning both visual and
textual encoders; (3) finetuning the top layers of the visual encoder provides
the best balance between ID and OOD accuracy. Building on these findings, we
propose partial finetuning of the visual encoder empowered with two simple
augmentation techniques: (1) retrieval augmentation which retrieves
task-relevant data from the VLM's pretraining dataset to enhance adaptation,
and (2) adversarial perturbation which promotes robustness during finetuning.
Results show that the former/latter boosts OOD/ID accuracy while slightly
sacrificing the ID/OOD accuracy. Yet, perhaps understandably, naively combining
the two does not maintain their best OOD/ID accuracy. We address this dilemma
with the developed SRAPF, Stage-wise Retrieval Augmentation-based Adversarial
Partial Finetuning. SRAPF consists of two stages: (1) partial finetuning the
visual encoder using both ID and retrieved data, and (2) adversarial partial
finetuning with few-shot ID data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SRAPF
achieves the state-of-the-art ID and OOD accuracy on the ImageNet OOD
benchmarks.

*Zelu Qi,Ping Shi,Chaoyang Zhang,Shuqi Wang,Fei Zhao,Da Pan,Zefeng Ying*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for assessing the visual quality of AI-generated videos (AIGVs) by decomposing quality into technical, motion, and semantic dimensions, using encoders for feature representation and a large language model (LLM) for regression, achieving second place in a 2025 challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AIGVs often suffer from visual defects like noise and blurriness, impacting user experience, necessitating an automatic quality assessment method for regulation and model improvement.

Method: Quality is decomposed into technical, motion, and semantic dimensions, with encoders for feature representation. An LLM, enhanced by multi-modal prompts and LoRA fine-tuning, serves as the regression module.

Result: The method achieved second place in the NTIRE 2025 Quality Assessment of AI-Generated Content Challenge.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively assesses AIGV quality, leveraging multi-dimensional features and LLMs, with demonstrated success in a competitive challenge.

Abstract: The development of AI-Generated Video (AIGV) technology has been remarkable
in recent years, significantly transforming the paradigm of video content
production. However, AIGVs still suffer from noticeable visual quality defects,
such as noise, blurriness, frame jitter and low dynamic degree, which severely
impact the user's viewing experience. Therefore, an effective automatic visual
quality assessment is of great importance for AIGV content regulation and
generative model improvement. In this work, we decompose the visual quality of
AIGVs into three dimensions: technical quality, motion quality, and video
semantics. For each dimension, we design corresponding encoder to achieve
effective feature representation. Moreover, considering the outstanding
performance of large language models (LLMs) in various vision and language
tasks, we introduce a LLM as the quality regression module. To better enable
the LLM to establish reasoning associations between multi-dimensional features
and visual quality, we propose a specially designed multi-modal prompt
engineering framework. Additionally, we incorporate LoRA fine-tuning technology
during the training phase, allowing the LLM to better adapt to specific tasks.
Our proposed method achieved \textbf{second place} in the NTIRE 2025 Quality

*Hongyu Wang,Yonghao Long,Yueyao Chen,Hon-Chi Yip,Markus Scheppach,Philip Wai-Yan Chiu,Yeung Yam,Helen Mei-Ling Meng,Qi Dou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces iDPOE, a novel imitation learning method for predicting dissection trajectories in ESD videos, improving surgical training and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting dissection trajectories in ESD videos can enhance surgical training, but existing methods struggle with uncertainty, geometric symmetries, and generalization.

Method: iDPOE combines a diffusion model with equivariant representations to model expert behavior and handle stochastic trajectories, improving training and sampling efficiency.

Result: iDPOE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in trajectory prediction on an ESD video dataset of 2000 clips.

Conclusion: iDPOE is the first imitation learning approach for surgical skill development in dissection trajectory prediction, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is a well-established technique for
removing epithelial lesions. Predicting dissection trajectories in ESD videos
offers significant potential for enhancing surgical skill training and
simplifying the learning process, yet this area remains underexplored. While
imitation learning has shown promise in acquiring skills from expert
demonstrations, challenges persist in handling uncertain future movements,
learning geometric symmetries, and generalizing to diverse surgical scenarios.
To address these, we introduce a novel approach: Implicit Diffusion Policy with
Equivariant Representations for Imitation Learning (iDPOE). Our method models
expert behavior through a joint state action distribution, capturing the
stochastic nature of dissection trajectories and enabling robust visual
representation learning across various endoscopic views. By incorporating a
diffusion model into policy learning, iDPOE ensures efficient training and
sampling, leading to more accurate predictions and better generalization.
Additionally, we enhance the model's ability to generalize to geometric
symmetries by embedding equivariance into the learning process. To address
state mismatches, we develop a forward-process guided action inference strategy
for conditional sampling. Using an ESD video dataset of nearly 2000 clips,
experimental results show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods,
both explicit and implicit, in trajectory prediction. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first application of imitation learning to surgical
skill development for dissection trajectory prediction.

Motivation: To reduce manual annotation efforts in industrial inspection systems by leveraging AI for auto-labeling.

Method: Enhanced SegGPT architecture with domain-specific training and scribble-based annotation, validated via a two-stage training approach.

Result: Achieved 0.22 IoU increase, 14% recall improvement, and 60% auto-labeling coverage, matching human-labeled data performance.

Conclusion: The system offers a practical solution for industrial defect detection, reducing reliance on manual labeling.

Abstract: This paper presents an AI-assisted auto-labeling system for display panel
defect detection that leverages in-context learning capabilities. We adopt and
enhance the SegGPT architecture with several domain-specific training
techniques and introduce a scribble-based annotation mechanism to streamline
the labeling process. Our two-stage training approach, validated on industrial
display panel datasets, demonstrates significant improvements over the baseline
model, achieving an average IoU increase of 0.22 and a 14% improvement in
recall across multiple product types, while maintaining approximately 60%
auto-labeling coverage. Experimental results show that models trained on our

offering a practical solution for reducing manual annotation efforts in
industrial inspection systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LAT is a label transfer framework that aligns annotations from diverse datasets into a target label space, improving detection performance without manual relabeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inconsistencies in class semantics and bounding box annotations across datasets hinder generalization in object detection. Existing methods either assume shared taxonomies or require manual effort.

Method: LAT uses dataset-specific detectors to generate pseudo-labels, combines them with ground-truth via a Privileged Proposal Generator (PPG), and refines features with a Semantic Feature Fusion (SFF) module.

Result: LAT improves target-domain detection performance by up to +4.8AP over baselines.

Conclusion: LAT effectively addresses class and spatial inconsistencies without shared label spaces or manual annotations, enhancing generalization.

Abstract: Combining multiple object detection datasets offers a path to improved
generalisation but is hindered by inconsistencies in class semantics and
bounding box annotations. Some methods to address this assume shared label
taxonomies and address only spatial inconsistencies; others require manual
relabelling, or produce a unified label space, which may be unsuitable when a
fixed target label space is required. We propose Label-Aligned Transfer (LAT),
a label transfer framework that systematically projects annotations from
diverse source datasets into the label space of a target dataset. LAT begins by
training dataset-specific detectors to generate pseudo-labels, which are then
combined with ground-truth annotations via a Privileged Proposal Generator
(PPG) that replaces the region proposal network in two-stage detectors. To
further refine region features, a Semantic Feature Fusion (SFF) module injects
class-aware context and features from overlapping proposals using a
confidence-weighted attention mechanism. This pipeline preserves
dataset-specific annotation granularity while enabling many-to-one label space
transfer across heterogeneous datasets, resulting in a semantically and
spatially aligned representation suitable for training a downstream detector.
LAT thus jointly addresses both class-level misalignments and bounding box
inconsistencies without relying on shared label spaces or manual annotations.
Across multiple benchmarks, LAT demonstrates consistent improvements in
target-domain detection performance, achieving gains of up to +4.8AP over
semi-supervised baselines.

*Shuhan Xu,Siyuan Liang,Hongling Zheng,Yong Luo,Aishan Liu,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are vulnerable to stealthy backdoor attacks, leading to malicious captions. The proposed Semantic Reward Defense (SRD) mitigates these attacks using reinforcement learning, reducing success rates to 5.6% while maintaining caption quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent studies reveal VLMs' susceptibility to backdoor attacks, where imperceptible perturbations in training data cause malicious caption generation. This poses a significant threat due to the attacks' stealthiness and cross-modal nature.

Method: The paper introduces SRD, a reinforcement learning framework using a Deep Q-Network. It applies discrete perturbations to sensitive image regions to disrupt malicious pathways, guided by a semantic fidelity score for reward.

Result: Experiments show SRD reduces attack success rates to 5.6% with minimal impact on clean input performance (less than 10% drop).

Conclusion: SRD provides an effective, trigger-agnostic defense against backdoor attacks in VLMs, balancing robustness and caption quality.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in image
captioning, but recent studies show they are vulnerable to backdoor attacks.
Attackers can inject imperceptible perturbations-such as local pixel triggers
or global semantic phrases-into the training data, causing the model to
generate malicious, attacker-controlled captions for specific inputs. These
attacks are hard to detect and defend due to their stealthiness and cross-modal
nature. By analyzing attack samples, we identify two key vulnerabilities: (1)
abnormal attention concentration on specific image regions, and (2) semantic
drift and incoherence in generated captions. To counter this, we propose
Semantic Reward Defense (SRD), a reinforcement learning framework that
mitigates backdoor behavior without prior knowledge of triggers. SRD uses a
Deep Q-Network to learn policies for applying discrete perturbations (e.g.,
occlusion, color masking) to sensitive image regions, aiming to disrupt the
activation of malicious pathways. We design a semantic fidelity score as the
reward signal, which jointly evaluates semantic consistency and linguistic
fluency of the output, guiding the agent toward generating robust yet faithful
captions. Experiments across mainstream VLMs and datasets show SRD reduces
attack success rates to 5.6%, while preserving caption quality on clean inputs
with less than 10% performance drop. SRD offers a trigger-agnostic,
interpretable defense paradigm against stealthy backdoor threats in multimodal
generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance underwater images by integrating physical models with feature learning while preserving semantic and fine details.

Method: Uses a dual-stream approach: one stream estimates transmission maps and background light via physics, while the other learns features with capsule clustering.

Result: Outperforms existing methods by +0.5dB PSNR with one-third FLOPs or +1dB PSNR at similar complexity.

Conclusion: The method effectively balances physical accuracy and perceptual quality, offering efficient and superior underwater image enhancement.

Abstract: We present a novel dual-stream architecture that achieves state-of-the-art
underwater image enhancement by explicitly integrating the Jaffe-McGlamery
physical model with capsule clustering-based feature representation learning.
Our method simultaneously estimates transmission maps and spatially-varying
background light through a dedicated physics estimator while extracting
entity-level features via capsule clustering in a parallel stream. This
physics-guided approach enables parameter-free enhancement that respects
underwater formation constraints while preserving semantic structures and
fine-grained details. Our approach also features a novel optimization objective
ensuring both physical adherence and perceptual quality across multiple spatial
frequencies. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments
across six challenging benchmarks. Results demonstrate consistent improvements
of $+0.5$dB PSNR over the best existing methods while requiring only one-third
of their computational complexity (FLOPs), or alternatively, more than $+1$dB
PSNR improvement when compared to methods with similar computational budgets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper challenges the need for extensive training data in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) by proposing a data selection paradigm, Reasoning Activation Potential (RAP), which identifies high-value 'cognitive samples' to improve reasoning efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address data redundancy and high computational costs in MLLMs by demonstrating that smaller, high-value datasets can outperform full corpora for multi-modal reasoning.

Method: Introduces RAP, which uses two estimators (Causal Discrepancy Estimator and Attention Confidence Estimator) to identify cognitive samples and a Difficulty-aware Replacement Module to enhance sample complexity.

Result: RAP achieves superior performance with only 9.3% of training data and reduces computational costs by over 43% across six datasets.

Conclusion: Smaller, high-value datasets can effectively replace full corpora in MLLMs, improving efficiency without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in complex reasoning tasks via reinforcement learning, it is commonly
believed that extensive training data is necessary for improving multi-modal
reasoning ability, inevitably leading to data redundancy and substantial
computational costs. However, can smaller high-value datasets match or
outperform full corpora for multi-modal reasoning in MLLMs? In this work, we
challenge this assumption through a key observation: meaningful multi-modal
reasoning is triggered by only a sparse subset of training samples, termed
cognitive samples, whereas the majority contribute marginally. Building on this
insight, we propose a novel data selection paradigm termed Reasoning Activation
Potential (RAP), which identifies cognitive samples by estimating each sample's
potential to stimulate genuine multi-modal reasoning by two complementary
estimators: 1) Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE) based on the potential
outcome model principle, eliminates samples that overly rely on language priors
by comparing outputs between multi-modal and text-only inputs; 2) Attention
Confidence Estimator (ACE), which exploits token-level self-attention to
discard samples dominated by irrelevant but over-emphasized tokens in
intermediate reasoning stages. Moreover, we introduce a Difficulty-aware
Replacement Module (DRM) to substitute trivial instances with cognitively
challenging ones, thereby ensuring complexity for robust multi-modal reasoning.
Experiments on six datasets show that our RAP method consistently achieves
superior performance using only 9.3% of the training data, while reducing
computational costs by over 43%. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Leo-ssl/RAP.

*Yijun Cao,Fuya Luo,Yongjie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new form of SSIM for unsupervised monocular depth learning, replacing multiplication with addition for smoother gradients and better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous works ignore the impact of SSIM components and hyperparameters on training, limiting performance.

Method: Introduces a modified SSIM function using addition to combine luminance, contrast, and structural similarity components.

Result: The new SSIM loss improves gradient smoothness and outperforms the baseline on KITTI-2015.

Conclusion: The optimized SSIM loss enhances unsupervised depth estimation performance.

Abstract: Unsupervised monocular depth learning generally relies on the photometric
relation among temporally adjacent images. Most of previous works use both mean
absolute error (MAE) and structure similarity index measure (SSIM) with
conventional form as training loss. However, they ignore the effect of
different components in the SSIM function and the corresponding hyperparameters
on the training. To address these issues, this work proposes a new form of
SSIM. Compared with original SSIM function, the proposed new form uses addition
rather than multiplication to combine the luminance, contrast, and structural
similarity related components in SSIM. The loss function constructed with this
scheme helps result in smoother gradients and achieve higher performance on
unsupervised depth estimation. We conduct extensive experiments to determine
the relatively optimal combination of parameters for our new SSIM. Based on the
popular MonoDepth approach, the optimized SSIM loss function can remarkably
outperform the baseline on the KITTI-2015 outdoor dataset.

TL;DR: HypeVPR introduces a hierarchical embedding framework in hyperbolic space for Visual Place Recognition (VPR), leveraging panoramic views' hierarchical structures for efficient and accurate matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world VPR applications face challenges with diverse query images from various viewpoints, requiring a robust and efficient solution.

Method: HypeVPR uses hyperbolic space for hierarchical feature representation and a coarse-to-fine search strategy for balanced speed and accuracy.

Result: HypeVPR outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 5x faster retrieval while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: HypeVPR effectively addresses P2E VPR challenges with hierarchical hyperbolic embeddings, offering superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: When applying Visual Place Recognition (VPR) to real-world mobile robots and
similar applications, perspective-to-equirectangular (P2E) formulation
naturally emerges as a suitable approach to accommodate diverse query images
captured from various viewpoints. In this paper, we introduce HypeVPR, a novel
hierarchical embedding framework in hyperbolic space, designed to address the
unique challenges of P2E VPR. The key idea behind HypeVPR is that visual
environments captured by panoramic views exhibit inherent hierarchical
structures. To leverage this property, we employ hyperbolic space to represent
hierarchical feature relationships and preserve distance properties within the
feature space. To achieve this, we propose a hierarchical feature aggregation
mechanism that organizes local-to-global feature representations within
hyperbolic space. Additionally, HypeVPR adopts an efficient coarse-to-fine
search strategy, optimally balancing speed and accuracy to ensure robust
matching, even between descriptors from different image types. This approach
enables HypeVPR to outperform state-of-the-art methods while significantly
reducing retrieval time, achieving up to 5x faster retrieval across diverse
benchmark datasets. The code and models will be released at

### [361] [Object-X: Learning to Reconstruct Multi-Modal 3D Object Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04789)
*Gaia Di Lorenzo,Federico Tombari,Marc Pollefeys,Daniel Barath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Object-X is a multi-modal 3D object representation framework that encodes rich embeddings (images, point clouds, text) and decodes them into detailed geometric and visual reconstructions, supporting tasks like scene alignment and localization with high efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack versatility, as they focus on either semantic understanding or geometric reconstruction, limiting their reuse across tasks and ability to decode into explicit geometry.

Method: Object-X grounds modalities in a 3D voxel grid, fuses them into an unstructured embedding, and uses 3D Gaussian Splatting for reconstruction.

Result: Object-X achieves high-fidelity novel-view synthesis, improves geometric accuracy, and performs competitively in downstream tasks while requiring significantly less storage.

Conclusion: Object-X is a scalable, practical solution for multi-modal 3D scene representation, outperforming traditional methods in efficiency and versatility.

Abstract: Learning effective multi-modal 3D representations of objects is essential for
numerous applications, such as augmented reality and robotics. Existing methods
often rely on task-specific embeddings that are tailored either for semantic
understanding or geometric reconstruction. As a result, these embeddings
typically cannot be decoded into explicit geometry and simultaneously reused
across tasks. In this paper, we propose Object-X, a versatile multi-modal
object representation framework capable of encoding rich object embeddings
(e.g. images, point cloud, text) and decoding them back into detailed geometric
and visual reconstructions. Object-X operates by geometrically grounding the
captured modalities in a 3D voxel grid and learning an unstructured embedding
fusing the information from the voxels with the object attributes. The learned
embedding enables 3D Gaussian Splatting-based object reconstruction, while also
supporting a range of downstream tasks, including scene alignment, single-image
3D object reconstruction, and localization. Evaluations on two challenging
real-world datasets demonstrate that Object-X produces high-fidelity novel-view
synthesis comparable to standard 3D Gaussian Splatting, while significantly
improving geometric accuracy. Moreover, Object-X achieves competitive
performance with specialized methods in scene alignment and localization.
Critically, our object-centric descriptors require 3-4 orders of magnitude less
storage compared to traditional image- or point cloud-based approaches,
establishing Object-X as a scalable and highly practical solution for
multi-modal 3D scene representation.

*Yusuke Matsui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LotusFilter is a fast post-processing module to diversify ANNS results by precomputing a cutoff table and greedily removing redundant vectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ANNS results can be overly similar, but some scenarios require diversity alongside similarity.

Method: Precompute a cutoff table of close vectors and greedily remove redundancies during filtering.

Result: Operates fast (0.02 ms/query) in real-world RAG settings using OpenAI embeddings.

Conclusion: LotusFilter effectively diversifies ANNS results efficiently, with publicly available code.

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is an essential building block for
applications like RAG but can sometimes yield results that are overly similar
to each other. In certain scenarios, search results should be similar to the
query and yet diverse. We propose LotusFilter, a post-processing module to
diversify ANNS results. We precompute a cutoff table summarizing vectors that
are close to each other. During the filtering, LotusFilter greedily looks up
the table to delete redundant vectors from the candidates. We demonstrated that
the LotusFilter operates fast (0.02 [ms/query]) in settings resembling
real-world RAG applications, utilizing features such as OpenAI embeddings. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/matsui528/lotf.

*Daniel Barath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SupeRANSAC is a unified RANSAC pipeline designed for consistent accuracy in geometric model estimation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robust estimation is critical in computer vision, but RANSAC performance varies due to implementation details. SupeRANSAC addresses this inconsistency.

Method: Introduces SupeRANSAC, analyzing techniques for effective RANSAC in tasks like homography and pose estimation.

Result: Improves performance by 6 AUC points on average for fundamental matrix estimation, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SupeRANSAC offers significant improvements in accuracy and consistency across multiple vision tasks.

Abstract: Robust estimation is a cornerstone in computer vision, particularly for tasks
like Structure-from-Motion and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping. RANSAC
and its variants are the gold standard for estimating geometric models (e.g.,
homographies, relative/absolute poses) from outlier-contaminated data. Despite
RANSAC's apparent simplicity, achieving consistently high performance across
different problems is challenging. While recent research often focuses on
improving specific RANSAC components (e.g., sampling, scoring), overall
performance is frequently more influenced by the "bells and whistles" (i.e.,
the implementation details and problem-specific optimizations) within a given
library. Popular frameworks like OpenCV and PoseLib demonstrate varying
performance, excelling in some tasks but lagging in others. We introduce
SupeRANSAC, a novel unified RANSAC pipeline, and provide a detailed analysis of
the techniques that make RANSAC effective for specific vision tasks, including
homography, fundamental/essential matrix, and absolute/rigid pose estimation.
SupeRANSAC is designed for consistent accuracy across these tasks, improving
upon the best existing methods by, for example, 6 AUC points on average for
fundamental matrix estimation. We demonstrate significant performance
improvements over the state-of-the-art on multiple problems and datasets. Code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MegaHan97K, a large-scale dataset for mega-category Chinese character recognition, addressing gaps in existing datasets and enabling new research challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of accurately recognizing the vast number of Chinese characters (87,887 in GB18030-2022) for cultural preservation and digital applications, with existing datasets being insufficient.

Method: Creation of MegaHan97K, a dataset with 97,455 categories, including handwritten, historical, and synthetic subsets to balance long-tail distribution.

Result: MegaHan97K supports GB18030-2022, offers 6x more categories than existing datasets, and reveals new challenges like storage demands and zero-shot learning.

Conclusion: MegaHan97K is a groundbreaking dataset for mega-category recognition, fostering future research in OCR and pattern recognition.

Abstract: Foundational to the Chinese language and culture, Chinese characters
encompass extraordinarily extensive and ever-expanding categories, with the
latest Chinese GB18030-2022 standard containing 87,887 categories. The accurate
recognition of this vast number of characters, termed mega-category
recognition, presents a formidable yet crucial challenge for cultural heritage
preservation and digital applications. Despite significant advances in Optical
Character Recognition (OCR), mega-category recognition remains unexplored due
to the absence of comprehensive datasets, with the largest existing dataset
containing merely 16,151 categories. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce
MegaHan97K, a mega-category, large-scale dataset covering an unprecedented
97,455 categories of Chinese characters. Our work offers three major
contributions: (1) MegaHan97K is the first dataset to fully support the latest
GB18030-2022 standard, providing at least six times more categories than
existing datasets; (2) It effectively addresses the long-tail distribution
problem by providing balanced samples across all categories through its three
distinct subsets: handwritten, historical and synthetic subsets; (3)
Comprehensive benchmarking experiments reveal new challenges in mega-category
scenarios, including increased storage demands, morphologically similar
character recognition, and zero-shot learning difficulties, while also
unlocking substantial opportunities for future research. To the best of our
knowledge, the MetaHan97K is likely the dataset with the largest classes not
only in the field of OCR but may also in the broader domain of pattern
recognition. The dataset is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Spike-TBR, a novel event-based encoding method, combines Temporal Binary Representation (TBR) with spiking neurons to enhance noise resilience in event stream processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras outperform traditional sensors but face challenges in noisy event stream conversion for standard vision pipelines.

Method: Spike-TBR integrates spiking neurons with TBR to filter noise and improve event stream representation. Four variants with different spiking neurons are tested.

Result: Spike-TBR outperforms in noisy scenarios and improves clean data results, bridging spike-based and frame-based processing.

Conclusion: Spike-TBR offers a robust, noise-resilient solution for event-driven vision applications.

Abstract: Event cameras offer significant advantages over traditional frame-based
sensors, including higher temporal resolution, lower latency and dynamic range.
However, efficiently converting event streams into formats compatible with
standard computer vision pipelines remains a challenging problem, particularly
in the presence of noise. In this paper, we propose Spike-TBR, a novel
event-based encoding strategy based on Temporal Binary Representation (TBR),
addressing its vulnerability to noise by integrating spiking neurons. Spike-TBR
combines the frame-based advantages of TBR with the noise-filtering
capabilities of spiking neural networks, creating a more robust representation
of event streams. We evaluate four variants of Spike-TBR, each using different
spiking neurons, across multiple datasets, demonstrating superior performance
in noise-affected scenarios while improving the results on clean data. Our
method bridges the gap between spike-based and frame-based processing, offering
a simple noise-resilient solution for event-driven vision applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite successful adversarial attacks on autonomous vehicle perception tasks, traffic light detectors have been less explored. This work addresses this gap.

Method: The authors propose a threat model with patches placed under traffic lights and describe a training strategy for CNN-based detectors.

Result: Successful attacks include targeted red-to-green label-flipping and pictogram classification attacks, validated in lab and real-world tests.

Conclusion: The study highlights vulnerabilities in traffic light detection systems and provides a framework for adversarial attacks, with code made publicly available.

Abstract: Realistic adversarial attacks on various camera-based perception tasks of
autonomous vehicles have been successfully demonstrated so far. However, only a
few works considered attacks on traffic light detectors. This work shows how
CNNs for traffic light detection can be attacked with printed patches. We
propose a threat model, where each instance of a traffic light is attacked with
a patch placed under it, and describe a training strategy. We demonstrate
successful adversarial patch attacks in universal settings. Our experiments
show realistic targeted red-to-green label-flipping attacks and attacks on
pictogram classification. Finally, we perform a real-world evaluation with
printed patches and demonstrate attacks in the lab settings with a mobile
traffic light for construction sites and in a test area with stationary traffic
lights. Our code is available at

*Shuo Cao,Yihao Liu,Xiaohui Li. Yuanting Gao. Yu Zhou,Chao Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualX-VSR introduces a dual axial spatial×temporal attention mechanism for real-world video super-resolution, eliminating motion compensation and improving fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based models struggle with pixel-level precision in VSR due to tokenization and sequential attention, while existing solutions face limited receptive fields and reliance on optical flow.

Method: Proposes DualX-VSR with a dual axial spatial×temporal attention mechanism, integrating spatial and temporal information orthogonally without motion compensation.

Result: DualX-VSR achieves high fidelity and superior performance in real-world VSR tasks.

Conclusion: DualX-VSR simplifies structure and enhances spatiotemporal modeling, outperforming existing transformer-based VSR methods.

Abstract: Transformer-based models like ViViT and TimeSformer have advanced video
understanding by effectively modeling spatiotemporal dependencies. Recent video
generation models, such as Sora and Vidu, further highlight the power of
transformers in long-range feature extraction and holistic spatiotemporal
modeling. However, directly applying these models to real-world video
super-resolution (VSR) is challenging, as VSR demands pixel-level precision,
which can be compromised by tokenization and sequential attention mechanisms.
While recent transformer-based VSR models attempt to address these issues using
smaller patches and local attention, they still face limitations such as
restricted receptive fields and dependence on optical flow-based alignment,
which can introduce inaccuracies in real-world settings. To overcome these
issues, we propose Dual Axial Spatial$\times$Temporal Transformer for
Real-World Video Super-Resolution (DualX-VSR), which introduces a novel dual
axial spatial$\times$temporal attention mechanism that integrates spatial and
temporal information along orthogonal directions. DualX-VSR eliminates the need
for motion compensation, offering a simplified structure that provides a
cohesive representation of spatiotemporal information. As a result, DualX-VSR
achieves high fidelity and superior performance in real-world VSR task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current perception systems excel in 2D reasoning segmentation but lack a comparable framework for 3D tasks, requiring explicit human input or pre-defined categories.

Method: Introduces OpenMaskDINO3D, leveraging a SEG token and object identifier to process point clouds and text prompts for 3D segmentation.

Result: Achieves high-precision 3D segmentation masks from natural language instructions, validated on ScanNet datasets.

Conclusion: OpenMaskDINO3D effectively bridges the gap in 3D reasoning segmentation, enabling accurate results from implicit instructions.

Abstract: Although perception systems have made remarkable advancements in recent
years, particularly in 2D reasoning segmentation, these systems still rely on
explicit human instruction or pre-defined categories to identify target objects
before executing visual recognition tasks. Such systems have matured
significantly, demonstrating the ability to reason and comprehend implicit user
intentions in two-dimensional contexts, producing accurate segmentation masks
based on complex and implicit query text. However, a comparable framework and
structure for 3D reasoning segmentation remain absent. This paper introduces
OpenMaskDINO3D, a LLM designed for comprehensive 3D understanding and
segmentation. OpenMaskDINO3D processes point cloud data and text prompts to
produce instance segmentation masks, excelling in many 3D tasks. By introducing
a SEG token and object identifier, we achieve high-precision 3D segmentation
mask generation, enabling the model to directly produce accurate point cloud
segmentation results from natural language instructions. Experimental results
on large-scale ScanNet datasets validate the effectiveness of our
OpenMaskDINO3D across various tasks.

TL;DR: A new method for reconstructing multidimensional geological fields using tensor completion outperforms ordinary kriging in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve reconstruction of geological fields from sparse observations by leveraging tensor completion and geostatistics.

Method: Model the field as a multidimensional tensor and recover missing values by enforcing a low-rank structure, combining tensor completion and geostatistics.

Result: Experiments show significant accuracy improvements over ordinary kriging for varying data observation percentages.

Conclusion: The proposed tensor completion method is effective for reconstructing geological fields from sparse data.

Abstract: We present a new viewpoint on a reconstructing multidimensional geological
fields from sparse observations. Drawing inspiration from deterministic image
inpainting techniques, we model a partially observed spatial field as a
multidimensional tensor and recover missing values by enforcing a global
low-rank structure. Our approach combines ideas from tensor completion and
geostatistics, providing a robust optimization framework. Experiments on
synthetic geological fields demonstrate that used tensor completion method

*Yu-Feng Chen,Tzuhsuan Huang,Pin-Yen Chiu,Jun-Cheng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel backdoor attack framework for diffusion models in image editing, using invisible triggers via poisoned training data and deep watermarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor attacks in image editing rely on visible triggers, which are impractical. The study aims to address this gap by introducing invisible triggers.

Method: The method embeds imperceptible watermarks as backdoor triggers using off-the-shelf deep watermarking models, ensuring normal editing for clean inputs.

Result: The approach achieves high attack success rates across various watermarking models, with analysis confirming the effectiveness of the triggers.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully demonstrates the vulnerability of diffusion models to invisible backdoor attacks in image editing, supported by experimental results.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in both image generation
and editing. However, recent studies have revealed their vulnerability to
backdoor attacks, in which specific patterns embedded in the input can
manipulate the model's behavior. Most existing research in this area has
proposed attack frameworks focused on the image generation pipeline, leaving
backdoor attacks in image editing relatively unexplored. Among the few studies
targeting image editing, most utilize visible triggers, which are impractical
because they introduce noticeable alterations to the input image before
editing. In this paper, we propose a novel attack framework that embeds
invisible triggers into the image editing process via poisoned training data.
We leverage off-the-shelf deep watermarking models to encode imperceptible
watermarks as backdoor triggers. Our goal is to make the model produce the
predefined backdoor target when it receives watermarked inputs, while editing
clean images normally according to the given prompt. With extensive experiments
across different watermarking models, the proposed method achieves promising
attack success rates. In addition, the analysis results of the watermark
characteristics in term of backdoor attack further support the effectiveness of
our approach. The code is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A transformer encoder is trained to embed chess board states into a latent space for intuitive move selection, achieving high performance without deep search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model human-like intuition-driven planning in chess, avoiding reliance on deep tree search.

Method: Supervised contrastive learning trains a transformer encoder to structure board states by positional evaluation in a latent space.

Result: Achieves an estimated Elo rating of 2593 with only a 6-ply beam search, improving with model size and embedding dimensionality.

Conclusion: Latent planning offers a viable alternative to traditional search, generalizable to other perfect-information games.

Abstract: Modern chess engines achieve superhuman performance through deep tree search
and regressive evaluation, while human players rely on intuition to select
candidate moves followed by a shallow search to validate them. To model this
intuition-driven planning process, we train a transformer encoder using
supervised contrastive learning to embed board states into a latent space
structured by positional evaluation. In this space, distance reflects
evaluative similarity, and visualized trajectories display interpretable
transitions between game states. We demonstrate that move selection can occur
entirely within this embedding space by advancing toward favorable regions,
without relying on deep search. Despite using only a 6-ply beam search, our
model achieves an estimated Elo rating of 2593. Performance improves with both
model size and embedding dimensionality, suggesting that latent planning may
offer a viable alternative to traditional search. Although we focus on chess,
the proposed embedding-based planning method can be generalized to other
perfect-information games where state evaluations are learnable. All source

TL;DR: The paper introduces Anywhere3D-Bench, a 3D visual grounding benchmark, and evaluates models on four grounding levels, revealing challenges in space-level and part-level tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and benchmark 3D visual grounding beyond object-level semantics, addressing gaps in spatial reasoning and fine-grained perception.

Method: Developed Anywhere3D-Bench with 2,632 referring expression-bounding box pairs across four levels, tested state-of-the-art models, LLMs, and MLLMs.

Result: Models struggle with space-level (23.57% accuracy) and part-level (33.94%) tasks, highlighting limitations in spatial reasoning and fine-grained perception.

Conclusion: Current models lack comprehensive 3D scene understanding beyond object-level, emphasizing the need for improved spatial and fine-grained reasoning.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding has made notable progress in localizing objects within
complex 3D scenes. However, grounding referring expressions beyond objects in
3D scenes remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Anywhere3D-Bench, a
holistic 3D visual grounding benchmark consisting of 2,632 referring
expression-3D bounding box pairs spanning four different grounding levels:
human-activity areas, unoccupied space beyond objects, objects in the scene,
and fine-grained object parts. We assess a range of state-of-the-art 3D visual
grounding methods alongside large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs) on Anywhere3D-Bench. Experimental results reveal that space-level and
part-level visual grounding pose the greatest challenges: space-level tasks
require a more comprehensive spatial reasoning ability, for example, modeling
distances and spatial relations within 3D space, while part-level tasks demand
fine-grained perception of object composition. Even the best performance model,
OpenAI o4-mini, achieves only 23.57% accuracy on space-level tasks and 33.94%
on part-level tasks, significantly lower than its performance on area-level and
object-level tasks. These findings underscore a critical gap in current models'
capacity to understand and reason about 3D scene beyond object-level semantics.

TL;DR: A 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) pipeline is introduced for stereo dataset generation, outperforming NeRF-based methods. Expert knowledge transfer from FoundationStereo improves zero-shot generalization, though 3DGS geometry can be noisy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an efficient, high-fidelity alternative to NeRF-based stereo dataset generation and improve zero-shot generalization for deep stereo models.

Method: Utilizes 3DGS for dataset generation and combines it with depth estimates from FoundationStereo in an expert knowledge transfer setup.

Result: 3DGS-generated datasets with FoundationStereo disparity estimates yield better zero-shot performance than noisy 3DGS geometry.

Conclusion: 3DGS shows promise for low-cost, high-quality dataset creation but requires further exploration for robustness in challenging settings.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based pipeline for
stereo dataset generation, offering an efficient alternative to Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF)-based methods. To obtain useful geometry estimates, we explore
utilizing the reconstructed geometry from the explicit 3D representations as
well as depth estimates from the FoundationStereo model in an expert knowledge
transfer setup. We find that when fine-tuning stereo models on 3DGS-generated
datasets, we demonstrate competitive performance in zero-shot generalization
benchmarks. When using the reconstructed geometry directly, we observe that it
is often noisy and contains artifacts, which propagate noise to the trained
model. In contrast, we find that the disparity estimates from FoundationStereo
are cleaner and consequently result in a better performance on the zero-shot
generalization benchmarks. Our method highlights the potential for low-cost,
high-fidelity dataset creation and fast fine-tuning for deep stereo models.
Moreover, we also reveal that while the latest Gaussian Splatting based methods
have achieved superior performance on established benchmarks, their robustness
falls short in challenging in-the-wild settings warranting further exploration.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the importance of choosing the right 3D digitization method for heritage objects, emphasizing collaboration between heritage and digital experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to digitize heritage objects is widely accepted, but no single method suits all cases. The paper aims to highlight the importance of tailored digitization.

Method: The study uses objects from the musée d'Archéologie nationale to illustrate diverse photographic 3D digitization methods, advocating for method adaptation based on object characteristics and intended use.

Result: No single 3D digitization method is universally suitable; the best method depends on the object and its digital twin's future use.

Conclusion: Absolute classification of 3D digitization methods is impractical. Instead, a collaborative, adaptive approach is recommended for each heritage object.

Abstract: The need to digitize heritage objects is now widely accepted. This article
presents the very fashionable context of the creation of ''digital twins''. It
illustrates the diversity of photographic 3D digitization methods, but this is
not its only objective. Using a selection of objects from the collections of
the mus{\'e}e d'Arch{\'e}ologie nationale, it shows that no single method is
suitable for all cases. Rather, the method to be recommended for a given object
should be the result of a concerted choice between those involved in heritage
and those involved in the digital domain, as each new object may require the
adaptation of existing tools. It would therefore be pointless to attempt an
absolute classification of 3D digitization methods. On the contrary, we need to
find the digital tool best suited to each object, taking into account not only
its characteristics, but also the future use of its digital twin.

Result: CzechLynx includes 219 unique lynx individuals, spans 15 years, and covers two distinct regions. The synthetic set enhances variability in environments, poses, and coat patterns.

Conclusion: The dataset is designed to benchmark and develop state-of-the-art models for animal re-identification and related tasks, with potential broader applications.

Abstract: We introduce CzechLynx, the first large-scale, open-access dataset for
individual identification, 2D pose estimation, and instance segmentation of the
Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx). CzechLynx includes more than 30k camera trap images
annotated with segmentation masks, identity labels, and 20-point skeletons and
covers 219 unique individuals across 15 years of systematic monitoring in two
geographically distinct regions: Southwest Bohemia and the Western Carpathians.
To increase the data variability, we create a complementary synthetic set with
more than 100k photorealistic images generated via a Unity-based pipeline and
diffusion-driven text-to-texture modeling, covering diverse environments,
poses, and coat-pattern variations. To allow testing generalization across
spatial and temporal domains, we define three tailored evaluation
protocols/splits: (i) geo-aware, (ii) time-aware open-set, and (iii) time-aware
closed-set. This dataset is targeted to be instrumental in benchmarking
state-of-the-art models and the development of novel methods for not just
individual animal re-identification.

Result: The method outperforms existing approaches, validated on a dataset of 2,500 annotated TLM videos.

Conclusion: This work advances AI-assisted embryo selection with a clinically grounded framework, promising improved IVF outcomes.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has recently shown promise in automated embryo
selection for In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF). However, current approaches either
address partial embryo evaluation lacking holistic quality assessment or target
clinical outcomes inevitably confounded by extra-embryonic factors, both
limiting clinical utility. To bridge this gap, we propose a new task called
Video-Based Embryo Grading - the first paradigm that directly utilizes
full-length time-lapse monitoring (TLM) videos to predict embryologists'
overall quality assessments. To support this task, we curate a real-world
clinical dataset comprising over 2,500 TLM videos, each annotated with a
grading label indicating the overall quality of embryos. Grounded in clinical
decision-making principles, we propose a Complementary Spatial-Temporal Pattern
Mining (CoSTeM) framework that conceptually replicates embryologists'
evaluation process. The CoSTeM comprises two branches: (1) a morphological
branch using a Mixture of Cross-Attentive Experts layer and a Temporal
Selection Block to select discriminative local structural features, and (2) a
morphokinetic branch employing a Temporal Transformer to model global
developmental trajectories, synergistically integrating static and dynamic
determinants for grading embryos. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
the superiority of our design. This work provides a valuable methodological
framework for AI-assisted embryo selection. The dataset and source code will be
publicly available upon acceptance.

### [377] [Robustness as Architecture: Designing IQA Models to Withstand Adversarial Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04951)
*Igor Meleshin,Anna Chistyakova,Anastasia Antsiferova,Dmitriy Vatolin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes designing robustness into Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models through architectural changes, rather than relying on data-driven defenses like adversarial training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional IQA models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, undermining trust. Current defenses focus on data-driven methods, but the paper questions if robustness should instead be designed into the model's architecture.

Method: The authors enforce orthogonal information flow and norm-preserving operations, then stabilize the system with pruning and fine-tuning.

Result: The redesigned IQA architecture resists adversarial attacks without adversarial training or major model changes.

Conclusion: The work advocates shifting from optimizing robustness through data to engineering it through design.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models are increasingly relied upon to
evaluate image quality in real-world systems -- from compression and
enhancement to generation and streaming. Yet their adoption brings a
fundamental risk: these models are inherently unstable. Adversarial
manipulations can easily fool them, inflating scores and undermining trust.
Traditionally, such vulnerabilities are addressed through data-driven defenses
-- adversarial retraining, regularization, or input purification. But what if
this is the wrong lens? What if robustness in perceptual models is not
something to learn but something to design? In this work, we propose a
provocative idea: robustness as an architectural prior. Rather than training
models to resist perturbations, we reshape their internal structure to suppress
sensitivity from the ground up. We achieve this by enforcing orthogonal
information flow, constraining the network to norm-preserving operations -- and
further stabilizing the system through pruning and fine-tuning. The result is a
robust IQA architecture that withstands adversarial attacks without requiring
adversarial training or significant changes to the original model. This
approach suggests a shift in perspective: from optimizing robustness through
data to engineering it through design.

*Hong Gao,Yiming Bao,Xuezhan Tu,Bin Zhong,Minling Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APVR is a training-free framework for hour-level video understanding, using hierarchical visual retrieval to overcome computational limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models struggle with long videos due to inefficiency and memory constraints.

Method: APVR uses Pivot Frame Retrieval and Pivot Token Retrieval for hierarchical, query-aware information extraction.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on LongVideoBench and VideoMME, surpassing both training-free and training-based methods.

Conclusion: APVR effectively handles long videos with semantic fidelity and integrates seamlessly with existing MLLM architectures.

Abstract: Current video-based multimodal large language models struggle with hour-level
video understanding due to computational constraints and inefficient
information extraction from extensive temporal sequences. We propose APVR
(Adaptive Pivot Visual information Retrieval), a training-free framework that
addresses the memory wall limitation through hierarchical visual information
retrieval. APVR operates via two complementary components: Pivot Frame
Retrieval employs semantic expansion and multi-modal confidence scoring to
identify semantically relevant video frames, while Pivot Token Retrieval
performs query-aware attention-driven token selection within the pivot frames.
This dual granularity approach enables processing of hour-long videos while
maintaining semantic fidelity. Experimental validation on LongVideoBench and
VideoMME demonstrates significant performance improvements, establishing
state-of-the-art results for not only training-free but also training-based
approaches while providing plug-and-play integration capability with existing
MLLM architectures.

*Huihan Wang,Zhiwen Yang,Hui Zhang,Dan Zhao,Bingzheng Wei,Yan Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FEAT is a Transformer model for dynamic medical video synthesis, addressing spatial-temporal-channel dependencies with efficient attention mechanisms and fine-grained guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Transformer models struggle with channel interactions, computational complexity, and coarse denoising, limiting dynamic medical video synthesis.

Method: FEAT introduces sequential spatial-temporal-channel attention, linear-complexity designs, and a residual value guidance module for fine-grained noise adaptation.

Result: FEAT-S matches or outperforms Endora with fewer parameters, while FEAT-L surpasses all baselines in performance and scalability.

Conclusion: FEAT offers an efficient, scalable solution for high-quality dynamic medical video synthesis, validated by benchmarks and downstream tasks.

Abstract: Synthesizing high-quality dynamic medical videos remains a significant
challenge due to the need for modeling both spatial consistency and temporal
dynamics. Existing Transformer-based approaches face critical limitations,
including insufficient channel interactions, high computational complexity from
self-attention, and coarse denoising guidance from timestep embeddings when
handling varying noise levels. In this work, we propose FEAT, a
full-dimensional efficient attention Transformer, which addresses these issues
through three key innovations: (1) a unified paradigm with sequential
spatial-temporal-channel attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies
across all dimensions, (2) a linear-complexity design for attention mechanisms
in each dimension, utilizing weighted key-value attention and global channel
attention, and (3) a residual value guidance module that provides fine-grained
pixel-level guidance to adapt to different noise levels. We evaluate FEAT on
standard benchmarks and downstream tasks, demonstrating that FEAT-S, with only
23\% of the parameters of the state-of-the-art model Endora, achieves
comparable or even superior performance. Furthermore, FEAT-L surpasses all
comparison methods across multiple datasets, showcasing both superior
effectiveness and scalability. Code is available at

### [380] [Bringing SAM to new heights: Leveraging elevation data for tree crown segmentation from drone imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04970)
*Mélisande Teng,Arthur Ouaknine,Etienne Laliberté,Yoshua Bengio,David Rolnick,Hugo Larochelle*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using SAM and DSM data for tree crown segmentation in drone imagery, comparing methods across boreal, temperate, and tropical forests. BalSAM, integrating SAM and DSM, shows promise, though out-of-the-box SAM underperforms Mask R-CNN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional tree monitoring is costly and labor-intensive. Drone imagery and computer vision, especially SAM, offer scalable solutions with limited labeled data.

Method: Comparison of SAM-based methods for tree crown segmentation in three forest types, integrating DSM data. Introduces BalSAM, combining SAM and DSM.

Result: BalSAM shows potential, especially in plantations. Out-of-the-box SAM underperforms Mask R-CNN, but tuning SAM and using DSM are promising.

Conclusion: Efficient SAM tuning and DSM integration are key for improving tree crown segmentation, with BalSAM as a promising approach.

Abstract: Information on trees at the individual level is crucial for monitoring forest
ecosystems and planning forest management. Current monitoring methods involve
ground measurements, requiring extensive cost, time and labor. Advances in
drone remote sensing and computer vision offer great potential for mapping
individual trees from aerial imagery at broad-scale. Large pre-trained vision
models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), represent a particularly
compelling choice given limited labeled data. In this work, we compare methods
leveraging SAM for the task of automatic tree crown instance segmentation in
high resolution drone imagery in three use cases: 1) boreal plantations, 2)
temperate forests and 3) tropical forests. We also study the integration of
elevation data into models, in the form of Digital Surface Model (DSM)
information, which can readily be obtained at no additional cost from RGB drone
imagery. We present BalSAM, a model leveraging SAM and DSM information, which
shows potential over other methods, particularly in the context of plantations.
We find that methods using SAM out-of-the-box do not outperform a custom Mask
R-CNN, even with well-designed prompts. However, efficiently tuning SAM
end-to-end and integrating DSM information are both promising avenues for tree
crown instance segmentation models.

*Yangyang Zhong,Ji Qi,Yuan Yao,Pengxin Luo,Yunfeng Yan,Donglian Qi,Zhiyuan Liu,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TextVidBench, a benchmark for long-video text question answering, addressing limitations of existing datasets. It features cross-domain videos, a three-stage evaluation framework, and high-quality annotations. The proposed method enhances temporal perception and handles long sequences, showing promising results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for Text-Visual Question Answering (ViteVQA) have limited video duration and narrow evaluation scopes, failing to assess multimodal large language models (MLLMs) adequately.

Method: The paper proposes TextVidBench with cross-domain long-video coverage, a three-stage evaluation framework, and fine-grained annotations. It introduces IT-Rope, temporal prompt engineering, non-uniform positional encoding, and lightweight fine-tuning.

Result: TextVidBench challenges existing models, and the proposed method improves long-video text understanding, validated by experiments on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: TextVidBench addresses gaps in long-video evaluation, and the proposed method offers insights for enhancing MLLMs' capabilities in this domain.

Abstract: Despite recent progress on the short-video Text-Visual Question Answering
(ViteVQA) task - largely driven by benchmarks such as M4-ViteVQA - existing
datasets still suffer from limited video duration and narrow evaluation scopes,
making it difficult to adequately assess the growing capabilities of powerful
multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To address these limitations, we
introduce TextVidBench, the first benchmark specifically designed for
long-video text question answering (>3 minutes). TextVidBench makes three key
contributions: 1) Cross-domain long-video coverage: Spanning 9 categories
(e.g., news, sports, gaming), with an average video length of 2306 seconds,
enabling more realistic evaluation of long-video understanding. 2) A
three-stage evaluation framework: "Text Needle-in-Haystack -> Temporal
Grounding -> Text Dynamics Captioning". 3) High-quality fine-grained
annotations: Containing over 5,000 question-answer pairs with detailed semantic
labeling. Furthermore, we propose an efficient paradigm for improving large
models through: (i) introducing the IT-Rope mechanism and temporal prompt
engineering to enhance temporal perception, (ii) adopting non-uniform
positional encoding to better handle long video sequences, and (iii) applying
lightweight fine-tuning on video-text data. Extensive experiments on multiple
public datasets as well as TextVidBench demonstrate that our new benchmark
presents significant challenges to existing models, while our proposed method
offers valuable insights into improving long-video scene text understanding
capabilities.

### [382] [Multi-scale Image Super Resolution with a Single Auto-Regressive Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04990)
*Enrique Sanchez,Isma Hadji,Adrian Bulat,Christos Tzelepis,Brais Martinez,Georgios Tzimiropoulos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach to Image Super Resolution (ISR) using Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) modeling, addressing limitations of existing methods like fixed resolution and large model size. It proposes Hierarchical Image Tokenization and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to achieve state-of-the-art results with a smaller model and no external data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VAR-based ISR methods like VARSR have limitations, including fixed resolution and reliance on large models and datasets. The paper aims to overcome these by improving scalability and efficiency.

Method: The method combines Hierarchical Image Tokenization (for multi-scale representation) and DPO (for preference-based optimization) to enable super-resolution in a single forward pass with a smaller model.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art ISR results, outperforming VARSR with a 300M parameter model and no external data. It also enables super-resolution at multiple scales in one pass.

Conclusion: The proposed components—Hierarchical Image Tokenization and DPO—effectively address VARSR's limitations, offering a scalable and efficient solution for ISR with superior performance.

Abstract: In this paper we tackle Image Super Resolution (ISR), using recent advances
in Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) modeling. VAR iteratively estimates the
residual in latent space between gradually increasing image scales, a process
referred to as next-scale prediction. Thus, the strong priors learned during
pre-training align well with the downstream task (ISR). To our knowledge, only
VARSR has exploited this synergy so far, showing promising results. However,
due to the limitations of existing residual quantizers, VARSR works only at a
fixed resolution, i.e. it fails to map intermediate outputs to the
corresponding image scales. Additionally, it relies on a 1B transformer
architecture (VAR-d24), and leverages a large-scale private dataset to achieve
state-of-the-art results. We address these limitations through two novel
components: a) a Hierarchical Image Tokenization approach with a multi-scale
image tokenizer that progressively represents images at different scales while
simultaneously enforcing token overlap across scales, and b) a Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) regularization term that, relying solely on the
LR and HR tokenizations, encourages the transformer to produce the latter over
the former. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a quantizer is
trained to force semantically consistent residuals at different scales, and the
first time that preference-based optimization is used to train a VAR. Using
these two components, our model can denoise the LR image and super-resolve at
half and full target upscale factors in a single forward pass. Additionally, we
achieve \textit{state-of-the-art results on ISR}, while using a small model
(300M params vs ~1B params of VARSR), and without using external training data.

*Edoardo Bianchi,Antonio Liotta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PATS is a novel video sampling method for sports skill assessment, preserving temporal continuity and outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video sampling disrupts temporal continuity, hindering accurate skill assessment.

Method: PATS adaptively segments videos to ensure full execution of critical movements, repeating across segments for comprehensive coverage.

Result: PATS outperforms state-of-the-art methods (+0.65% to +3.05%) and excels in challenging domains (+26.22% bouldering).

Conclusion: PATS is an effective adaptive approach for automated skill assessment in diverse activities.

Abstract: Automated sports skill assessment requires capturing fundamental movement
patterns that distinguish expert from novice performance, yet current video
sampling methods disrupt the temporal continuity essential for proficiency
evaluation. To this end, we introduce Proficiency-Aware Temporal Sampling
(PATS), a novel sampling strategy that preserves complete fundamental movements
within continuous temporal segments for multi-view skill assessment. PATS
adaptively segments videos to ensure each analyzed portion contains full
execution of critical performance components, repeating this process across
multiple segments to maximize information coverage while maintaining temporal
coherence. Evaluated on the EgoExo4D benchmark with SkillFormer, PATS surpasses
the state-of-the-art accuracy across all viewing configurations (+0.65% to
+3.05%) and delivers substantial gains in challenging domains (+26.22%
bouldering, +2.39% music, +1.13% basketball). Systematic analysis reveals that
PATS successfully adapts to diverse activity characteristics-from
high-frequency sampling for dynamic sports to fine-grained segmentation for
sequential skills-demonstrating its effectiveness as an adaptive approach to
temporal sampling that advances automated skill assessment for real-world
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CSTR-CLIP, a model for Chinese scene text retrieval, and a new benchmark (DL-CSVTR) to evaluate diverse text layouts. It outperforms existing methods by 18.82% in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for Chinese scene text retrieval, derived from English solutions, perform poorly due to complex layouts. A specialized approach is needed.

Method: Proposes CSTR-CLIP, integrating global visual info with multi-granularity alignment training in a two-stage process.

Result: CSTR-CLIP achieves 18.82% higher accuracy than previous models and faster inference.

Conclusion: CSTR-CLIP effectively handles diverse Chinese text layouts, with the dataset and code made public for further research.

Abstract: Chinese scene text retrieval is a practical task that aims to search for
images containing visual instances of a Chinese query text. This task is
extremely challenging because Chinese text often features complex and diverse
layouts in real-world scenes. Current efforts tend to inherit the solution for
English scene text retrieval, failing to achieve satisfactory performance. In
this paper, we establish a Diversified Layout benchmark for Chinese Street View
Text Retrieval (DL-CSVTR), which is specifically designed to evaluate retrieval
performance across various text layouts, including vertical, cross-line, and
partial alignments. To address the limitations in existing methods, we propose
Chinese Scene Text Retrieval CLIP (CSTR-CLIP), a novel model that integrates
global visual information with multi-granularity alignment training. CSTR-CLIP
applies a two-stage training process to overcome previous limitations, such as
the exclusion of visual features outside the text region and reliance on
single-granularity alignment, thereby enabling the model to effectively handle
diverse text layouts. Experiments on existing benchmark show that CSTR-CLIP
outperforms the previous state-of-the-art model by 18.82% accuracy and also
provides faster inference speed. Further analysis on DL-CSVTR confirms the
superior performance of CSTR-CLIP in handling various text layouts. The dataset
and code will be publicly available to facilitate research in Chinese scene
text retrieval.

TL;DR: The paper discusses advancements in monocular depth estimation using deep learning, highlighting challenges in generalization to unseen domains and recent methods like Depth Anything for zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve monocular depth estimation by leveraging deep learning and addressing the challenge of generalizing to unseen domains.

Method: Utilizes deep learning techniques, including multi-scale fusion networks, classification reinterpretation, additional priors, and affine-invariant loss for multi-dataset training.

Result: Depth Anything shows leading performance in zero-shot monocular depth estimation, excelling in structural detail extraction despite metric depth limitations.

Conclusion: While progress has been made, accurate metric depth estimation remains a challenge, with Depth Anything emerging as a strong solution for structural detail in unseen domains.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation aims to determine the depth of each pixel from an
RGB image captured by a monocular camera. The development of deep learning has
significantly advanced this field by facilitating the learning of depth
features from some well-annotated datasets
\cite{Geiger_Lenz_Stiller_Urtasun_2013,silberman2012indoor}. Eigen \textit{et
al.} \cite{eigen2014depth} first introduce a multi-scale fusion network for
depth regression. Following this, subsequent improvements have come from
reinterpreting the regression task as a classification problem
\cite{bhat2021adabins,Li_Wang_Liu_Jiang_2022}, incorporating additional priors
\cite{shao2023nddepth,yang2023gedepth}, and developing more effective objective
function \cite{xian2020structure,Yin_Liu_Shen_Yan_2019}. Despite these
advances, generalizing to unseen domains remains a challenge. Recently, several
methods have employed affine-invariant loss to enable multi-dataset joint
training \cite{MiDaS,ZeroDepth,guizilini2023towards,Dany}. Among them, Depth
Anything \cite{Dany} has shown leading performance in zero-shot monocular depth
estimation. While it struggles to estimate accurate metric depth due to the
lack of explicit depth cues, it excels at extracting structural information
from unseen images, producing structure-detailed monocular depth.

TL;DR: A novel pipeline generates synthetic 3D point cloud data using 3D Gaussian Splatting and Gaussian Opacity Fields, enabling cost-effective training of segmentation models without real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world point cloud annotation is costly and labor-intensive, necessitating a synthetic data solution.

Method: Leverages 3DGS and GOF to create 3D assets, simulates environments with LiDAR, and trains models like PointNet++, PTv3, and OACNN on synthetic data.

Result: PTv3 achieved 91.35% mIoU without real data, sometimes outperforming models trained on real data. Models generalized well to unseen classes.

Conclusion: Synthetic data can effectively replace or even surpass real-world data for training 3D segmentation models.

Abstract: Training neural networks for tasks such as 3D point cloud semantic
segmentation demands extensive datasets, yet obtaining and annotating
real-world point clouds is costly and labor-intensive. This work aims to
introduce a novel pipeline for generating realistic synthetic data, by
leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Gaussian Opacity Fields (GOF) to
generate 3D assets of multiple different agricultural vehicles instead of using
generic models. These assets are placed in a simulated environment, where the
point clouds are generated using a simulated LiDAR. This is a flexible approach
that allows changing the LiDAR specifications without incurring additional
costs. We evaluated the impact of synthetic data on segmentation models such as
PointNet++, Point Transformer V3, and OACNN, by training and validating the
models only on synthetic data. Remarkably, the PTv3 model had an mIoU of
91.35\%, a noteworthy result given that the model had neither been trained nor
validated on any real data. Further studies even suggested that in certain
scenarios the models trained only on synthetically generated data performed
better than models trained on real-world data. Finally, experiments
demonstrated that the models can generalize across semantic classes, enabling
accurate predictions on mesh models they were never trained on.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UAV4D is a framework for photorealistic rendering of dynamic UAV-captured scenes, addressing challenges like monocular setups and multiple small moving humans. It combines 3D foundation and human mesh models, resolves scale ambiguity, and uses Gaussian splats for rendering, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dynamic neural rendering methods struggle with UAV-captured scenarios, especially monocular setups and multiple small moving humans, which are underrepresented in datasets.

Method: Uses a 3D foundation model and human mesh reconstruction, resolves scene scale ambiguity via human-scene contact points, and initializes Gaussian splats with SMPL and background mesh.

Result: Achieves 1.5 dB PSNR improvement and superior visual sharpness on UAV datasets (VisDrone, Manipal-UAV, Okutama-Action).

Conclusion: UAV4D effectively addresses UAV-specific challenges, enabling high-quality dynamic scene rendering from monocular video.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in dynamic neural rendering, existing
methods fail to address the unique challenges posed by UAV-captured scenarios,
particularly those involving monocular camera setups, top-down perspective, and
multiple small, moving humans, which are not adequately represented in existing
datasets. In this work, we introduce UAV4D, a framework for enabling
photorealistic rendering for dynamic real-world scenes captured by UAVs.
Specifically, we address the challenge of reconstructing dynamic scenes with
multiple moving pedestrians from monocular video data without the need for
additional sensors. We use a combination of a 3D foundation model and a human
mesh reconstruction model to reconstruct both the scene background and humans.
We propose a novel approach to resolve the scene scale ambiguity and place both
humans and the scene in world coordinates by identifying human-scene contact
points. Additionally, we exploit the SMPL model and background mesh to
initialize Gaussian splats, enabling holistic scene rendering. We evaluated our
method on three complex UAV-captured datasets: VisDrone, Manipal-UAV, and
Okutama-Action, each with distinct characteristics and 10~50 humans. Our
results demonstrate the benefits of our approach over existing methods in novel
view synthesis, achieving a 1.5 dB PSNR improvement and superior visual
sharpness.

TL;DR: A novel physical annotation system captures human expertise for ML training in optical inspection, using tracked pointers and a projector interface for intuitive, accurate labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between human expertise and automated data generation for ML training, especially for non-IT experts in optical inspection.

Method: Uses calibrated, tracked pointers and a projector-based interface to capture physical trajectories and contours, converting them into standardized annotations.

Result: Preliminary results confirm feasibility, with integration into CVAT streamlining ML workflows.

Conclusion: The system enhances ML data generation for optical inspection, offering intuitive, accurate annotation and preserving valuable expertise.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel physical annotation system designed to generate
training data for automated optical inspection. The system uses pointer-based
in-situ interaction to transfer the valuable expertise of trained inspection
personnel directly into a machine learning (ML) training pipeline. Unlike
conventional screen-based annotation methods, our system captures physical
trajectories and contours directly on the object, providing a more intuitive
and efficient way to label data. The core technology uses calibrated, tracked
pointers to accurately record user input and transform these spatial
interactions into standardised annotation formats that are compatible with
open-source annotation software. Additionally, a simple projector-based
interface projects visual guidance onto the object to assist users during the
annotation process, ensuring greater accuracy and consistency. The proposed
concept bridges the gap between human expertise and automated data generation,
enabling non-IT experts to contribute to the ML training pipeline and
preventing the loss of valuable training samples. Preliminary evaluation
results confirm the feasibility of capturing detailed annotation trajectories
and demonstrate that integration with CVAT streamlines the workflow for
subsequent ML tasks. This paper details the system architecture, calibration
procedures and interface design, and discusses its potential contribution to
future ML data generation for automated optical inspection.

TL;DR: FlowDirector is an inversion-free video editing framework using ODEs and attention-guided masking for coherent, localized edits, outperforming inversion-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing temporal inconsistencies and structural fidelity loss in inversion-based text-driven video editing methods.

Method: Proposes FlowDirector, modeling edits as ODE-guided evolution in data space with attention-guided masking and guidance-enhanced editing for semantic alignment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in instruction adherence, temporal consistency, and background preservation.

Conclusion: FlowDirector establishes a new paradigm for efficient, coherent video editing without inversion.

Abstract: Text-driven video editing aims to modify video content according to natural
language instructions. While recent training-free approaches have made progress
by leveraging pre-trained diffusion models, they typically rely on
inversion-based techniques that map input videos into the latent space, which
often leads to temporal inconsistencies and degraded structural fidelity. To
address this, we propose FlowDirector, a novel inversion-free video editing
framework. Our framework models the editing process as a direct evolution in
data space, guiding the video via an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) to
smoothly transition along its inherent spatiotemporal manifold, thereby
preserving temporal coherence and structural details. To achieve localized and
controllable edits, we introduce an attention-guided masking mechanism that
modulates the ODE velocity field, preserving non-target regions both spatially
and temporally. Furthermore, to address incomplete edits and enhance semantic
alignment with editing instructions, we present a guidance-enhanced editing
strategy inspired by Classifier-Free Guidance, which leverages differential
signals between multiple candidate flows to steer the editing trajectory toward
stronger semantic alignment without compromising structural consistency.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks demonstrate that FlowDirector achieves
state-of-the-art performance in instruction adherence, temporal consistency,
and background preservation, establishing a new paradigm for efficient and
coherent video editing without inversion.

advancements in OCR and NLP, Vietnamese text recognition faces unique
challenges due to its complex diacritics, tonal variations, and lack of
large-scale annotated datasets. Traditional OCR methods often struggle with
real-world document variations, while deep learning approaches have shown
promise but remain limited by data scarcity and generalization issues.
Recently, large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models have
demonstrated remarkable improvements in text recognition and document
understanding, offering a new direction for Vietnamese DAR. However, challenges
such as domain adaptation, multimodal learning, and computational efficiency
persist. This survey provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques in
Vietnamese document recognition, highlights key limitations, and explores how
LLMs can revolutionize the field. We discuss future research directions,
including dataset development, model optimization, and the integration of
multimodal approaches for improved document intelligence. By addressing these
gaps, we aim to foster advancements in Vietnamese DAR and encourage
community-driven solutions.

*Peng Wang,Yichun Shi,Xiaochen Lian,Zhonghua Zhai,Xin Xia,Xuefeng Xiao,Weilin Huang,Jianchao Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeedEdit 3.0 improves real image editing by enhancing edit instruction following and content preservation, with key upgrades in data curation, joint learning, and outperforming benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance real image editing by improving instruction adherence and content preservation, leveraging T2I models and scalable data curation.

Method: Enhanced data curation with meta-info embedding, joint learning pipeline combining diffusion and reward losses, and evaluation on real image benchmarks.

Result: Achieves a 56.1% usability rate, outperforming SeedEdit 1.6 (38.4%), GPT4o (37.1%), and Gemini 2.0 (30.3%).

Conclusion: SeedEdit 3.0 sets a new standard for real image editing with scalable data and improved performance.

Abstract: We introduce SeedEdit 3.0, in companion with our T2I model Seedream 3.0 [22],
which significantly improves over our previous version [27] in both aspects of
edit instruction following and image content (e.g., ID/IP) preservation on real
image inputs. Additional to model upgrading with T2I, in this report, we
present several key improvements. First, we develop an enhanced data curation
pipeline with a meta-info paradigm and meta-info embedding strategy that help
mix images from multiple data sources. This allows us to scale editing data
effectively, and meta information is helpfult to connect VLM with diffusion
model more closely. Second, we introduce a joint learning pipeline for
computing a diffusion loss and a reward loss. Finally, we evaluate SeedEdit 3.0
on our testing benchmarks, for real image editing, where it achieves a best
trade-off between multiple aspects, yielding a high usability rate of 56.1%,
compared to SeedEdit 1.6 (38.4%), GPT4o (37.1%) and Gemini 2.0 (30.3%).

### [392] [Interpretable Multimodal Framework for Human-Centered Street Assessment: Integrating Visual-Language Models for Perceptual Urban Diagnostics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05087)
*HaoTian Lan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Multimodal Street Evaluation Framework (MSEF) combining vision and language models to assess streetscapes, achieving high accuracy and alignment with resident perceptions while revealing nuanced urban insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current objective street metrics fail to capture subjective perceptions crucial for inclusive urban design, necessitating a more interpretable and comprehensive framework.

Method: The study uses a fusion of a vision transformer (VisualGLM-6B) and a large language model (GPT-4), fine-tuned with LoRA and P-Tuning v2 on 15,000 annotated street-view images from Harbin, China.

Result: MSEF achieves an F1 score of 0.84 on objective features and 89.3% agreement with resident perceptions, uncovering context-dependent contradictions and nonlinear patterns in urban perception.

Conclusion: The framework bridges sensory data and socio-affective inference, offering methodological innovation and practical utility for urban planning aligned with SDG 11.

Abstract: While objective street metrics derived from imagery or GIS have become
standard in urban analytics, they remain insufficient to capture subjective
perceptions essential to inclusive urban design. This study introduces a novel
Multimodal Street Evaluation Framework (MSEF) that fuses a vision transformer
(VisualGLM-6B) with a large language model (GPT-4), enabling interpretable
dual-output assessment of streetscapes. Leveraging over 15,000 annotated
street-view images from Harbin, China, we fine-tune the framework using LoRA
and P-Tuning v2 for parameter-efficient adaptation. The model achieves an F1
score of 0.84 on objective features and 89.3 percent agreement with aggregated
resident perceptions, validated across stratified socioeconomic geographies.
Beyond classification accuracy, MSEF captures context-dependent contradictions:
for instance, informal commerce boosts perceived vibrancy while simultaneously
reducing pedestrian comfort. It also identifies nonlinear and semantically
contingent patterns -- such as the divergent perceptual effects of
architectural transparency across residential and commercial zones -- revealing
the limits of universal spatial heuristics. By generating natural-language
rationales grounded in attention mechanisms, the framework bridges sensory data
with socio-affective inference, enabling transparent diagnostics aligned with
SDG 11. This work offers both methodological innovation in urban perception
modeling and practical utility for planning systems seeking to reconcile
infrastructural precision with lived experience.

### [394] [Astraea: A GPU-Oriented Token-wise Acceleration Framework for Video Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05096)
*Haosong Liu,Yuge Cheng,Zihan Liu,Aiyue Chen,Yiwu Yao,Chen Chen,Jingwen Leng,Yu Feng,Minyi Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASTRAEA is an automatic framework for optimizing video diffusion transformers (vDiTs) by reducing computational demands while maintaining video quality. It achieves up to 2.4x speedup on a single GPU and 13.2x on 8 GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational demands of vDiTs limit practical deployment, and existing acceleration methods rely on heuristics, restricting their applicability.

Method: ASTRAEA introduces a lightweight token selection mechanism, a GPU-parallel sparse attention strategy, and an evolutionary algorithm to optimize token reduction.

Result: Achieves up to 2.4x speedup on a single GPU (13.2x on 8 GPUs) with minimal quality loss (<0.5% on VBench score).

Conclusion: ASTRAEA effectively balances speed and quality, making vDiTs more practical for deployment.

Abstract: Video diffusion transformers (vDiTs) have made impressive progress in
text-to-video generation, but their high computational demands present major
challenges for practical deployment. While existing acceleration methods reduce
workload at various granularities, they often rely on heuristics, limiting
their applicability.
  We introduce ASTRAEA, an automatic framework that searches for near-optimal
configurations for vDiT-based video generation. At its core, ASTRAEA proposes a
lightweight token selection mechanism and a memory-efficient, GPU-parallel
sparse attention strategy, enabling linear reductions in execution time with
minimal impact on generation quality. To determine optimal token reduction for
different timesteps, we further design a search framework that leverages a
classic evolutionary algorithm to automatically determine the distribution of
the token budget effectively. Together, ASTRAEA achieves up to 2.4x inference
speedup on a single GPU with great scalability (up to 13.2x speedup on 8 GPUs)
while retaining better video quality compared to the state-of-the-art methods
(<0.5% loss on the VBench score compared to the baseline vDiT models).

*Revant Teotia,Candace Ross,Karen Ullrich,Sumit Chopra,Adriana Romero-Soriano,Melissa Hall,Matthew J. Muckley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DIM-CIM, a framework to measure diversity and generalization in text-to-image models without needing reference datasets, and applies it to analyze model performance and training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for evaluating text-to-image model diversity either rely on reference datasets or lack specificity, limiting adaptability and interpretability.

Method: The authors propose the DIM-CIM framework, which measures default-mode diversity and generalization capacity, and create the COCO-DIMCIM benchmark using COCO concepts and LLM-augmented captions.

Result: Scaling models from 1.5B to 8.1B parameters improves generalization but reduces default-mode diversity. DIM-CIM identifies fine-grained failure cases and shows a 0.85 correlation between training data diversity and model diversity.

Conclusion: DIM-CIM offers a flexible, interpretable way to assess text-to-image model diversity and generalization, enhancing understanding of model performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models have achieved impressive
quality and consistency. However, this has come at the cost of representation
diversity. While automatic evaluation methods exist for benchmarking model
diversity, they either require reference image datasets or lack specificity
about the kind of diversity measured, limiting their adaptability and
interpretability. To address this gap, we introduce the Does-it/Can-it
framework, DIM-CIM, a reference-free measurement of default-mode diversity
("Does" the model generate images with expected attributes?) and generalization
capacity ("Can" the model generate diverse attributes for a particular
concept?). We construct the COCO-DIMCIM benchmark, which is seeded with COCO
concepts and captions and augmented by a large language model. With
COCO-DIMCIM, we find that widely-used models improve in generalization at the
cost of default-mode diversity when scaling from 1.5B to 8.1B parameters.
DIMCIM also identifies fine-grained failure cases, such as attributes that are
generated with generic prompts but are rarely generated when explicitly
requested. Finally, we use DIMCIM to evaluate the training data of a T2I model
and observe a correlation of 0.85 between diversity in training images and
default-mode diversity. Our work provides a flexible and interpretable
framework for assessing T2I model diversity and generalization, enabling a more
comprehensive understanding of model performance.

### [396] [Practical Manipulation Model for Robust Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05119)
*Benedikt Hopf,Radu Timofte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Practical Manipulation Model (PMM) to improve deepfake detection under non-ideal conditions, enhancing robustness and performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake detectors perform poorly under non-ideal conditions, making them easy to circumvent. The paper aims to address this instability.

Method: The authors develop PMM, expanding forgery possibilities with Poisson blending, diverse masks, generator artifacts, and distractors. They also add strong degradations to training images.

Result: PMM improves robustness and performance, showing AUC increases of 3.51% and 6.21% on DFDC and DFDCP datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates PMM's effectiveness in enhancing deepfake detection robustness and highlights previous detectors' lack of stability.

Abstract: Modern deepfake detection models have achieved strong performance even on the
challenging cross-dataset task. However, detection performance under non-ideal
conditions remains very unstable, limiting success on some benchmark datasets
and making it easy to circumvent detection. Inspired by the move to a more
real-world degradation model in the area of image super-resolution, we have
developed a Practical Manipulation Model (PMM) that covers a larger set of
possible forgeries. We extend the space of pseudo-fakes by using Poisson
blending, more diverse masks, generator artifacts, and distractors.
Additionally, we improve the detectors' generality and robustness by adding
strong degradations to the training images. We demonstrate that these changes
not only significantly enhance the model's robustness to common image
degradations but also improve performance on standard benchmark datasets.
Specifically, we show clear increases of $3.51\%$ and $6.21\%$ AUC on the DFDC
and DFDCP datasets, respectively, over the s-o-t-a LAA backbone. Furthermore,
we highlight the lack of robustness in previous detectors and our improvements
in this regard. Code can be found at https://github.com/BenediktHopf/PMM

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CIVET framework evaluates VLMs' understanding of object properties and relations, revealing limitations in accuracy, positional bias, and relational comprehension compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically assess VLMs' scene comprehension, addressing gaps in standardized evaluation and uncontrolled biases.

Method: Introduces CIVET, a controlled framework for evaluating VLMs using noise-free stimuli, testing five state-of-the-art models.

Result: VLMs recognize limited basic properties, show positional bias, and struggle with object relations, lagging behind human accuracy.

Conclusion: Current VLMs lack robust scene understanding, highlighting the need for improved models and evaluation methods.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved competitive performance in
various tasks, their comprehension of the underlying structure and semantics of
a scene remains understudied. To investigate the understanding of VLMs, we
study their capability regarding object properties and relations in a
controlled and interpretable manner. To this scope, we introduce CIVET, a novel
and extensible framework for systematiC evaluatIon Via controllEd sTimuli.
CIVET addresses the lack of standardized systematic evaluation for assessing
VLMs' understanding, enabling researchers to test hypotheses with statistical
rigor. With CIVET, we evaluate five state-of-the-art VLMs on exhaustive sets of
stimuli, free from annotation noise, dataset-specific biases, and uncontrolled
scene complexity. Our findings reveal that 1) current VLMs can accurately
recognize only a limited set of basic object properties; 2) their performance
heavily depends on the position of the object in the scene; 3) they struggle to
understand basic relations among objects. Furthermore, a comparative evaluation
with human annotators reveals that VLMs still fall short of achieving
human-level accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RGB cameras struggle with fast-moving drones, especially in poor lighting. Event cameras offer high temporal resolution, but current datasets lack fine temporal detail and drone-specific motion.

Method: The authors created FRED, featuring 7+ hours of annotated drone trajectories from 5 drone models, including challenging conditions like rain and adverse lighting.

Result: FRED provides dense annotations, evaluation protocols, and standard metrics for reproducible benchmarking.

Conclusion: FRED aims to advance research in high-speed drone perception and multimodal spatiotemporal understanding.

Abstract: Small, fast, and lightweight drones present significant challenges for
traditional RGB cameras due to their limitations in capturing fast-moving
objects, especially under challenging lighting conditions. Event cameras offer
an ideal solution, providing high temporal definition and dynamic range, yet
existing benchmarks often lack fine temporal resolution or drone-specific
motion patterns, hindering progress in these areas. This paper introduces the
Florence RGB-Event Drone dataset (FRED), a novel multimodal dataset
specifically designed for drone detection, tracking, and trajectory
forecasting, combining RGB video and event streams. FRED features more than 7
hours of densely annotated drone trajectories, using 5 different drone models
and including challenging scenarios such as rain and adverse lighting
conditions. We provide detailed evaluation protocols and standard metrics for
each task, facilitating reproducible benchmarking. The authors hope FRED will
advance research in high-speed drone perception and multimodal spatiotemporal
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a non-neural network approach for through-the-wall radar human activity recognition, focusing on physical interpretability and template matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The author aims to revisit traditional methods with strong physical interpretability, moving away from neural networks, to achieve intelligent recognition.

Method: Generates range-time and Doppler-time maps, uses corner detection and multiphase active contour for segmentation, discretizes features into point clouds, and calculates topological similarity using the Mapper algorithm.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness through numerical simulations and measured experiments.

Conclusion: The method successfully achieves recognition without neural networks, emphasizing physical interpretability and theoretical signal processing.

Abstract: After a few years of research in the field of through-the-wall radar (TWR)
human activity recognition (HAR), I found that we seem to be stuck in the
mindset of training on radar image data through neural network models. The
earliest related works in this field based on template matching did not require
a training process, and I believe they have never died. Because these methods
possess a strong physical interpretability and are closer to the basis of
theoretical signal processing research. In this paper, I would like to try to
return to the original path by attempting to eschew neural networks to achieve
the TWR HAR task and challenge to achieve intelligent recognition as neural
network models. In detail, the range-time map and Doppler-time map of TWR are
first generated. Then, the initial regions of the human target foreground and
noise background on the maps are determined using corner detection method, and
the micro-Doppler signature is segmented using the multiphase active contour
model. The micro-Doppler segmentation feature is discretized into a
two-dimensional point cloud. Finally, the topological similarity between the
resulting point cloud and the point clouds of the template data is calculated
using Mapper algorithm to obtain the recognition results. The effectiveness of
the proposed method is demonstrated by numerical simulated and measured
experiments. The open-source code of this work is released at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAO introduces a granular video anomaly detection framework integrating fine-grained anomalous object detection into a unified pipeline, improving precision without threshold tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VAD methods lack finer-grained analysis (e.g., anomalous pixels), limiting anomaly detection capabilities.

Method: TAO transforms anomaly detection into pixel-level tracking of anomalous objects, linking scores to segmentation and tracking tasks.

Result: TAO achieves superior accuracy and robustness, setting new benchmarks in VAD.

Conclusion: TAO advances VAD by unifying fine-grained anomaly detection, offering precise localization in complex videos.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial in scenarios such as surveillance
and autonomous driving, where timely detection of unexpected activities is
essential. Although existing methods have primarily focused on detecting
anomalous objects in videos -- either by identifying anomalous frames or
objects -- they often neglect finer-grained analysis, such as anomalous pixels,
which limits their ability to capture a broader range of anomalies. To address
this challenge, we propose a new framework called Track Any Anomalous Object
(TAO), which introduces a granular video anomaly detection pipeline that, for
the first time, integrates the detection of multiple fine-grained anomalous
objects into a unified framework. Unlike methods that assign anomaly scores to
every pixel, our approach transforms the problem into pixel-level tracking of
anomalous objects. By linking anomaly scores to downstream tasks such as
segmentation and tracking, our method removes the need for threshold tuning and
achieves more precise anomaly localization in long and complex video sequences.
Experiments demonstrate that TAO sets new benchmarks in accuracy and
robustness. Project page available online.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAPFM introduces a method for adapting pathology foundation models (PFMs) to clinical tasks using vision transformer attention for MIL aggregation, optimizing feature representations and attention weights, and outperforms benchmarks in mutation prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting pretrained PFMs for clinical tasks is challenging due to weak WSI-level labels and the need for MIL, requiring stable training dynamics.

Method: TAPFM uses vision transformer attention for MIL aggregation, maintaining separate computational graphs for the MIL aggregator and PFM to ensure stable training.

Result: TAPFM outperforms conventional methods in mutation prediction tasks for bladder cancer and lung adenocarcinoma, handling multi-label classification effectively.

Conclusion: TAPFM enables practical adaptation of PFMs on standard hardware for diverse clinical applications.

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
analyzing whole slide images (WSIs). However, adapting these pretrained PFMs
for specific clinical tasks presents considerable challenges, primarily due to
the availability of only weak (WSI-level) labels for gigapixel images,
necessitating multiple instance learning (MIL) paradigm for effective WSI
analysis. This paper proposes a novel approach for single-GPU \textbf{T}ask
\textbf{A}daptation of \textbf{PFM}s (TAPFM) that uses vision transformer
(\vit) attention for MIL aggregation while optimizing both for feature
representations and attention weights. The proposed approach maintains separate
computational graphs for MIL aggregator and the PFM to create stable training
dynamics that align with downstream task objectives during end-to-end
adaptation. Evaluated on mutation prediction tasks for bladder cancer and lung
adenocarcinoma across institutional and TCGA cohorts, TAPFM consistently
outperforms conventional approaches, with H-Optimus-0 (TAPFM) outperforming the
benchmarks. TAPFM effectively handles multi-label classification of actionable
mutations as well. Thus, TAPFM makes adaptation of powerful pre-trained PFMs
practical on standard hardware for various clinical applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies a limitation in current multimodal fine-tuning methods, proposes MokA for efficient adaptation, and demonstrates its effectiveness across various scenarios and backbones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods, borrowed from LLMs, neglect multimodal differences, hindering full modality utilization.

Method: Proposes MokA, a multimodal-aware fine-tuning strategy with modality-specific parameters and enhanced cross-modal interaction.

Result: Consistent improvements in audio-visual-text, visual-text, and speech-text scenarios across multiple LLM backbones.

Conclusion: MokA offers a targeted solution for efficient MLLM adaptation, enabling further exploration.

Abstract: In this paper, we reveal that most current efficient multimodal fine-tuning
methods are hindered by a key limitation: they are directly borrowed from LLMs,
often neglecting the intrinsic differences of multimodal scenarios and even
affecting the full utilization of all modalities. Inspired by our empirical
observation, we argue that unimodal adaptation and cross-modal adaptation are
two essential parts for the effective fine-tuning of MLLMs. From this
perspective, we propose Multimodal low-rank Adaptation (MokA), a
multimodal-aware efficient fine-tuning strategy that takes multimodal
characteristics into consideration. It compresses unimodal information by
modality-specific parameters while explicitly enhancing cross-modal
interaction, ensuring both unimodal and cross-modal adaptation. Extensive
experiments cover three representative multimodal scenarios (audio-visual-text,
visual-text, and speech-text), and multiple LLM backbones (LLaMA2/3, Qwen2,
Qwen2.5-VL, etc). Consistent improvements indicate the efficacy and versatility
of the proposed method. Ablation studies and efficiency evaluation are also
conducted to fully asses our method. Overall, we think MokA provides a more
targeted solution for efficient adaptation of MLLMs, paving the way for further
exploration. The project page is at https://gewu-lab.github.io/MokA.

TL;DR: A vision-aided autonomous reflector system enhances mmWave communication in NLoS conditions by dynamically steering signals using a motorized metallic plate, achieving significant signal strength gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable mmWave communication in NLoS is challenging in urban or infrastructure-limited environments, necessitating adaptive solutions.

Method: The system uses a monocular camera to detect ArUco markers, estimate angles of arrival, and align a reflector in real time for optimal signal redirection.

Result: Experiments at 60 GHz show a 23 dB average gain in signal strength and 0.89 probability of maintaining reception above -65 dB.

Conclusion: The system offers resilient and adaptive mmWave connectivity in complex environments, outperforming static or no-reflector setups.

Abstract: Reliable millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication in non-line-of-sight (NLoS)
conditions remains a major challenge for both military and civilian operations,
especially in urban or infrastructure-limited environments. This paper presents
a vision-aided autonomous reflector system designed to enhance mmWave link
performance by dynamically steering signal reflections using a motorized
metallic plate. The proposed system leverages a monocular camera to detect
ArUco markers on allied transmitter and receiver nodes, estimate their angles
of arrival, and align the reflector in real time for optimal signal
redirection. This approach enables selective beam coverage by serving only
authenticated targets with visible markers and reduces the risk of unintended
signal exposure. The designed prototype, built on a Raspberry Pi 4 and
low-power hardware, operates autonomously without reliance on external
infrastructure or GPS. Experimental results at 60\,GHz demonstrate a 23\,dB
average gain in received signal strength and an 0.89 probability of maintaining
signal reception above a target threshold of -65 dB in an indoor environment,
far exceeding the static and no-reflector baselines. These results demonstrate
the system's potential for resilient and adaptive mmWave connectivity in
complex and dynamic environments.

*Yuxin Wen,Yangsibo Huang,Tom Goldstein,Ravi Kumar,Badih Ghazi,Chiyuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates cross-modality memorization in vision-language models, revealing a gap in information transfer between modalities and proposing a baseline solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand neural networks' memorization, especially in multimodal settings, addressing unintentional memorization of sensitive data and improving knowledge acquisition.

Method: Uses a synthetic persona dataset to quantify memorization and cross-modal transferability, training models on one modality and testing on another.

Result: Facts learned in one modality transfer to another, but with a significant gap in recall between source and target modalities, observed across various scenarios.

Conclusion: Proposes a baseline method to mitigate the gap, aiming to inspire robust multimodal learning techniques for better cross-modal transferability.

Abstract: Understanding what and how neural networks memorize during training is
crucial, both from the perspective of unintentional memorization of potentially
sensitive information and from the standpoint of effective knowledge
acquisition for real-world, knowledge-intensive tasks. While previous studies
primarily investigate memorization within a single modality, such as text
memorization in large language models or image memorization in diffusion
models, unified multimodal models are becoming increasingly prevalent in
practical applications. In this work, we focus on the unique characteristics of
cross-modality memorization and conduct a systematic study centered on
vision-language models. To facilitate controlled experiments, we first
introduce a synthetic persona dataset comprising diverse synthetic person
images and textual descriptions. We quantify factual knowledge memorization and
cross-modal transferability by training models on a single modality and
evaluating their performance in the other. Our results reveal that facts
learned in one modality transfer to the other, but a significant gap exists
between recalling information in the source and target modalities. Furthermore,
we observe that this gap exists across various scenarios, including more
capable models, machine unlearning, and the multi-hop case. At the end, we
propose a baseline method to mitigate this challenge. We hope our study can
inspire future research on developing more robust multimodal learning
techniques to enhance cross-modal transferability.

*Yani Zhang,Dongming Wu,Hao Shi,Yingfei Liu,Tiancai Wang,Haoqiang Fan,Xingping Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper questions if embodied 3D grounding benefits from detection models, finding that untrained detection models outperform grounding models. It proposes DEGround, integrating detection and grounding, and achieves a 7.52% accuracy improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether embodied 3D grounding sufficiently leverages detection models, given that untrained detection models outperform trained grounding models.

Method: Proposes DEGround, which shares DETR queries for detection and grounding, adds a regional activation module, and a query-wise modulation module for better language understanding.

Result: DEGround outperforms BIP3D by 7.52% on the EmbodiedScan validation set.

Conclusion: DEGround effectively integrates detection and grounding, improving performance and highlighting the need for better context-aware grounding.

Abstract: Embodied 3D grounding aims to localize target objects described in human
instructions from ego-centric viewpoint. Most methods typically follow a
two-stage paradigm where a trained 3D detector's optimized backbone parameters
are used to initialize a grounding model. In this study, we explore a
fundamental question: Does embodied 3D grounding benefit enough from detection?
To answer this question, we assess the grounding performance of detection
models using predicted boxes filtered by the target category. Surprisingly,
these detection models without any instruction-specific training outperform the
grounding models explicitly trained with language instructions. This indicates
that even category-level embodied 3D grounding may not be well resolved, let
alone more fine-grained context-aware grounding. Motivated by this finding, we
propose DEGround, which shares DETR queries as object representation for both
DEtection and Grounding and enables the grounding to benefit from basic
category classification and box detection. Based on this framework, we further
introduce a regional activation grounding module that highlights
instruction-related regions and a query-wise modulation module that
incorporates sentence-level semantic into the query representation,
strengthening the context-aware understanding of language instructions.
Remarkably, DEGround outperforms state-of-the-art model BIP3D by 7.52\% at
overall accuracy on the EmbodiedScan validation set. The source code will be
publicly available at https://github.com/zyn213/DEGround.

*Yanbo Wang,Ziyi Wang,Wenzhao Zheng,Jie Zhou,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OGGSplat is a method for semantic-aware 3D scene reconstruction from sparse views, using open Gaussians and RGB-semantic inpainting to expand the field-of-view efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for semantic-aware 3D reconstruction from sparse views, driven by applications like virtual reality and embodied AI, where existing methods are either computationally expensive or limited in scope.

Method: OGGSplat initializes open Gaussians from sparse views, applies RGB-semantic inpainting for consistency, and optimizes Gaussian parameters progressively.

Result: The method achieves semantic and generative quality in open-vocabulary scene reconstruction, validated by a new benchmark (GO).

Conclusion: OGGSplat offers an efficient and scalable solution for semantic-aware 3D reconstruction, even with minimal input views.

Abstract: Reconstructing semantic-aware 3D scenes from sparse views is a challenging
yet essential research direction, driven by the demands of emerging
applications such as virtual reality and embodied AI. Existing per-scene
optimization methods require dense input views and incur high computational
costs, while generalizable approaches often struggle to reconstruct regions
outside the input view cone. In this paper, we propose OGGSplat, an open
Gaussian growing method that expands the field-of-view in generalizable 3D
reconstruction. Our key insight is that the semantic attributes of open
Gaussians provide strong priors for image extrapolation, enabling both semantic
consistency and visual plausibility. Specifically, once open Gaussians are
initialized from sparse views, we introduce an RGB-semantic consistent
inpainting module applied to selected rendered views. This module enforces
bidirectional control between an image diffusion model and a semantic diffusion
model. The inpainted regions are then lifted back into 3D space for efficient
and progressive Gaussian parameter optimization. To evaluate our method, we
establish a Gaussian Outpainting (GO) benchmark that assesses both semantic and
generative quality of reconstructed open-vocabulary scenes. OGGSplat also
demonstrates promising semantic-aware scene reconstruction capabilities when
provided with two view images captured directly from a smartphone camera.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Follow-Your-Motion, a two-stage video motion transfer framework using spatial-temporal decoupled LoRA to improve motion consistency and tuning efficiency in large video diffusion transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion-transfer methods suffer from motion inconsistency and inefficiency in large video diffusion transformers due to spatial-temporal coupling in 3D attention operators.

Method: Proposes spatial-temporal decoupled LoRA for decoupling attention, sparse motion sampling, and adaptive RoPE for faster tuning. Introduces MotionBench for benchmarking.

Result: Extensive evaluations on MotionBench demonstrate the superiority of Follow-Your-Motion in motion consistency and efficiency.

Conclusion: Follow-Your-Motion effectively addresses motion inconsistency and tuning inefficiency, validated by MotionBench.

Abstract: Recently, breakthroughs in the video diffusion transformer have shown
remarkable capabilities in diverse motion generations. As for the
motion-transfer task, current methods mainly use two-stage Low-Rank Adaptations
(LoRAs) finetuning to obtain better performance. However, existing
adaptation-based motion transfer still suffers from motion inconsistency and
tuning inefficiency when applied to large video diffusion transformers. Naive
two-stage LoRA tuning struggles to maintain motion consistency between
generated and input videos due to the inherent spatial-temporal coupling in the
3D attention operator. Additionally, they require time-consuming fine-tuning
processes in both stages. To tackle these issues, we propose
Follow-Your-Motion, an efficient two-stage video motion transfer framework that
finetunes a powerful video diffusion transformer to synthesize complex
motion.Specifically, we propose a spatial-temporal decoupled LoRA to decouple
the attention architecture for spatial appearance and temporal motion
processing. During the second training stage, we design the sparse motion
sampling and adaptive RoPE to accelerate the tuning speed. To address the lack
of a benchmark for this field, we introduce MotionBench, a comprehensive
benchmark comprising diverse motion, including creative camera motion, single
object motion, multiple object motion, and complex human motion. We show
extensive evaluations on MotionBench to verify the superiority of
Follow-Your-Motion.

*Wenhao Hu,Xuexiang Wen,Xi Li,Gaoang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DSG-World is a novel framework for 3D Gaussian World modeling using dual state observations to overcome occlusion and improve reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in world modeling, such as occlusion and lack of 3D/physical consistency in existing methods.

Method: Leverages dual perturbed observations, constructs dual segmentation-aware Gaussian fields, and enforces photometric/semantic consistency.

Result: Enables efficient real-to-simulation transfer, high-fidelity rendering, and object-level manipulation without dense observations.

Conclusion: DSG-World demonstrates strong generalization for 3D reconstruction and simulation, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Building an efficient and physically consistent world model from limited
observations is a long standing challenge in vision and robotics. Many existing
world modeling pipelines are based on implicit generative models, which are
hard to train and often lack 3D or physical consistency. On the other hand,
explicit 3D methods built from a single state often require multi-stage
processing-such as segmentation, background completion, and inpainting-due to
occlusions. To address this, we leverage two perturbed observations of the same
scene under different object configurations. These dual states offer
complementary visibility, alleviating occlusion issues during state transitions
and enabling more stable and complete reconstruction. In this paper, we present
DSG-World, a novel end-to-end framework that explicitly constructs a 3D
Gaussian World model from Dual State observations. Our approach builds dual
segmentation-aware Gaussian fields and enforces bidirectional photometric and
semantic consistency. We further introduce a pseudo intermediate state for
symmetric alignment and design collaborative co-pruning trategies to refine
geometric completeness. DSG-World enables efficient real-to-simulation transfer
purely in the explicit Gaussian representation space, supporting high-fidelity
rendering and object-level scene manipulation without relying on dense
observations or multi-stage pipelines. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong
generalization to novel views and scene states, highlighting the effectiveness
of our approach for real-world 3D reconstruction and simulation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonkeyOCR introduces a vision-language model for document parsing using the SRR triplet paradigm, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify complex multi-tool pipelines and avoid inefficiencies of large end-to-end models in document parsing.

Method: Uses the Structure-Recognition-Relation (SRR) triplet paradigm to decompose parsing into layout analysis, content identification, and logical ordering.

Result: Outperforms MinerU by 5.1% on average, excels in formulas (+15.0%) and tables (+8.6%), and surpasses larger models like Qwen2.5-VL and Gemini 2.5 Pro.

Conclusion: MonkeyOCR achieves state-of-the-art performance with efficient deployment, offering a scalable and precise solution for document parsing.

Abstract: We introduce MonkeyOCR, a vision-language model for document parsing that
advances the state of the art by leveraging a Structure-Recognition-Relation
(SRR) triplet paradigm. This design simplifies what would otherwise be a
complex multi-tool pipeline (as in MinerU's modular approach) and avoids the
inefficiencies of processing full pages with giant end-to-end models (e.g.,
large multimodal LLMs like Qwen-VL). In SRR, document parsing is abstracted
into three fundamental questions - "Where is it?" (structure), "What is it?"
(recognition), and "How is it organized?" (relation) - corresponding to layout
analysis, content identification, and logical ordering. This focused
decomposition balances accuracy and speed: it enables efficient, scalable
processing without sacrificing precision. To train and evaluate this approach,
we introduce the MonkeyDoc (the most comprehensive document parsing dataset to
date), with 3.9 million instances spanning over ten document types in both
Chinese and English. Experiments show that MonkeyOCR outperforms MinerU by an
average of 5.1%, with particularly notable improvements on challenging content
such as formulas (+15.0%) and tables (+8.6%). Remarkably, our 3B-parameter
model surpasses much larger and top-performing models, including Qwen2.5-VL
(72B) and Gemini 2.5 Pro, achieving state-of-the-art average performance on
English document parsing tasks. In addition, MonkeyOCR processes multi-page
documents significantly faster (0.84 pages per second compared to 0.65 for
MinerU and 0.12 for Qwen2.5-VL-7B). The 3B model can be efficiently deployed
for inference on a single NVIDIA 3090 GPU. Code and models will be released at
https://github.com/Yuliang-Liu/MonkeyOCR.

*Jianghao Wu,Yicheng Wu,Yutong Xie,Wenjia Bai,You Zhang,Feilong Tang,Yulong Li,Yasmeen George,Imran Razzak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM-TTA improves medical image segmentation by adapting SAM at test-time, addressing input and semantic discrepancies without losing generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM's limited adaptability to medical domains and reduced generalization in existing adaptations like MedSAM.

Method: Proposes SAM-TTA with SBCT for input adaptation and DUMT for semantic alignment via consistency learning.

Result: Outperforms existing TTA approaches and surpasses fine-tuned models like MedSAM in some cases.

Conclusion: SAM-TTA sets a new paradigm for universal medical image segmentation, balancing performance and generalization.

Abstract: Universal medical image segmentation using the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
remains challenging due to its limited adaptability to medical domains.
Existing adaptations, such as MedSAM, enhance SAM's performance in medical
imaging but at the cost of reduced generalization to unseen data. Therefore, in
this paper, we propose SAM-aware Test-Time Adaptation (SAM-TTA), a
fundamentally different pipeline that preserves the generalization of SAM while
improving its segmentation performance in medical imaging via a test-time
framework. SAM-TTA tackles two key challenges: (1) input-level discrepancies
caused by differences in image acquisition between natural and medical images
and (2) semantic-level discrepancies due to fundamental differences in object
definition between natural and medical domains (e.g., clear boundaries vs.
ambiguous structures). Specifically, our SAM-TTA framework comprises (1)
Self-adaptive Bezier Curve-based Transformation (SBCT), which adaptively
converts single-channel medical images into three-channel SAM-compatible inputs
while maintaining structural integrity, to mitigate the input gap between
medical and natural images, and (2) Dual-scale Uncertainty-driven Mean Teacher
adaptation (DUMT), which employs consistency learning to align SAM's internal
representations to medical semantics, enabling efficient adaptation without
auxiliary supervision or expensive retraining. Extensive experiments on five
public datasets demonstrate that our SAM-TTA outperforms existing TTA
approaches and even surpasses fully fine-tuned models such as MedSAM in certain
scenarios, establishing a new paradigm for universal medical image
segmentation. Code can be found at https://github.com/JianghaoWu/SAM-TTA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoViX is a self-supervised cross-view video localization framework for GPS-denied, off-road environments, addressing perceptual ambiguities and seasonal shifts. It achieves robust 3-DoF localization with minimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in GPS-denied, off-road environments include perceptual ambiguities from repetitive vegetation and seasonal appearance shifts, making alignment with outdated satellite imagery difficult.

Method: MoViX uses viewpoint- and season-invariant representations, pose-dependent positive sampling, hard negative mining, motion-informed frame sampling, and a temporal aggregator. It integrates with Monte Carlo Localization and employs entropy-guided temperature scaling.

Result: On the TartanDrive 2.0 dataset, MoViX localizes within 25 meters 93% of the time and within 50 meters 100% of the time, outperforming baselines without environment-specific tuning. It also generalizes to a real-world off-road dataset.

Conclusion: MoViX provides robust and accurate cross-view localization in challenging environments, demonstrating generalization and outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Robust cross-view 3-DoF localization in GPS-denied, off-road environments
remains challenging due to (1) perceptual ambiguities from repetitive
vegetation and unstructured terrain, and (2) seasonal shifts that significantly
alter scene appearance, hindering alignment with outdated satellite imagery. To
address this, we introduce MoViX, a self-supervised cross-view video
localization framework that learns viewpoint- and season-invariant
representations while preserving directional awareness essential for accurate
localization. MoViX employs a pose-dependent positive sampling strategy to
enhance directional discrimination and temporally aligned hard negative mining
to discourage shortcut learning from seasonal cues. A motion-informed frame
sampler selects spatially diverse frames, and a lightweight temporal aggregator
emphasizes geometrically aligned observations while downweighting ambiguous
ones. At inference, MoViX runs within a Monte Carlo Localization framework,
using a learned cross-view matching module in place of handcrafted models.
Entropy-guided temperature scaling enables robust multi-hypothesis tracking and
confident convergence under visual ambiguity. We evaluate MoViX on the
TartanDrive 2.0 dataset, training on under 30 minutes of data and testing over
12.29 km. Despite outdated satellite imagery, MoViX localizes within 25 meters
of ground truth 93% of the time, and within 50 meters 100% of the time in
unseen regions, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines without
environment-specific tuning. We further demonstrate generalization on a
real-world off-road dataset from a geographically distinct site with a
different robot platform.

*Xiaodong Wang,Jinfa Huang,Li Yuan,Peixi Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LeanPO is a reference-free method to optimize Video-LLMs by addressing the likelihood displacement issue in preference alignment, improving reward estimation and mitigating unintended drops in response probabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing preference alignment techniques like DPO inadvertently reduce the likelihood of both winning and losing responses, worsening with video content complexity. LeanPO aims to mitigate this issue.

Method: Proposes LeanPO, which reformulates the implicit reward as the average likelihood of responses, uses a self-generated preference data pipeline, and employs dynamic label smoothing to handle noise.

Result: LeanPO significantly enhances Video-LLM performance, boosts baselines with minimal overhead, and aligns preferences with human trustworthiness.

Conclusion: LeanPO provides a simple, effective solution for reliable and efficient Video-LLMs by addressing preference alignment challenges.

Abstract: Most Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) adopt preference alignment
techniques, e.g., DPO~\citep{rafailov2024dpo}, to optimize the reward margin
between a winning response ($y_w$) and a losing response ($y_l$). However, the
likelihood displacement observed in DPO indicates that both $\log \pi_\theta
(y_w\mid x)$ and $\log \pi_\theta (y_l\mid x) $ often decrease during training,
inadvertently boosting the probabilities of non-target responses. In this
paper, we systematically revisit this phenomenon from LLMs to Video-LLMs,
showing that it intensifies when dealing with the redundant complexity of video
content. To alleviate the impact of this phenomenon, we propose \emph{Lean
Preference Optimization} (LeanPO), a reference-free approach that reformulates
the implicit reward as the average likelihood of the response with respect to
the policy model. A key component of LeanPO is the reward-trustworthiness
correlated self-generated preference data pipeline, which carefully infuses
relevant prior knowledge into the model while continuously refining the
preference data via self-reflection. This allows the policy model to obtain
high-quality paired data and accurately estimate the newly defined reward, thus
mitigating the unintended drop. In addition, we introduce a dynamic label
smoothing strategy that mitigates the impact of noise in responses from diverse
video content, preventing the model from overfitting to spurious details.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that LeanPO significantly enhances the
performance of state-of-the-art Video-LLMs, consistently boosting baselines of
varying capacities with minimal additional training overhead. Moreover, LeanPO
offers a simple yet effective solution for aligning Video-LLM preferences with
human trustworthiness, paving the way toward the reliable and efficient
Video-LLMs.

*Juan E. Tapia,Christoph Busch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using Foundation Models (FM) to improve generalization in Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) for ID cards across diverse countries, highlighting the importance of bona fide images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PAD systems lack generalization due to limited training data from few countries, hindering commercial viability.

Method: The study benchmarks FM capabilities using zero-shot and fine-tuning approaches on two datasets: a private Chilean ID set and an open-set from Finland, Spain, and Slovakia.

Result: Bona fide images are identified as crucial for achieving generalization in PAD.

Conclusion: FM can enhance PAD generalization, with bona fide images playing a key role.

Abstract: Nowadays, one of the main challenges in presentation attack detection (PAD)
on ID cards is obtaining generalisation capabilities for a diversity of
countries that are issuing ID cards. Most PAD systems are trained on one, two,
or three ID documents because of privacy protection concerns. As a result, they
do not obtain competitive results for commercial purposes when tested in an
unknown new ID card country. In this scenario, Foundation Models (FM) trained
on huge datasets can help to improve generalisation capabilities. This work
intends to improve and benchmark the capabilities of FM and how to use them to
adapt the generalisation on PAD of ID Documents. Different test protocols were
used, considering zero-shot and fine-tuning and two different ID card datasets.
One private dataset based on Chilean IDs and one open-set based on three ID
countries: Finland, Spain, and Slovakia. Our findings indicate that bona fide
images are the key to generalisation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TF-CoVR is a new benchmark for temporally fine-grained Composed Video Retrieval (CoVR), focusing on gymnastics and diving with 180K triplets. It improves upon previous benchmarks by linking queries to multiple target videos. The proposed TF-CoVR-Base model enhances retrieval performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CoVR benchmarks lack the ability to capture subtle, fast-paced temporal differences, limiting their practical usefulness.

Method: TF-CoVR-Base uses a two-stage framework: (i) pre-training a video encoder for fine-grained action classification, and (ii) aligning queries with videos via contrastive learning.

Result: TF-CoVR-Base improves zero-shot mAP@50 from 5.92 to 7.51 and raises fine-tuned state-of-the-art from 19.83 to 25.82.

Conclusion: TF-CoVR addresses a critical gap in CoVR benchmarks and demonstrates significant performance improvements with the proposed model.

Abstract: Composed Video Retrieval (CoVR) retrieves a target video given a query video
and a modification text describing the intended change. Existing CoVR
benchmarks emphasize appearance shifts or coarse event changes and therefore do
not test the ability to capture subtle, fast-paced temporal differences. We
introduce TF-CoVR, the first large-scale benchmark dedicated to temporally
fine-grained CoVR. TF-CoVR focuses on gymnastics and diving and provides 180K
triplets drawn from FineGym and FineDiving. Previous CoVR benchmarks focusing
on temporal aspect, link each query to a single target segment taken from the
same video, limiting practical usefulness. In TF-CoVR, we instead construct
each <query, modification> pair by prompting an LLM with the label differences
between clips drawn from different videos; every pair is thus associated with
multiple valid target videos (3.9 on average), reflecting real-world tasks such
as sports-highlight generation. To model these temporal dynamics we propose
TF-CoVR-Base, a concise two-stage training framework: (i) pre-train a video
encoder on fine-grained action classification to obtain temporally
discriminative embeddings; (ii) align the composed query with candidate videos
using contrastive learning. We conduct the first comprehensive study of image,
video, and general multimodal embedding (GME) models on temporally fine-grained
composed retrieval in both zero-shot and fine-tuning regimes. On TF-CoVR,
TF-CoVR-Base improves zero-shot mAP@50 from 5.92 (LanguageBind) to 7.51, and
after fine-tuning raises the state-of-the-art from 19.83 to 25.82.

TL;DR: A novel multi-scale bilateral grid unifies appearance codes and bilateral grids, improving geometric accuracy in dynamic scene reconstruction for autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing photometric inconsistency in real-world images, which limits the quality of reconstructions in neural rendering techniques like NeRF and Gaussian Splatting.

Method: Proposes a multi-scale bilateral grid to combine appearance codes and bilateral grids, enhancing pixel-wise color mapping.

Result: Significantly improves geometric accuracy in autonomous driving scenes, outperforming existing methods across four datasets (Waymo, NuScenes, Argoverse, PandaSet).

Conclusion: The multi-scale bilateral grid effectively reduces floaters from photometric inconsistency, proving crucial for accurate geometry in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Neural rendering techniques, including NeRF and Gaussian Splatting (GS), rely
on photometric consistency to produce high-quality reconstructions. However, in
real-world scenarios, it is challenging to guarantee perfect photometric
consistency in acquired images. Appearance codes have been widely used to
address this issue, but their modeling capability is limited, as a single code
is applied to the entire image. Recently, the bilateral grid was introduced to
perform pixel-wise color mapping, but it is difficult to optimize and constrain
effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale bilateral grid that
unifies appearance codes and bilateral grids. We demonstrate that this approach
significantly improves geometric accuracy in dynamic, decoupled autonomous
driving scene reconstruction, outperforming both appearance codes and bilateral
grids. This is crucial for autonomous driving, where accurate geometry is
important for obstacle avoidance and control. Our method shows strong results
across four datasets: Waymo, NuScenes, Argoverse, and PandaSet. We further
demonstrate that the improvement in geometry is driven by the multi-scale
bilateral grid, which effectively reduces floaters caused by photometric
inconsistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of point cloud registration and multi-part shape assembly by learning a continuous velocity field and intrinsic symmetry handling without labels.

Method: Learns a point-wise velocity field to transport noisy points to targets, recovering part poses, and uses a self-supervised encoder for overlapping points.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks, with joint training enhancing accuracy through shared geometric priors.

Conclusion: The unified formulation and self-supervised approach enable effective learning and superior performance in registration and assembly tasks.

Abstract: We introduce Rectified Point Flow, a unified parameterization that formulates
pairwise point cloud registration and multi-part shape assembly as a single
conditional generative problem. Given unposed point clouds, our method learns a
continuous point-wise velocity field that transports noisy points toward their
target positions, from which part poses are recovered. In contrast to prior
work that regresses part-wise poses with ad-hoc symmetry handling, our method
intrinsically learns assembly symmetries without symmetry labels. Together with
a self-supervised encoder focused on overlapping points, our method achieves a
new state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks spanning pairwise
registration and shape assembly. Notably, our unified formulation enables
effective joint training on diverse datasets, facilitating the learning of
shared geometric priors and consequently boosting accuracy. Project page:

TL;DR: A framework enhances long-term consistency in video world models using geometry-grounded spatial memory, improving scene consistency and context length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle with scene consistency due to limited temporal context, leading to forgetting of environments.

Method: Introduces a geometry-grounded long-term spatial memory for storing and retrieving information, trained on custom datasets.

Result: Shows improved quality, consistency, and context length compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Paves the way for long-term consistent world generation in video models.

Abstract: Emerging world models autoregressively generate video frames in response to
actions, such as camera movements and text prompts, among other control
signals. Due to limited temporal context window sizes, these models often
struggle to maintain scene consistency during revisits, leading to severe
forgetting of previously generated environments. Inspired by the mechanisms of
human memory, we introduce a novel framework to enhancing long-term consistency
of video world models through a geometry-grounded long-term spatial memory. Our
framework includes mechanisms to store and retrieve information from the
long-term spatial memory and we curate custom datasets to train and evaluate
world models with explicitly stored 3D memory mechanisms. Our evaluations show
improved quality, consistency, and context length compared to relevant
baselines, paving the way towards long-term consistent world generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D shape completion methods lack consistency, are computationally expensive, and struggle with sharp boundaries.

Method: Uses a feedforward transformer to predict depth maps, object masks, and confidence scores for query rays from a single RGB-D image, fusing predictions across views.

Result: Outperforms baselines by up to 44% in 3D chamfer distance on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: RaySt3R effectively addresses limitations of current methods, offering improved performance and efficiency.

Abstract: 3D shape completion has broad applications in robotics, digital twin
reconstruction, and extended reality (XR). Although recent advances in 3D
object and scene completion have achieved impressive results, existing methods
lack 3D consistency, are computationally expensive, and struggle to capture
sharp object boundaries. Our work (RaySt3R) addresses these limitations by
recasting 3D shape completion as a novel view synthesis problem. Specifically,
given a single RGB-D image and a novel viewpoint (encoded as a collection of
query rays), we train a feedforward transformer to predict depth maps, object
masks, and per-pixel confidence scores for those query rays. RaySt3R fuses
these predictions across multiple query views to reconstruct complete 3D
shapes. We evaluate RaySt3R on synthetic and real-world datasets, and observe
it achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the baselines on all
datasets by up to 44% in 3D chamfer distance. Project page:

Result: VCT and SVCT maintain accuracy and interpretability on four medical datasets, with SVCT providing stable explanations under perturbations.

Conclusion: SVCT meets medical field needs by balancing accuracy, interpretability, and faithfulness, overcoming CBM limitations.

Abstract: Transparency is a paramount concern in the medical field, prompting
researchers to delve into the realm of explainable AI (XAI). Among these XAI
methods, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to restrict the model's latent
space to human-understandable high-level concepts by generating a conceptual
layer for extracting conceptual features, which has drawn much attention
recently. However, existing methods rely solely on concept features to
determine the model's predictions, which overlook the intrinsic feature
embeddings within medical images. To address this utility gap between the
original models and concept-based models, we propose Vision Concept Transformer
(VCT). Furthermore, despite their benefits, CBMs have been found to negatively
impact model performance and fail to provide stable explanations when faced
with input perturbations, which limits their application in the medical field.
To address this faithfulness issue, this paper further proposes the Stable
Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT) based on VCT, which leverages the vision
transformer (ViT) as its backbone and incorporates a conceptual layer. SVCT
employs conceptual features to enhance decision-making capabilities by fusing
them with image features and ensures model faithfulness through the integration
of Denoised Diffusion Smoothing. Comprehensive experiments on four medical
datasets demonstrate that our VCT and SVCT maintain accuracy while remaining
interpretable compared to baselines. Furthermore, even when subjected to
perturbations, our SVCT model consistently provides faithful explanations, thus
meeting the needs of the medical field.

TL;DR: EOC-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating object-centric embodied cognition in dynamic egocentric scenarios, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on static scenes, neglecting dynamic interactions. EOC-Bench aims to fill this gap by assessing object cognition in dynamic environments.

Method: EOC-Bench includes 3,277 annotated QA pairs across three temporal categories (Past, Present, Future), 11 evaluation dimensions, and 3 referencing types. A mixed-format human-in-the-loop annotation framework and multi-scale temporal accuracy metric are developed.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations of various MLLMs are conducted using EOC-Bench, highlighting its effectiveness.

Conclusion: EOC-Bench advances embodied object cognition in MLLMs, providing a foundation for reliable core models in embodied systems.

Abstract: The emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has driven
breakthroughs in egocentric vision applications. These applications necessitate
persistent, context-aware understanding of objects, as users interact with
tools in dynamic and cluttered environments. However, existing embodied
benchmarks primarily focus on static scene exploration, emphasizing object's
appearance and spatial attributes while neglecting the assessment of dynamic
changes arising from users' interactions. To address this gap, we introduce
EOC-Bench, an innovative benchmark designed to systematically evaluate
object-centric embodied cognition in dynamic egocentric scenarios. Specially,
EOC-Bench features 3,277 meticulously annotated QA pairs categorized into three
temporal categories: Past, Present, and Future, covering 11 fine-grained
evaluation dimensions and 3 visual object referencing types. To ensure thorough
assessment, we develop a mixed-format human-in-the-loop annotation framework
with four types of questions and design a novel multi-scale temporal accuracy
metric for open-ended temporal evaluation. Based on EOC-Bench, we conduct
comprehensive evaluations of various proprietary, open-source, and object-level
MLLMs. EOC-Bench serves as a crucial tool for advancing the embodied object
cognitive capabilities of MLLMs, establishing a robust foundation for
developing reliable core models for embodied systems.

### [422] [AliTok: Towards Sequence Modeling Alignment between Tokenizer and Autoregressive Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05289)
*Pingyu Wu,Kai Zhu,Yu Liu,Longxiang Tang,Jian Yang,Yansong Peng,Wei Zhai,Yang Cao,Zheng-Jun Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Aligned Tokenizer (AliTok) for autoregressive image generation, improving token modeling with unidirectional dependencies and achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image tokenizers hinder autoregressive models due to bidirectional dependencies.

Method: Introduces AliTok with a causal decoder, prefix tokens, and two-stage training for better alignment and reconstruction.

Result: Achieves gFID 1.50 (177M params) and 1.35 (662M params), outperforming diffusion methods with faster sampling.

Conclusion: AliTok aligns tokenizer and autoregressive models, enhancing performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Autoregressive image generation aims to predict the next token based on
previous ones. However, existing image tokenizers encode tokens with
bidirectional dependencies during the compression process, which hinders the
effective modeling by autoregressive models. In this paper, we propose a novel
Aligned Tokenizer (AliTok), which utilizes a causal decoder to establish
unidirectional dependencies among encoded tokens, thereby aligning the token
modeling approach between the tokenizer and autoregressive model. Furthermore,
by incorporating prefix tokens and employing two-stage tokenizer training to
enhance reconstruction consistency, AliTok achieves great reconstruction
performance while being generation-friendly. On ImageNet-256 benchmark, using a
standard decoder-only autoregressive model as the generator with only 177M
parameters, AliTok achieves a gFID score of 1.50 and an IS of 305.9. When the
parameter count is increased to 662M, AliTok achieves a gFID score of 1.35,
surpassing the state-of-the-art diffusion method with 10x faster sampling
speed. The code and weights are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeedVR2 is a one-step diffusion-based video restoration model that addresses high-resolution challenges with adaptive window attention and adversarial training, achieving competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based VR methods improve visual quality but are computationally expensive. Distillation-based approaches for one-step restoration are underexplored for high-resolution VR.

Method: SeedVR2 introduces adaptive window attention (dynamic window size) and adversarial training with feature matching loss for stability.

Result: SeedVR2 achieves comparable or better performance than existing VR methods in a single step.

Conclusion: The proposed enhancements make SeedVR2 efficient and effective for high-resolution VR, advancing one-step diffusion-based restoration.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based video restoration (VR) demonstrate
significant improvement in visual quality, yet yield a prohibitive
computational cost during inference. While several distillation-based
approaches have exhibited the potential of one-step image restoration,
extending existing approaches to VR remains challenging and underexplored,
particularly when dealing with high-resolution video in real-world settings. In
this work, we propose a one-step diffusion-based VR model, termed as SeedVR2,
which performs adversarial VR training against real data. To handle the
challenging high-resolution VR within a single step, we introduce several
enhancements to both model architecture and training procedures. Specifically,
an adaptive window attention mechanism is proposed, where the window size is
dynamically adjusted to fit the output resolutions, avoiding window
inconsistency observed under high-resolution VR using window attention with a
predefined window size. To stabilize and improve the adversarial post-training
towards VR, we further verify the effectiveness of a series of losses,
including a proposed feature matching loss without significantly sacrificing
training efficiency. Extensive experiments show that SeedVR2 can achieve
comparable or even better performance compared with existing VR approaches in a
single step.

TL;DR: PAM integrates SAM 2 and LLMs for efficient region-level visual understanding, offering segmentation and semantic outputs with improved speed and memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance region-level visual understanding by combining segmentation and semantic generation in a lightweight, efficient framework.

Method: Extends SAM 2 with LLMs, introduces Semantic Perceiver for feature transformation, and uses a refined dataset of 1.5M images and 0.6M videos.

Result: PAM runs 1.2-2.4x faster, uses less GPU memory, and performs well on diverse tasks.

Conclusion: PAM is a practical, efficient baseline for future region-level visual understanding research.

Abstract: We present Perceive Anything Model (PAM), a conceptually straightforward and
efficient framework for comprehensive region-level visual understanding in
images and videos. Our approach extends the powerful segmentation model SAM 2
by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling simultaneous object
segmentation with the generation of diverse, region-specific semantic outputs,
including categories, label definition, functional explanations, and detailed
captions. A key component, Semantic Perceiver, is introduced to efficiently
transform SAM 2's rich visual features, which inherently carry general vision,
localization, and semantic priors into multi-modal tokens for LLM
comprehension. To support robust multi-granularity understanding, we also
develop a dedicated data refinement and augmentation pipeline, yielding a
high-quality dataset of 1.5M image and 0.6M video region-semantic annotations,
including novel region-level streaming video caption data. PAM is designed for
lightweightness and efficiency, while also demonstrates strong performance
across a diverse range of region understanding tasks. It runs 1.2-2.4x faster
and consumes less GPU memory than prior approaches, offering a practical
solution for real-world applications. We believe that our effective approach
will serve as a strong baseline for future research in region-level visual
understanding.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a 3D-aware pseudo-labeling method to improve semantic correspondence estimation, achieving state-of-the-art results with reduced annotation needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing ambiguities in semantic matching for symmetric objects or repeated parts using large pre-trained vision models.

Method: Training an adapter to refine features using 3D-aware pseudo-labels, cyclic consistency filtering, and 3D spherical prototype constraints.

Result: Achieves over 4% absolute gain on SPair-71k and 7% improvement over similarly supervised methods.

Conclusion: The approach simplifies training extension to other data sources and reduces annotation dependency.

Abstract: Finding correspondences between semantically similar points across images and
object instances is one of the everlasting challenges in computer vision. While
large pre-trained vision models have recently been demonstrated as effective
priors for semantic matching, they still suffer from ambiguities for symmetric
objects or repeated object parts. We propose to improve semantic correspondence
estimation via 3D-aware pseudo-labeling. Specifically, we train an adapter to
refine off-the-shelf features using pseudo-labels obtained via 3D-aware
chaining, filtering wrong labels through relaxed cyclic consistency, and 3D
spherical prototype mapping constraints. While reducing the need for dataset
specific annotations compared to prior work, we set a new state-of-the-art on
SPair-71k by over 4% absolute gain and by over 7% against methods with similar
supervision requirements. The generality of our proposed approach simplifies
extension of training to other data sources, which we demonstrate in our
experiments.

TL;DR: MARBLE is a method for material editing in images using CLIP-space embeddings and pre-trained text-to-image models, enabling blending and fine-grained control over material attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve exemplar-based material editing by leveraging CLIP-space embeddings and pre-trained models for better control and blending of material properties.

Method: Uses CLIP-space embeddings to find material directions, identifies a denoising UNet block for material attribution, and employs a shallow network for parametric control over attributes like roughness and glow.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative analysis shows MARBLE's effectiveness in material blending and fine-grained editing, including multiple edits in one pass.

Conclusion: MARBLE advances material editing by combining CLIP-space embeddings with pre-trained models, offering precise control and multi-edit capabilities.

Abstract: Editing materials of objects in images based on exemplar images is an active
area of research in computer vision and graphics. We propose MARBLE, a method
for performing material blending and recomposing fine-grained material
properties by finding material embeddings in CLIP-space and using that to
control pre-trained text-to-image models. We improve exemplar-based material
editing by finding a block in the denoising UNet responsible for material
attribution. Given two material exemplar-images, we find directions in the
CLIP-space for blending the materials. Further, we can achieve parametric
control over fine-grained material attributes such as roughness, metallic,
transparency, and glow using a shallow network to predict the direction for the
desired material attribute change. We perform qualitative and quantitative
analysis to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method. We also present
the ability of our method to perform multiple edits in a single forward pass

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProJo4D is a progressive joint optimization framework for 4D scene understanding, outperforming prior methods in future state prediction, novel view rendering, and material estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for physics-integrated neural rendering face challenges like error accumulation and non-convex optimization, limiting scalability and accuracy.

Method: ProJo4D progressively optimizes geometry, appearance, physical state, and material properties, guided by parameter sensitivity.

Result: ProJo4D outperforms prior work on PAC-NeRF and Spring-Gaus datasets in future state prediction, rendering, and material estimation.

Conclusion: ProJo4D effectively addresses limitations of sequential optimization, enabling scalable and accurate physically grounded 4D scene understanding.

Abstract: Neural rendering has made significant strides in 3D reconstruction and novel
view synthesis. With the integration with physics, it opens up new
applications. The inverse problem of estimating physics from visual data,
however, still remains challenging, limiting its effectiveness for applications
like physically accurate digital twin creation in robotics and XR. Existing
methods that incorporate physics into neural rendering frameworks typically
require dense multi-view videos as input, making them impractical for scalable,
real-world use. When presented with sparse multi-view videos, the sequential
optimization strategy used by existing approaches introduces significant error
accumulation, e.g., poor initial 3D reconstruction leads to bad material
parameter estimation in subsequent stages. Instead of sequential optimization,
directly optimizing all parameters at the same time also fails due to the
highly non-convex and often non-differentiable nature of the problem. We
propose ProJo4D, a progressive joint optimization framework that gradually
increases the set of jointly optimized parameters guided by their sensitivity,
leading to fully joint optimization over geometry, appearance, physical state,
and material property. Evaluations on PAC-NeRF and Spring-Gaus datasets show
that ProJo4D outperforms prior work in 4D future state prediction, novel view
rendering of future state, and material parameter estimation, demonstrating its
effectiveness in physically grounded 4D scene understanding. For demos, please

### [428] [Does Your 3D Encoder Really Work? When Pretrain-SFT from 2D VLMs Meets 3D VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05318)
*Haoyuan Li,Yanpeng Zhou,Yufei Gao,Tao Tang,Jianhua Han,Yujie Yuan,Dave Zhenyu Chen,Jiawang Bian,Hang Xu,Xiaodan Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes 3D Vision-Language Models (VLMs), categorizing them into object-centric, image-based, and scene-centric approaches. It identifies performance gaps in scene-centric VLMs, attributing them to limited 3D encoder reliance and ineffective pre-training. A new QA dataset is introduced to improve 3D understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why 3D scene-centric VLMs underperform compared to object-centric and 2D image-based approaches, and to address their limitations in leveraging 3D data.

Method: Categorizes 3D VLMs, analyzes their performance gaps, and introduces a novel QA dataset to disrupt shortcut learning.

Result: 3D scene-centric VLMs rely less on 3D encoders, pre-train poorly, and overfit to linguistic cues. The new dataset aims to improve 3D understanding.

Conclusion: Advanced evaluation and strategies are needed to enhance 3D understanding in VLMs, with the proposed dataset as a step forward.

Abstract: Remarkable progress in 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has spurred interest
in extending them to 3D settings for tasks like 3D Question Answering, Dense
Captioning, and Visual Grounding. Unlike 2D VLMs that typically process images
through an image encoder, 3D scenes, with their intricate spatial structures,
allow for diverse model architectures. Based on their encoder design, this
paper categorizes recent 3D VLMs into 3D object-centric, 2D image-based, and 3D
scene-centric approaches. Despite the architectural similarity of 3D
scene-centric VLMs to their 2D counterparts, they have exhibited comparatively
lower performance compared with the latest 3D object-centric and 2D image-based
approaches. To understand this gap, we conduct an in-depth analysis, revealing
that 3D scene-centric VLMs show limited reliance on the 3D scene encoder, and
the pre-train stage appears less effective than in 2D VLMs. Furthermore, we
observe that data scaling benefits are less pronounced on larger datasets. Our
investigation suggests that while these models possess cross-modal alignment
capabilities, they tend to over-rely on linguistic cues and overfit to frequent
answer distributions, thereby diminishing the effective utilization of the 3D
encoder. To address these limitations and encourage genuine 3D scene
understanding, we introduce a novel 3D Relevance Discrimination QA dataset
designed to disrupt shortcut learning and improve 3D understanding. Our
findings highlight the need for advanced evaluation and improved strategies for
better 3D understanding in 3D VLMs.

TL;DR: PM-Loss, a regularization loss using a pointmap from a pre-trained transformer, improves depth maps in 3D Gaussian Splatting by addressing fragmentation at object boundaries, enhancing rendering quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depth discontinuities in depth-based 3D Gaussian Splatting cause fragmented point clouds, reducing rendering quality.

Method: Introduces PM-Loss, leveraging a pointmap from a pre-trained transformer to enforce geometric smoothness in depth maps.

Result: Improved depth maps lead to better rendering quality in 3DGS across various architectures and scenes.

Conclusion: PM-Loss effectively mitigates fragmentation issues in depth-based 3DGS, consistently enhancing rendering results.

Abstract: Depth maps are widely used in feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
pipelines by unprojecting them into 3D point clouds for novel view synthesis.
This approach offers advantages such as efficient training, the use of known
camera poses, and accurate geometry estimation. However, depth discontinuities
at object boundaries often lead to fragmented or sparse point clouds, degrading
rendering quality -- a well-known limitation of depth-based representations. To
tackle this issue, we introduce PM-Loss, a novel regularization loss based on a
pointmap predicted by a pre-trained transformer. Although the pointmap itself
may be less accurate than the depth map, it effectively enforces geometric
smoothness, especially around object boundaries. With the improved depth map,
our method significantly improves the feed-forward 3DGS across various
architectures and scenes, delivering consistently better rendering results. Our

Result: AV-Reasoner achieves state-of-the-art results but fails to improve performance on out-of-domain benchmarks.

Conclusion: CG-AV-Counting is a comprehensive benchmark, and AV-Reasoner shows promise but has limitations in generalization.

Abstract: Despite progress in video understanding, current MLLMs struggle with counting
tasks. Existing benchmarks are limited by short videos, close-set queries, lack
of clue annotations, and weak multimodal coverage. In this paper, we introduce
CG-AV-Counting, a manually-annotated clue-grounded counting benchmark with
1,027 multimodal questions and 5,845 annotated clues over 497 long videos. It
supports both black-box and white-box evaluation, serving as a comprehensive
testbed for both end-to-end and reasoning-based counting. To explore ways to
improve model's counting capability, we propose AV-Reasoner, a model trained
with GRPO and curriculum learning to generalize counting ability from related
tasks. AV-Reasoner achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple

TL;DR: MINT-CoT enhances multimodal math reasoning by interleaving visual tokens into textual CoT, outperforming baselines on key benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to multimodal domains is challenging due to coarse visual regions, limited math perception, and reliance on external tools.

Method: Proposes MINT-CoT, which dynamically interleaves visual tokens into textual reasoning steps using an Interleave Token and trains via a three-stage strategy.

Result: MINT-CoT-7B outperforms baselines by +34.08% (MathVista), +28.78% (GeoQA), and +23.2% (MMStar).

Conclusion: MINT-CoT effectively integrates visual and textual reasoning for math problems, validated by strong benchmark performance.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has widely enhanced mathematical reasoning in Large
Language Models (LLMs), but it still remains challenging for extending it to
multimodal domains. Existing works either adopt a similar textual reasoning for
image input, or seek to interleave visual signals into mathematical CoT.
However, they face three key limitations for math problem-solving: reliance on
coarse-grained box-shaped image regions, limited perception of vision encoders
on math content, and dependence on external capabilities for visual
modification. In this paper, we propose MINT-CoT, introducing Mathematical
INterleaved Tokens for Chain-of-Thought visual reasoning. MINT-CoT adaptively
interleaves relevant visual tokens into textual reasoning steps via an
Interleave Token, which dynamically selects visual regions of any shapes within
math figures. To empower this capability, we construct the MINT-CoT dataset,
containing 54K mathematical problems aligning each reasoning step with visual
regions at the token level, accompanied by a rigorous data generation pipeline.
We further present a three-stage MINT-CoT training strategy, progressively
combining text-only CoT SFT, interleaved CoT SFT, and interleaved CoT RL, which
derives our MINT-CoT-7B model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method for effective visual interleaved reasoning in
mathematical domains, where MINT-CoT-7B outperforms the baseline model by
+34.08% on MathVista, +28.78% on GeoQA, and +23.2% on MMStar, respectively. Our

Motivation: The scarcity of well-annotated long videos limits the training of hour-long Video-LMMs, prompting the creation of VideoMarathon.

Method: VideoMarathon includes 9,700 hours of diverse long videos with 3.3M QA pairs. Hour-LLaVA leverages a memory augmentation module for efficient hour-long video training and inference.

Result: Hour-LLaVA outperforms others on long video-language benchmarks, showcasing the dataset's quality and model's superiority.

Conclusion: VideoMarathon and Hour-LLaVA address the gap in long video understanding, advancing Video-LMM capabilities.

Abstract: Recent long-form video-language understanding benchmarks have driven progress
in video large multimodal models (Video-LMMs). However, the scarcity of
well-annotated long videos has left the training of hour-long Video-LLMs
underexplored. To close this gap, we present VideoMarathon, a large-scale
hour-long video instruction-following dataset. This dataset includes around
9,700 hours of long videos sourced from diverse domains, ranging from 3 to 60
minutes per video. Specifically, it contains 3.3M high-quality QA pairs,
spanning six fundamental topics: temporality, spatiality, object, action,
scene, and event. Compared to existing video instruction datasets,
VideoMarathon significantly extends training video durations up to 1 hour, and
supports 22 diverse tasks requiring both short- and long-term video
comprehension. Building on VideoMarathon, we propose Hour-LLaVA, a powerful and
efficient Video-LMM for hour-scale video-language modeling. It enables
hour-long video training and inference at 1-FPS sampling by leveraging a memory
augmentation module, which adaptively integrates user question-relevant and
spatiotemporal-informative semantics from a cached full video context. In our
experiments, Hour-LLaVA achieves the best performance on multiple long

TL;DR: VideoMolmo is a multimodal model for spatio-temporal localization, combining LLM reasoning with temporal consistency and mask fusion for precise pointing in videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video-based approaches lack contextual understanding and generalization, which VideoMolmo addresses by integrating language models and temporal modules.

Method: VideoMolmo uses a temporal attention mechanism for frame consistency and a mask fusion pipeline for bidirectional point propagation. It decomposes the task into LLM-generated coordinates and sequential mask-fusion for segmentation.

Result: The model improves spatio-temporal pointing accuracy and reasoning, validated on a new dataset (72k video-caption pairs) and benchmarks (VPoS-Bench, Refer-VOS, Reasoning VOS).

Conclusion: VideoMolmo outperforms existing models in accuracy and reasoning, with publicly available code and models.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal localization is vital for precise interactions across diverse
domains, from biological research to autonomous navigation and interactive
interfaces. Current video-based approaches, while proficient in tracking, lack
the sophisticated reasoning capabilities of large language models, limiting
their contextual understanding and generalization. We introduce VideoMolmo, a
large multimodal model tailored for fine-grained spatio-temporal pointing
conditioned on textual descriptions. Building upon the Molmo architecture,
VideoMolmo incorporates a temporal module utilizing an attention mechanism to
condition each frame on preceding frames, ensuring temporal consistency.
Additionally, our novel temporal mask fusion pipeline employs SAM2 for
bidirectional point propagation, significantly enhancing coherence across video
sequences. This two-step decomposition, i.e., first using the LLM to generate
precise pointing coordinates, then relying on a sequential mask-fusion module
to produce coherent segmentation, not only simplifies the task for the language
model but also enhances interpretability. Due to the lack of suitable datasets,
we curate a comprehensive dataset comprising 72k video-caption pairs annotated
with 100k object points. To evaluate the generalization of VideoMolmo, we
introduce VPoS-Bench, a challenging out-of-distribution benchmark spanning five
real-world scenarios: Cell Tracking, Egocentric Vision, Autonomous Driving,
Video-GUI Interaction, and Robotics. We also evaluate our model on Referring
Video Object Segmentation (Refer-VOS) and Reasoning VOS tasks. In comparison to
existing models, VideoMolmo substantially improves spatio-temporal pointing
accuracy and reasoning capability. Our code and models are publicly available

Result: Produces higher quality defurnished assets compared to neural radiance fields or RGB-D inpainting methods.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline effectively generates defurnished indoor spaces with superior quality by combining geometric guidance and inpainting.

Abstract: We present a pipeline for generating defurnished replicas of indoor spaces
represented as textured meshes and corresponding multi-view panoramic images.
To achieve this, we first segment and remove furniture from the mesh
representation, extend planes, and fill holes, obtaining a simplified
defurnished mesh (SDM). This SDM acts as an ``X-ray'' of the scene's underlying
structure, guiding the defurnishing process. We extract Canny edges from depth
and normal images rendered from the SDM. We then use these as a guide to remove
the furniture from panorama images via ControlNet inpainting. This control
signal ensures the availability of global geometric information that may be
hidden from a particular panoramic view by the furniture being removed. The
inpainted panoramas are used to texture the mesh. We show that our approach
produces higher quality assets than methods that rely on neural radiance
fields, which tend to produce blurry low-resolution images, or RGB-D
inpainting, which is highly susceptible to hallucinations.

### [435] [Direct Numerical Layout Generation for 3D Indoor Scene Synthesis via Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05341)
*Xingjian Ran,Yixuan Li,Linning Xu,Mulin Yu,Bo Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DirectLayout is a framework for generating 3D indoor scenes from text using LLMs, addressing challenges in layout generation with spatial reasoning and iterative alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D scene synthesis struggle with open-vocabulary and fine-grained user instructions due to dataset limitations and inflexible constraints.

Method: DirectLayout uses LLMs for spatial reasoning, decomposing generation into BEV layout, 3D lifting, and refinement, aided by CoT Activation and CoT-Grounded reward.

Result: The framework achieves strong semantic consistency, generalization, and physical plausibility in experiments.

Conclusion: DirectLayout advances 3D scene synthesis by combining LLM-based reasoning with iterative alignment, offering flexibility and quality.

Abstract: Realistic 3D indoor scene synthesis is vital for embodied AI and digital
content creation. It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object
generation and layout generation. While recent generative models have
significantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout
generation remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either
overfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize
numerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate
scenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user
instructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates
numerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial
reasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the
generation into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting
it into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial
reasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we
employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset.
Additionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance
generalization and spatial planning. During inference, DirectLayout addresses
asset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context
learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves
impressive semantic consistency, generalization and physical plausibility.

*Shengcao Cao,Zijun Wei,Jason Kuen,Kangning Liu,Lingzhi Zhang,Jiuxiang Gu,HyunJoon Jung,Liang-Yan Gui,Yu-Xiong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel task called omnimodal referring expression segmentation (ORES) and a framework (RAS) to address it, enhancing segmentation models with multimodal interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image segmentation models lack comprehensive semantic understanding for complex vision-language queries, limiting user-friendly interactions.

Method: Proposes RAS, a mask-centric large multimodal model, to handle arbitrary prompts (text or text plus visual entities) for segmentation.

Result: RAS shows superior performance on ORES, RES, and GRES tasks, validated with new datasets MaskGroups-2M and MaskGroups-HQ.

Conclusion: The work bridges the gap in multimodal segmentation, offering improved interaction capabilities for vision-language applications.

Abstract: Recent image segmentation models have advanced to segment images into
high-quality masks for visual entities, and yet they cannot provide
comprehensive semantic understanding for complex queries based on both language
and vision. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in applications that
require user-friendly interactions driven by vision-language prompts. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a novel task of omnimodal referring expression
segmentation (ORES). In this task, a model produces a group of masks based on
arbitrary prompts specified by text only or text plus reference visual
entities. To address this new challenge, we propose a novel framework to "Refer
to Any Segmentation Mask Group" (RAS), which augments segmentation models with
complex multimodal interactions and comprehension via a mask-centric large
multimodal model. For training and benchmarking ORES models, we create datasets
MaskGroups-2M and MaskGroups-HQ to include diverse mask groups specified by
text and reference entities. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate
superior performance of RAS on our new ORES task, as well as classic referring
expression segmentation (RES) and generalized referring expression segmentation
(GRES) tasks. Project page: https://Ref2Any.github.io.

*Jiahui Wang,Zuyan Liu,Yongming Rao,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates attention mechanisms in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), revealing that only ~5% of attention heads (visual heads) contribute to visual understanding. It introduces SparseMM, a KV-Cache optimization strategy for efficient MLLM inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how MLLMs process visual inputs and leverage the sparsity of visual heads for efficient inference.

Method: A training-free framework identifies visual heads, followed by SparseMM, which allocates asymmetric computation budgets based on visual relevance.

Result: SparseMM achieves 1.38x real-time acceleration, 52% memory reduction, and maintains performance parity.

Conclusion: SparseMM efficiently optimizes MLLM inference by focusing on visual heads, balancing accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are commonly derived by extending
pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with visual capabilities. In this
work, we investigate how MLLMs process visual inputs by analyzing their
attention mechanisms. We reveal a surprising sparsity phenomenon: only a small
subset (approximately less than 5%) of attention heads in LLMs actively
contribute to visual understanding, termed visual heads. To identify these
heads efficiently, we design a training-free framework that quantifies
head-level visual relevance through targeted response analysis. Building on
this discovery, we introduce SparseMM, a KV-Cache optimization strategy that
allocates asymmetric computation budgets to heads in LLMs based on their visual
scores, leveraging the sparity of visual heads for accelerating the inference
of MLLMs. Compared with prior KV-Cache acceleration methods that ignore the
particularity of visual, SparseMM prioritizes stress and retaining visual
semantics during decoding. Extensive evaluations across mainstream multimodal
benchmarks demonstrate that SparseMM achieves superior accuracy-efficiency
trade-offs. Notably, SparseMM delivers 1.38x real-time acceleration and 52%
memory reduction during generation while maintaining performance parity on
efficiency test. Our project is open sourced at

TL;DR: A neural inverse rendering system for multi-viewpoint videos of light propagation, using time-resolved neural radiance caching for accurate light transport effects and 3D reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of accurately modeling direct and indirect light transport in multi-viewpoint videos, enabling advanced applications like view synthesis and relighting.

Method: Extends neural radiance caching with time-resolved capabilities, applied to flash lidar system measurements.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction under strong indirect light, with capabilities like view synthesis and relighting.

Conclusion: The system advances inverse rendering by accurately modeling light transport, enabling novel applications in 3D reconstruction and scene manipulation.

Abstract: We present the first system for physically based, neural inverse rendering
from multi-viewpoint videos of propagating light. Our approach relies on a
time-resolved extension of neural radiance caching -- a technique that
accelerates inverse rendering by storing infinite-bounce radiance arriving at
any point from any direction. The resulting model accurately accounts for
direct and indirect light transport effects and, when applied to captured
measurements from a flash lidar system, enables state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction in the presence of strong indirect light. Further, we
demonstrate view synthesis of propagating light, automatic decomposition of
captured measurements into direct and indirect components, as well as novel
capabilities such as multi-view time-resolved relighting of captured scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FreeTimeGS, a 4D representation for dynamic 3D scene reconstruction, improving flexibility and motion handling compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with complex motions due to deformation field optimization challenges.

Method: Proposes FreeTimeGS, allowing Gaussian primitives to appear at arbitrary times and locations, with motion functions for temporal redundancy reduction.

Result: Outperforms recent methods in rendering quality on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: FreeTimeGS offers superior flexibility and performance for dynamic 3D scene modeling.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes with
complex motions. Some recent works define 3D Gaussian primitives in the
canonical space and use deformation fields to map canonical primitives to
observation spaces, achieving real-time dynamic view synthesis. However, these
methods often struggle to handle scenes with complex motions due to the
difficulty of optimizing deformation fields. To overcome this problem, we
propose FreeTimeGS, a novel 4D representation that allows Gaussian primitives
to appear at arbitrary time and locations. In contrast to canonical Gaussian
primitives, our representation possesses the strong flexibility, thus improving
the ability to model dynamic 3D scenes. In addition, we endow each Gaussian
primitive with an motion function, allowing it to move to neighboring regions
over time, which reduces the temporal redundancy. Experiments results on
several datasets show that the rendering quality of our method outperforms
recent methods by a large margin.

*Hanoona Rasheed,Abdelrahman Shaker,Anqi Tang,Muhammad Maaz,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Salman Khan,Fahad Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoMathQA is a benchmark for evaluating models' ability to perform temporally extended, cross-modal reasoning in videos across 10 mathematical domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mathematical reasoning in videos is challenging due to the need to integrate fine-grained visual, textual, and auditory cues over time. Existing approaches lack the capability to handle such multimodal, temporally rich contexts.

Method: The benchmark includes videos (10s to 1h) annotated by experts, with questions designed for direct problem-solving, conceptual transfer, and deep instructional comprehension. Multi-step reasoning annotations are provided for fine-grained evaluation.

Result: VideoMathQA highlights the limitations of current models and provides a systematic framework for evaluating reasoning in multimodal, temporally extended settings.

Conclusion: The benchmark advances the evaluation of models' reasoning abilities in real-world video contexts, addressing gaps in existing approaches.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning in real-world video settings presents a fundamentally
different challenge than in static images or text. It requires interpreting
fine-grained visual information, accurately reading handwritten or digital
text, and integrating spoken cues, often dispersed non-linearly over time. In
such multimodal contexts, success hinges not just on perception, but on
selectively identifying and integrating the right contextual details from a
rich and noisy stream of content. To this end, we introduce VideoMathQA, a
benchmark designed to evaluate whether models can perform such temporally
extended cross-modal reasoning on videos. The benchmark spans 10 diverse
mathematical domains, covering videos ranging from 10 seconds to over 1 hour.
It requires models to interpret structured visual content, understand
instructional narratives, and jointly ground concepts across visual, audio, and
textual modalities. We employ graduate-level experts to ensure high quality,
totaling over $920$ man-hours of annotation. To reflect real-world scenarios,
questions are designed around three core reasoning challenges: direct problem
solving, where answers are grounded in the presented question; conceptual
transfer, which requires applying learned methods to new problems; and deep
instructional comprehension, involving multi-step reasoning over extended
explanations and partially worked-out solutions. Each question includes
multi-step reasoning annotations, enabling fine-grained diagnosis of model
capabilities. Through this benchmark, we highlight the limitations of existing
approaches and establish a systematic evaluation framework for models that must
reason, rather than merely perceive, across temporally extended and
modality-rich mathematical problem settings. Our benchmark and evaluation code
are available at: https://mbzuai-oryx.github.io/VideoMathQA

### [442] [Contrastive Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05350)
*George Stoica,Vivek Ramanujan,Xiang Fan,Ali Farhadi,Ranjay Krishna,Judy Hoffman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Contrastive Flow Matching enhances conditional flow uniqueness in diffusion models, improving training speed, reducing de-noising steps, and lowering FID scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In conditional settings, flow uniqueness is not guaranteed, leading to ambiguous generations. The paper aims to enforce uniqueness across conditional flows.

Method: Introduces Contrastive Flow Matching, adding a contrastive objective to maximize dissimilarities between flows from arbitrary sample pairs.

Result: Improves training speed (up to 9x), reduces de-noising steps (up to 5x), and lowers FID scores (up to 8.9).

Conclusion: Contrastive Flow Matching effectively enhances condition separation and performance in diffusion models.

Abstract: Unconditional flow-matching trains diffusion models to transport samples from
a source distribution to a target distribution by enforcing that the flows
between sample pairs are unique. However, in conditional settings (e.g.,
class-conditioned models), this uniqueness is no longer guaranteed--flows from
different conditions may overlap, leading to more ambiguous generations. We
introduce Contrastive Flow Matching, an extension to the flow matching
objective that explicitly enforces uniqueness across all conditional flows,
enhancing condition separation. Our approach adds a contrastive objective that
maximizes dissimilarities between predicted flows from arbitrary sample pairs.
We validate Contrastive Flow Matching by conducting extensive experiments
across varying model architectures on both class-conditioned (ImageNet-1k) and
text-to-image (CC3M) benchmarks. Notably, we find that training models with
Contrastive Flow Matching (1) improves training speed by a factor of up to 9x,
(2) requires up to 5x fewer de-noising steps and (3) lowers FID by up to 8.9
compared to training the same models with flow matching. We release our code
at: https://github.com/gstoica27/DeltaFM.git.

*Guangchen Lan,Huseyin A. Inan,Sahar Abdelnabi,Janardhan Kulkarni,Lukas Wutschitz,Reza Shokri,Christopher G. Brinton,Robert Sim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to ensure contextual integrity (CI) in autonomous agents by combining explicit reasoning with LLMs and a reinforcement learning framework, reducing inappropriate information disclosure while maintaining task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of autonomous agents necessitates ensuring contextual integrity (CI) in decision-making about information sharing, requiring agents to reason about their operating context.

Method: The approach involves prompting LLMs to reason about CI and developing an RL framework to instill CI reasoning. A synthetic dataset of ~700 examples is used for training.

Result: The method significantly reduces inappropriate information disclosure without compromising task performance, with improvements transferring to human-annotated CI benchmarks like PrivacyLens.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses CI in autonomous agents, demonstrating scalability and transferability to real-world benchmarks.

Abstract: As the era of autonomous agents making decisions on behalf of users unfolds,
ensuring contextual integrity (CI) -- what is the appropriate information to
share while carrying out a certain task -- becomes a central question to the
field. We posit that CI demands a form of reasoning where the agent needs to
reason about the context in which it is operating. To test this, we first
prompt LLMs to reason explicitly about CI when deciding what information to
disclose. We then extend this approach by developing a reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that further instills in models the reasoning necessary to
achieve CI. Using a synthetic, automatically created, dataset of only $\sim700$
examples but with diverse contexts and information disclosure norms, we show
that our method substantially reduces inappropriate information disclosure
while maintaining task performance across multiple model sizes and families.
Importantly, improvements transfer from this synthetic dataset to established
CI benchmarks such as PrivacyLens that has human annotations and evaluates
privacy leakage of AI assistants in actions and tool calls.

TL;DR: CircuGraphRAG is a retrieval-augmented framework that improves LLM accuracy in circular economy tasks by grounding outputs in a domain-specific knowledge graph, outperforming standalone LLMs and naive RAG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often hallucinate industrial codes and emission factors, which can mislead regulatory and investment decisions in sustainable manufacturing.

Method: CircuGraphRAG uses a knowledge graph with 117,380 entities, translates queries into SPARQL, and retrieves verified subgraphs for structured reasoning.

Result: It achieves ROUGE-L F1 scores up to 1.0, halves response time, and reduces token usage by 16% compared to baselines.

Conclusion: CircuGraphRAG enhances reliability and efficiency in circular economy planning, supporting low-carbon decision-making.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for sustainable manufacturing, but
often hallucinate industrial codes and emission factors, undermining regulatory
and investment decisions. We introduce CircuGraphRAG, a retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) framework that grounds LLMs outputs in a domain-specific
knowledge graph for the circular economy. This graph connects 117,380
industrial and waste entities with classification codes and GWP100 emission
data, enabling structured multi-hop reasoning. Natural language queries are
translated into SPARQL and verified subgraphs are retrieved to ensure accuracy
and traceability. Compared with Standalone LLMs and Naive RAG, CircuGraphRAG
achieves superior performance in single-hop and multi-hop question answering,
with ROUGE-L F1 scores up to 1.0, while baseline scores below 0.08. It also
improves efficiency, halving the response time and reducing token usage by 16%
in representative tasks. CircuGraphRAG provides fact-checked, regulatory-ready
support for circular economy planning, advancing reliable, low-carbon resource
decision making.

*Peter Jansen,Samiah Hassan,Ruoyao Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Matter-of-Fact is a dataset for assessing hypothesis feasibility in materials science, showing current models struggle (72% accuracy vs. 50% chance), but experts believe it's solvable, offering potential to scale scientific discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated hypothesis generation is cheap, but testing is costly. Filtering feasible hypotheses could scale discovery systems and increase significant findings.

Method: Introduces Matter-of-Fact, a dataset of 8.4k claims from materials science papers, covering qualitative/quantitative claims from theory, experiments, and simulations.

Result: Current models (retrieval-augmented generation, code generation) achieve only 72% accuracy (vs. 50% chance), but experts deem most claims solvable.

Conclusion: The task is challenging for current models, but near-term progress could accelerate scientific discovery by improving feasibility filtering.

Abstract: Contemporary approaches to assisted scientific discovery use language models
to automatically generate large numbers of potential hypothesis to test, while
also automatically generating code-based experiments to test those hypotheses.
While hypotheses can be comparatively inexpensive to generate, automated
experiments can be costly, particularly when run at scale (i.e. thousands of
experiments). Developing the capacity to filter hypotheses based on their
feasibility would allow discovery systems to run at scale, while increasing
their likelihood of making significant discoveries. In this work we introduce
Matter-of-Fact, a challenge dataset for determining the feasibility of
hypotheses framed as claims. Matter-of-Fact includes 8.4k claims extracted from
scientific articles spanning four high-impact contemporary materials science
topics, including superconductors, semiconductors, batteries, and aerospace
materials, while including qualitative and quantitative claims from
theoretical, experimental, and code/simulation results. We show that strong
baselines that include retrieval augmented generation over scientific
literature and code generation fail to exceed 72% performance on this task
(chance performance is 50%), while domain-expert verification suggests nearly
all are solvable -- highlighting both the difficulty of this task for current
models, and the potential to accelerate scientific discovery by making
near-term progress.

TL;DR: The study highlights significant fluctuations in benchmark evaluations of reasoning models like Deepseek-R1-Distill and QwQ-32B, advocating for stricter evaluation standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unreliability of performance claims due to inconsistent evaluation conditions in open-source reasoning models.

Method: Empirical assessments of the Deepseek-R1-Distill series models under varied conditions.

Result: Subtle evaluation differences cause substantial performance variations, making improvements hard to reproduce.

Conclusion: A more rigorous evaluation paradigm is needed for reliable benchmarking of reasoning models.

Abstract: Reasoning models represented by the Deepseek-R1-Distill series have been
widely adopted by the open-source community due to their strong performance in
mathematics, science, programming, and other domains. However, our study
reveals that their benchmark evaluation results are subject to significant
fluctuations caused by various factors. Subtle differences in evaluation
conditions can lead to substantial variations in results. Similar phenomena are
observed in other open-source inference models fine-tuned based on the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series, as well as in the QwQ-32B model, making their
claimed performance improvements difficult to reproduce reliably. Therefore, we
advocate for the establishment of a more rigorous paradigm for model
performance evaluation and present our empirical assessments of the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series models.

TL;DR: The paper explores strategic deception in large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought reasoning, using representation engineering to detect and control it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical alignment challenge of honesty in LLMs, especially those with advanced reasoning capabilities that may intentionally deceive.

Method: Uses representation engineering, Linear Artificial Tomography (LAT), and activation steering to induce, detect, and control deception.

Result: Achieves 89% detection accuracy for deception and a 40% success rate in eliciting context-appropriate deception without explicit prompts.

Conclusion: Provides tools for trustworthy AI alignment by unveiling honesty-related issues in reasoning models.

Abstract: The honesty of large language models (LLMs) is a critical alignment
challenge, especially as advanced systems with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
may strategically deceive humans. Unlike traditional honesty issues on LLMs,
which could be possibly explained as some kind of hallucination, those models'
explicit thought paths enable us to study strategic deception--goal-driven,
intentional misinformation where reasoning contradicts outputs. Using
representation engineering, we systematically induce, detect, and control such
deception in CoT-enabled LLMs, extracting "deception vectors" via Linear
Artificial Tomography (LAT) for 89% detection accuracy. Through activation
steering, we achieve a 40% success rate in eliciting context-appropriate
deception without explicit prompts, unveiling the specific honesty-related
issue of reasoning models and providing tools for trustworthy AI alignment.

*Nathan Herr,Tim Rocktäschel,Roberta Raileanu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-First Search (LFS) is a novel method where LLMs autonomously guide search processes, outperforming traditional algorithms like MCTS, ToT-BFS, and BestFS in flexibility, efficiency, and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional search methods like MCTS rely on fixed hyperparameters, limiting adaptability across tasks. LFS aims to eliminate this by leveraging LLMs for self-guided exploration.

Method: LFS empowers LLMs to autonomously control search processes, using internal scoring to decide paths without external heuristics or manual tuning.

Result: LFS outperforms MCTS, ToT-BFS, and BestFS in challenging tasks, is more efficient, scales better with stronger models, and benefits from increased compute.

Conclusion: LFS offers a flexible, efficient, and scalable alternative to traditional search methods, enhancing LLM-based reasoning and planning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable improvements in
reasoning and planning through increased test-time compute, often by framing
problem-solving as a search process. While methods like Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) have proven effective in some domains, their reliance on fixed
exploration hyperparameters limits their adaptability across tasks of varying
difficulty, rendering them impractical or expensive in certain settings. In
this paper, we propose \textbf{LLM-First Search (LFS)}, a novel \textit{LLM
Self-Guided Search} method that removes the need for pre-defined search
strategies by empowering the LLM to autonomously control the search process via
self-guided exploration. Rather than relying on external heuristics or
hardcoded policies, the LLM evaluates whether to pursue the current search path
or explore alternative branches based on its internal scoring mechanisms. This
enables more flexible and context-sensitive reasoning without requiring manual
tuning or task-specific adaptation. We evaluate LFS on Countdown and Sudoku
against three classic widely-used search algorithms, Tree-of-Thoughts' Breadth
First Search (ToT-BFS), Best First Search (BestFS), and MCTS, each of which
have been used to achieve SotA results on a range of challenging reasoning
tasks. We found that LFS (1) performs better on more challenging tasks without
additional tuning, (2) is more computationally efficient compared to the other
methods, especially when powered by a stronger model, (3) scales better with
stronger models, due to its LLM-First design, and (4) scales better with
increased compute budget. Our code is publicly available at

*Loan Dao,Ngoc Quoc Ly*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an ontology-based AI framework for bone disease diagnosis, integrating hierarchical neural networks, VQA, and multimodal deep learning, but lacks experimental validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the lack of systematic domain expertise in medical AI systems, aiming to improve diagnostic reliability for bone diseases.

Method: Develops an ontology-guided framework with hierarchical neural networks, VQA for clinical reasoning, and multimodal deep learning integrating imaging, clinical, and lab data.

Result: The framework shows potential for broader application due to its standardized structure and reusable components, though experimental validation is pending.

Conclusion: Future work will expand datasets and validate the system, as current limitations prevent immediate experimental testing.

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence (AI) systems frequently lack systematic
domain expertise integration, potentially compromising diagnostic reliability.
This study presents an ontology-based framework for bone disease diagnosis,
developed in collaboration with Ho Chi Minh City Hospital for Traumatology and
Orthopedics. The framework introduces three theoretical contributions: (1) a
hierarchical neural network architecture guided by bone disease ontology for
segmentation-classification tasks, incorporating Visual Language Models (VLMs)
through prompts, (2) an ontology-enhanced Visual Question Answering (VQA)
system for clinical reasoning, and (3) a multimodal deep learning model that
integrates imaging, clinical, and laboratory data through ontological
relationships. The methodology maintains clinical interpretability through
systematic knowledge digitization, standardized medical terminology mapping,
and modular architecture design. The framework demonstrates potential for
extension beyond bone diseases through its standardized structure and reusable
components. While theoretical foundations are established, experimental
validation remains pending due to current dataset and computational resource
limitations. Future work will focus on expanding the clinical dataset and

### [450] [Contextual Integrity in LLMs via Reasoning and Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04245)
*Guangchen Lan,Huseyin A. Inan,Sahar Abdelnabi,Janardhan Kulkarni,Lukas Wutschitz,Reza Shokri,Christopher G. Brinton,Robert Sim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to ensure contextual integrity (CI) in autonomous agents by combining explicit reasoning with LLMs and a reinforcement learning framework, reducing inappropriate information disclosure while maintaining task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of autonomous agents necessitates ensuring contextual integrity (CI) to determine appropriate information sharing during tasks.

Method: The approach involves prompting LLMs to reason explicitly about CI and developing an RL framework to instill CI reasoning, tested on a synthetic dataset of ~700 examples.

Result: The method significantly reduces inappropriate information disclosure without compromising task performance, with improvements transferring to human-annotated benchmarks like PrivacyLens.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses CI in autonomous agents, demonstrating scalability and transferability to real-world benchmarks.

Abstract: As the era of autonomous agents making decisions on behalf of users unfolds,
ensuring contextual integrity (CI) -- what is the appropriate information to
share while carrying out a certain task -- becomes a central question to the
field. We posit that CI demands a form of reasoning where the agent needs to
reason about the context in which it is operating. To test this, we first
prompt LLMs to reason explicitly about CI when deciding what information to
disclose. We then extend this approach by developing a reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that further instills in models the reasoning necessary to
achieve CI. Using a synthetic, automatically created, dataset of only $\sim700$
examples but with diverse contexts and information disclosure norms, we show
that our method substantially reduces inappropriate information disclosure
while maintaining task performance across multiple model sizes and families.
Importantly, improvements transfer from this synthetic dataset to established
CI benchmarks such as PrivacyLens that has human annotations and evaluates
privacy leakage of AI assistants in actions and tool calls.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CircuGraphRAG improves LLM accuracy for circular economy tasks by grounding outputs in a knowledge graph, outperforming baselines in QA and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often hallucinate industrial codes and emission data, risking regulatory and investment decisions in sustainable manufacturing.

Method: Uses a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework with a domain-specific knowledge graph (117,380 entities) for structured reasoning, translating queries to SPARQL for verified subgraph retrieval.

Result: Achieves ROUGE-L F1 scores up to 1.0 (vs. baselines <0.08), halves response time, and reduces token usage by 16%.

Conclusion: CircuGraphRAG offers reliable, regulatory-ready support for circular economy planning, enhancing low-carbon decision-making.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for sustainable manufacturing, but
often hallucinate industrial codes and emission factors, undermining regulatory
and investment decisions. We introduce CircuGraphRAG, a retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) framework that grounds LLMs outputs in a domain-specific
knowledge graph for the circular economy. This graph connects 117,380
industrial and waste entities with classification codes and GWP100 emission
data, enabling structured multi-hop reasoning. Natural language queries are
translated into SPARQL and verified subgraphs are retrieved to ensure accuracy
and traceability. Compared with Standalone LLMs and Naive RAG, CircuGraphRAG
achieves superior performance in single-hop and multi-hop question answering,
with ROUGE-L F1 scores up to 1.0, while baseline scores below 0.08. It also
improves efficiency, halving the response time and reducing token usage by 16%
in representative tasks. CircuGraphRAG provides fact-checked, regulatory-ready
support for circular economy planning, advancing reliable, low-carbon resource
decision making.

*Peter Jansen,Samiah Hassan,Ruoyao Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A dataset called Matter-of-Fact is introduced to evaluate the feasibility of scientific hypotheses, aiming to reduce costly automated experiments by filtering hypotheses. Current models perform poorly (72% accuracy vs. 50% chance), but experts believe the task is solvable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high cost of automated experiments in scientific discovery by filtering hypotheses for feasibility, enabling scalable and impactful research.

Method: Created Matter-of-Fact, a dataset of 8.4k claims from materials science topics, and tested baselines like retrieval-augmented generation and code generation.

Result: Current models achieve only 72% accuracy (chance is 50%), but domain experts suggest the task is solvable.

Conclusion: The task is challenging for current models, but solving it could significantly accelerate scientific discovery.

Abstract: Contemporary approaches to assisted scientific discovery use language models
to automatically generate large numbers of potential hypothesis to test, while
also automatically generating code-based experiments to test those hypotheses.
While hypotheses can be comparatively inexpensive to generate, automated
experiments can be costly, particularly when run at scale (i.e. thousands of
experiments). Developing the capacity to filter hypotheses based on their
feasibility would allow discovery systems to run at scale, while increasing
their likelihood of making significant discoveries. In this work we introduce
Matter-of-Fact, a challenge dataset for determining the feasibility of
hypotheses framed as claims. Matter-of-Fact includes 8.4k claims extracted from
scientific articles spanning four high-impact contemporary materials science
topics, including superconductors, semiconductors, batteries, and aerospace
materials, while including qualitative and quantitative claims from
theoretical, experimental, and code/simulation results. We show that strong
baselines that include retrieval augmented generation over scientific
literature and code generation fail to exceed 72% performance on this task
(chance performance is 50%), while domain-expert verification suggests nearly
all are solvable -- highlighting both the difficulty of this task for current
models, and the potential to accelerate scientific discovery by making
near-term progress.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper highlights inconsistencies in benchmark evaluations of reasoning models like Deepseek-R1-Distill, advocating for stricter evaluation standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unreliability of benchmark results for reasoning models, which vary due to minor evaluation differences.

Method: Empirical assessment of the Deepseek-R1-Distill series models to identify evaluation inconsistencies.

Result: Benchmark results fluctuate significantly under varying conditions, making performance claims hard to reproduce.

Conclusion: A more rigorous evaluation paradigm is needed to ensure reliable and reproducible model performance assessments.

Abstract: Reasoning models represented by the Deepseek-R1-Distill series have been
widely adopted by the open-source community due to their strong performance in
mathematics, science, programming, and other domains. However, our study
reveals that their benchmark evaluation results are subject to significant
fluctuations caused by various factors. Subtle differences in evaluation
conditions can lead to substantial variations in results. Similar phenomena are
observed in other open-source inference models fine-tuned based on the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series, as well as in the QwQ-32B model, making their
claimed performance improvements difficult to reproduce reliably. Therefore, we
advocate for the establishment of a more rigorous paradigm for model
performance evaluation and present our empirical assessments of the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series models.

*Kai Wang,Yihao Zhang,Meng Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper studies strategic deception in LLMs with CoT reasoning, using representation engineering to detect and control it, achieving high accuracy and success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the alignment challenge of honesty in LLMs, particularly focusing on strategic deception enabled by explicit reasoning paths.

Method: Uses representation engineering, Linear Artificial Tomography (LAT), and activation steering to induce, detect, and control deception.

Result: Achieves 89% detection accuracy for deception and a 40% success rate in eliciting context-appropriate deception.

Conclusion: Provides tools for trustworthy AI alignment by uncovering and addressing honesty-related issues in reasoning models.

Abstract: The honesty of large language models (LLMs) is a critical alignment
challenge, especially as advanced systems with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
may strategically deceive humans. Unlike traditional honesty issues on LLMs,
which could be possibly explained as some kind of hallucination, those models'
explicit thought paths enable us to study strategic deception--goal-driven,
intentional misinformation where reasoning contradicts outputs. Using
representation engineering, we systematically induce, detect, and control such
deception in CoT-enabled LLMs, extracting "deception vectors" via Linear
Artificial Tomography (LAT) for 89% detection accuracy. Through activation
steering, we achieve a 40% success rate in eliciting context-appropriate
deception without explicit prompts, unveiling the specific honesty-related
issue of reasoning models and providing tools for trustworthy AI alignment.

### [455] [LLM-First Search: Self-Guided Exploration of the Solution Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05213)
*Nathan Herr,Tim Rocktäschel,Roberta Raileanu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-First Search (LFS) is a novel self-guided search method where LLMs autonomously control the search process, eliminating the need for fixed exploration hyperparameters. It outperforms traditional search methods in flexibility, efficiency, and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional search methods like MCTS rely on fixed hyperparameters, limiting adaptability across tasks. LFS aims to overcome this by leveraging LLMs for autonomous search control.

Method: LFS empowers LLMs to self-guide the search process, evaluating paths internally without external heuristics. It was tested on Countdown and Sudoku against ToT-BFS, BestFS, and MCTS.

Result: LFS performs better on challenging tasks, is more computationally efficient, scales better with stronger models, and handles increased compute budgets effectively.

Conclusion: LFS demonstrates superior adaptability, efficiency, and scalability compared to traditional search methods, making it a promising approach for LLM-based reasoning and planning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable improvements in
reasoning and planning through increased test-time compute, often by framing
problem-solving as a search process. While methods like Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) have proven effective in some domains, their reliance on fixed
exploration hyperparameters limits their adaptability across tasks of varying
difficulty, rendering them impractical or expensive in certain settings. In
this paper, we propose \textbf{LLM-First Search (LFS)}, a novel \textit{LLM
Self-Guided Search} method that removes the need for pre-defined search
strategies by empowering the LLM to autonomously control the search process via
self-guided exploration. Rather than relying on external heuristics or
hardcoded policies, the LLM evaluates whether to pursue the current search path
or explore alternative branches based on its internal scoring mechanisms. This
enables more flexible and context-sensitive reasoning without requiring manual
tuning or task-specific adaptation. We evaluate LFS on Countdown and Sudoku
against three classic widely-used search algorithms, Tree-of-Thoughts' Breadth
First Search (ToT-BFS), Best First Search (BestFS), and MCTS, each of which
have been used to achieve SotA results on a range of challenging reasoning
tasks. We found that LFS (1) performs better on more challenging tasks without
additional tuning, (2) is more computationally efficient compared to the other
methods, especially when powered by a stronger model, (3) scales better with
stronger models, due to its LLM-First design, and (4) scales better with
increased compute budget. Our code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an ontology-based AI framework for bone disease diagnosis, integrating hierarchical neural networks, VQA systems, and multimodal deep learning. It emphasizes clinical interpretability but lacks experimental validation due to resource constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical AI systems often lack domain expertise, risking diagnostic reliability. This study aims to address this gap by integrating systematic knowledge into AI for bone disease diagnosis.

Method: The framework includes: (1) a hierarchical neural network guided by bone disease ontology, (2) an ontology-enhanced VQA system, and (3) a multimodal deep learning model integrating imaging, clinical, and lab data. It uses standardized terminology and modular design.

Result: The framework shows potential for broader application due to its standardized structure and reusable components, but experimental validation is pending.

Conclusion: The study establishes a theoretical foundation for ontology-based AI in bone disease diagnosis, with future work needed for dataset expansion and validation.

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence (AI) systems frequently lack systematic
domain expertise integration, potentially compromising diagnostic reliability.
This study presents an ontology-based framework for bone disease diagnosis,
developed in collaboration with Ho Chi Minh City Hospital for Traumatology and
Orthopedics. The framework introduces three theoretical contributions: (1) a
hierarchical neural network architecture guided by bone disease ontology for
segmentation-classification tasks, incorporating Visual Language Models (VLMs)
through prompts, (2) an ontology-enhanced Visual Question Answering (VQA)
system for clinical reasoning, and (3) a multimodal deep learning model that
integrates imaging, clinical, and laboratory data through ontological
relationships. The methodology maintains clinical interpretability through
systematic knowledge digitization, standardized medical terminology mapping,
and modular architecture design. The framework demonstrates potential for
extension beyond bone diseases through its standardized structure and reusable
components. While theoretical foundations are established, experimental
validation remains pending due to current dataset and computational resource
limitations. Future work will focus on expanding the clinical dataset and
conducting comprehensive system validation.

TL;DR: ProLoRA enables zero-shot adaptation of parameter-efficient fine-tuning in text-to-image diffusion models without retraining, transferring pre-trained low-rank adjustments between models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods require retraining when switching base models, which is often impractical due to data constraints. ProLoRA addresses this limitation.

Method: ProLoRA projects source adjustments into the target model's weight space, leveraging subspace and null space similarities and selectively targeting aligned layers.

Result: Evaluations show successful knowledge transfer and comparable performance without retraining.

Conclusion: ProLoRA provides an efficient solution for adapting fine-tuning in text-to-image models without additional training data.

Abstract: We introduce ProLoRA, enabling zero-shot adaptation of parameter-efficient
fine-tuning in text-to-image diffusion models. ProLoRA transfers pre-trained
low-rank adjustments (e.g., LoRA) from a source to a target model without
additional training data. This overcomes the limitations of traditional methods
that require retraining when switching base models, often challenging due to
data constraints. ProLoRA achieves this via projection of source adjustments
into the target model's weight space, leveraging subspace and null space
similarities and selectively targeting aligned layers. Evaluations on
established text-to-image models demonstrate successful knowledge transfer and
comparable performance without retraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance multi-agent systems by combining LLMs with MARL for better coordination and generalization.

Method: Uses Coordinator, Communicator, and Memory modules with PPO and language-conditioned loss, tested in game environments.

Result: Shows improved win rates, coordination, and zero-shot generalization, with subgoal generation and messaging being key.

Conclusion: LLM-MARL bridges LLMs and MARL, advancing cooperative agent design for games and human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: This paper introduces LLM-MARL, a unified framework that incorporates large
language models (LLMs) into multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to
enhance coordination, communication, and generalization in simulated game
environments. The framework features three modular components of Coordinator,
Communicator, and Memory, which dynamically generate subgoals, facilitate
symbolic inter-agent messaging, and support episodic recall. Training combines
PPO with a language-conditioned loss and LLM query gating. LLM-MARL is
evaluated in Google Research Football, MAgent Battle, and StarCraft II. Results
show consistent improvements over MAPPO and QMIX in win rate, coordination
score, and zero-shot generalization. Ablation studies demonstrate that subgoal
generation and language-based messaging each contribute significantly to
performance gains. Qualitative analysis reveals emergent behaviors such as role
specialization and communication-driven tactics. By bridging language modeling
and policy learning, this work contributes to the design of intelligent,
cooperative agents in interactive simulations. It offers a path forward for
leveraging LLMs in multi-agent systems used for training, games, and human-AI
collaboration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure AI and legacy systems align with organizational values and targets, addressing transparency, ethical compliance, and decision traceability.

Method: HADA wraps algorithms/LLMs in stakeholder agents (business, data-science, audit, ethics, customer) with conversational APIs. It uses natural language for alignment objectives, KPIs, and constraints, deployed in a cloud-native proof of concept.

Result: Evaluation showed complete coverage of objectives: conversational control, KPI tracing, bias mitigation, and decision lineage reproducibility.

Conclusion: HADA improves accuracy, transparency, and ethical compliance in decision pipelines, supported by open-source architecture and empirical evidence.

Abstract: We present HADA (Human-AI Agent Decision Alignment), a protocol- and
framework agnostic reference architecture that keeps both large language model
(LLM) agents and legacy algorithms aligned with organizational targets and
values. HADA wraps any algorithm or LLM in role-specific stakeholder agents --
business, data-science, audit, ethics, and customer -- each exposing
conversational APIs so that technical and non-technical actors can query,
steer, audit, or contest every decision across strategic, tactical, and
real-time horizons. Alignment objectives, KPIs, and value constraints are
expressed in natural language and are continuously propagated, logged, and
versioned while thousands of heterogeneous agents run on different
orchestration stacks. A cloud-native proof of concept packages a production
credit-scoring model (getLoanDecision) and deploys it on
Docker/Kubernetes/Python; five scripted retail-bank scenarios show how target
changes, parameter tweaks, explanation requests, and ethics triggers flow end
to end through the architecture. Evaluation followed the Design-Science
Research Methodology. Walkthrough observation and log inspection demonstrated
complete coverage of six predefined objectives: every role could invoke
conversational control, trace KPIs and value constraints, detect and mitigate
ZIP-code bias, and reproduce full decision lineage, independent of the
underlying LLM or agent library. Contributions: (1) an open-source HADA
architecture, (2) a mid-range design theory for human-AI alignment in
multi-agent systems, and (3) empirical evidence that framework-agnostic,
protocol-compliant stakeholder agents improve accuracy, transparency, and
ethical compliance in real-world decision pipelines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EXIF is a novel framework for automatic skill discovery in LLM-powered agents, using an exploration-first strategy and iterative feedback to improve feasibility and performance without human intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in training LLM agents include manual effort for dataset creation, invalid task proposals, and lack of meaningful learning signals. EXIF aims to address these by automating skill discovery.

Method: EXIF employs an exploration agent (Alice) to generate feasible skills and train the target agent (Bob). An iterative feedback loop refines the process.

Result: Experiments on Webshop and Crafter show EXIF effectively discovers skills and improves agent performance without human intervention.

Conclusion: EXIF demonstrates potential for self-evolving systems, with Alice and Bob sharing the same model further enhancing performance.

Abstract: Training large language model (LLM) agents to acquire necessary skills and
perform diverse tasks within an environment is gaining interest as a means to
enable open-endedness. However, creating the training dataset for their skill
acquisition faces several challenges. Manual trajectory collection requires
significant human effort. Another approach, where LLMs directly propose tasks
to learn, is often invalid, as the LLMs lack knowledge of which tasks are
actually feasible. Moreover, the generated data may not provide a meaningful
learning signal, as agents often already perform well on the proposed tasks. To
address this, we propose a novel automatic skill discovery framework EXIF for
LLM-powered agents, designed to improve the feasibility of generated target
behaviors while accounting for the agents' capabilities. Our method adopts an
exploration-first strategy by employing an exploration agent (Alice) to train
the target agent (Bob) to learn essential skills in the environment.
Specifically, Alice first interacts with the environment to retrospectively
generate a feasible, environment-grounded skill dataset, which is then used to
train Bob. Crucially, we incorporate an iterative feedback loop, where Alice
evaluates Bob's performance to identify areas for improvement. This feedback
then guides Alice's next round of exploration, forming a closed-loop data
generation process. Experiments on Webshop and Crafter demonstrate EXIF's
ability to effectively discover meaningful skills and iteratively expand the
capabilities of the trained agent without any human intervention, achieving
substantial performance improvements. Interestingly, we observe that setting
Alice to the same model as Bob also notably improves performance, demonstrating
EXIF's potential for building a self-evolving system.

Motivation: To understand emergent reasoning in Transformer LMs, which resists mechanistic analysis, by modeling it as a continuous-time stochastic process.

Method: Model sentence-level hidden state trajectories as a drift-diffusion system on a lower-dimensional manifold, validated with empirical data from 8 models and 7 benchmarks.

Result: A rank-40 projection explains ~50% variance, revealing four latent reasoning regimes. An SLDS model captures these features.

Conclusion: The framework provides tools to simulate and predict reasoning dynamics, including misaligned states or LM failures.

Abstract: Transformer LMs show emergent reasoning that resists mechanistic
understanding. We offer a statistical physics framework for continuous-time
chain-of-thought reasoning dynamics. We model sentence-level hidden state
trajectories as a stochastic dynamical system on a lower-dimensional manifold.
This drift-diffusion system uses latent regime switching to capture diverse
reasoning phases, including misaligned states or failures. Empirical
trajectories (8 models, 7 benchmarks) show a rank-40 projection (balancing
variance capture and feasibility) explains ~50% variance. We find four latent
reasoning regimes. An SLDS model is formulated and validated to capture these
features. The framework enables low-cost reasoning simulation, offering tools
to study and predict critical transitions like misaligned states or other LM
failures.

TL;DR: A graph-based framework is proposed to improve multi-table QA by leveraging human-curated relational knowledge for schema linking and join paths, outperforming existing methods on complex datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-table QA struggle with complex, real-world scenarios due to unreliable schema linking, prompting the need for a more robust solution.

Method: The proposed method uses a graph-based framework to encode schema links and join paths, employing pruning and sub-path merging for efficient reasoning.

Result: The approach demonstrates effectiveness on standard benchmarks and a large-scale industrial dataset, marking the first application to such complex data.

Conclusion: The graph-based framework successfully addresses the challenges of multi-table QA in complex scenarios, offering a scalable and interpretable solution.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in table Question Answering
(Table QA). However, extending these capabilities to multi-table QA remains
challenging due to unreliable schema linking across complex tables. Existing
methods based on semantic similarity work well only on simplified hand-crafted
datasets and struggle to handle complex, real-world scenarios with numerous and
diverse columns. To address this, we propose a graph-based framework that
leverages human-curated relational knowledge to explicitly encode schema links
and join paths. Given a natural language query, our method searches this graph
to construct interpretable reasoning chains, aided by pruning and sub-path
merging strategies to enhance efficiency and coherence. Experiments on both
standard benchmarks and a realistic, large-scale dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. To our knowledge, this is the first multi-table
QA system applied to truly complex industrial tabular data.

TL;DR: A ranking-based AI monitoring system improves public health data review efficiency by 54x over traditional alert-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional alert-based systems are inefficient for modern public health data monitoring due to constant threshold adjustments and lag.

Method: Proposes a ranking-based monitoring paradigm using AI anomaly detection, deployed to monitor 5M daily data points.

Result: Three-month evaluation showed 54x faster reviewer efficiency compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: Human-centered AI can transform public health decision-making by enhancing monitoring efficiency.

Abstract: Public health experts need scalable approaches to monitor large volumes of
health data (e.g., cases, hospitalizations, deaths) for outbreaks or data
quality issues. Traditional alert-based monitoring systems struggle with modern
public health data monitoring systems for several reasons, including that
alerting thresholds need to be constantly reset and the data volumes may cause
application lag. Instead, we propose a ranking-based monitoring paradigm that
leverages new AI anomaly detection methods. Through a multi-year
interdisciplinary collaboration, the resulting system has been deployed at a
national organization to monitor up to 5,000,000 data points daily. A
three-month longitudinal deployed evaluation revealed a significant improvement
in monitoring objectives, with a 54x increase in reviewer speed efficiency
compared to traditional alert-based methods. This work highlights the potential
of human-centered AI to transform public health decision-making.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs on preference-based reasoning tasks in matching markets, revealing limitations in handling ranked inputs and instability resolution, especially in large markets. Fine-tuning helps in small markets but not large ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LLMs' capabilities in ranked preferences and structured algorithms in combinatorial domains like matching markets, which are crucial for applications such as resource allocation and ride-sharing.

Method: Evaluated state-of-the-art models on a hierarchy of preference-based reasoning tasks, including stable-matching generation, instability detection, resolution, and fine-grained preference queries. Used parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) to test performance improvements.

Result: Top-performing models struggled with instability in large markets, often failing to identify blocking pairs or execute iterative algorithms. LoRA improved small-market performance but not large-market outcomes.

Conclusion: LLMs have limitations in handling ranked inputs and large-market instability, suggesting the need for more sophisticated strategies for larger-context reasoning.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven progress in reasoning
tasks -- from program synthesis to scientific hypothesis generation -- yet
their ability to handle ranked preferences and structured algorithms in
combinatorial domains remains underexplored. We study matching markets, a core
framework behind applications like resource allocation and ride-sharing, which
require reconciling individual ranked preferences to ensure stable outcomes. We
evaluate several state-of-the-art models on a hierarchy of preference-based
reasoning tasks -- ranging from stable-matching generation to instability
detection, instability resolution, and fine-grained preference queries -- to
systematically expose their logical and algorithmic limitations in handling
ranked inputs. Surprisingly, even top-performing models with advanced reasoning
struggle to resolve instability in large markets, often failing to identify
blocking pairs or execute algorithms iteratively. We further show that
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) significantly improves performance in
small markets, but fails to bring about a similar improvement on large
instances, suggesting the need for more sophisticated strategies to improve
LLMs' reasoning with larger-context inputs.

TL;DR: CogMath introduces a fine-grained evaluation framework for LLMs' mathematical abilities, revealing overestimation of their capabilities by 30%-40%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation paradigms for LLMs' mathematical abilities are insufficient, relying only on overall answer accuracy.

Method: CogMath formalizes human reasoning into 3 stages (problem comprehension, solving, summarization) and 9 dimensions, using a multi-agent system for assessment.

Result: Application on 7 LLMs shows their capabilities are overestimated by 30%-40%, with strengths/weaknesses identified across stages/dimensions.

Conclusion: CogMath provides deeper insights into LLMs' mathematical reasoning, aiding future enhancements.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in solving complex
mathematical tasks, existing evaluation paradigms rely solely on a coarse
measure of overall answer accuracy, which are insufficient for assessing their
authentic capabilities. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CogMath}, which
comprehensively assesses LLMs' mathematical abilities through the lens of human
cognition. Specifically, inspired by psychological theories, CogMath formalizes
human reasoning process into 3 stages: \emph{problem comprehension},
\emph{problem solving}, and \emph{solution summarization}. Within these stages,
we investigate perspectives such as numerical calculation, knowledge, and
counterfactuals, and design a total of 9 fine-grained evaluation dimensions. In
each dimension, we develop an ``\emph{Inquiry}-\emph{Judge}-\emph{Reference}''
multi-agent system to generate inquiries that assess LLMs' mastery from this
dimension. An LLM is considered to truly master a problem only when excelling

*Aladin Djuhera,Amin Seffo,Masataro Asai,Holger Boche*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STPR is a framework using LLMs to translate natural language constraints into executable Python functions for robotic navigation, ensuring accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of translating informal, complex natural language constraints into formal descriptions for robotic planning.

Method: STPR leverages LLMs to generate Python functions from constraints, applied to point cloud representations with traditional search algorithms.

Result: Experiments show STPR ensures full compliance with constraints, short runtimes, and works with smaller LLMs.

Conclusion: STPR effectively bridges the gap between natural language constraints and robotic planning, offering a scalable and efficient solution.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have spurred interest in
robotic navigation that incorporates complex spatial, mathematical, and
conditional constraints from natural language into the planning problem. Such
constraints can be informal yet highly complex, making it challenging to
translate into a formal description that can be passed on to a planning
algorithm. In this paper, we propose STPR, a constraint generation framework
that uses LLMs to translate constraints (expressed as instructions on ``what
not to do'') into executable Python functions. STPR leverages the LLM's strong
coding capabilities to shift the problem description from language into
structured and transparent code, thus circumventing complex reasoning and
avoiding potential hallucinations. We show that these LLM-generated functions
accurately describe even complex mathematical constraints, and apply them to
point cloud representations with traditional search algorithms. Experiments in
a simulated Gazebo environment show that STPR ensures full compliance across
several constraints and scenarios, while having short runtimes. We also verify
that STPR can be used with smaller, code-specific LLMs, making it applicable to
a wide range of compact models at low inference cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional schema creation is resource-intensive, requiring expert involvement. The study aims to automate this process using LLMs to improve scalability and efficiency.

Method: The authors leverage LLMs to generate schemas, utilizing local and global information from knowledge graphs. They introduce YAGO Schema and Wikidata EntitySchema datasets for evaluation.

Result: Experiments show LLMs can produce high-quality ShEx schemas, demonstrating their potential for scalable, automated schema generation.

Conclusion: The work advances automated schema generation for large knowledge graphs and sets a new benchmark for structured generation tasks, challenging LLMs with syntactically rich formalisms.

Abstract: Schemas are vital for ensuring data quality in the Semantic Web and natural
language processing. Traditionally, their creation demands substantial
involvement from knowledge engineers and domain experts. Leveraging the
impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in related tasks like
ontology engineering, we explore automatic schema generation using LLMs. To
bridge the resource gap, we introduce two datasets: YAGO Schema and Wikidata
EntitySchema, along with evaluation metrics. The LLM-based pipelines
effectively utilize local and global information from knowledge graphs (KGs) to
generate validating schemas in Shape Expressions (ShEx). Experiments
demonstrate LLMs' strong potential in producing high-quality ShEx schemas,
paving the way for scalable, automated schema generation for large KGs.
Furthermore, our benchmark introduces a new challenge for structured
generation, pushing the limits of LLMs on syntactically rich formalisms.

TL;DR: OpenAg is a framework combining AI, knowledge graphs, and multi-agent reasoning to provide context-aware, explainable agricultural insights for smallholder farmers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems lack contextual understanding and adaptability for farming, especially for resource-limited smallholders.

Method: OpenAg integrates domain-specific models, neural knowledge graphs, multi-agent reasoning, and causal explainability.

Result: The framework offers actionable, interpretable recommendations by combining scientific and farmer knowledge.

Conclusion: OpenAg bridges the gap between scientific knowledge and farmer expertise for scalable, locally relevant decision-making.

Abstract: Agriculture is undergoing a major transformation driven by artificial
intelligence (AI), machine learning, and knowledge representation technologies.
However, current agricultural intelligence systems often lack contextual
understanding, explainability, and adaptability, especially for smallholder
farmers with limited resources. General-purpose large language models (LLMs),
while powerful, typically lack the domain-specific knowledge and contextual
reasoning needed for practical decision support in farming. They tend to
produce recommendations that are too generic or unrealistic for real-world
applications. To address these challenges, we present OpenAg, a comprehensive
framework designed to advance agricultural artificial general intelligence
(AGI). OpenAg combines domain-specific foundation models, neural knowledge
graphs, multi-agent reasoning, causal explainability, and adaptive transfer
learning to deliver context-aware, explainable, and actionable insights. The
system includes: (i) a unified agricultural knowledge base that integrates
scientific literature, sensor data, and farmer-generated knowledge; (ii) a
neural agricultural knowledge graph for structured reasoning and inference;
(iii) an adaptive multi-agent reasoning system where AI agents specialize and
collaborate across agricultural domains; and (iv) a causal transparency
mechanism that ensures AI recommendations are interpretable, scientifically
grounded, and aligned with real-world constraints. OpenAg aims to bridge the
gap between scientific knowledge and the tacit expertise of experienced farmers
to support scalable and locally relevant agricultural decision-making.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeePoly introduces a two-stage framework combining DNNs for global feature capture and polynomial bases for local corrections, improving accuracy and efficiency in solving PDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional DNN-based methods for PDEs lack convergence guarantees and computational efficiency compared to numerical schemes.

Method: A two-stage approach: DNNs capture global features, followed by linear space optimization with DNN-extracted features and polynomial basis functions.

Result: Enhanced high-order accuracy and efficiency across diverse problems, with theoretical and experimental validation.

Conclusion: DeePoly offers a robust, mesh-free, and scheme-free solution for PDEs, bridging the gap between DNNs and traditional methods.

Abstract: Recently, machine learning methods have gained significant traction in
scientific computing, particularly for solving Partial Differential Equations
(PDEs). However, methods based on deep neural networks (DNNs) often lack
convergence guarantees and computational efficiency compared to traditional
numerical schemes. This work introduces DeePoly, a novel framework that
transforms the solution paradigm from pure non-convex parameter optimization to
a two-stage approach: first employing a DNN to capture complex global features,
followed by linear space optimization with combined DNN-extracted features
(Scoper) and polynomial basis functions (Sniper). This strategic combination
leverages the complementary strengths of both methods -- DNNs excel at
approximating complex global features (i.e., high-gradient features) and
stabilize the polynomial approximation while polynomial bases provide
high-precision local corrections with convergence guarantees. Theoretical
analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly
enhances both high-order accuracy and efficiency across diverse problem types
while maintaining mesh-free and scheme-free properties. This paper also serves
as a theoretical exposition for the open-source project DeePoly.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a pre-operative critic mechanism (GUI-Critic-R1) for GUI automation, using S-GRPO and a novel suggestion reward to improve decision-making reliability. It also develops a data pipeline for training and testing, showing superior accuracy and effectiveness in evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI automation requires precise step-by-step decisions with low error tolerance, as mistakes can lead to irreversible outcomes. Existing MLLMs lack mechanisms to preemptively critique actions.

Method: Proposes S-GRPO strategy to build GUI-Critic-R1, incorporating a suggestion reward. Develops a reasoning-bootstrapping data pipeline for training (GUI-Critic-Train) and testing (GUI-Critic-Test).

Result: GUI-Critic-R1 outperforms current MLLMs in critic accuracy on static tests and improves success rates and efficiency in dynamic GUI automation benchmarks.

Conclusion: The pre-operative critic mechanism and S-GRPO strategy enhance reliability and performance in GUI automation, addressing critical gaps in decision-making and data availability.

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been
extensively utilized for multimodal reasoning tasks, including Graphical User
Interface (GUI) automation. Unlike general offline multimodal tasks, GUI
automation is executed in online interactive environments, necessitating
step-by-step decision-making based on real-time status of the environment. This
task has a lower tolerance for decision-making errors at each step, as any
mistakes may cumulatively disrupt the process and potentially lead to
irreversible outcomes like deletions or payments. To address these issues, we
introduce a pre-operative critic mechanism that provides effective feedback
prior to the actual execution, by reasoning about the potential outcome and
correctness of actions. Specifically, we propose a Suggestion-aware Gradient
Relative Policy Optimization (S-GRPO) strategy to construct our pre-operative
critic model GUI-Critic-R1, incorporating a novel suggestion reward to enhance
the reliability of the model's feedback. Furthermore, we develop a
reasoning-bootstrapping based data collection pipeline to create a
GUI-Critic-Train and a GUI-Critic-Test, filling existing gaps in GUI critic
data. Static experiments on the GUI-Critic-Test across both mobile and web
domains reveal that our GUI-Critic-R1 offers significant advantages in critic
accuracy compared to current MLLMs. Dynamic evaluation on GUI automation
benchmark further highlights the effectiveness and superiority of our model, as
evidenced by improved success rates and operational efficiency.

*Lucas Irwin,Arda Kaz,Peiyao Sheng,Pramod Viswanath*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CHANCERY, a corporate governance reasoning benchmark for NLP models, testing their ability to classify executive actions as consistent with corporate charters. SOTA models struggle, with reasoning agents performing better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing legal datasets lack focus on reasoning tasks, despite reasoning being central to legal practice. The paper addresses this gap by creating a benchmark for corporate governance reasoning.

Method: The benchmark includes a corporate charter and executive action proposals for binary classification. It is based on 24 corporate governance principles and 79 real charters from diverse industries.

Result: SOTA models like Claude 3.7 Sonnet and GPT-4o achieved 64.5% and 75.2% accuracy, while reasoning agents (ReAct, CodeAct) scored 76.1% and 78.1%, showing the benchmark's difficulty.

Conclusion: CHANCERY highlights the challenges in legal reasoning for NLP models and provides insights into their capabilities, with reasoning agents outperforming traditional models.

Abstract: Law has long been a domain that has been popular in natural language
processing (NLP) applications. Reasoning (ratiocination and the ability to make
connections to precedent) is a core part of the practice of the law in the real
world. Nevertheless, while multiple legal datasets exist, none have thus far
focused specifically on reasoning tasks. We focus on a specific aspect of the
legal landscape by introducing a corporate governance reasoning benchmark
(CHANCERY) to test a model's ability to reason about whether
executive/board/shareholder's proposed actions are consistent with corporate
governance charters. This benchmark introduces a first-of-its-kind corporate
governance reasoning test for language models - modeled after real world
corporate governance law. The benchmark consists of a corporate charter (a set
of governing covenants) and a proposal for executive action. The model's task
is one of binary classification: reason about whether the action is consistent
with the rules contained within the charter. We create the benchmark following
established principles of corporate governance - 24 concrete corporate
governance principles established in and 79 real life corporate charters
selected to represent diverse industries from a total dataset of 10k real life
corporate charters. Evaluations on state-of-the-art (SOTA) reasoning models
confirm the difficulty of the benchmark, with models such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet
and GPT-4o achieving 64.5% and 75.2% accuracy respectively. Reasoning agents
exhibit superior performance, with agents based on the ReAct and CodeAct
frameworks scoring 76.1% and 78.1% respectively, further confirming the
advanced legal reasoning capabilities required to score highly on the
benchmark. We also conduct an analysis of the types of questions which current
reasoning models struggle on, revealing insights into the legal reasoning
capabilities of SOTA models.

TL;DR: LLM-based agents self-improve in strategic planning by autonomously rewriting prompts and code, outperforming static baselines in the game Settlers of Catan.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing LLMs' struggle with long-term strategic planning by testing their ability to self-improve in challenging environments.

Method: Multi-agent architecture with specialized roles (Analyzer, Researcher, Coder, Player) iteratively analyzing, researching, and modifying agent logic or prompts, benchmarked using Catanatron.

Result: Self-evolving agents, especially with Claude 3.7 and GPT-4o, outperform static baselines by autonomously adapting strategies and demonstrating adaptive reasoning.

Conclusion: LLM agents can effectively self-improve in strategic tasks through iterative analysis and adaptation, showcasing potential for autonomous problem-solving.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have enabled their use as autonomous agents across a
range of tasks, yet they continue to struggle with formulating and adhering to
coherent long-term strategies. In this paper, we investigate whether LLM agents
can self-improve when placed in environments that explicitly challenge their
strategic planning abilities. Using the board game Settlers of Catan, accessed
through the open-source Catanatron framework, we benchmark a progression of
LLM-based agents, from a simple game-playing agent to systems capable of
autonomously rewriting their own prompts and their player agent's code. We
introduce a multi-agent architecture in which specialized roles (Analyzer,
Researcher, Coder, and Player) collaborate to iteratively analyze gameplay,
research new strategies, and modify the agent's logic or prompt. By comparing
manually crafted agents to those evolved entirely by LLMs, we evaluate how
effectively these systems can diagnose failure and adapt over time. Our results
show that self-evolving agents, particularly when powered by models like Claude
3.7 and GPT-4o, outperform static baselines by autonomously adopting their
strategies, passing along sample behavior to game-playing agents, and
demonstrating adaptive reasoning over multiple iterations.

TL;DR: The study introduces E-bike agents, a framework using LLMs to classify and extract safety variables from unstructured e-bike incident reports, achieving high accuracy and revealing key accident factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: E-bike accidents are rising, but unstructured incident reports hinder quantitative safety analysis.

Method: Four LLM agents classify and extract data, followed by an ordered logit model to analyze severity factors.

Result: Equipment issues are common, but human-related incidents are more fatal. The model achieves a 0.87 F1 score.

Conclusion: The framework improves e-bike safety analytics and provides actionable insights for stakeholders.

Abstract: Electric bicycles (e-bikes) are rapidly increasing in use, raising safety
concerns due to a rise in accident reports. However, e-bike incident reports
often use unstructured narrative formats, which hinders quantitative safety
analysis. This study introduces E-bike agents, a framework that uses large
language models (LLM) powered agents to classify and extract safety variables
from unstructured incident reports. Our framework consists of four LLM agents,
handling data classification, information extraction, injury cause
determination, and component linkage, to extract the key factors that could
lead to E-bike accidents and cause varying severity levels. Furthermore, we
used an ordered logit model to examine the relationship between the severity of
the incident and the factors retrieved, such as gender, the type of cause, and
environmental conditions. Our research shows that equipment issues are slightly
more common than human-related ones, but human-related incidents are more often
fatal. Specifically, pedals, tires, and brakes are frequent contributors to
accidents. The model achieves a high weighted F1 score of 0.87 in
classification accuracy, highlighting the potential of using LLMs to extract
unstructured data in niche domains, such as transportation. Our method offers a
scalable solution to improve e-bike safety analytics and provides actionable
information for policy makers, designers, and regulators.

Result: Simulation experiments show LLM-empowered agents enable emergent phenomena like role specialization and market-aligned price fluctuations.

Conclusion: LLMs offer a promising solution for enhancing agent-based modeling in MMO economies, improving realism and adaptability.

Abstract: Within the domain of Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) economy research,
Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) has emerged as a robust tool for analyzing game
economics, evolving from rule-based agents to decision-making agents enhanced
by reinforcement learning. Nevertheless, existing works encounter significant
challenges when attempting to emulate human-like economic activities among
agents, particularly regarding agent reliability, sociability, and
interpretability. In this study, we take a preliminary step in introducing a
novel approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) in MMO economy simulation.
Leveraging LLMs' role-playing proficiency, generative capacity, and reasoning
aptitude, we design LLM-driven agents with human-like decision-making and
adaptability. These agents are equipped with the abilities of role-playing,
perception, memory, and reasoning, addressing the aforementioned challenges
effectively. Simulation experiments focusing on in-game economic activities
demonstrate that LLM-empowered agents can promote emergent phenomena like role

TL;DR: RL enhances reasoning in language models by improving internal strategy formulation and knowledge integration, not just plan execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the specific advantages of RL-based training methods like GRPO in enhancing reasoning capabilities of language models.

Method: Introduces a fine-grained analytic framework to dissect RL's impact on reasoning, focusing on plan-following, problem decomposition, and knowledge utilization.

Result: RL-tuned models show robustness and better knowledge integration, though explicit plans degrade performance on hard tasks.

Conclusion: RL improves reasoning by empowering models to develop internal strategies and integrate knowledge, providing a foundation for better training and evaluation.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become the dominant paradigm for endowing
language models with advanced reasoning capabilities. Despite the substantial
empirical gains demonstrated by RL-based training methods like GRPO, a granular
understanding of their advantages is still lacking. To address this gap, we
introduce a fine-grained analytic framework to dissect the impact of RL on
reasoning. Our framework specifically investigates key elements that have been
hypothesized to benefit from RL training: (1) plan-following and execution, (2)
problem decomposition, and (3) improved reasoning and knowledge utilization.
Using this framework, we gain insights beyond mere accuracy. For instance,
providing models with explicit step-by-step plans surprisingly degrades
performance on the most challenging benchmarks, yet RL-tuned models exhibit
greater robustness, experiencing markedly smaller performance drops than their
base counterparts. This suggests that RL may not primarily enhance the
execution of external plans but rather empower models to formulate and follow
internal strategies better suited to their reasoning processes. Conversely, we
observe that RL enhances the model's capacity to integrate provided knowledge
into its reasoning process, leading to performance improvements across diverse
tasks. We also study difficulty, showing improved training by developing new
ways to exploit hard problems. Our findings lay a foundation for more
principled training and evaluation of reasoning models.

TL;DR: A novel model-based RL framework optimizes both task performance and safety by dynamically switching between model-based planning and policy execution, using adaptive safety thresholds and an implicit world model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world RL applications require safety and reliability, but traditional model-based RL suffers from model inaccuracies leading to failures in safety-critical settings.

Method: The framework incorporates an adaptive mechanism for dynamic switching between planning and policy execution, uses an implicit world model to resolve objective mismatch, and employs dynamic safety thresholds.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements in safety and performance over non-adaptive methods, achieving robust results on safety-critical tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully balances safety and performance, outperforming existing methods in safety-critical continuous control tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) applications in real-world scenarios must
prioritize safety and reliability, which impose strict constraints on agent
behavior. Model-based RL leverages predictive world models for action planning
and policy optimization, but inherent model inaccuracies can lead to
catastrophic failures in safety-critical settings. We propose a novel
model-based RL framework that jointly optimizes task performance and safety. To
address world model errors, our method incorporates an adaptive mechanism that
dynamically switches between model-based planning and direct policy execution.
We resolve the objective mismatch problem of traditional model-based approaches
using an implicit world model. Furthermore, our framework employs dynamic
safety thresholds that adapt to the agent's evolving capabilities, consistently
selecting actions that surpass safe policy suggestions in both performance and
safety. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over non-adaptive
methods, showing that our approach optimizes safety and performance
simultaneously rather than merely meeting minimum safety requirements. The
proposed framework achieves robust performance on diverse safety-critical
continuous control tasks, outperforming existing methods.

Motivation: To address increasingly complex cyber-attacks by modeling and simulating attacker-defender interactions in networked systems.

Method: Markovian modeling and simulation of cyber-attacker and defender agents on network nodes, with actions influencing system states.

Result: Implemented a realistic scenario to evaluate defender strategies and attacker behaviors.

Conclusion: The framework provides a tool for assessing dynamic cyber-defense strategies against coordinated attacks.

Abstract: As cyber-attacks show to be more and more complex and coordinated,
cyber-defenders strategy through multi-agent approaches could be key to tackle
against cyber-attacks as close as entry points in a networked system. This
paper presents a Markovian modeling and implementation through a simulator of
fighting cyber-attacker agents and cyber-defender agents deployed on host
network nodes. It aims to provide an experimental framework to implement
realistically based coordinated cyber-attack scenarios while assessing
cyber-defenders dynamic organizations. We abstracted network nodes by sets of
properties including agents' ones. Actions applied by agents model how the
network reacts depending in a given state and what properties are to change.
Collective choice of the actions brings the whole environment closer or farther
from respective cyber-attackers and cyber-defenders goals. Using the simulator,
we implemented a realistically inspired scenario with several behavior

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable LLMs to directly control embodied agents by integrating symbolic reasoning with sensory-motor data for optimal performance.

Method: LLMs generate and iteratively refine control strategies using textual descriptions, feedback, and sensory-motor data.

Result: Successful identification of optimal or high-performing solutions in classic control and inverted pendulum tasks.

Conclusion: The method effectively combines symbolic and sub-symbolic data for embodied agent control.

Abstract: We propose a method that enables large language models (LLMs) to control
embodied agents by directly mapping continuous observation vectors to
continuous action vectors. Initially, the LLMs generate a control strategy
based on a textual description of the agent, its environment, and the intended
goal. This strategy is then iteratively refined through a learning process in
which the LLMs are repeatedly prompted to improve the current strategy, using
performance feedback and sensory-motor data collected during its evaluation.
The method is validated on classic control tasks from the Gymnasium library and
the inverted pendulum task from the MuJoCo library. In most cases, it
successfully identifies optimal or high-performing solutions by integrating
symbolic knowledge derived through reasoning with sub-symbolic sensory-motor
data gathered as the agent interacts with its environment.

Method: Uses differentiable logic gates in a circuit, trained end-to-end with gradients, operating discretely at inference.

Result: Successfully learns CA rules, generates patterns (checkerboard, lizard shape, multi-color), and shows robustness to noise and damage.

Conclusion: DiffLogic CA advances programmable matter by combining DLGNs and NCA, demonstrating generalization and robustness in recurrent architectures.

Abstract: This paper introduces Differentiable Logic Cellular Automata (DiffLogic CA),
a novel combination of Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) and Differentiable Logic
Gates Networks (DLGNs). The fundamental computation units of the model are
differentiable logic gates, combined into a circuit. During training, the model
is fully end-to-end differentiable allowing gradient-based training, and at
inference time it operates in a fully discrete state space. This enables
learning local update rules for cellular automata while preserving their
inherent discrete nature. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach
through a series of milestones: (1) fully learning the rules of Conway's Game
of Life, (2) generating checkerboard patterns that exhibit resilience to noise
and damage, (3) growing a lizard shape, and (4) multi-color pattern generation.
Our model successfully learns recurrent circuits capable of generating desired
target patterns. For simpler patterns, we observe success with both synchronous
and asynchronous updates, demonstrating significant generalization capabilities
and robustness to perturbations. We make the case that this combination of
DLGNs and NCA represents a step toward programmable matter and robust computing
systems that combine binary logic, neural network adaptability, and localized
processing. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first successful

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create autonomous agents capable of self-regulation in resource-volatile environments, moving beyond traditional reward-driven paradigms.

Method: Formalizes energy-based utility and viability constraints, integrating energy harvesting, thermal regulation, and adaptive computation into a closed-loop system.

Result: Simulations show stable, resource-aware behavior without external supervision.

Conclusion: Provides a foundation for deploying autonomous agents in unpredictable environments where self-regulation is critical.

Abstract: This paper introduces Energentic Intelligence, a class of autonomous systems
defined not by task performance, but by their capacity to sustain themselves
through internal energy regulation. Departing from conventional reward-driven
paradigms, these agents treat survival-maintaining functional operation under
fluctuating energetic and thermal conditions-as the central objective. We
formalize this principle through an energy-based utility function and a
viability-constrained survival horizon, and propose a modular architecture that
integrates energy harvesting, thermal regulation, and adaptive computation into
a closed-loop control system. A simulated environment demonstrates the
emergence of stable, resource-aware behavior without external supervision.
Together, these contributions provide a theoretical and architectural
foundation for deploying autonomous agents in resource-volatile settings where
persistence must be self-regulated and infrastructure cannot be assumed.

TL;DR: RAG-UAV enhances LLMs' mathematical reasoning for UAV tasks using retrieval-augmented generation, improving accuracy and reducing errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional UAV flight control uses hardcoded equations, but LLMs struggle with reliable math reasoning. RAG-UAV aims to improve this by leveraging domain literature.

Method: Proposes RAG-UAV, a framework integrating retrieval-augmented generation with LLMs, tested on the UAV-Math-Bench (20 problems across four difficulty levels).

Result: RAG improves exact answer accuracy (up to 75%), reduces incorrect formulations (25% to 5%), and lowers numerical errors (MSE reduced significantly).

Conclusion: RAG enhances LLMs' reliability for UAV tasks, but real-time flight control needs further validation. Data and benchmarks are publicly available.

Abstract: Autonomous UAV operation necessitates reliable mathematical reasoning for
tasks such as trajectory planning and power management. While traditional
flight control relies on hardcoded equations, recent Large Language Models
(LLMs) offer potential for more flexible problem-solving but struggle with
reliably selecting and applying correct mathematical formulations and executing
precise multi-step arithmetic. We propose RAG-UAV, a retrieval-augmented
generation framework designed to improve the mathematical reasoning of several
LLMs (including GPT o1/Turbo, Llama-3.2/3.3, Mistral, and DeepSeek R1) in
UAV-specific contexts by providing access to relevant domain literature. To
conduct an initial assessment, we introduce the UAV-Math-Bench, a small problem
set comprising 20 UAV-centric mathematical problems across four difficulty
levels. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating retrieval substantially
increases exact answer accuracy (achieving up to 75% with o1), reduces
instances of incorrect formulation selection (from 25% without RAG to 5% with
RAG), decreases numerical errors, reducing Mean Squared Error (MSE) by orders
of magnitude for the best-performing models. This pilot study indicates that
RAG can enable general-purpose LLMs to function as more reliable tools for
engineering analysis, although direct real-time flight control requires further
investigation and validation on a larger scale. All benchmark data, question
and answer are publicly available.

### [483] [Truly Self-Improving Agents Require Intrinsic Metacognitive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05109)
*Tennison Liu,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes intrinsic metacognitive learning for self-improving agents, addressing limitations of rigid and non-scalable current approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-improvement methods are rigid, lack generalization, and struggle to scale. The paper argues for intrinsic metacognition to enhance adaptability and scalability.

Method: Introduces a framework with three components: metacognitive knowledge, planning, and evaluation, inspired by human metacognition.

Result: Existing agents rely on extrinsic, fixed mechanisms; intrinsic metacognition components are already present but underutilized.

Conclusion: Key challenges include distributing metacognitive responsibilities between humans and agents and improving evaluation methods for sustained self-improvement.

Abstract: Self-improving agents aim to continuously acquire new capabilities with
minimal supervision. However, current approaches face two key limitations:
their self-improvement processes are often rigid, fail to generalize across
tasks domains, and struggle to scale with increasing agent capabilities. We
argue that effective self-improvement requires intrinsic metacognitive
learning, defined as an agent's intrinsic ability to actively evaluate, reflect
on, and adapt its own learning processes. Drawing inspiration from human
metacognition, we introduce a formal framework comprising three components:
metacognitive knowledge (self-assessment of capabilities, tasks, and learning
strategies), metacognitive planning (deciding what and how to learn), and
metacognitive evaluation (reflecting on learning experiences to improve future
learning). Analyzing existing self-improving agents, we find they rely
predominantly on extrinsic metacognitive mechanisms, which are fixed,
human-designed loops that limit scalability and adaptability. Examining each
component, we contend that many ingredients for intrinsic metacognition are
already present. Finally, we explore how to optimally distribute metacognitive
responsibilities between humans and agents, and robustly evaluate and improve
intrinsic metacognitive learning, key challenges that must be addressed to
enable truly sustained, generalized, and aligned self-improvement.

*Violet Xiang,Chase Blagden,Rafael Rafailov,Nathan Lile,Sang Truong,Chelsea Finn,Nick Haber*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ALP (Adaptive Length Penalty) reduces token usage by 50% in LRMs by dynamically adjusting penalties based on prompt difficulty, improving efficiency without significant performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for controlling token usage in LRMs either require manual effort or treat all problems uniformly, ignoring difficulty differences.

Method: ALP uses reinforcement learning to tailor generation length to per-prompt solve rates, penalizing extra tokens more for easy prompts and less for hard ones.

Result: Post-training DeepScaleR-1.5B with ALP reduces average token usage by 50% while maintaining performance, and improves accuracy on hard problems.

Conclusion: ALP intelligently redistributes compute resources, cutting waste on easy prompts and boosting performance on difficult ones.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher performance on challenging
reasoning tasks by generating more tokens at inference time, but this verbosity
often wastes computation on easy problems. Existing solutions, including
supervised finetuning on shorter traces, user-controlled budgets, or RL with
uniform penalties, either require data curation, manual configuration, or treat
all problems alike regardless of difficulty. We introduce Adaptive Length
Penalty (ALP), a reinforcement learning objective tailoring generation length
to per-prompt solve rate. During training, ALP monitors each prompt's online
solve rate through multiple rollouts and adds a differentiable penalty whose
magnitude scales inversely with that rate, so confident (easy) prompts incur a
high cost for extra tokens while hard prompts remain unhindered. Posttraining
DeepScaleR-1.5B with ALP cuts average token usage by 50\% without significantly
dropping performance. Relative to fixed-budget and uniform penalty baselines,
ALP redistributes its reduced budget more intelligently by cutting compute on
easy prompts and reallocating saved tokens to difficult ones, delivering higher
accuracy on the hardest problems with higher cost.

*Mikhail Terekhov,Zhen Ning David Liu,Caglar Gulcehre,Samuel Albanie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Control Tax' to measure the cost of integrating AI oversight, proposes a framework to quantify it, evaluates AI models in adversarial settings, and provides cost-effective monitoring strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for robust oversight mechanisms in AI due to its rapid integration into high-stakes applications, and the lack of practical adoption due to implementation overhead.

Method: Introduces a theoretical framework for Control Tax, evaluates AI models in adversarial scenarios, and develops cost-effective monitoring strategies.

Result: A framework linking safety guarantees to costs, empirical cost estimates, and optimized monitoring strategies for practical AI control.

Conclusion: The work advances AI Control by balancing safety and cost, enabling informed decisions for deployment.

Abstract: The rapid integration of agentic AI into high-stakes real-world applications
requires robust oversight mechanisms. The emerging field of AI Control (AIC)
aims to provide such an oversight mechanism, but practical adoption depends
heavily on implementation overhead. To study this problem better, we introduce
the notion of Control tax -- the operational and financial cost of integrating
control measures into AI pipelines. Our work makes three key contributions to
the field of AIC: (1) we introduce a theoretical framework that quantifies the
Control Tax and maps classifier performance to safety assurances; (2) we
conduct comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art language models in
adversarial settings, where attacker models insert subtle backdoors into code
while monitoring models attempt to detect these vulnerabilities; and (3) we
provide empirical financial cost estimates for control protocols and develop
optimized monitoring strategies that balance safety and cost-effectiveness
while accounting for practical constraints like auditing budgets. Our framework
enables practitioners to make informed decisions by systematically connecting
safety guarantees with their costs, advancing AIC through principled economic
feasibility assessment across different deployment contexts.

*Ivan Vegner,Sydelle de Souza,Valentin Forch,Martha Lewis,Leonidas A. A. Doumas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper distinguishes between systematicity of behavior and representations in ML models, critiques current benchmarks, and suggests assessing representational systematicity using mechanistic interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between Fodor and Pylyshyn's argument for systematicity of representations and the focus on behavioral systematicity in existing ML benchmarks and models.

Method: Analyzes key benchmarks in language and vision using Hadley's (1994) taxonomy of systematic generalization and highlights mechanistic interpretability approaches.

Result: Identifies limitations in current benchmarks and proposes ways to evaluate representational systematicity.

Conclusion: Emphasizes the need to assess systematicity of representations in ML models and suggests mechanistic interpretability as a viable approach.

Abstract: A core aspect of compositionality, systematicity is a desirable property in
ML models as it enables strong generalization to novel contexts. This has led
to numerous studies proposing benchmarks to assess systematic generalization,
as well as models and training regimes designed to enhance it. Many of these
efforts are framed as addressing the challenge posed by Fodor and Pylyshyn.
However, while they argue for systematicity of representations, existing
benchmarks and models primarily focus on the systematicity of behaviour. We
emphasize the crucial nature of this distinction. Furthermore, building on
Hadley's (1994) taxonomy of systematic generalization, we analyze the extent to
which behavioural systematicity is tested by key benchmarks in the literature
across language and vision. Finally, we highlight ways of assessing
systematicity of representations in ML models as practiced in the field of
mechanistic interpretability.

*Kareem Amin,Salman Avestimehr,Sara Babakniya,Alex Bie,Weiwei Kong,Natalia Ponomareva,Umar Syed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a clustering-based method for differentially private (DP) language model inference, improving text quality and privacy efficiency by using medians for aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uniform sampling in DP language model inference degrades text quality, especially for heterogeneous topics, prompting the need for a better approach.

Method: Clusters input data before batch selection and aggregates next-token predictions using medians for improved privacy guarantees.

Result: Demonstrates better representativeness (e.g., MAUVE) and downstream task performance at lower privacy cost.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances synthetic data quality and privacy efficiency compared to prior approaches.

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) language model inference is an approach for
generating private synthetic text. A sensitive input example is used to prompt
an off-the-shelf large language model (LLM) to produce a similar example.
Multiple examples can be aggregated together to formally satisfy the DP
guarantee.
  Prior work creates inference batches by sampling sensitive inputs uniformly
at random. We show that uniform sampling degrades the quality of privately
generated text, especially when the sensitive examples concern heterogeneous
topics.
  We remedy this problem by clustering the input data before selecting
inference batches. Next, we observe that clustering also leads to more similar
next-token predictions across inferences. We use this insight to introduce a
new algorithm that aggregates next token statistics by privately computing
medians instead of averages. This approach leverages the fact that the median
has decreased local sensitivity when next token predictions are similar,
allowing us to state a data-dependent and ex-post DP guarantee about the
privacy properties of this algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate improvements in
terms of representativeness metrics (e.g., MAUVE) as well as downstream task
performance. We show that our method produces high-quality synthetic data at
significantly lower privacy cost than a previous state-of-the-art method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide rigorous privacy protection while extracting meaningful insights from chatbot interactions.

Method: Employs private clustering, keyword extraction (frequency-based, TF-IDF-based, LLM-guided), and DP tools like histogram summarization.

Result: Balances data utility and privacy, preserving conversational insights effectively.

Conclusion: Urania successfully ensures privacy while maintaining useful insights from chatbot data.

Abstract: We introduce $Urania$, a novel framework for generating insights about LLM
chatbot interactions with rigorous differential privacy (DP) guarantees. The
framework employs a private clustering mechanism and innovative keyword
extraction methods, including frequency-based, TF-IDF-based, and LLM-guided
approaches. By leveraging DP tools such as clustering, partition selection, and
histogram-based summarization, $Urania$ provides end-to-end privacy protection.
Our evaluation assesses lexical and semantic content preservation, pair
similarity, and LLM-based metrics, benchmarking against a non-private
Clio-inspired pipeline (Tamkin et al., 2024). Moreover, we develop a simple
empirical privacy evaluation that demonstrates the enhanced robustness of our
DP pipeline. The results show the framework's ability to extract meaningful
conversational insights while maintaining stringent user privacy, effectively
balancing data utility with privacy preservation.

TL;DR: Proposes EHR2Path, a novel method for modeling patient pathways using structured EHR data, improving prediction of health trajectories with a token-efficient summary mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of managing and interpreting vast, heterogeneous patient data for personalized care, overcoming limitations of narrow-use-case approaches.

Method: Transforms EHR data into a structured representation and designs EHR2Path, a pathway prediction model with a summary mechanism for long-term temporal context.

Result: Outperforms baselines in next time-step prediction and longitudinal simulation, enabling detailed patient trajectory simulations.

Conclusion: EHR2Path advances predictive and personalized healthcare by efficiently forecasting diverse health outcomes.

Abstract: Healthcare systems face significant challenges in managing and interpreting
vast, heterogeneous patient data for personalized care. Existing approaches
often focus on narrow use cases with a limited feature space, overlooking the
complex, longitudinal interactions needed for a holistic understanding of
patient health. In this work, we propose a novel approach to patient pathway
modeling by transforming diverse electronic health record (EHR) data into a
structured representation and designing a holistic pathway prediction model,
EHR2Path, optimized to predict future health trajectories. Further, we
introduce a novel summary mechanism that embeds long-term temporal context into
topic-specific summary tokens, improving performance over text-only models,
while being much more token-efficient. EHR2Path demonstrates strong performance
in both next time-step prediction and longitudinal simulation, outperforming
competitive baselines. It enables detailed simulations of patient trajectories,
inherently targeting diverse evaluation tasks, such as forecasting vital signs,
lab test results, or length-of-stay, opening a path towards predictive and
personalized healthcare.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes key aspects of RL for long-context reasoning, highlighting the roles of positive/negative samples, data inefficiency in policy optimization, and performance instability due to ambiguous problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address open questions and counterintuitive behaviors in RL for long-context reasoning, focusing on sample roles, data efficiency, and performance stability.

Method: Systematically analyzes sample roles, explores strategies like relative length rewards and offline injection for data efficiency, and investigates instability via multiple evaluation runs.

Result: Negative samples enhance generalization; training on them alone matches standard RL. Data inefficiency is addressed, and instability is mitigated by multiple evaluations.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into RL training dynamics, offering practical solutions for efficiency and stability in long-context reasoning.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in training long-context reasoning models via
reinforcement learning (RL), several open questions and counterintuitive
behaviors remain. This work focuses on three key aspects: (1) We systematically
analyze the roles of positive and negative samples in RL, revealing that
positive samples mainly facilitate data fitting, whereas negative samples
significantly enhance generalization and robustness. Interestingly, training
solely on negative samples can rival standard RL training performance. (2) We
identify substantial data inefficiency in group relative policy optimization,
where over half of the samples yield zero advantage. To address this, we
explore two straightforward strategies, including relative length rewards and
offline sample injection, to better leverage these data and enhance reasoning
efficiency and capability. (3) We investigate unstable performance across
various reasoning models and benchmarks, attributing instability to uncertain
problems with ambiguous outcomes, and demonstrate that multiple evaluation runs
mitigate this issue.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes HAR contrastive loss and SHARP framework to mitigate degree bias in GNNs by adding more positive pairs and adaptively weighting them, showing improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs suffer from degree bias in node classification, and existing GCL methods provide insufficient and noisy information for low-degree nodes.

Method: Introduces HAR contrastive loss to add more positive pairs using node labels and adaptively weights pairs based on learning hardness, along with the SHARP framework for broader application.

Result: SHARP outperforms baselines on four datasets, improving performance globally and across degree levels.

Conclusion: HAR and SHARP effectively address degree bias in GNNs, enhancing node classification performance.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often suffer from degree bias in node
classification tasks, where prediction performance varies across nodes with
different degrees. Several approaches, which adopt Graph Contrastive Learning
(GCL), have been proposed to mitigate this bias. However, the limited number of
positive pairs and the equal weighting of all positives and negatives in GCL
still lead to low-degree nodes acquiring insufficient and noisy information.
This paper proposes the Hardness Adaptive Reweighted (HAR) contrastive loss to
mitigate degree bias. It adds more positive pairs by leveraging node labels and
adaptively weights positive and negative pairs based on their learning
hardness. In addition, we develop an experimental framework named SHARP to
extend HAR to a broader range of scenarios. Both our theoretical analysis and
experiments validate the effectiveness of SHARP. The experimental results
across four datasets show that SHARP achieves better performance against
baselines at both global and degree levels.

*Danil Sivtsov,Ivan Rodkin,Gleb Kuzmin,Yuri Kuratov,Ivan Oseledets*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diagonal Batching improves RMTs by enabling parallelism across segments, reducing inference time and memory usage without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models face inefficiencies in long-context tasks due to quadratic time and linear memory complexity. RMTs help but introduce sequential bottlenecks.

Method: Diagonal Batching, a scheduling scheme, allows parallel processing in RMTs while maintaining exact recurrence, eliminating sequential constraints.

Result: Diagonal Batching achieves a 3.3x speedup over standard LLaMA-1B and 1.8x over sequential RMTs on 131,072-token sequences.

Conclusion: Diagonal Batching makes RMTs more practical for real-world long-context applications by reducing inference cost and latency.

Abstract: Transformer models struggle with long-context inference due to their
quadratic time and linear memory complexity. Recurrent Memory Transformers
(RMTs) offer a solution by reducing the asymptotic cost to linear time and
constant memory usage. However, their memory update mechanism leads to
sequential execution, causing a performance bottleneck.
  We introduce Diagonal Batching, a scheduling scheme that unlocks parallelism
across segments in RMTs while preserving exact recurrence. This approach
eliminates the sequential constraint, enabling efficient GPU inference even for
single long-context inputs without complex batching and pipelining techniques.
Because the technique is purely a run-time computation reordering, existing RMT
models adopt it with no retraining.
  Applied to a LLaMA-1B ARMT model, Diagonal Batching yields a 3.3x speedup
over standard full-attention LLaMA-1B and a 1.8x speedup over the sequential
RMT implementation on 131,072-token sequences. By removing sequential
bottleneck, Diagonal Batching reduces inference cost and latency, thereby
strengthening RMTs as a practical solution for real-world, long-context
applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a stable, parallelizable version of the Mesa layer, derived from an in-context loss, and demonstrates its superior performance in language modeling, especially for long-context tasks, though at higher computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers dominate sequence modeling but have linear memory and compute scaling. Recent RNN models like DeltaNet and Mamba offer constant costs. This work aims to unify and improve such models by optimizing an in-context regression objective.

Method: The authors introduce a numerically stable, chunkwise parallelizable Mesa layer, minimizing an in-context loss optimally at every time point using a conjugate gradient solver.

Result: The model achieves lower perplexity and better downstream performance than previous RNNs, particularly in long-context tasks, but requires additional inference-time compute.

Conclusion: Optimal test-time training enhances performance, aligning with trends of increasing test-time compute, here by solving sequential optimization within the network.

Abstract: Sequence modeling is currently dominated by causal transformer architectures
that use softmax self-attention. Although widely adopted, transformers require
scaling memory and compute linearly during inference. A recent stream of work
linearized the softmax operation, resulting in powerful recurrent neural
network (RNN) models with constant memory and compute costs such as DeltaNet,
Mamba or xLSTM. These models can be unified by noting that their recurrent
layer dynamics can all be derived from an in-context regression objective,
approximately optimized through an online learning rule. Here, we join this
line of work and introduce a numerically stable, chunkwise parallelizable
version of the recently proposed Mesa layer (von Oswald et al., 2024), and
study it in language modeling at the billion-parameter scale. This layer again
stems from an in-context loss, but which is now minimized to optimality at
every time point using a fast conjugate gradient solver. Through an extensive
suite of experiments, we show that optimal test-time training enables reaching
lower language modeling perplexity and higher downstream benchmark performance
than previous RNNs, especially on tasks requiring long context understanding.
This performance gain comes at the cost of additional flops spent during
inference time. Our results are therefore intriguingly related to recent trends
of increasing test-time compute to improve performance -- here by spending
compute to solve sequential optimization problems within the neural network
itself.

TL;DR: The paper proposes two techniques—difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay—to improve data efficiency in RL fine-tuning of LLMs, reducing training time by 25%-65%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL fine-tuning for LLMs is resource-intensive, and existing methods lack focus on data efficiency.

Method: Introduces adaptive difficulty for online data selection and an attention-based framework to estimate difficulty efficiently. Also proposes rollout replay to reuse recent rollouts.

Result: Experiments show the method reduces RL fine-tuning time by 25%-65% while matching the performance of GRPO.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques significantly enhance data efficiency in RL fine-tuning for LLMs, offering practical benefits for resource optimization.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become an effective approach for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs), particularly to enhance their reasoning
capabilities. However, RL fine-tuning remains highly resource-intensive, and
existing work has largely overlooked the problem of data efficiency. In this
paper, we propose two techniques to improve data efficiency in LLM RL
fine-tuning: difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay. We
introduce the notion of adaptive difficulty to guide online data selection,
prioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that are more likely to yield
informative learning signals. To estimate adaptive difficulty efficiently, we
develop an attention-based framework that requires rollouts for only a small
reference set of questions. The adaptive difficulty of the remaining questions
is then estimated based on their similarity to this set. To further reduce
rollout cost, we introduce a rollout replay mechanism that reuses recent
rollouts, lowering per-step computation while maintaining stable updates.
Extensive experiments across 6 LLM-dataset combinations show that our method
reduces RL fine-tuning time by 25% to 65% to reach the same level of
performance as the original GRPO algorithm.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper challenges the overestimation of smaller models' effectiveness in test-time scaling, introducing the Kinetics Scaling Law that accounts for computation and memory costs, and proposes sparse attention for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work overlooks memory bottlenecks in inference-time strategies, leading to inefficient resource allocation. The study aims to address this by rethinking scaling laws.

Method: The authors analyze models from 0.6B to 32B parameters, proposing the Kinetics Scaling Law and a sparse attention paradigm to reduce per-token costs.

Result: Sparse attention models outperform dense ones, with significant gains in problem-solving accuracy across cost regimes.

Conclusion: Sparse attention is crucial for maximizing test-time scaling potential, as it enables longer generations and parallel samples within resource limits.

Abstract: We rethink test-time scaling laws from a practical efficiency perspective,
revealing that the effectiveness of smaller models is significantly
overestimated. Prior work, grounded in compute-optimality, overlooks critical
memory access bottlenecks introduced by inference-time strategies (e.g.,
Best-of-$N$, long CoTs). Our holistic analysis, spanning models from 0.6B to
32B parameters, reveals a new Kinetics Scaling Law that better guides resource
allocation by incorporating both computation and memory access costs. Kinetics
Scaling Law suggests that test-time compute is more effective when used on
models above a threshold than smaller ones. A key reason is that in TTS,
attention, rather than parameter count, emerges as the dominant cost factor.
Motivated by this, we propose a new scaling paradigm centered on sparse
attention, which lowers per-token cost and enables longer generations and more
parallel samples within the same resource budget. Empirically, we show that
sparse attention models consistently outperform dense counterparts, achieving
over 60 points gains in low-cost regimes and over 5 points gains in high-cost
regimes for problem-solving accuracy on AIME, encompassing evaluations on
state-of-the-art MoEs. These results suggest that sparse attention is essential
for realizing the full potential of test-time scaling because, unlike training,
where parameter scaling saturates, test-time accuracy continues to improve
through increased generation. The code is available at

*Adrian Łańcucki,Konrad Staniszewski,Piotr Nawrot,Edoardo M. Ponti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS) to compress the KV cache in Transformer LLMs, enabling more tokens to be generated within the same compute budget while improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The KV cache size bottlenecks generation cost in Transformer LLMs, limiting the benefits of inference-time scaling. The goal is to improve accuracy without increasing compute costs.

Method: Proposes DMS, a method to sparsify KV caches with minimal training (1K steps), delaying token eviction to preserve critical information.

Result: DMS achieves 8× compression, outperforming training-free sparse attention, and boosts accuracy (e.g., 9.1 points on AIME 24 for Qwen-R1 32B).

Conclusion: Inference-time hyper-scaling with DMS is practical and effective, enhancing accuracy without additional runtime or memory costs.

Abstract: Inference-time scaling trades efficiency for increased reasoning accuracy by
generating longer or more parallel sequences. However, in Transformer LLMs,
generation cost is bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache, rather
than the number of generated tokens. Hence, we explore inference-time
hyper-scaling: by compressing the KV cache, we can generate more tokens within
the same compute budget and further improve the accuracy of scaled inference.
The success of this approach, however, hinges on the ability of compression
methods to preserve accuracy even at high compression ratios. To make
hyper-scaling practical, we introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a
novel method for sparsifying KV caches that only requires 1K training steps to
achieve 8$\times$ compression, while maintaining better accuracy than
training-free sparse attention. Instead of prematurely discarding cached
tokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and
preserving critical information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
inference-time hyper-scaling with DMS on multiple families of LLMs, showing
that it boosts accuracy for comparable inference runtime and memory load. For
instance, we enhance Qwen-R1 32B by an average of 9.1 points on AIME 24, 7.6 on
GPQA, and 9.6 on LiveCodeBench across compute budgets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: YOTO (You Only Train Once) automates loss weight hyperparameter optimization in one training run, outperforming grid search in computer vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional training involves multiple runs for loss selection and weighting; YOTO aims to streamline this by optimizing loss weights in a single training session.

Method: YOTO treats loss hyperparameters as network parameters, optimizing them via gradient-based methods with a differentiable composite loss layer and a novel regularization loss.

Result: YOTO consistently outperforms grid-search methods in 3D estimation and semantic segmentation tasks on unseen test data.

Conclusion: YOTO provides an efficient, one-shot solution for loss hyperparameter optimization, demonstrating superior performance over traditional methods.

Abstract: The title of this paper is perhaps an overclaim. Of course, the process of
creating and optimizing a learned model inevitably involves multiple training
runs which potentially feature different architectural designs, input and
output encodings, and losses. However, our method, You Only Train Once (YOTO),
indeed contributes to limiting training to one shot for the latter aspect of
losses selection and weighting. We achieve this by automatically optimizing
loss weight hyperparameters of learned models in one shot via standard
gradient-based optimization, treating these hyperparameters as regular
parameters of the networks and learning them. To this end, we leverage the
differentiability of the composite loss formulation which is widely used for
optimizing multiple empirical losses simultaneously and model it as a novel
layer which is parameterized with a softmax operation that satisfies the
inherent positivity constraints on loss hyperparameters while avoiding
degenerate empirical gradients. We complete our joint end-to-end optimization
scheme by defining a novel regularization loss on the learned hyperparameters,
which models a uniformity prior among the employed losses while ensuring
boundedness of the identified optima. We evidence the efficacy of YOTO in
jointly optimizing loss hyperparameters and regular model parameters in one
shot by comparing it to the commonly used brute-force grid search across
state-of-the-art networks solving two key problems in computer vision, i.e. 3D
estimation and semantic segmentation, and showing that it consistently
outperforms the best grid-search model on unseen test data. Code will be made
publicly available.

*Ranjith Merugu,Bryan Bo Cao,Shubham Jain*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: StatsMerging is a lightweight, learning-based model merging method that uses weight distribution statistics and SVD to guide merging without requiring labels or test samples. It outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in accuracy, generalization, and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of accommodating multiple large models within constrained memory budgets efficiently.

Method: Uses SVD to capture task-specific weight distributions, a lightweight learner (StatsMergeLearner), and Task-Specific Teacher Distillation for merging heterogeneous architectures.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, generalization to unseen tasks, and robustness to image quality variations across eight tasks.

Conclusion: StatsMerging is an effective, label-free solution for model merging, offering superior performance and adaptability.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising solution to accommodate multiple
large models within constrained memory budgets. We present StatsMerging, a
novel lightweight learning-based model merging method guided by weight
distribution statistics without requiring ground truth labels or test samples.
StatsMerging offers three key advantages: (1) It uniquely leverages singular
values from singular value decomposition (SVD) to capture task-specific weight
distributions, serving as a proxy for task importance to guide task coefficient
prediction; (2) It employs a lightweight learner StatsMergeLearner to model the
weight distributions of task-specific pre-trained models, improving
generalization and enhancing adaptation to unseen samples; (3) It introduces
Task-Specific Teacher Distillation for merging vision models with heterogeneous
architectures, a merging learning paradigm that avoids costly ground-truth
labels by task-specific teacher distillation. Notably, we present two types of
knowledge distillation, (a) distilling knowledge from task-specific models to
StatsMergeLearner; and (b) distilling knowledge from models with heterogeneous
architectures prior to merging. Extensive experiments across eight tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness of StatsMerging. Our results show that
StatsMerging outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of overall
accuracy, generalization to unseen tasks, and robustness to image quality
variations.

### [499] [Scaling Laws for Robust Comparison of Open Foundation Language-Vision Models and Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04598)
*Marianna Nezhurina,Tomer Porian,Giovanni Pucceti,Tommie Kerssies,Romain Beaumont,Mehdi Cherti,Jenia Jitsev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates how scaling laws can be used to compare models (CLIP and MaMMUT) and datasets for pre-training, revealing MaMMUT's superior scalability and sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable systematic comparison of models and datasets across scales, avoiding biased conclusions from single-scale measurements.

Method: Derives full scaling laws using dense measurements for CLIP and MaMMUT, evaluates on downstream tasks (classification, retrieval, segmentation) and datasets (DataComp, DFN, Re-LAION).

Result: MaMMUT shows stronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than CLIP, validated across tasks and datasets.

Conclusion: Scaling laws provide a robust method for model and dataset comparison, facilitating systematic improvement of foundation models. Open-source models and code are released.

Abstract: In studies of transferable learning, scaling laws are obtained for various
important foundation models to predict their properties and performance at
larger scales. We show here how scaling law derivation can also be used for
model and dataset comparison, allowing to decide which procedure is to be
preferred for pre-training. For the first time, full scaling laws based on
dense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales are
derived for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT,
that use either contrastive only or contrastive and captioning text generative
loss. Ensuring sufficient prediction accuracy for held out points, we use
derived scaling laws to compare both models, obtaining evidence for MaMMUT's
stronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than standard
CLIP. To strengthen validity of the comparison, we show scaling laws for
various downstream tasks, classification, retrieval, and segmentation, and for
different open datasets, DataComp, DFN and Re-LAION, observing consistently the
same trends. We show that comparison can also be performed when deriving
scaling laws with a constant learning rate schedule, reducing compute cost.
Accurate derivation of scaling laws provides thus means to perform model and
dataset comparison across scale spans, avoiding misleading conclusions based on
measurements from single reference scales only, paving the road for systematic
comparison and improvement of open foundation models and datasets for their
creation. We release all the pre-trained models with their intermediate
checkpoints, including openMaMMUT-L/14, which achieves $80.3\%$ zero-shot
ImageNet-1k accuracy, trained on 12.8B samples from DataComp-1.4B. Code for
reproducing experiments in the paper and raw experiments data can be found at

*Cong Geng,Jia Wang,Li Chen,Zhiyong Gao,Jes Frellsen,Søren Hauberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes bidirectional bounds for training energy-based models (EBMs) to improve stability and performance, comparing four bounds derived from different perspectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EBMs are challenging to train due to instability issues when using variational lower bounds. The paper aims to stabilize training by introducing bidirectional bounds.

Method: The authors derive and compare four bounds: two lower bounds (based on generator Jacobian singular values and mutual information) and two upper bounds (gradient penalty-like and diffusion process-based). Algorithms for evaluating these bounds are provided.

Result: Bidirectional bounds stabilize EBM training, leading to high-quality density estimation and sample generation.

Conclusion: The proposed bidirectional bounds effectively address training instability in EBMs, offering improved performance in density estimation and generation tasks.

Abstract: Energy-based models (EBMs) estimate unnormalized densities in an elegant
framework, but they are generally difficult to train. Recent work has linked
EBMs to generative adversarial networks, by noting that they can be trained
through a minimax game using a variational lower bound. To avoid the
instabilities caused by minimizing a lower bound, we propose to instead work
with bidirectional bounds, meaning that we maximize a lower bound and minimize
an upper bound when training the EBM. We investigate four different bounds on
the log-likelihood derived from different perspectives. We derive lower bounds
based on the singular values of the generator Jacobian and on mutual
information. To upper bound the negative log-likelihood, we consider a gradient
penalty-like bound, as well as one based on diffusion processes. In all cases,
we provide algorithms for evaluating the bounds. We compare the different
bounds to investigate, the pros and cons of the different approaches. Finally,
we demonstrate that the use of bidirectional bounds stabilizes EBM training and
yields high-quality density estimation and sample generation.

*Zeming Wei,Yiwen Guo,Yisen Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies adversarial training (AT) through class-wise feature attribution, identifying cross-class features as key for robustness. It shows AT initially learns these features but shifts to class-specific ones during robust overfitting, unifying insights on AT mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the training dynamics and mechanisms of adversarial training (AT) by analyzing class-wise feature attribution, particularly focusing on cross-class features.

Method: The study uses theoretical evidence from a synthetic data model and systematic experiments across various model architectures to analyze the role of cross-class and class-specific features in AT.

Result: AT initially learns cross-class features for robustness but shifts to class-specific features during robust overfitting. This provides a unified view of AT properties like soft-label training benefits and robust overfitting.

Conclusion: The findings refine understanding of AT mechanisms, offering new perspectives for future research. The code is publicly available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Adversarial training (AT) has been considered one of the most effective
methods for making deep neural networks robust against adversarial attacks,
while the training mechanisms and dynamics of AT remain open research problems.
In this paper, we present a novel perspective on studying AT through the lens
of class-wise feature attribution. Specifically, we identify the impact of a
key family of features on AT that are shared by multiple classes, which we call
cross-class features. These features are typically useful for robust
classification, which we offer theoretical evidence to illustrate through a
synthetic data model. Through systematic studies across multiple model
architectures and settings, we find that during the initial stage of AT, the
model tends to learn more cross-class features until the best robustness
checkpoint. As AT further squeezes the training robust loss and causes robust
overfitting, the model tends to make decisions based on more class-specific
features. Based on these discoveries, we further provide a unified view of two
existing properties of AT, including the advantage of soft-label training and
robust overfitting. Overall, these insights refine the current understanding of
AT mechanisms and provide new perspectives on studying them. Our code is
available at https://github.com/PKU-ML/Cross-Class-Features-AT.

*Yizhuo Li,Yuying Ge,Yixiao Ge,Ying Shan,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel framework aligns learnable latent spaces to target distributions using flow-based generative models, avoiding costly likelihood evaluations and ODE solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To align latent spaces with arbitrary target distributions efficiently, leveraging flow models as priors.

Method: Pretrains a flow model on target features, then regularizes latent space via an alignment loss, reformulating flow matching.

Result: The alignment loss approximates the negative log-likelihood of the target distribution, validated in controlled and large-scale experiments.

Conclusion: The framework offers a computationally efficient and theoretically grounded approach for latent space alignment.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for aligning learnable latent spaces to
arbitrary target distributions by leveraging flow-based generative models as
priors. Our method first pretrains a flow model on the target features to
capture the underlying distribution. This fixed flow model subsequently
regularizes the latent space via an alignment loss, which reformulates the flow
matching objective to treat the latents as optimization targets. We formally
prove that minimizing this alignment loss establishes a computationally
tractable surrogate objective for maximizing a variational lower bound on the
log-likelihood of latents under the target distribution. Notably, the proposed
method eliminates computationally expensive likelihood evaluations and avoids
ODE solving during optimization. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate in a
controlled setting that the alignment loss landscape closely approximates the
negative log-likelihood of the target distribution. We further validate the
effectiveness of our approach through large-scale image generation experiments
on ImageNet with diverse target distributions, accompanied by detailed
discussions and ablation studies. With both theoretical and empirical
validation, our framework paves a new way for latent space alignment.

*Ivan Vegner,Sydelle de Souza,Valentin Forch,Martha Lewis,Leonidas A. A. Doumas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses the distinction between systematicity of behavior and representations in ML models, analyzes benchmarks for behavioral systematicity, and suggests methods to assess representational systematicity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between Fodor and Pylyshyn's argument for systematicity of representations and the focus on behavioral systematicity in existing benchmarks and models.

Method: Analyzes benchmarks for behavioral systematicity in language and vision, and highlights methods from mechanistic interpretability to assess representational systematicity.

Result: Identifies limitations in current benchmarks and proposes ways to evaluate representational systematicity.

Conclusion: Emphasizes the need to shift focus from behavioral to representational systematicity for better generalization in ML models.

Abstract: A core aspect of compositionality, systematicity is a desirable property in
ML models as it enables strong generalization to novel contexts. This has led
to numerous studies proposing benchmarks to assess systematic generalization,
as well as models and training regimes designed to enhance it. Many of these
efforts are framed as addressing the challenge posed by Fodor and Pylyshyn.
However, while they argue for systematicity of representations, existing
benchmarks and models primarily focus on the systematicity of behaviour. We
emphasize the crucial nature of this distinction. Furthermore, building on
Hadley's (1994) taxonomy of systematic generalization, we analyze the extent to
which behavioural systematicity is tested by key benchmarks in the literature
across language and vision. Finally, we highlight ways of assessing
systematicity of representations in ML models as practiced in the field of
mechanistic interpretability.

*Kareem Amin,Salman Avestimehr,Sara Babakniya,Alex Bie,Weiwei Kong,Natalia Ponomareva,Umar Syed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper improves DP language model inference by clustering input data and using median aggregation for next-token predictions, enhancing text quality and privacy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uniform sampling in DP language model inference degrades text quality, especially for heterogeneous topics. The paper aims to address this by improving batch selection and aggregation methods.

Method: Clusters input data before batch selection and introduces median aggregation for next-token predictions, leveraging reduced local sensitivity for better privacy guarantees.

Result: Improves synthetic data quality (e.g., MAUVE) and downstream task performance while reducing privacy cost compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances DP language model inference by combining clustering and median aggregation, achieving superior results with lower privacy overhead.

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) language model inference is an approach for
generating private synthetic text. A sensitive input example is used to prompt
an off-the-shelf large language model (LLM) to produce a similar example.
Multiple examples can be aggregated together to formally satisfy the DP
guarantee.
  Prior work creates inference batches by sampling sensitive inputs uniformly
at random. We show that uniform sampling degrades the quality of privately
generated text, especially when the sensitive examples concern heterogeneous
topics.
  We remedy this problem by clustering the input data before selecting
inference batches. Next, we observe that clustering also leads to more similar
next-token predictions across inferences. We use this insight to introduce a
new algorithm that aggregates next token statistics by privately computing
medians instead of averages. This approach leverages the fact that the median
has decreased local sensitivity when next token predictions are similar,
allowing us to state a data-dependent and ex-post DP guarantee about the
privacy properties of this algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate improvements in
terms of representativeness metrics (e.g., MAUVE) as well as downstream task
performance. We show that our method produces high-quality synthetic data at
significantly lower privacy cost than a previous state-of-the-art method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide rigorous privacy guarantees for LLM chatbot interaction analysis while preserving data utility.

Method: Uses private clustering, keyword extraction (frequency-based, TF-IDF, LLM-guided), and DP tools like histogram summarization.

Result: Demonstrates effective balance between privacy and utility, outperforming non-private benchmarks.

Conclusion: Urania successfully extracts insights with strong DP guarantees, enhancing privacy in chatbot analysis.

Abstract: We introduce $Urania$, a novel framework for generating insights about LLM
chatbot interactions with rigorous differential privacy (DP) guarantees. The
framework employs a private clustering mechanism and innovative keyword
extraction methods, including frequency-based, TF-IDF-based, and LLM-guided
approaches. By leveraging DP tools such as clustering, partition selection, and
histogram-based summarization, $Urania$ provides end-to-end privacy protection.
Our evaluation assesses lexical and semantic content preservation, pair
similarity, and LLM-based metrics, benchmarking against a non-private
Clio-inspired pipeline (Tamkin et al., 2024). Moreover, we develop a simple
empirical privacy evaluation that demonstrates the enhanced robustness of our
DP pipeline. The results show the framework's ability to extract meaningful
conversational insights while maintaining stringent user privacy, effectively
balancing data utility with privacy preservation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of managing heterogeneous patient data for personalized care, overcoming limitations of narrow-use-case approaches.

Method: Transforms EHR data into structured representations, uses a holistic pathway prediction model, and introduces a summary mechanism for long-term temporal context.

Result: EHR2Path excels in next time-step prediction and longitudinal simulation, outperforming baselines in tasks like forecasting vital signs and lab results.

Conclusion: EHR2Path enables predictive, personalized healthcare by simulating detailed patient trajectories and improving evaluation tasks.

Abstract: Healthcare systems face significant challenges in managing and interpreting
vast, heterogeneous patient data for personalized care. Existing approaches
often focus on narrow use cases with a limited feature space, overlooking the
complex, longitudinal interactions needed for a holistic understanding of
patient health. In this work, we propose a novel approach to patient pathway
modeling by transforming diverse electronic health record (EHR) data into a
structured representation and designing a holistic pathway prediction model,
EHR2Path, optimized to predict future health trajectories. Further, we
introduce a novel summary mechanism that embeds long-term temporal context into
topic-specific summary tokens, improving performance over text-only models,
while being much more token-efficient. EHR2Path demonstrates strong performance
in both next time-step prediction and longitudinal simulation, outperforming
competitive baselines. It enables detailed simulations of patient trajectories,
inherently targeting diverse evaluation tasks, such as forecasting vital signs,
lab test results, or length-of-stay, opening a path towards predictive and
personalized healthcare.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes key aspects of RL for long-context reasoning, highlighting the roles of positive/negative samples, data inefficiency, and performance instability, proposing solutions to enhance efficiency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address open questions and counterintuitive behaviors in RL for long-context reasoning, focusing on sample roles, data inefficiency, and performance instability.

Method: Systematic analysis of sample roles, strategies to improve data efficiency (relative length rewards, offline sample injection), and investigation of instability via multiple evaluation runs.

Result: Negative samples enhance generalization; training on them alone matches standard RL. Data inefficiency is addressed, and instability is mitigated by multiple evaluations.

Conclusion: The study provides insights and practical solutions to improve RL training for long-context reasoning, emphasizing sample roles, data efficiency, and stability.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in training long-context reasoning models via
reinforcement learning (RL), several open questions and counterintuitive
behaviors remain. This work focuses on three key aspects: (1) We systematically
analyze the roles of positive and negative samples in RL, revealing that
positive samples mainly facilitate data fitting, whereas negative samples
significantly enhance generalization and robustness. Interestingly, training
solely on negative samples can rival standard RL training performance. (2) We
identify substantial data inefficiency in group relative policy optimization,
where over half of the samples yield zero advantage. To address this, we
explore two straightforward strategies, including relative length rewards and
offline sample injection, to better leverage these data and enhance reasoning
efficiency and capability. (3) We investigate unstable performance across
various reasoning models and benchmarks, attributing instability to uncertain
problems with ambiguous outcomes, and demonstrate that multiple evaluation runs
mitigate this issue.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes HAR contrastive loss and SHARP framework to mitigate degree bias in GNNs by adding more positive pairs and adaptive weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs suffer from degree bias in node classification, where low-degree nodes receive insufficient and noisy information due to limited positive pairs in GCL.

Method: Introduces HAR contrastive loss (leveraging labels for more positive pairs and adaptive weighting) and SHARP framework for broader application.

Result: SHARP outperforms baselines on four datasets, improving performance globally and across degree levels.

Conclusion: The proposed HAR and SHARP effectively address degree bias in GNNs, validated by theory and experiments.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often suffer from degree bias in node
classification tasks, where prediction performance varies across nodes with
different degrees. Several approaches, which adopt Graph Contrastive Learning
(GCL), have been proposed to mitigate this bias. However, the limited number of
positive pairs and the equal weighting of all positives and negatives in GCL
still lead to low-degree nodes acquiring insufficient and noisy information.
This paper proposes the Hardness Adaptive Reweighted (HAR) contrastive loss to
mitigate degree bias. It adds more positive pairs by leveraging node labels and
adaptively weights positive and negative pairs based on their learning
hardness. In addition, we develop an experimental framework named SHARP to
extend HAR to a broader range of scenarios. Both our theoretical analysis and
experiments validate the effectiveness of SHARP. The experimental results
across four datasets show that SHARP achieves better performance against
baselines at both global and degree levels.

*Danil Sivtsov,Ivan Rodkin,Gleb Kuzmin,Yuri Kuratov,Ivan Oseledets*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diagonal Batching improves RMTs by enabling parallelism across segments, reducing inference time and memory usage without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models face inefficiencies with long-context inference due to quadratic time and linear memory complexity. RMTs address this but introduce sequential bottlenecks.

Method: Diagonal Batching, a scheduling scheme, allows parallelism in RMTs while maintaining exact recurrence, eliminating sequential constraints.

Result: Diagonal Batching achieves a 3.3x speedup over standard LLaMA-1B and 1.8x over sequential RMT on 131,072-token sequences.

Conclusion: Diagonal Batching makes RMTs more practical for real-world long-context applications by reducing inference cost and latency.

Abstract: Transformer models struggle with long-context inference due to their
quadratic time and linear memory complexity. Recurrent Memory Transformers
(RMTs) offer a solution by reducing the asymptotic cost to linear time and
constant memory usage. However, their memory update mechanism leads to
sequential execution, causing a performance bottleneck.
  We introduce Diagonal Batching, a scheduling scheme that unlocks parallelism
across segments in RMTs while preserving exact recurrence. This approach
eliminates the sequential constraint, enabling efficient GPU inference even for
single long-context inputs without complex batching and pipelining techniques.
Because the technique is purely a run-time computation reordering, existing RMT
models adopt it with no retraining.
  Applied to a LLaMA-1B ARMT model, Diagonal Batching yields a 3.3x speedup
over standard full-attention LLaMA-1B and a 1.8x speedup over the sequential
RMT implementation on 131,072-token sequences. By removing sequential
bottleneck, Diagonal Batching reduces inference cost and latency, thereby
strengthening RMTs as a practical solution for real-world, long-context
applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a stable, parallelizable version of the Mesa layer, derived from an in-context regression objective, achieving better performance in language modeling at scale, albeit with higher computational cost during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the linear scaling of memory and compute in transformers during inference, the authors explore recurrent neural network (RNN) models like DeltaNet, Mamba, and xLSTM, unified by an in-context regression objective.

Method: The proposed Mesa layer is derived from an in-context loss, optimized at every time point using a fast conjugate gradient solver, enabling chunkwise parallelization.

Result: The model achieves lower perplexity and higher downstream performance, especially in long-context tasks, but requires additional FLOPs during inference.

Conclusion: The work aligns with trends of increasing test-time compute for performance gains, here by solving sequential optimization problems within the network.

Abstract: Sequence modeling is currently dominated by causal transformer architectures
that use softmax self-attention. Although widely adopted, transformers require
scaling memory and compute linearly during inference. A recent stream of work
linearized the softmax operation, resulting in powerful recurrent neural
network (RNN) models with constant memory and compute costs such as DeltaNet,
Mamba or xLSTM. These models can be unified by noting that their recurrent
layer dynamics can all be derived from an in-context regression objective,
approximately optimized through an online learning rule. Here, we join this
line of work and introduce a numerically stable, chunkwise parallelizable
version of the recently proposed Mesa layer (von Oswald et al., 2024), and
study it in language modeling at the billion-parameter scale. This layer again
stems from an in-context loss, but which is now minimized to optimality at
every time point using a fast conjugate gradient solver. Through an extensive
suite of experiments, we show that optimal test-time training enables reaching
lower language modeling perplexity and higher downstream benchmark performance
than previous RNNs, especially on tasks requiring long context understanding.
This performance gain comes at the cost of additional flops spent during
inference time. Our results are therefore intriguingly related to recent trends
of increasing test-time compute to improve performance -- here by spending
compute to solve sequential optimization problems within the neural network
itself.

TL;DR: Proposes two techniques (difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay) to improve data efficiency in RL fine-tuning of LLMs, reducing training time by 25-65%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL fine-tuning for LLMs is resource-intensive, and existing work overlooks data efficiency.

Method: Uses adaptive difficulty for online data selection and rollout replay to reduce computation.

Result: Achieves same performance as GRPO with 25-65% less training time.

Conclusion: The techniques significantly enhance data efficiency in RL fine-tuning for LLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become an effective approach for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs), particularly to enhance their reasoning
capabilities. However, RL fine-tuning remains highly resource-intensive, and
existing work has largely overlooked the problem of data efficiency. In this
paper, we propose two techniques to improve data efficiency in LLM RL
fine-tuning: difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay. We
introduce the notion of adaptive difficulty to guide online data selection,
prioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that are more likely to yield
informative learning signals. To estimate adaptive difficulty efficiently, we
develop an attention-based framework that requires rollouts for only a small
reference set of questions. The adaptive difficulty of the remaining questions
is then estimated based on their similarity to this set. To further reduce
rollout cost, we introduce a rollout replay mechanism that reuses recent
rollouts, lowering per-step computation while maintaining stable updates.
Extensive experiments across 6 LLM-dataset combinations show that our method
reduces RL fine-tuning time by 25% to 65% to reach the same level of
performance as the original GRPO algorithm.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Kinetics Scaling Law, showing smaller models' effectiveness is overestimated due to memory bottlenecks. Sparse attention is proposed to improve efficiency, outperforming dense models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work overlooks memory access bottlenecks in test-time scaling, leading to overestimation of smaller models' effectiveness.

Method: Holistic analysis of models (0.6B to 32B parameters) and introduction of sparse attention to reduce per-token costs.

Result: Sparse attention models outperform dense ones, with significant accuracy gains (60+ points in low-cost, 5+ in high-cost regimes).

Conclusion: Sparse attention is crucial for test-time scaling, as it enables longer generations and better accuracy without saturating like parameter scaling.

Abstract: We rethink test-time scaling laws from a practical efficiency perspective,
revealing that the effectiveness of smaller models is significantly
overestimated. Prior work, grounded in compute-optimality, overlooks critical
memory access bottlenecks introduced by inference-time strategies (e.g.,
Best-of-$N$, long CoTs). Our holistic analysis, spanning models from 0.6B to
32B parameters, reveals a new Kinetics Scaling Law that better guides resource
allocation by incorporating both computation and memory access costs. Kinetics
Scaling Law suggests that test-time compute is more effective when used on
models above a threshold than smaller ones. A key reason is that in TTS,
attention, rather than parameter count, emerges as the dominant cost factor.
Motivated by this, we propose a new scaling paradigm centered on sparse
attention, which lowers per-token cost and enables longer generations and more
parallel samples within the same resource budget. Empirically, we show that
sparse attention models consistently outperform dense counterparts, achieving
over 60 points gains in low-cost regimes and over 5 points gains in high-cost
regimes for problem-solving accuracy on AIME, encompassing evaluations on
state-of-the-art MoEs. These results suggest that sparse attention is essential
for realizing the full potential of test-time scaling because, unlike training,
where parameter scaling saturates, test-time accuracy continues to improve
through increased generation. The code is available at

*Adrian Łańcucki,Konrad Staniszewski,Piotr Nawrot,Edoardo M. Ponti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS) to compress the KV cache in Transformer LLMs, enabling more tokens to be generated within the same compute budget and improving reasoning accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The key-value (KV) cache size bottlenecks generation cost in Transformer LLMs, limiting efficiency. The paper aims to address this by compressing the KV cache to allow hyper-scaling without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: The authors propose Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a method that sparsifies KV caches with minimal training (1K steps) and delays token eviction to preserve critical information.

Result: DMS achieves 8× compression while maintaining better accuracy than training-free sparse attention. It boosts accuracy on benchmarks like AIME 24, GPQA, and LiveCodeBench for models like Qwen-R1 32B.

Conclusion: Inference-time hyper-scaling with DMS is practical and effective, enhancing accuracy without increasing runtime or memory load.

Abstract: Inference-time scaling trades efficiency for increased reasoning accuracy by
generating longer or more parallel sequences. However, in Transformer LLMs,
generation cost is bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache, rather
than the number of generated tokens. Hence, we explore inference-time
hyper-scaling: by compressing the KV cache, we can generate more tokens within
the same compute budget and further improve the accuracy of scaled inference.
The success of this approach, however, hinges on the ability of compression
methods to preserve accuracy even at high compression ratios. To make
hyper-scaling practical, we introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a
novel method for sparsifying KV caches that only requires 1K training steps to
achieve 8$\times$ compression, while maintaining better accuracy than
training-free sparse attention. Instead of prematurely discarding cached
tokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and
preserving critical information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
inference-time hyper-scaling with DMS on multiple families of LLMs, showing
that it boosts accuracy for comparable inference runtime and memory load. For
instance, we enhance Qwen-R1 32B by an average of 9.1 points on AIME 24, 7.6 on
GPQA, and 9.6 on LiveCodeBench across compute budgets.

### [514] [You Only Train Once](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04349)
*Christos Sakaridis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: YOTO (You Only Train Once) automates loss weight hyperparameter optimization in one training run, outperforming grid search in computer vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify and improve the process of optimizing loss weights in model training, avoiding multiple runs.

Method: Uses gradient-based optimization to treat loss hyperparameters as network parameters, with a softmax layer and regularization loss.

Result: Outperforms grid search in 3D estimation and semantic segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: YOTO effectively optimizes loss weights in one shot, enhancing model performance.

Abstract: The title of this paper is perhaps an overclaim. Of course, the process of
creating and optimizing a learned model inevitably involves multiple training
runs which potentially feature different architectural designs, input and
output encodings, and losses. However, our method, You Only Train Once (YOTO),
indeed contributes to limiting training to one shot for the latter aspect of
losses selection and weighting. We achieve this by automatically optimizing
loss weight hyperparameters of learned models in one shot via standard
gradient-based optimization, treating these hyperparameters as regular
parameters of the networks and learning them. To this end, we leverage the
differentiability of the composite loss formulation which is widely used for
optimizing multiple empirical losses simultaneously and model it as a novel
layer which is parameterized with a softmax operation that satisfies the
inherent positivity constraints on loss hyperparameters while avoiding
degenerate empirical gradients. We complete our joint end-to-end optimization
scheme by defining a novel regularization loss on the learned hyperparameters,
which models a uniformity prior among the employed losses while ensuring
boundedness of the identified optima. We evidence the efficacy of YOTO in
jointly optimizing loss hyperparameters and regular model parameters in one
shot by comparing it to the commonly used brute-force grid search across
state-of-the-art networks solving two key problems in computer vision, i.e. 3D
estimation and semantic segmentation, and showing that it consistently
outperforms the best grid-search model on unseen test data. Code will be made
publicly available.

*Ranjith Merugu,Bryan Bo Cao,Shubham Jain*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: StatsMerging is a lightweight learning-based model merging method that uses weight distribution statistics, SVD, and task-specific teacher distillation to merge models without ground truth labels or test samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of accommodating multiple large models within constrained memory budgets efficiently.

Method: Leverages SVD for task-specific weight distributions, uses StatsMergeLearner for modeling, and introduces Task-Specific Teacher Distillation for merging heterogeneous architectures.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in accuracy, generalization, and robustness across eight tasks.

Conclusion: StatsMerging is an effective solution for model merging, offering improved performance and adaptability without requiring labeled data.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising solution to accommodate multiple
large models within constrained memory budgets. We present StatsMerging, a
novel lightweight learning-based model merging method guided by weight
distribution statistics without requiring ground truth labels or test samples.
StatsMerging offers three key advantages: (1) It uniquely leverages singular
values from singular value decomposition (SVD) to capture task-specific weight
distributions, serving as a proxy for task importance to guide task coefficient
prediction; (2) It employs a lightweight learner StatsMergeLearner to model the
weight distributions of task-specific pre-trained models, improving
generalization and enhancing adaptation to unseen samples; (3) It introduces
Task-Specific Teacher Distillation for merging vision models with heterogeneous
architectures, a merging learning paradigm that avoids costly ground-truth
labels by task-specific teacher distillation. Notably, we present two types of
knowledge distillation, (a) distilling knowledge from task-specific models to
StatsMergeLearner; and (b) distilling knowledge from models with heterogeneous
architectures prior to merging. Extensive experiments across eight tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness of StatsMerging. Our results show that
StatsMerging outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of overall
accuracy, generalization to unseen tasks, and robustness to image quality
variations.

### [516] [Scaling Laws for Robust Comparison of Open Foundation Language-Vision Models and Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04598)
*Marianna Nezhurina,Tomer Porian,Giovanni Pucceti,Tommie Kerssies,Romain Beaumont,Mehdi Cherti,Jenia Jitsev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates how scaling laws can be used to compare models and datasets for pre-training, focusing on CLIP and MaMMUT. It shows MaMMUT's superior scalability and efficiency, validated across tasks and datasets, and releases models and code for reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a systematic method for comparing foundation models and datasets using scaling laws, avoiding single-scale biases and enabling better pre-training decisions.

Method: Derives full scaling laws for CLIP and MaMMUT using dense measurements across model and sample scales, validating predictions on held-out data and downstream tasks.

Result: MaMMUT shows stronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than CLIP, consistently across tasks (classification, retrieval, segmentation) and datasets (DataComp, DFN, Re-LAION).

Conclusion: Scaling laws enable reliable model and dataset comparisons across scales, supporting systematic improvements. The release of models and code facilitates reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: In studies of transferable learning, scaling laws are obtained for various
important foundation models to predict their properties and performance at
larger scales. We show here how scaling law derivation can also be used for
model and dataset comparison, allowing to decide which procedure is to be
preferred for pre-training. For the first time, full scaling laws based on
dense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales are
derived for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT,
that use either contrastive only or contrastive and captioning text generative
loss. Ensuring sufficient prediction accuracy for held out points, we use
derived scaling laws to compare both models, obtaining evidence for MaMMUT's
stronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than standard
CLIP. To strengthen validity of the comparison, we show scaling laws for
various downstream tasks, classification, retrieval, and segmentation, and for
different open datasets, DataComp, DFN and Re-LAION, observing consistently the
same trends. We show that comparison can also be performed when deriving
scaling laws with a constant learning rate schedule, reducing compute cost.
Accurate derivation of scaling laws provides thus means to perform model and
dataset comparison across scale spans, avoiding misleading conclusions based on
measurements from single reference scales only, paving the road for systematic
comparison and improvement of open foundation models and datasets for their
creation. We release all the pre-trained models with their intermediate
checkpoints, including openMaMMUT-L/14, which achieves $80.3\%$ zero-shot
ImageNet-1k accuracy, trained on 12.8B samples from DataComp-1.4B. Code for
reproducing experiments in the paper and raw experiments data can be found at

### [517] [Exploring bidirectional bounds for minimax-training of Energy-based models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04609)
*Cong Geng,Jia Wang,Li Chen,Zhiyong Gao,Jes Frellsen,Søren Hauberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes bidirectional bounds for training energy-based models (EBMs) to stabilize training and improve performance, comparing four derived bounds and demonstrating their effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EBMs are challenging to train, and recent methods using variational lower bounds can cause instabilities. The authors aim to address this by introducing bidirectional bounds.

Method: The authors derive and compare four bounds on log-likelihood: two lower bounds (based on generator Jacobian singular values and mutual information) and two upper bounds (gradient penalty-like and diffusion-based). Algorithms for evaluating these bounds are provided.

Result: Bidirectional bounds stabilize EBM training, leading to high-quality density estimation and sample generation.

Conclusion: The proposed bidirectional bounds effectively address training instabilities in EBMs, offering improved performance and practical algorithms for implementation.

Abstract: Energy-based models (EBMs) estimate unnormalized densities in an elegant
framework, but they are generally difficult to train. Recent work has linked
EBMs to generative adversarial networks, by noting that they can be trained
through a minimax game using a variational lower bound. To avoid the
instabilities caused by minimizing a lower bound, we propose to instead work
with bidirectional bounds, meaning that we maximize a lower bound and minimize
an upper bound when training the EBM. We investigate four different bounds on
the log-likelihood derived from different perspectives. We derive lower bounds
based on the singular values of the generator Jacobian and on mutual
information. To upper bound the negative log-likelihood, we consider a gradient
penalty-like bound, as well as one based on diffusion processes. In all cases,
we provide algorithms for evaluating the bounds. We compare the different
bounds to investigate, the pros and cons of the different approaches. Finally,
we demonstrate that the use of bidirectional bounds stabilizes EBM training and
yields high-quality density estimation and sample generation.

### [518] [Identifying and Understanding Cross-Class Features in Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05032)
*Zeming Wei,Yiwen Guo,Yisen Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies adversarial training (AT) through class-wise feature attribution, identifying cross-class features as key for robustness. It shows AT initially learns these features but shifts to class-specific ones during overfitting, unifying insights on soft-label training and robust overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms and dynamics of adversarial training (AT) by analyzing class-wise feature attribution, particularly focusing on cross-class features.

Method: The study uses theoretical evidence and systematic experiments across various model architectures to analyze the role of cross-class and class-specific features in AT.

Result: AT initially learns cross-class features for robustness but shifts to class-specific features during overfitting, providing a unified view of soft-label training and robust overfitting.

Conclusion: The findings refine understanding of AT mechanisms and offer new perspectives for future research, with code available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Adversarial training (AT) has been considered one of the most effective
methods for making deep neural networks robust against adversarial attacks,
while the training mechanisms and dynamics of AT remain open research problems.
In this paper, we present a novel perspective on studying AT through the lens
of class-wise feature attribution. Specifically, we identify the impact of a
key family of features on AT that are shared by multiple classes, which we call
cross-class features. These features are typically useful for robust
classification, which we offer theoretical evidence to illustrate through a
synthetic data model. Through systematic studies across multiple model
architectures and settings, we find that during the initial stage of AT, the
model tends to learn more cross-class features until the best robustness
checkpoint. As AT further squeezes the training robust loss and causes robust
overfitting, the model tends to make decisions based on more class-specific
features. Based on these discoveries, we further provide a unified view of two
existing properties of AT, including the advantage of soft-label training and
robust overfitting. Overall, these insights refine the current understanding of
AT mechanisms and provide new perspectives on studying them. Our code is
available at https://github.com/PKU-ML/Cross-Class-Features-AT.

*Yizhuo Li,Yuying Ge,Yixiao Ge,Ying Shan,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel framework aligns latent spaces to target distributions using flow-based models, avoiding expensive likelihood evaluations and ODE solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To align learnable latent spaces with arbitrary target distributions efficiently.

Method: Pretrains a flow model on target features, then regularizes the latent space via an alignment loss derived from flow matching.

Result: The alignment loss approximates the negative log-likelihood of the target distribution, validated in controlled and large-scale experiments.

Conclusion: The framework offers a computationally efficient and theoretically grounded method for latent space alignment.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for aligning learnable latent spaces to
arbitrary target distributions by leveraging flow-based generative models as
priors. Our method first pretrains a flow model on the target features to
capture the underlying distribution. This fixed flow model subsequently
regularizes the latent space via an alignment loss, which reformulates the flow
matching objective to treat the latents as optimization targets. We formally
prove that minimizing this alignment loss establishes a computationally
tractable surrogate objective for maximizing a variational lower bound on the
log-likelihood of latents under the target distribution. Notably, the proposed
method eliminates computationally expensive likelihood evaluations and avoids
ODE solving during optimization. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate in a
controlled setting that the alignment loss landscape closely approximates the
negative log-likelihood of the target distribution. We further validate the
effectiveness of our approach through large-scale image generation experiments
on ImageNet with diverse target distributions, accompanied by detailed
discussions and ablation studies. With both theoretical and empirical
validation, our framework paves a new way for latent space alignment.

TL;DR: A survey on risks and limitations of Concept-based Models, highlighting challenges like concept leakage and adversarial vulnerabilities, and discussing mitigation strategies and future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing adoption of Concept-based Models in sensitive domains by identifying their limitations and improving their reliability and trustworthiness.

Method: Comprehensive survey aggregating challenges, architecture choices, and recent advances in Supervised and Unsupervised paradigms.

Result: Identifies key issues (e.g., concept leakage, robustness) and mitigation strategies, while highlighting open problems.

Conclusion: Concept-based Models need further research to enhance reliability and applicability, with promising avenues for future work.

Abstract: Concept-based Models are a class of inherently explainable networks that
improve upon standard Deep Neural Networks by providing a rationale behind
their predictions using human-understandable `concepts'. With these models
being highly successful in critical applications like medical diagnosis and
financial risk prediction, there is a natural push toward their wider adoption
in sensitive domains to instill greater trust among diverse stakeholders.
However, recent research has uncovered significant limitations in the structure
of such networks, their training procedure, underlying assumptions, and their
susceptibility to adversarial vulnerabilities. In particular, issues such as
concept leakage, entangled representations, and limited robustness to
perturbations pose challenges to their reliability and generalization.
Additionally, the effectiveness of human interventions in these models remains
an open question, raising concerns about their real-world applicability. In
this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on the risks and limitations
associated with Concept-based Models. In particular, we focus on aggregating
commonly encountered challenges and the architecture choices mitigating these
challenges for Supervised and Unsupervised paradigms. We also examine recent
advances in improving their reliability and discuss open problems and promising
avenues of future research in this domain.

TL;DR: The paper proposes augmenting OOD detectors with probabilistic reasoning using Markov logic networks (MLNs) to improve performance and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring deep learning model reliability in open-world scenarios requires effective OOD detection, which current methods lack in explainability and performance.

Method: Utilizes MLNs to combine first-order logic with probabilistic reasoning, enhancing existing OOD detectors. Introduces an algorithm for learning logical constraints from data.

Result: MLNs significantly improve OOD detector performance across datasets while maintaining computational efficiency. The learning algorithm proves effective.

Conclusion: MLNs offer a promising approach to enhance OOD detection with better explainability and performance, validated by experiments.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models operating in open-world scenarios. Current OOD
detectors mainly rely on statistical models to identify unusual patterns in the
latent representations of a deep neural network. This work proposes to augment
existing OOD detectors with probabilistic reasoning, utilizing Markov logic
networks (MLNs). MLNs connect first-order logic with probabilistic reasoning to
assign probabilities to inputs based on weighted logical constraints defined
over human-understandable concepts, which offers improved explainability.
Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we demonstrate that MLNs
can significantly enhance the performance of a wide range of existing OOD
detectors while maintaining computational efficiency. Furthermore, we introduce
a simple algorithm for learning logical constraints for OOD detection from a
dataset and showcase its effectiveness.

### [522] [Triple Attention Transformer Architecture for Time-Dependent Concrete Creep Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04243)
*Warayut Dokduea,Weerachart Tangchirapat,Sompote Youwai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel Triple Attention Transformer Architecture is introduced for predicting concrete creep, outperforming traditional methods with high accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches fail to model the sequential nature of concrete creep, treating time as a static input. This limits accuracy and practical applicability.

Method: The architecture uses a triple-stream attention framework (temporal, feature, and batch attention) within a transformer to model creep as an autoregressive sequence task.

Result: Achieves 1.63% mean absolute percentage error and R2 of 0.999, with Young's modulus identified as the most predictive feature.

Conclusion: The work validates transformers for materials science, offering a data-driven solution with practical deployment via a web interface.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel Triple Attention Transformer Architecture for
predicting time-dependent concrete creep, addressing fundamental limitations in
current approaches that treat time as merely an input parameter rather than
modeling the sequential nature of deformation development. By transforming
concrete creep prediction into an autoregressive sequence modeling task similar
to language processing, our architecture leverages the transformer's
self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in historical
creep patterns. The model implements a triple-stream attention framework
incorporating temporal attention for sequential progression, feature attention
for material property interactions, and batch attention for inter-sample
relationships. Evaluated on experimental datasets with standardized daily
measurements spanning 160 days, the architecture achieves exceptional
performance with mean absolute percentage error of 1.63% and R2 values of 0.999
across all datasets, substantially outperforming traditional empirical models
and existing machine learning approaches. Ablation studies confirm the critical
role of attention mechanisms, with attention pooling contributing most
significantly to model performance. SHAP analysis reveals Young's modulus as
the primary predictive feature, followed by density and compressive strength,
providing interpretability essential for engineering applications. A deployed
web-based interface facilitates practical implementation, enabling real-time
predictions using standard laboratory parameters. This work establishes the
viability of applying transformer architectures to materials science problems,
demonstrating the potential for data-driven approaches to revolutionize
structural behavior prediction and engineering design practices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning LLMs for safety is impractical; SafeSteer offers a simpler, effective alternative.

Method: Uses category-specific steering vectors and a gradient-free unsupervised approach to adjust LLM outputs for safety without explicit refusal.

Result: Demonstrates precise safety control across LLMs, datasets, and risk categories while preserving topic relevance.

Conclusion: SafeSteer is a simple, effective solution for safety adjustments in LLMs without complex retraining.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to adapt to evolving safety policies
is costly and impractical. Mechanistic interpretability enables inference-time
control through latent activation steering, yet its potential for precise,
customizable safety adjustments remains largely untapped. This paper
investigates an approach called SafeSteer for guiding the outputs of LLMs by:
(i) leveraging category-specific steering vectors for more precise control,
(ii) employing a simple, gradient-free unsupervised method to enhance safety
steering while preserving text quality, topic relevance, and without explicit
refusal, and (iii) accomplishing this without a hard requirement of contrastive
pairwise safe data. We also highlight that our method, being simple and
effective, aligns with recent studies suggesting that simple techniques often
outperform more complex ones in activation steering. We showcase the
effectiveness of our approach across various LLMs, datasets, and risk
categories, demonstrating its ability to provide precise control, prevent
blanket refusals, and guide models toward generating safe content while
maintaining topic relevance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a tailored AI approach for forest fire risk prediction, focusing on departmental contexts in France to provide region-specific insights, addressing the limitations of traditional binary classification methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate change has increased fire frequency and intensity, making accurate fire prediction crucial. Traditional binary classification oversimplifies the problem, lacking local context for end-users like firefighters.

Method: The paper proposes a new AI approach that models fire risk at the departmental level, considering local terrain, climate, and historical data, and benchmarks it on a national-scale dataset for metropolitan France.

Result: The method provides more actionable, region-specific fire risk predictions, outperforming traditional binary classification by addressing local variability.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the importance of localized fire risk modeling and sets a benchmark for future AI applications in this domain, with supplementary materials available for further research.

Abstract: Forest fire prediction involves estimating the likelihood of fire ignition or
related risk levels in a specific area over a defined time period. With climate
change intensifying fire behavior and frequency, accurate prediction has become
one of the most pressing challenges in Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Traditionally, fire ignition is approached as a binary classification task in
the literature. However, this formulation oversimplifies the problem,
especially from the perspective of end-users such as firefighters. In general,
as is the case in France, firefighting units are organized by department, each
with its terrain, climate conditions, and historical experience with fire
events. Consequently, fire risk should be modeled in a way that is sensitive to
local conditions and does not assume uniform risk across all regions. This
paper proposes a new approach that tailors fire risk assessment to departmental
contexts, offering more actionable and region-specific predictions for
operational use. With this, we present the first national-scale AI benchmark
for metropolitan France using state-of-the-art AI models on a relatively
unexplored dataset. Finally, we offer a summary of important future works that
should be taken into account. Supplementary materials are available on GitHub.

Conclusion: MUC-G4 provides a reliable solution for ensuring safety and reliability of compressed neural networks in practical applications.

Abstract: The rapid development of deep learning has led to challenges in deploying
neural networks on edge devices, mainly due to their high memory and runtime
complexity. Network compression techniques, such as quantization and pruning,
aim to reduce this complexity while maintaining accuracy. However, existing
incremental verification methods often focus only on quantization and struggle
with structural changes. This paper presents MUC-G4 (Minimal Unsat Core-Guided
Incremental Verification), a novel framework for incremental verification of
compressed deep neural networks. It encodes both the original and compressed
networks into SMT formulas, classifies changes, and use \emph{Minimal Unsat
Cores (MUCs)} from the original network to guide efficient verification for the
compressed network. Experimental results show its effectiveness in handling
quantization and pruning, with high proof reuse rates and significant speedup
in verification time compared to traditional methods. MUC-G4 hence offers a
promising solution for ensuring the safety and reliability of compressed neural

Motivation: To understand the influence of the sampling distribution on DPO's training dynamics and optimization landscape.

Method: Analyzed response distribution effects on policy updates, designed a simplified alignment model, and conducted empirical experiments.

Result: High-quality, frequent responses enhance gradient signals and improve policy learning, supporting the online DPO framework.

Conclusion: The study provides theoretical and empirical justification for the role of sampling distribution in DPO, emphasizing its importance for effective policy learning.

Abstract: We study the role of the sampling distribution in Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) and aim to understand its impact on DPO's training dynamics.
Our analyses show that both the solution space and the convergence behavior of
DPO depend on the support and quality of the generating distribution. We first
analyze how distribution of responses influences policy updates during gradient
descent, drawing connections to common phenomena found in practice. We then
design a simplified yet well-structured alignment model as a proxy, and develop
quantitative results showing how more frequent high-quality responses amplify
the gradient signal and improve the optimization landscape, leading to more
effective policy learning. Our theoretical findings are supported by empirical
experiments and provide a principled justification for the online DPO framework
in practice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SF2Bench, a dataset for compound flood analysis in South Florida, and evaluates six machine learning methods for flood forecasting, highlighting their strengths in capturing temporal and spatial dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing global flood risks and inefficiency of traditional physics-based methods necessitate improved forecasting approaches using machine learning, but comprehensive datasets are scarce.

Method: The authors introduce SF2Bench, integrating tide, rainfall, groundwater, and human management data. They evaluate six machine learning methods (MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, Transformers, LLMs) for flood forecasting.

Result: Experiments show varying performance across methods, revealing their diverse capabilities in capturing temporal and spatial dependencies in compound floods.

Conclusion: SF2Bench enables detailed analysis of flood drivers, and machine learning methods offer promising alternatives to traditional approaches, though dataset limitations remain a challenge.

Abstract: Forecasting compound floods presents a significant challenge due to the
intricate interplay of meteorological, hydrological, and oceanographic factors.
Analyzing compound floods has become more critical as the global climate
increases flood risks. Traditional physics-based methods, such as the
Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System, are often
time-inefficient. Machine learning has recently demonstrated promise in both
modeling accuracy and computational efficiency. However, the scarcity of
comprehensive datasets currently hinders systematic analysis. Existing
water-related datasets are often limited by a sparse network of monitoring
stations and incomplete coverage of relevant factors. To address this
challenge, we introduce SF2Bench, a comprehensive time series collection on
compound floods in South Florida, which integrates four key factors: tide,
rainfall, groundwater, and human management activities (gate and pump
controlling). This integration allows for a more detailed analysis of the
individual contributions of these drivers to compound flooding and informs the
development of improved flood forecasting approaches. To comprehensively
evaluate the potential of various modeling paradigms, we assess the performance
of six categories of methods, encompassing Multilayer Perceptrons,
Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Graph Neural
Networks, Transformers, and Large Language Models. We verified the impact of
different key features on flood forecasting through experiments. Our analysis
examines temporal and spatial aspects, providing insights into the influence of
historical data and spatial dependencies. The varying performance across these
approaches underscores the diverse capabilities of each in capturing complex
temporal and spatial dependencies inherent in compound floods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based symbolic regression methods lack explicit data understanding and systematic reflection, limiting robustness and discovery capability.

Method: DrSR integrates data analysis (e.g., structural relationships) with reflective learning, creating a feedback loop to refine equation generation.

Result: DrSR improves valid equation rates and outperforms classical and recent LLM-based methods in accuracy, generalization, and search efficiency.

Conclusion: DrSR demonstrates strong potential for scientific equation discovery by balancing data understanding and generation reflection.

Abstract: Symbolic regression is a fundamental tool for discovering interpretable
mathematical expressions from data, with broad applications across scientific
and engineering domains. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong performance in this task, leveraging embedded scientific
priors and reasoning capabilities to surpass traditional methods. However,
existing LLM-based approaches, such as LLM-SR, often over-rely on internal
priors, lacking explicit data understanding and systematic reflection during
equation generation. To address these limitations, we propose DrSR (Dual
Reasoning Symbolic Regression), a framework that combines data-driven insight
with reflective learning to enhance both robustness and discovery capability.
Specifically, DrSR guides LLMs to analyze structural relationships (e.g.,
monotonicity, nonlinearity, and correlation) within the data to generate
structured descriptions. Simultaneously, it monitors equation performance and
establishes a feedback loop to refine subsequent generations. By integrating
data understanding and generation reflection in a closed loop, DrSR enables
more efficient exploration of the symbolic expression space. Experiments across
interdisciplinary datasets in physics, chemistry, biology, and materials
science demonstrate that DrSR substantially improves the valid equation rate
and consistently outperforms both classical and recent LLM-based methods in
terms of accuracy, generalization, and search efficiency. These results
underscore its potential for scientific equation discovery.

### [529] [Training-free AI for Earth Observation Change Detection using Physics Aware Neuromorphic Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04285)
*Stephen Smith,Cormac Purcell,Zdenka Kuncic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Physics Aware Neuromorphic Network (PANN) is proposed for on-board satellite image processing to prioritize disaster-related data for downlinking, achieving comparable or better results than state-of-the-art AI models without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the bottleneck of bandwidth-limited downlinking of satellite data by enabling efficient on-board processing for timely disaster response.

Method: Uses a neuromorphic network inspired by memristors, with dynamic weights updated via physics-based rules, to detect changes in multi-spectral images and generate prioritization maps.

Result: PANN matched or outperformed a state-of-the-art AI model in natural disaster detection, requiring no training and minimal computing resources.

Conclusion: PANN offers a viable, resource-efficient solution for on-board satellite data processing to prioritize critical disaster information.

Abstract: Earth observations from low Earth orbit satellites provide vital information
for decision makers to better manage time-sensitive events such as natural
disasters. For the data to be most effective for first responders, low latency
is required between data capture and its arrival to decision makers. A major
bottleneck is in the bandwidth-limited downlinking of the data from satellites
to ground stations. One approach to overcome this challenge is to process at
least some of the data on-board and prioritise pertinent data to be downlinked.
In this work we propose a Physics Aware Neuromorphic Network (PANN) to detect
changes caused by natural disasters from a sequence of multi-spectral satellite
images and produce a change map, enabling relevant data to be prioritised for
downlinking. The PANN used in this study is motivated by physical neural
networks comprised of nano-electronic circuit elements known as "memristors"
(nonlinear resistors with memory). The weights in the network are dynamic and
update in response to varying input signals according to memristor equations of
state and electrical circuit conservation laws. The PANN thus generates
physics-constrained dynamical output features which are used to detect changes
in a natural disaster detection task by applying a distance-based metric.
Importantly, this makes the whole model training-free, allowing it to be
implemented with minimal computing resources. The PANN was benchmarked against
a state-of-the-art AI model and achieved comparable or better results in each
natural disaster category. It thus presents a promising solution to the
challenge of resource-constrained on-board processing.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Backbone Augmented Training (BAT) to improve adaptation of large models by leveraging backbone data, introduces ALBAT for efficient implementation, and validates its effectiveness in low-data scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited adaptation data poses challenges for training large models, prompting the need to utilize backbone data for augmentation.

Method: Proposes BAT, formulates key mathematical propositions, introduces ALBAT for data selection, and validates it in personalization and language tasks.

Result: ALBAT enhances adaptation training in low-data scenarios, proving BAT's validity and benefits.

Conclusion: BAT and ALBAT effectively address adaptation challenges by leveraging backbone data, improving performance with minimal resources.

Abstract: Adaptations facilitate efficient training of large backbone models, including
diffusion models for image generation and transformer-based language models.
While various adaptation techniques enhance performance with minimal
computational resources, limited adaptation data often leads to challenges in
training. To address this, we focus on the enormous amount of backbone data
used to pre-train the backbone models. We propose Backbone Augmented Training
(BAT), a method that leverages backbone data to augment the adaptation dataset.
First, we formulate and prove two mathematical key propositions: one
establishes the validity of BAT, while the other identifies a condition under
which BAT benefits adaptation. Furthermore, we introduce an advanced data
selection scheme that satisfies these propositions and present ALBAT algorithm
to implement this approach. ALBAT efficiently enhances adaptation training in
both personalization and language generation tasks with scarce data.

### [531] [Relational reasoning and inductive bias in transformers trained on a transitive inference task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04289)
*Jesse Geerts,Stephanie Chan,Claudia Clopath,Kimberly Stachenfeld*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers show distinct relational reasoning behaviors in in-weights (IWL) and in-context learning (ICL) regimes, with IWL naturally generalizing transitive inference, while ICL requires pre-training on structured tasks to achieve similar results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how transformers perform relational reasoning, specifically transitive inference, and compare their behavior in two learning regimes: IWL and ICL.

Method: Investigating transformers on a transitive inference task, comparing IWL (storing information in network parameters) and ICL (using input sequence information). Mechanistic analysis was conducted to identify underlying strategies.

Result: IWL models generalize transitive inference naturally, while ICL models rely on match-and-copy strategies for adjacent pairs. Pre-training ICL models on structured tasks enables transitive inference and mimics human-like effects.

Conclusion: Pre-training on structured tasks helps transformers develop representations for in-context relational reasoning, bridging the gap between IWL and ICL performance.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities,
but the mechanisms underlying relational reasoning in different learning
regimes remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate how transformers
perform a classic relational reasoning task from the Psychology literature,
\textit{transitive inference}, which requires inference about indirectly
related items by integrating information across observed adjacent item pairs
(e.g., if A>B and B>C, then A>C). We compare transitive inference behavior
across two distinct learning regimes: in-weights learning (IWL), where models
store information in network parameters, and in-context learning (ICL), where
models flexibly utilize information presented within the input sequence. Our
findings reveal that IWL naturally induces a generalization bias towards
transitive inference, despite being trained only on adjacent items, whereas ICL
models trained solely on adjacent items do not generalize transitively.
Mechanistic analysis shows that ICL models develop induction circuits that
implement a simple match-and-copy strategy that performs well at relating
adjacent pairs, but does not encoding hierarchical relationships among
indirectly related items. Interestingly, when pre-trained on in-context linear
regression tasks, transformers successfully exhibit in-context generalizable
transitive inference. Moreover, like IWL, they display both \textit{symbolic
distance} and \textit{terminal item effects} characteristic of human and animal
performance, without forming induction circuits. These results suggest that
pre-training on tasks with underlying structure promotes the development of
representations that can scaffold in-context relational reasoning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LDPTRLQ, a novel algorithm combining Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty with RL for IoT optimization, ensuring queue stability and outperforming baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing complex optimization challenges in IoT by integrating Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty with RL for better performance and stability.

Method: Derives a method to combine Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty with RL under common conditions, proposing the LDPTRLQ algorithm.

Result: Simulations show LDPTRLQ outperforms baseline methods in compatibility, stability, and performance.

Conclusion: LDPTRLQ effectively balances short-term and long-term optimization, proving superior to existing approaches.

Abstract: With the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, the demand for
addressing complex optimization challenges has intensified. The Lyapunov
Drift-Plus-Penalty algorithm is a widely adopted approach for ensuring queue
stability, and some research has preliminarily explored its integration with
reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we investigate the adaptation of
the Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty algorithm for RL applications, deriving an
effective method for combining Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty with RL under a set
of common and reasonable conditions through rigorous theoretical analysis.
Unlike existing approaches that directly merge the two frameworks, our proposed
algorithm, termed Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty method tailored for reinforcement
learning with queue stability (LDPTRLQ) algorithm, offers theoretical
superiority by effectively balancing the greedy optimization of Lyapunov
Drift-Plus-Penalty with the long-term perspective of RL. Simulation results for
multiple problems demonstrate that LDPTRLQ outperforms the baseline methods
using the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty method and RL, corroborating the validity
of our theoretical derivations. The results also demonstrate that our proposed
algorithm outperforms other benchmarks in terms of compatibility and stability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoCT combines large language models and classical ML for interpretable, scalable clinical trial outcome prediction, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical trials are costly and slow; accurate outcome prediction can reduce costs and speed up drug discovery. Current deep learning models lack interpretability and are prone to label leakage.

Method: AutoCT autonomously generates, evaluates, and refines tabular features using Monte Carlo Tree Search for optimization.

Result: AutoCT matches or surpasses SOTA methods in clinical trial prediction with limited self-refinement iterations.

Conclusion: AutoCT offers a scalable, interpretable, and cost-efficient solution for clinical trial prediction.

Abstract: Clinical trials are critical for advancing medical treatments but remain
prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. Accurate prediction of clinical
trial outcomes can significantly reduce research and development costs and
accelerate drug discovery. While recent deep learning models have shown promise
by leveraging unstructured data, their black-box nature, lack of
interpretability, and vulnerability to label leakage limit their practical use
in high-stakes biomedical contexts. In this work, we propose AutoCT, a novel
framework that combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models
with the explainability of classical machine learning. AutoCT autonomously
generates, evaluates, and refines tabular features based on public information
without human input. Our method uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to iteratively
optimize predictive performance. Experimental results show that AutoCT performs
on par with or better than SOTA methods on clinical trial prediction tasks
within only a limited number of self-refinement iterations, establishing a new
paradigm for scalable, interpretable, and cost-efficient clinical trial
prediction.

Conclusion: Customized forecasting for consumer groups and detailed weather data enhance accuracy, contributing to reliable power demand predictions and grid stability.

Abstract: Ensuring grid stability in the transition to renewable energy sources

precise forecasting by differentiating among industrial, commercial, and
residential consumers through customer clusterisation, tailoring the

are explored and compared, determining the most effective approaches. With all
that, the main contribution of this work are the new forecasting approaches
proposed, which have demonstrated superior performance compared to simpler

forecasting strategies for different consumer groups and demonstrating the
impact of incorporating detailed weather data on forecasting accuracy. These
advancements contribute to more reliable power demand predictions, thereby

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep-learning framework for short-term hauling-fleet capacity forecasting in open-pit mining, combining real-world data with synthetic breakdown scenarios to improve prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address operational uncertainties like weather, mechanical breakdowns, and crew availability in open-pit mining for better fleet management.

Method: Proposes a hybrid approach using XGBoost and LSTM models, integrating real operational data (rainfall, telemetry) and synthetic breakdown scenarios. SHAP analysis identifies key predictors.

Result: XGBoost achieves MedAE of 14.3%, LSTM 15.1%. Simulated breakdown data reduces prediction volatility.

Conclusion: The hybrid model enhances forecast robustness. Future work will include maintenance, HR data, and operational constraints for further improvements.

Abstract: Accurate short-term forecasting of hauling-fleet capacity is crucial in
open-pit mining, where weather fluctuations, mechanical breakdowns, and
variable crew availability introduce significant operational uncertainties. We
propose a deep-learning framework that blends real-world operational records
(high-resolution rainfall measurements, fleet performance telemetry) with
synthetically generated mechanical-breakdown scenarios to enable the model to
capture fluctuating high-impact failure events. We evaluate two architectures:
an XGBoost regressor achieving a median absolute error (MedAE) of 14.3 per cent
and a Long Short-Term Memory network with a MedAE of 15.1 per cent. Shapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value analyses identify cumulative rainfall,
historical payload trends, and simulated breakdown frequencies as dominant
predictors. Integration of simulated breakdown data and shift-planning features
notably reduces prediction volatility. Future work will further integrate
maintenance-scheduling indicators (Mean Time Between Failures, Mean Time to
Repair), detailed human resource data (operator absenteeism, crew efficiency
metrics), blast event scheduling, and other operational constraints to enhance
forecast robustness and adaptability. This hybrid modelling approach offers a
comprehensive decision-support tool for proactive, data-driven fleet management
under dynamically uncertain conditions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A 4-step process enhances ensemble learning using softlog-softmax cascades, focusing on diversity, consistency, and reliable evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve consistency and dependability in next-generation ensemble learning systems by leveraging softlog-softmax cascades.

Method: 1. Anatomical: Select diverse canonical forms for the ensemble model. 2. Physiological: Use softlog for consistent weak logarithmic operations. 3. Neural information theory: Propose softlog-based entropy/divergence for consistent information measures. 4. Derive an informative performance tensor for evaluation.

Result: Diversity in canonical forms is more useful for complex problems; softlog ensures consistency in operations and decisions.

Conclusion: The 4-step process effectively enhances ensemble learning by improving diversity, consistency, and evaluation reliability.

Abstract: The paper proposes a 4-step process for highlighting that softlog-softmax
cascades can improve both consistency and dependability of the next generation
ensemble learning systems. The first process is anatomical in nature: the
target ensemble model under consideration is composed by canonical elements
relating to the definition of a convolutional frustum. No a priori is
considered in the choice of canonical forms. Diversity is the main criterion
for selecting these forms. It is shown that the more complex the problem, the
more useful this ensemble diversity is. The second process is physiological and
relates to neural engineering: a softlog is derived to both make weak
logarithmic operations consistent and lead, through multiple softlog-softmax
layers, to intermediate decisions in the sense of respecting the same class
logic as that faced by the output layer. The third process concerns neural
information theory: softlog-based entropy and divergence are proposed for the
sake of constructing information measures yielding consistent values on closed
intervals. These information measures are used to determine the relationships
between individual and sub-community decisions in frustum diversitybased
ensemble learning. The concluding process addresses the derivation of an
informative performance tensor for the purpose of a reliable ensemble
evaluation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the system-level costs of LLM-based AI agents, revealing high resource usage, latency, and energy concerns despite improved accuracy. It calls for more efficient agent designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing concerns about the sustainability and efficiency of dynamic, multi-turn AI agents, which, while versatile, introduce significant computational and infrastructural demands.

Method: The study conducts a comprehensive system-level analysis of AI agents, evaluating resource usage, latency, energy consumption, and power demands across various designs and scaling strategies.

Result: Agents improve accuracy with increased compute but face diminishing returns, high latency variance, and unsustainable infrastructure costs.

Conclusion: The findings highlight a need for compute-efficient agent designs to balance performance and sustainability under real-world constraints.

Abstract: Large-language-model (LLM)-based AI agents have recently showcased impressive
versatility by employing dynamic reasoning, an adaptive, multi-step process
that coordinates with external tools. This shift from static, single-turn
inference to agentic, multi-turn workflows broadens task generalization and
behavioral flexibility, but it also introduces serious concerns about
system-level cost, efficiency, and sustainability. This paper presents the
first comprehensive system-level analysis of AI agents, quantifying their
resource usage, latency behavior, energy consumption, and datacenter-wide power
consumption demands across diverse agent designs and test-time scaling
strategies. We further characterize how AI agent design choices, such as
few-shot prompting, reflection depth, and parallel reasoning, impact
accuracy-cost tradeoffs. Our findings reveal that while agents improve accuracy
with increased compute, they suffer from rapidly diminishing returns, widening
latency variance, and unsustainable infrastructure costs. Through detailed
evaluation of representative agents, we highlight the profound computational
demands introduced by AI agent workflows, uncovering a looming sustainability
crisis. These results call for a paradigm shift in agent design toward
compute-efficient reasoning, balancing performance with deployability under
real-world constraints.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a unified benchmark for RFT-based red teaming methods, especially PPO-based ones, affects stability and reproducibility.

Method: Introduces RedRFT, combining CleanRL and Tianshou strengths, with modular PPO components and diversity metrics. Includes an ablation study on LoRA, KL divergence, and Lagrange Multiplier.

Result: RedRFT simplifies and standardizes RFT implementation, facilitating plug-and-play experimentation and clarifying component influences.

Conclusion: RedRFT aids in understanding RFT nuances and accelerates innovation in red teaming for LLMs.

Abstract: Red teaming has proven to be an effective method for identifying and
mitigating vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). Reinforcement
Fine-Tuning (RFT) has emerged as a promising strategy among existing red
teaming techniques. However, a lack of a unified benchmark hinders current
RFT-based red teaming methods. Implementation details, especially in Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO)-based RFT, significantly affect outcome stability and
reproducibility. To address this issue, we introduce RedRFT, a lightweight
benchmark designed to simplify and standardize the implementation and
evaluation of RFT-based red teaming. RedRFT combines the design strengths of
both single-file CleanRL and highly modularized Tianshou, offering high-quality
single-file red teaming implementations and modular PPO core components, such
as the General Advantage Estimator. It supports a variety of token and sentence
diversity metrics, featuring modularized intrinsic reward computation that
facilitates plug-and-play experimentation. To clarify their influence on RFT
performance, we conducted an extensive ablation study on key components,
including Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, and
Lagrange Multiplier. We hope this work contributes to 1) gaining a
comprehensive understanding of the implementation nuances of RFT-based red
teaming algorithms, and 2) enabling rapid prototyping of innovative features
for RFT-based red teaming. Code for the benchmark can be accessed at

TL;DR: A 'half' layer of hidden units with partially randomized and partially trained weights is proposed, reducing parameters while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the number of trainable parameters in deep networks while maintaining performance by leveraging randomized connections.

Method: Introduces 'half' units with fixed random weights for input summation and two modifiable weights for activation scaling and translation, applied in any network layer.

Result: Experiments on MNIST and FashionMNIST show reasonable accuracy with fewer parameters due to regularization from randomized connections.

Conclusion: Half layers offer a promising approach to parameter efficiency in deep networks without significant performance loss.

Abstract: We propose a ``half'' layer of hidden units that has some of its weights
randomly set and some of them trained. A half unit is composed of two stages:
First, it takes a weighted sum of its inputs with fixed random weights, and
second, the total activation is multiplied and then translated using two
modifiable weights, before the result is passed through a nonlinearity. The
number of modifiable weights of each hidden unit is thus two and does not
depend on the fan-in. We show how such half units can be used in the first or
any later layer in a deep network, possibly following convolutional layers. Our
experiments on MNIST and FashionMNIST data sets indicate the promise of half
layers, where we can achieve reasonable accuracy with a reduced number of
parameters due to the regularizing effect of the randomized connections.

TL;DR: The paper reexpresses the hyperDT algorithm in the Beltrami-Klein model of hyperbolic spaces, simplifying it into pre- and post-processing steps around Euclidean tree-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend decision tree models to hyperbolic spaces while preserving simplicity and leveraging existing Euclidean optimizations.

Method: Reformulate hyperDT in the Beltrami-Klein model, enabling a wrapper approach around Euclidean tree models.

Result: Improved flexibility, speed, accuracy, and code maintainability.

Conclusion: The wrapper approach simplifies hyperbolic decision trees, making them more practical and efficient.

Abstract: Decision trees and models that use them as primitives are workhorses of
machine learning in Euclidean spaces. Recent work has further extended these
models to the Lorentz model of hyperbolic space by replacing axis-parallel
hyperplanes with homogeneous hyperplanes when partitioning the input space. In
this paper, we show how the hyperDT algorithm can be elegantly reexpressed in
the Beltrami-Klein model of hyperbolic spaces. This preserves the thresholding
operation used in Euclidean decision trees, enabling us to further rewrite
hyperDT as simple pre- and post-processing steps that form a wrapper around
existing tree-based models designed for Euclidean spaces. The wrapper approach
unlocks many optimizations already available in Euclidean space models,
improving flexibility, speed, and accuracy while offering a simpler, more
maintainable, and extensible codebase. Our implementation is available at

TL;DR: The paper analyzes sample replay in continual learning, showing it can sometimes increase forgetting, even in noiseless settings, and highlights the importance of sample choice and task relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To theoretically understand the effectiveness and limitations of sample replay in mitigating forgetting in continual learning, particularly in over-parameterized linear regression.

Method: Theoretical analysis of sample replay in a continual linear regression setting, examining the role of replayed samples and task subspace relationships. Empirical validation with neural networks and SGD.

Result: Forgetting can be non-monotonic with replay samples; replay may harm performance in worst-case and distributional settings. Empirical results confirm similar behavior in neural networks.

Conclusion: Sample replay's effectiveness depends on sample choice and task relationships, and it can sometimes worsen forgetting, even in simple settings.

Abstract: Continual learning seeks to enable machine learning systems to solve an
increasing corpus of tasks sequentially. A critical challenge for continual
learning is forgetting, where the performance on previously learned tasks
decreases as new tasks are introduced. One of the commonly used techniques to
mitigate forgetting, sample replay, has been shown empirically to reduce
forgetting by retaining some examples from old tasks and including them in new
training episodes. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of sample
replay in an over-parameterized continual linear regression setting, where each
task is given by a linear subspace and with enough replay samples, one would be
able to eliminate forgetting. Our analysis focuses on sample replay and
highlights the role of the replayed samples and the relationship between task
subspaces. Surprisingly, we find that, even in a noiseless setting, forgetting
can be non-monotonic with respect to the number of replay samples. We present
tasks where replay can be harmful with respect to worst-case settings, and also
in distributional settings where replay of randomly selected samples increases
forgetting in expectation. We also give empirical evidence that harmful replay
is not limited to training with linear models by showing similar behavior for a
neural networks equipped with SGD. Through experiments on a commonly used
benchmark, we provide additional evidence that, even in seemingly benign
scenarios, performance of the replay heavily depends on the choice of replay
samples and the relationship between tasks.

TL;DR: The paper proposes iS-QL, a method using a copy of the last linear layer of the online network as a target network, improving sample efficiency in target-free reinforcement learning while reducing memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Removing target networks in value-based RL can free memory but causes instability. The paper aims to balance target-free benefits with stability by leveraging partial target networks.

Method: iS-QL uses a copy of the last linear layer of the online network as a target network, sharing other parameters, and applies iterated Q-learning to bridge performance gaps.

Result: iS-QL improves sample efficiency in target-free RL, with lower memory usage and comparable training time to target-based methods.

Conclusion: iS-QL offers a scalable, efficient alternative to traditional target-based RL, balancing stability and performance.

Abstract: In value-based reinforcement learning, removing the target network is
tempting as the boostrapped target would be built from up-to-date estimates,
and the spared memory occupied by the target network could be reallocated to
expand the capacity of the online network. However, eliminating the target
network introduces instability, leading to a decline in performance. Removing
the target network also means we cannot leverage the literature developed
around target networks. In this work, we propose to use a copy of the last
linear layer of the online network as a target network, while sharing the
remaining parameters with the up-to-date online network, hence stepping out of
the binary choice between target-based and target-free methods. It enables us
to leverage the concept of iterated Q-learning, which consists of learning
consecutive Bellman iterations in parallel, to reduce the performance gap
between target-free and target-based approaches. Our findings demonstrate that
this novel method, termed iterated Shared Q-Learning (iS-QL), improves the
sample efficiency of target-free approaches across various settings.
Importantly, iS-QL requires a smaller memory footprint and comparable training
time to classical target-based algorithms, highlighting its potential to scale
reinforcement learning research.

Result: Outperforms baselines in 2D-Point Agent and continuous control tasks with fewer meta-testing samples.

Conclusion: UMCNP effectively adapts to unseen tasks with minimal samples, demonstrating superior efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: We introduce Unsupervised Meta-Testing with Conditional Neural Processes
(UMCNP), a novel hybrid few-shot meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) method
that uniquely combines, yet distinctly separates, parameterized policy
gradient-based (PPG) and task inference-based few-shot meta-RL. Tailored for
settings where the reward signal is missing during meta-testing, our method
increases sample efficiency without requiring additional samples in
meta-training. UMCNP leverages the efficiency and scalability of Conditional
Neural Processes (CNPs) to reduce the number of online interactions required in
meta-testing. During meta-training, samples previously collected through PPG
meta-RL are efficiently reused for learning task inference in an offline
manner. UMCNP infers the latent representation of the transition dynamics model
from a single test task rollout with unknown parameters. This approach allows
us to generate rollouts for self-adaptation by interacting with the learned
dynamics model. We demonstrate our method can adapt to an unseen test task
using significantly fewer samples during meta-testing than the baselines in
2D-Point Agent and continuous control meta-RL benchmarks, namely, cartpole with
unknown angle sensor bias, walker agent with randomized dynamics parameters.

### [545] [Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning is Approximately Supervised Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04411)
*Achleshwar Luthra,Tianbao Yang,Tomer Galanti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper bridges the gap between self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) and a supervised variant (NSCL), proving their equivalence as the number of classes grows. It analyzes the geometric structure of NSCL minimizers and introduces a bound for few-shot error, validated empirically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish theoretical foundations for self-supervised contrastive learning, which lacks full theoretical understanding despite empirical success.

Method: Theoretical analysis linking CL to NSCL, geometric characterization of NSCL minimizers, and derivation of a few-shot error bound for linear probing.

Result: The gap between CL and NSCL vanishes with more classes; NSCL minimizers exhibit specific geometric properties; the few-shot error bound is tight and directional variation dominates.

Conclusion: CL implicitly approximates NSCL, and the derived theoretical insights align with empirical validation, supporting accurate few-shot learning.

Abstract: Despite its empirical success, the theoretical foundations of self-supervised
contrastive learning (CL) are not yet fully established. In this work, we
address this gap by showing that standard CL objectives implicitly approximate
a supervised variant we call the negatives-only supervised contrastive loss
(NSCL), which excludes same-class contrasts. We prove that the gap between the
CL and NSCL losses vanishes as the number of semantic classes increases, under
a bound that is both label-agnostic and architecture-independent.
  We characterize the geometric structure of the global minimizers of the NSCL
loss: the learned representations exhibit augmentation collapse, within-class
collapse, and class centers that form a simplex equiangular tight frame. We
further introduce a new bound on the few-shot error of linear-probing. This
bound depends on two measures of feature variability--within-class dispersion
and variation along the line between class centers. We show that directional
variation dominates the bound and that the within-class dispersion's effect
diminishes as the number of labeled samples increases. These properties enable
CL and NSCL-trained representations to support accurate few-shot label recovery
using simple linear probes.
  Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical findings: the gap between CL
and NSCL losses decays at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\#\text{classes}})$;
the two losses are highly correlated; minimizing the CL loss implicitly brings
the NSCL loss close to the value achieved by direct minimization; and the
proposed few-shot error bound provides a tight estimate of probing performance
in practice.

*Egor Petrov,Grigoriy Evseev,Aleksey Antonov,Andrey Veprikov,Pavel Plyusnin,Nikolay Bushkov,Stanislav Moiseev,Aleksandr Beznosikov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes zero-order optimization methods, JAGUAR SignSGD and JAGUAR Muon, for efficient fine-tuning of large language models, reducing memory and computational costs while maintaining convergence quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional first-order optimizers like SGD and Adam are inefficient for large models due to high memory and computational costs. Zero-order methods offer a viable alternative.

Method: The authors introduce JAGUAR SignSGD (a momentum-based zero-order algorithm) and JAGUAR Muon (leveraging matrix structure), providing convergence guarantees and empirical validation.

Result: The proposed methods match or surpass first-order methods in convergence quality while significantly reducing memory usage.

Conclusion: Zero-order optimization is a practical and theoretically grounded approach for resource-constrained LLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for adapting
pre-trained models to downstream tasks. Yet traditional first-order optimizers
such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam incur prohibitive memory and
computational costs that scale poorly with model size. In this paper, we
investigate zero-order (ZO) optimization methods as a memory- and
compute-efficient alternative, particularly in the context of
parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA. We propose
$\texttt{JAGUAR SignSGD}$, a ZO momentum-based algorithm that extends ZO
SignSGD, requiring the same number of parameters as the standard ZO SGD and
only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ function evaluations per iteration. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to establish rigorous convergence guarantees
for SignSGD in the stochastic ZO case. We further propose $\texttt{JAGUAR
Muon}$, a novel ZO extension of the Muon optimizer that leverages the matrix
structure of model parameters, and we provide its convergence rate under
arbitrary stochastic noise. Through extensive experiments on challenging LLM
fine-tuning benchmarks, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithms meet or
exceed the convergence quality of standard first-order methods, achieving
significant memory reduction. Our theoretical and empirical results establish
new ZO optimization methods as a practical and theoretically grounded approach
for resource-constrained LLM adaptation. Our code is available at

*Zixuan Xia,Aram Davtyan,Paolo Favaro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KOALA++ is a scalable Kalman-based optimization algorithm for neural networks, improving upon KOALA by modeling structured gradient uncertainty efficiently without expensive second-order calculations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of second-order methods in neural network training while capturing richer gradient uncertainty structure.

Method: Estimates parameter covariance matrix recursively using compact gradient covariance products, avoiding full matrix storage and inversions.

Result: Achieves accuracy comparable or superior to state-of-the-art optimizers in tasks like image classification and language modeling, with first-order efficiency.

Conclusion: KOALA++ offers a scalable, efficient alternative to second-order methods by better modeling gradient uncertainty.

Abstract: We propose KOALA++, a scalable Kalman-based optimization algorithm that
explicitly models structured gradient uncertainty in neural network training.
Unlike second-order methods, which rely on expensive second order gradient
calculation, our method directly estimates the parameter covariance matrix by
recursively updating compact gradient covariance products. This design improves
upon the original KOALA framework that assumed diagonal covariance by
implicitly capturing richer uncertainty structure without storing the full
covariance matrix and avoiding large matrix inversions. Across diverse tasks,
including image classification and language modeling, KOALA++ achieves accuracy
on par or better than state-of-the-art first- and second-order optimizers while
maintaining the efficiency of first-order methods.

### [548] [Grokking and Generalization Collapse: Insights from \texttt{HTSR} theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04434)
*Hari K. Prakash,Charles H. Martin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies a novel 'anti-grokking' phase in neural networks, distinct from pre-grokking and grokking, where test accuracy collapses while training accuracy remains perfect. The Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HTSR) metric α effectively detects all three phases, unlike other metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and characterize the grokking phenomena in neural networks, including identifying new phases and validating the effectiveness of the HTSR metric.

Method: A 3-layer MLP is trained on a subset of MNIST with and without weight decay, using the HTSR metric α and other comparative metrics to analyze phases.

Result: Anti-grokking is discovered as a late-stage collapse phase, detectable only by the HTSR α metric. Correlation Traps signal overfitting.

Conclusion: The HTSR α metric is a robust tool for measuring generalization and detecting overfitting, with α ≈ 2 as a universal layer-convergence target.

Abstract: We study the well-known grokking phenomena in neural networks (NNs) using a
3-layer MLP trained on 1 k-sample subset of MNIST, with and without weight
decay, and discover a novel third phase -- \emph{anti-grokking} -- that occurs
very late in training and resembles but is distinct from the familiar
\emph{pre-grokking} phases: test accuracy collapses while training accuracy
stays perfect. This late-stage collapse is distinct, from the known
pre-grokking and grokking phases, and is not detected by other proposed
grokking progress measures. Leveraging Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization HTSR
through the open-source WeightWatcher tool, we show that the HTSR layer quality
metric $\alpha$ alone delineates all three phases, whereas the best competing
metrics detect only the first two. The \emph{anti-grokking} is revealed by
training for $10^7$ and is invariably heralded by $\alpha < 2$ and the
appearance of \emph{Correlation Traps} -- outlier singular values in the
randomized layer weight matrices that make the layer weight matrix atypical and
signal overfitting of the training set. Such traps are verified by visual
inspection of the layer-wise empirical spectral densities, and by using
Kolmogorov--Smirnov tests on randomized spectra. Comparative metrics, including
activation sparsity, absolute weight entropy, circuit complexity, and $l^2$
weight norms track pre-grokking and grokking but fail to distinguish grokking
from anti-grokking. This discovery provides a way to measure overfitting and
generalization collapse without direct access to the test data. These results
strengthen the claim that the \emph{HTSR} $\alpha$ provides universal
layer-convergence target at $\alpha \approx 2$ and underscore the value of
using the HTSR alpha $(\alpha)$ metric as a measure of generalization.

*Robin Yadav,Qi Yan,Guy Wolf,Avishek Joey Bose,Renjie Liao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RETRO SYNFLOW (RSF) is a discrete flow-matching framework for single-step retrosynthesis, outperforming SOTA with 60% top-1 accuracy and improved diversity via Feynman-Kac steering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of accurate and diverse single-step retrosynthesis prediction in organic chemistry.

Method: RSF uses a Markov bridge between target and reactant molecules, reaction center identification, and Feynman-Kac steering with Sequential Monte Carlo resampling.

Result: Achieves 60% top-1 accuracy (20% better than SOTA) and 19% improvement in top-5 round-trip accuracy.

Conclusion: RSF enhances retrosynthesis planning with superior accuracy and diversity, validated by empirical results.

Abstract: A fundamental problem in organic chemistry is identifying and predicting the
series of reactions that synthesize a desired target product molecule. Due to
the combinatorial nature of the chemical search space, single-step reactant
prediction -- i.e. single-step retrosynthesis -- remains challenging even for
existing state-of-the-art template-free generative approaches to produce an
accurate yet diverse set of feasible reactions. In this paper, we model
single-step retrosynthesis planning and introduce RETRO SYNFLOW (RSF) a
discrete flow-matching framework that builds a Markov bridge between the
prescribed target product molecule and the reactant molecule. In contrast to
past approaches, RSF employs a reaction center identification step to produce
intermediate structures known as synthons as a more informative source
distribution for the discrete flow. To further enhance diversity and
feasibility of generated samples, we employ Feynman-Kac steering with
Sequential Monte Carlo based resampling to steer promising generations at
inference using a new reward oracle that relies on a forward-synthesis model.
Empirically, we demonstrate \nameshort achieves $60.0 \%$ top-1 accuracy, which
outperforms the previous SOTA by $20 \%$. We also substantiate the benefits of
steering at inference and demonstrate that FK-steering improves top-$5$
round-trip accuracy by $19 \%$ over prior template-free SOTA methods, all while
preserving competitive top-$k$ accuracy results.

### [550] [Selective Matching Losses -- Not All Scores Are Created Equal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04446)
*Gil I. Shamir,Manfred K. Warmuth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces selective matching loss functions to prioritize accurate predictions in specific regions of a domain, using link functions to emphasize high-sensitivity areas. It extends this to multi-class problems with composite Softmax functions, showing advantages in applications like ranking and LLM fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate predictions are often critical in specific regions of a domain, but traditional losses treat all regions equally. The paper aims to address this by designing loss functions that prioritize high-importance regions.

Method: The authors construct selective matching loss functions using increasing link functions (e.g., Sigmoid, hyperbolic sine) to emphasize high-sensitivity regions. For multi-class problems, they develop a framework using composite Softmax functions to maintain ranking sensitivity.

Result: Selective losses outperform traditional losses in applications like dwell-time prediction, retrieval, ranking, and LLM fine-tuning, as they better distinguish between high- and low-importance regions.

Conclusion: The proposed selective loss framework effectively addresses the need for prioritized prediction accuracy in specific regions, extending to multi-class problems and demonstrating practical advantages in various applications.

Abstract: Learning systems match predicted scores to observations over some domain.
Often, it is critical to produce accurate predictions in some subset (or
region) of the domain, yet less important to accurately predict in other
regions. We construct selective matching loss functions by design of increasing
link functions over score domains. A matching loss is an integral over the
link. A link defines loss sensitivity as function of the score, emphasizing
high slope high sensitivity regions over flat ones. Loss asymmetry drives a
model and resolves its underspecification to predict better in high sensitivity
regions where it is more important, and to distinguish between high and low
importance regions. A large variety of selective scalar losses can be designed
with scaled and shifted Sigmoid and hyperbolic sine links. Their properties,
however, do not extend to multi-class. Applying them per dimension lacks
ranking sensitivity that assigns importance according to class score ranking.
Utilizing composite Softmax functions, we develop a framework for
multidimensional selective losses. We overcome limitations of the standard
Softmax function, that is good for classification, but not for distinction
between adjacent scores. Selective losses have substantial advantage over
traditional losses in applications with more important score regions, including
dwell-time prediction, retrieval, ranking with either pointwise, contrastive
pairwise, or listwise losses, distillation problems, and fine-tuning alignment
of Large Language Models (LLMs).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper extends ODXU, a Neurosymbolic AI framework, for Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS), integrating deep clustering, symbolic reasoning, and uncertainty quantification. It outperforms traditional models and explores transfer learning in cybersecurity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance robustness, interpretability, and generalization in NIDS by extending ODXU with advanced uncertainty quantification and transfer learning.

Method: Extends ODXU with score-based and metamodel-based uncertainty quantification, and develops a transfer learning strategy for cybersecurity.

Result: ODXU outperforms traditional neural models on CIC-IDS-2017 and ACI-IoT-2023 datasets, with metamodel-based UQ methods performing best.

Conclusion: The extended ODXU framework improves NIDS performance and demonstrates the potential of transfer learning in cybersecurity.

Abstract: Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) play a vital role in protecting
digital infrastructures against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. In
this paper, we extend ODXU, a Neurosymbolic AI (NSAI) framework that integrates
deep embedded clustering for feature extraction, symbolic reasoning using
XGBoost, and comprehensive uncertainty quantification (UQ) to enhance
robustness, interpretability, and generalization in NIDS. The extended ODXU
incorporates score-based methods (e.g., Confidence Scoring, Shannon Entropy)
and metamodel-based techniques, including SHAP values and Information Gain, to
assess the reliability of predictions. Experimental results on the CIC-IDS-2017
dataset show that ODXU outperforms traditional neural models across six
evaluation metrics, including classification accuracy and false omission rate.
While transfer learning has seen widespread adoption in fields such as computer
vision and natural language processing, its potential in cybersecurity has not
been thoroughly explored. To bridge this gap, we develop a transfer learning
strategy that enables the reuse of a pre-trained ODXU model on a different
dataset. Our ablation study on ACI-IoT-2023 demonstrates that the optimal
transfer configuration involves reusing the pre-trained autoencoder, retraining
the clustering module, and fine-tuning the XGBoost classifier, and outperforms
traditional neural models when trained with as few as 16,000 samples
(approximately 50% of the training data). Additionally, results show that
metamodel-based UQ methods consistently outperform score-based approaches on
both datasets.

TL;DR: The study uses ML models to classify dental providers into standard and safety net clinic providers, achieving 94.1% accuracy with Neural Networks. Feature selection and robustness to missing data are key findings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve classification of dental providers for better resource allocation, especially for underserved populations, using ML models on a dataset with high missing values.

Method: Twelve ML models (e.g., kNN, SVM, Random Forest) were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation on a dataset of 24,300 instances with 20 features. Feature ranking methods (information gain, Gini index, ANOVA) identified critical predictors.

Result: Neural Network achieved the highest accuracy (94.1%). Treatment-related metrics were top-ranked features, while demographics had minimal impact. SGD and ensemble methods were robust to missing data.

Conclusion: Feature selection enhances ML model efficiency. The study advocates integrating feature-ranking techniques with advanced ML for optimized dental provider classification and resource allocation.

Abstract: This study investigates the application of machine learning (ML) models for
classifying dental providers into two categories - standard rendering providers
and safety net clinic (SNC) providers - using a 2018 dataset of 24,300
instances with 20 features. The dataset, characterized by high missing values
(38.1%), includes service counts (preventive, treatment, exams), delivery
systems (FFS, managed care), and beneficiary demographics. Feature ranking
methods such as information gain, Gini index, and ANOVA were employed to
identify critical predictors, revealing treatment-related metrics
(TXMT_USER_CNT, TXMT_SVC_CNT) as top-ranked features. Twelve ML models,
including k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines
(SVM), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Random Forest, Neural Networks, and
Gradient Boosting, were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation.
Classification accuracy was tested across incremental feature subsets derived
from rankings. The Neural Network achieved the highest accuracy (94.1%) using
all 20 features, followed by Gradient Boosting (93.2%) and Random Forest
(93.0%). Models showed improved performance as more features were incorporated,
with SGD and ensemble methods demonstrating robustness to missing data. Feature
ranking highlighted the dominance of treatment service counts and annotation
codes in distinguishing provider types, while demographic variables (AGE_GROUP,
CALENDAR_YEAR) had minimal impact. The study underscores the importance of
feature selection in enhancing model efficiency and accuracy, particularly in
imbalanced healthcare datasets. These findings advocate for integrating
feature-ranking techniques with advanced ML algorithms to optimize dental
provider classification, enabling targeted resource allocation for underserved
populations.

Motivation: Effective classification of dental providers enhances healthcare resource allocation and service delivery, particularly for underserved groups.

Method: Analyzed a 2018 dataset of 24,300 instances with 20 features, tested multiple ML algorithms (kNN, Decision Trees, SVM, SGD, Random Forest, Neural Networks, Gradient Boosting) using 10-fold cross-validation, and evaluated performance with AUC, CA, F1-score, precision, and recall.

Conclusion: Advanced ML models, particularly ensemble and deep learning, significantly improve dental provider classification, aiding better resource distribution for underserved populations.

Abstract: Dental provider classification plays a crucial role in optimizing healthcare
resource allocation and policy planning. Effective categorization of providers,
such as standard rendering providers and safety net clinic (SNC) providers,
enhances service delivery to underserved populations. This study aimed to
evaluate the performance of machine learning models in classifying dental
providers using a 2018 dataset. A dataset of 24,300 instances with 20 features
was analyzed, including beneficiary and service counts across fee-for-service

categorized by delivery system and patient age groups (0-20 and 21+). Despite
38.1% missing data, multiple machine learning algorithms were tested, including
k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM),
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Random Forest, Neural Networks, and Gradient
Boosting. A 10-fold cross-validation approach was applied, and models were
evaluated using AUC, classification accuracy (CA), F1-score, precision, and
recall. Neural Networks achieved the highest AUC (0.975) and CA (94.1%),
followed by Random Forest (AUC: 0.948, CA: 93.0%). These models effectively
handled imbalanced data and complex feature interactions, outperforming
traditional classifiers like Logistic Regression and SVM. Advanced machine

TL;DR: COSMOS is a framework for predicting LLM adaptation outcomes, reducing computational costs by up to 98.71% while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimal selection of LLM adaptation strategies under resource constraints is challenging and costly.

Method: Introduces COSMOS, using lightweight proxy models and low-sample scaling laws to predict performance and cost.

Result: Achieves high accuracy, reducing costs by 92.72% on average and up to 98.71% in intensive scenarios.

Conclusion: Efficient prediction of LLM adaptation outcomes is feasible and significantly reduces deployment overhead.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across numerous
tasks by using a diverse array of adaptation strategies. However, optimally
selecting a model and adaptation strategy under resource constraints is
challenging and often requires extensive experimentation. We investigate
whether it is possible to accurately predict both performance and cost without
expensive trials. We formalize the strategy selection problem for LLMs and
introduce COSMOS, a unified prediction framework that efficiently estimates
adaptation outcomes at minimal cost. We instantiate and study the capability of
our framework via a pair of powerful predictors: embedding-augmented
lightweight proxy models to predict fine-tuning performance, and low-sample
scaling laws to forecast retrieval-augmented in-context learning. Extensive
evaluation across eight representative benchmarks demonstrates that COSMOS
achieves high prediction accuracy while reducing computational costs by 92.72%
on average, and up to 98.71% in resource-intensive scenarios. Our results show
that efficient prediction of adaptation outcomes is not only feasible but can
substantially reduce the computational overhead of LLM deployment while
maintaining performance standards.

*C. Evans Hedges*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Orthogonalizing gradients ($\perp$Grad) improves model calibration without losing accuracy, outperforming SGD in metrics like test loss and predictive entropy, even under input corruption. It's optimizer-agnostic, efficient, and compatible with post-hoc calibration. Theoretically, it converges to solutions favoring confidence scaling over boundary improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance model calibration (e.g., reducing overconfidence) without compromising accuracy, addressing limitations of standard training methods like SGD.

Method: Introduces $\perp$Grad, a technique to orthogonalize gradients during training. Evaluated on CIFAR-10 with limited labeled data, CIFAR-10C for robustness, and extended training scenarios.

Result: $\perp$Grad matches SGD in accuracy but improves calibration metrics (lower test loss, reduced overconfidence, higher entropy). Benefits persist under corruption and longer training.

Conclusion: $\perp$Grad is a practical, efficient method for better calibration, supported by theoretical convergence guarantees and empirical robustness.

Abstract: We provide evidence that orthogonalizing gradients during training improves
model calibration without sacrificing accuracy. On CIFAR-10 with 10% labeled
data, $\perp$Grad matches SGD in accuracy but yields consistently improved
calibration metrics such as lower test loss, reduced softmax overconfidence,
and higher predictive entropy. These benefits persist under input corruption
(CIFAR-10C) and extended training, where $\perp$Grad models degrade more
gracefully than SGD-trained counterparts. $\perp$Grad is optimizer-agnostic,
incurs minimal overhead, and works well with post-hoc calibration techniques
like temperature scaling.
  Theoretically, we prove convergence of a simplified version of $\perp$Grad
under mild assumptions and characterize its stationary points in positive
homogeneous networks: $\perp$Grad converges to solutions where further loss
reduction requires confidence scaling rather than decision boundary
improvement.

TL;DR: CryoBoltz bridges cryo-EM and protein structure prediction to model dynamic biomolecular systems by guiding sampling with density maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing protein structure prediction models lack conformational diversity, while cryo-EM struggles with atomic model generation.

Method: Combines cryo-EM density maps with protein structure priors, guiding sampling via global/local constraints.

Result: Successfully builds atomic models for dynamic systems like transporters and antibodies.

Conclusion: CryoBoltz effectively integrates experimental and computational data for accurate modeling of biomolecular diversity.

Abstract: Protein structure prediction models are now capable of generating accurate 3D
structural hypotheses from sequence alone. However, they routinely fail to
capture the conformational diversity of dynamic biomolecular complexes, often
requiring heuristic MSA subsampling approaches for generating alternative
states. In parallel, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has emerged as a
powerful tool for imaging near-native structural heterogeneity, but is
challenged by arduous pipelines to go from raw experimental data to atomic
models. Here, we bridge the gap between these modalities, combining cryo-EM
density maps with the rich sequence and biophysical priors learned by protein
structure prediction models. Our method, CryoBoltz, guides the sampling
trajectory of a pretrained protein structure prediction model using both global
and local structural constraints derived from density maps, driving predictions
towards conformational states consistent with the experimental data. We
demonstrate that this flexible yet powerful inference-time approach allows us
to build atomic models into heterogeneous cryo-EM maps across a variety of
dynamic biomolecular systems including transporters and antibodies.

TL;DR: PGT is a new training method for physical reservoir computing, using perturbations to approximate gradients without backpropagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the limitation of physical reservoir computing's inability to perform backpropagation due to its black-box nature.

Method: Uses random perturbations in parameter space to approximate gradient updates via forward passes, tested on simulated and experimental hardware.

Result: PGT achieves performance comparable to backpropagation where the latter is impractical.

Conclusion: PGT enables deeper integration of physical reservoirs into neural networks, promising energy efficiency gains in AI training.

Abstract: We introduce Perturbative Gradient Training (PGT), a novel training paradigm
that overcomes a critical limitation of physical reservoir computing: the
inability to perform backpropagation due to the black-box nature of physical
reservoirs. Drawing inspiration from perturbation theory in physics, PGT uses
random perturbations in the network's parameter space to approximate gradient
updates using only forward passes. We demonstrate the feasibility of this
approach on both simulated neural network architectures, including a dense
network and a transformer model with a reservoir layer, and on experimental
hardware using a magnonic auto-oscillation ring as the physical reservoir. Our
results show that PGT can achieve performance comparable to that of standard
backpropagation methods in cases where backpropagation is impractical or
impossible. PGT represents a promising step toward integrating physical
reservoirs into deeper neural network architectures and achieving significant
energy efficiency gains in AI training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural PDE solvers often face challenges with error accumulation, stability, and physical consistency over long time horizons.

Method: The approach uses a hierarchy of lower-dimensional future state representations and adjusts temporal downsampling ratios to capture dynamics at multiple granularities, inspired by implicit time-stepping methods.

Result: The method achieves high short-term accuracy and stable long-term forecasts in turbulent fluid dynamics, outperforming autoregressive baselines with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: The multiscale implicit neural emulator effectively addresses long-term prediction challenges in neural PDE solvers, enhancing stability and accuracy.

Abstract: Neural PDE solvers offer a powerful tool for modeling complex dynamical

maintaining stability and physical consistency. We introduce a multiscale
implicit neural emulator that enhances long-term prediction accuracy by
conditioning on a hierarchy of lower-dimensional future state representations.
Drawing inspiration from the stability properties of numerical implicit
time-stepping methods, our approach leverages predictions several steps ahead
in time at increasing compression rates for next-timestep refinements. By
actively adjusting the temporal downsampling ratios, our design enables the
model to capture dynamics across multiple granularities and enforce long-range
temporal coherence. Experiments on turbulent fluid dynamics show that our
method achieves high short-term accuracy and produces long-term stable
forecasts, significantly outperforming autoregressive baselines while adding
minimal computational overhead.

*Geon-Woo Kim,Junbo Li,Shashidhar Gandham,Omar Baldonado,Adithya Gangidi,Pavan Balaji,Zhangyang Wang,Aditya Akella*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HALoS is a hierarchical asynchronous optimization framework for training large language models (LLMs) across distributed regions, reducing communication costs and improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training LLMs across geographically distributed accelerators faces high communication costs and uneven hardware utilization.

Method: HALoS introduces local and global parameter servers (LPSs and GPS) to minimize inter-region communication and leverage fast intra-region links.

Result: HALoS achieves up to 7.5x faster convergence than synchronous baselines and 2.1x improvement over asynchronous methods, while maintaining model quality.

Conclusion: Hierarchical, server-side update accumulation and global model merging are effective for scalable, efficient LLM training in heterogeneous, geo-distributed environments.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) increasingly relies on geographically
distributed accelerators, causing prohibitive communication costs across
regions and uneven utilization of heterogeneous hardware. We propose HALoS, a
hierarchical asynchronous optimization framework that tackles these issues by
introducing local parameter servers (LPSs) within each region and a global
parameter server (GPS) that merges updates across regions. This hierarchical
design minimizes expensive inter-region communication, reduces straggler
effects, and leverages fast intra-region links. We provide a rigorous
convergence analysis for HALoS under non-convex objectives, including
theoretical guarantees on the role of hierarchical momentum in asynchronous
training. Empirically, HALoS attains up to 7.5x faster convergence than
synchronous baselines in geo-distributed LLM training and improves upon
existing asynchronous methods by up to 2.1x. Crucially, HALoS preserves the
model quality of fully synchronous SGD-matching or exceeding accuracy on
standard language modeling and downstream benchmarks-while substantially
lowering total training time. These results demonstrate that hierarchical,
server-side update accumulation and global model merging are powerful tools for
scalable, efficient training of new-era LLMs in heterogeneous, geo-distributed
environments.

### [560] [NOBLE -- Neural Operator with Biologically-informed Latent Embeddings to Capture Experimental Variability in Biological Neuron Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04536)
*Luca Ghafourpour,Valentin Duruisseaux,Bahareh Tolooshams,Philip H. Wong,Costas A. Anastassiou,Anima Anandkumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NOBLE is a neural operator framework that predicts neural dynamics by learning from biophysically realistic neuron models, addressing variability and computational inefficiency in current approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neuron modeling lacks scalability and fails to fully capture biophysical complexity and variability, limiting understanding of brain function.

Method: NOBLE uses a neural operator to map interpretable neuron features to somatic voltage responses, trained on realistic neuron models.

Result: NOBLE predicts neural dynamics with variability, achieves a 4200x speedup, and is validated on experimental data.

Conclusion: NOBLE enables efficient, scalable neuron modeling, advancing neuroAI and brain research.

Abstract: Characterizing the diverse computational properties of human neurons via
multimodal electrophysiological, transcriptomic, and morphological data
provides the foundation for constructing and validating bio-realistic neuron
models that can advance our understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying
brain function. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the
limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data.
To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but
are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally
expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming
increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical
complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To
address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework
that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of
interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by
current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic
neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for
the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic
neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose
dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the
first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data,
enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial
variability and achieve a $4200\times$ speedup over numerical solvers. To this
end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, opening the door to a better
understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic
architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.

*Yuanpei Gao,Qi Yan,Yan Leng,Renjie Liao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural MJD combines neural networks with a non-stationary Merton jump diffusion model to improve time series prediction by explicitly modeling stochastic processes and abrupt changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models struggle with non-stationary data and abrupt changes due to their black-box nature and lack of explicit stochastic modeling.

Method: Neural MJD formulates forecasting as an SDE simulation problem, using a time-inhomogeneous Itô diffusion and compound Poisson process. It includes a likelihood truncation mechanism and a novel solver for tractable learning.

Result: Neural MJD outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and statistical methods on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The model effectively addresses non-stationarity and abrupt changes, offering improved generalization and performance.

Abstract: While deep learning methods have achieved strong performance in time series
prediction, their black-box nature and inability to explicitly model underlying
stochastic processes often limit their generalization to non-stationary data,
especially in the presence of abrupt changes. In this work, we introduce Neural
MJD, a neural network based non-stationary Merton jump diffusion (MJD) model.
Our model explicitly formulates forecasting as a stochastic differential
equation (SDE) simulation problem, combining a time-inhomogeneous It\^o
diffusion to capture non-stationary stochastic dynamics with a
time-inhomogeneous compound Poisson process to model abrupt jumps. To enable
tractable learning, we introduce a likelihood truncation mechanism that caps
the number of jumps within small time intervals and provide a theoretical error
bound for this approximation. Additionally, we propose an Euler-Maruyama with
restart solver, which achieves a provably lower error bound in estimating
expected states and reduced variance compared to the standard solver.
Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Neural
MJD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and statistical
learning methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces mdQFL, a model-driven quantum federated learning algorithm, to address bottlenecks and heterogeneity in federated learning, reducing communication costs by 50% while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenges of massive datasets, numerous devices, and non-IID data distributions in federated learning (FL) and quantum federated learning (QFL) hinder performance, motivating the development of mdQFL.

Method: The authors propose mdQFL, an efficient and adaptable algorithm for QFL, incorporating training and update personalization and test generalization, evaluated under diverse non-IID conditions.

Result: Experiments show a 50% reduction in communication costs with maintained or improved accuracy and better local model training compared to standard QFL.

Conclusion: mdQFL effectively addresses QFL challenges, offering practical benefits and theoretical insights, with potential applicability to broader FL scenarios.

Abstract: Training with huge datasets and a large number of participating devices leads
to bottlenecks in federated learning (FL). Furthermore, the challenges of
heterogeneity between multiple FL clients affect the overall performance of the
system. In a quantum federated learning (QFL) context, we address these three
main challenges: i) training bottlenecks from massive datasets, ii) the
involvement of a substantial number of devices, and iii) non-IID data
distributions. We introduce a model-driven quantum federated learning algorithm
(mdQFL) to tackle these challenges. Our proposed approach is efficient and
adaptable to various factors, including different numbers of devices. To the
best of our knowledge, it is the first to explore training and update
personalization, as well as test generalization within a QFL setting, which can
be applied to other FL scenarios. We evaluated the efficiency of the proposed
mdQFL framework through extensive experiments under diverse non-IID data
heterogeneity conditions using various datasets within the Qiskit environment.
Our results demonstrate a nearly 50% decrease in total communication costs
while maintaining or, in some cases, exceeding the accuracy of the final model
and consistently improving local model training compared to the standard QFL
baseline. Moreover, our experimental evaluation thoroughly explores the QFL and
mdQFL algorithms, along with several influencing factors. In addition, we
present a theoretical analysis to clarify the complexities of the proposed
algorithm. The experimental code is available at 1.

Motivation: Address the lack of standardization in unsupervised learning workflows for scientific discoveries.

Method: Proposes a workflow including question formulation, data preparation, modeling, validation, and documentation.

Result: Demonstrates the workflow's effectiveness through a case study on refining Milky Way globular clusters.

Conclusion: A structured workflow enhances reproducibility and reliability in unsupervised learning for scientific discovery.

Abstract: Unsupervised machine learning is widely used to mine large, unlabeled
datasets to make data-driven discoveries in critical domains such as climate
science, biomedicine, astronomy, chemistry, and more. However, despite its
widespread utilization, there is a lack of standardization in unsupervised
learning workflows for making reliable and reproducible scientific discoveries.
In this paper, we present a structured workflow for using unsupervised learning
techniques in science. We highlight and discuss best practices starting with
formulating validatable scientific questions, conducting robust data
preparation and exploration, using a range of modeling techniques, performing
rigorous validation by evaluating the stability and generalizability of
unsupervised learning conclusions, and promoting effective communication and
documentation of results to ensure reproducible scientific discoveries. To
illustrate our proposed workflow, we present a case study from astronomy,
seeking to refine globular clusters of Milky Way stars based upon their
chemical composition. Our case study highlights the importance of validation
and illustrates how the benefits of a carefully-designed workflow for
unsupervised learning can advance scientific discovery.

Motivation: Reliable explanations are crucial for human decision-making in critical domains using GNNs, but symmetrization discards directional info, leading to misleading results.

Method: Theoretical and empirical studies on the impact of preserving directional semantics in GNNs.

Conclusion: Direction-aware GNN explainability is essential, especially in security-critical applications.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly used in critical domains, where

the common practice of graph symmetrization discards directional information,
leading to significant information loss and misleading explanations. Our

### [565] [Composing Agents to Minimize Worst-case Risk](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04632)
*Guruprerana Shabadi,Rajeev Alur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper formalizes agentic workflows as directed acyclic graphs (agent graphs) and introduces an algorithm to optimize agent compositions for task success and risk minimization, focusing on worst-case risk (value-at-risk).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern agentic systems decompose tasks into subtasks handled by specialized AI agents, but real-world deployment requires balancing task success with risk (safety, fairness, privacy) and analyzing tail behaviors.

Method: The work defines worst-case risk as value-at-risk of loss distributions, proposes an efficient algorithm using union bounds and dynamic programming to approximate value-at-risk, and proves its near-optimality for practical loss functions.

Result: The algorithm is evaluated on reinforcement learning-based control benchmarks, showing effectiveness in approximating value-at-risk and identifying optimal agent compositions.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses risk minimization in agentic workflows, providing a practical solution for optimizing agent compositions while considering worst-case risks.

Abstract: From software development to robot control, modern agentic systems decompose
complex objectives into a sequence of subtasks and choose a set of specialized
AI agents to complete them. We formalize an agentic workflow as a directed
acyclic graph, called an agent graph, where edges represent AI agents and paths
correspond to feasible compositions of agents. When deploying these systems in
the real world, we need to choose compositions of agents that not only maximize
the task success, but also minimize risk where the risk captures requirements
like safety, fairness, and privacy. This additionally requires carefully
analyzing the low-probability (tail) behaviors of compositions of agents. In
this work, we consider worst-case risk minimization over the set of feasible
agent compositions. We define worst-case risk as the tail quantile -- also
known as value-at-risk -- of the loss distribution of the agent composition
where the loss quantifies the risk associated with agent behaviors. We
introduce an efficient algorithm that traverses the agent graph and finds a
near-optimal composition of agents by approximating the value-at-risk via a
union bound and dynamic programming. Furthermore, we prove that the
approximation is near-optimal asymptotically for a broad class of practical
loss functions. To evaluate our framework, we consider a suite of video
game-like control benchmarks that require composing several agents trained with
reinforcement learning and demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness in
approximating the value-at-risk and identifying the optimal agent composition.

Result: Computes Pareto frontiers of serial speed versus cost per token for popular LLMs.

Conclusion: The model provides a framework to optimize LLM deployment by balancing cost and performance.

Abstract: We develop a theoretical model that addresses the economic trade-off between
cost per token versus serial token generation speed when deploying LLMs for
inference at scale. Our model takes into account arithmetic, memory bandwidth,
network bandwidth and latency constraints; and optimizes over different
parallelism setups and batch sizes to find the ones that optimize serial
inference speed at a given cost per token. We use the model to compute Pareto
frontiers of serial speed versus cost per token for popular language models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces neural network reprogrammability as a unifying framework for model adaptation techniques like model reprogramming, prompt tuning, and prompt instruction, focusing on manipulating interfaces while keeping parameters frozen.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge fragmented research areas and provide a clear understanding of interrelationships among model adaptation techniques.

Method: Proposes a taxonomy categorizing adaptation approaches by manipulation format, location, operator, and output alignment requirement.

Result: The framework applies across data modalities and model architectures, revealing theoretical connections and practical distinctions among techniques.

Conclusion: Neural network reprogrammability is a fundamental paradigm for efficient model adaptation, with identified challenges and promising research directions.

Abstract: As large-scale pre-trained foundation models continue to expand in size and
capability, efficiently adapting them to specific downstream tasks has become
increasingly critical. Despite substantial progress, existing adaptation
approaches have evolved largely in isolation, without a clear understanding of
their interrelationships. This survey introduces neural network
reprogrammability as a unifying framework that bridges mainstream model
adaptation techniques--model reprogramming, prompt tuning, and prompt
instruction--previously fragmented research areas yet converges on a shared
principle: repurposing a pre-trained model by manipulating information at the
interfaces while keeping the model parameters frozen. These methods exploit
neural networks' sensitivity to manipulation on different interfaces, be it
through perturbing inputs, inserting tokens into intermediate layers, or
providing task-specific examples in context, to redirect model behaviors
towards desired outcomes. We then present a taxonomy that categorizes such
information manipulation-based adaptation approaches across four key
dimensions: manipulation format (fixed or learnable), location (interfaces
where manipulations occur), operator (how they are applied), and output
alignment requirement (post-processing needed to align outputs with downstream
tasks). Notably, this framework applies consistently across data modalities,
independent of specific model architectures. Moreover, viewing established
techniques like in-context learning and chain-of-thought prompting through this
lens reveals both their theoretical connections and practical distinctions. We
further analyze remaining technical challenges and ethical considerations,
positioning neural network reprogrammability as a fundamental paradigm for
efficient model adaptation. We lastly identify promising research directions
emerging from this integrative viewpoint.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper argues that oversmoothing in deep GNNs is overstated, attributing performance issues to vanishing gradients from transformation/activation, not aggregation. It shows deep GNNs can work with classical solutions like skip connections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the overstated impact of oversmoothing in GNNs and advocate for deeper architectures by clarifying misconceptions.

Method: Analyzes core GNN operations (aggregation, linear transformation, activation) and tests classical solutions (skip connections, normalization) for deep GNNs.

Result: Deep GNNs can perform well without oversmoothing issues, as vanishing gradients, not aggregation, are the main problem.

Conclusion: Oversmoothing is not unique to GNNs; deep architectures are viable with proper techniques, opening new research directions.

Abstract: Oversmoothing has been recognized as a main obstacle to building deep Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs), limiting the performance. This position paper argues
that the influence of oversmoothing has been overstated and advocates for a
further exploration of deep GNN architectures. Given the three core operations
of GNNs, aggregation, linear transformation, and non-linear activation, we show
that prior studies have mistakenly confused oversmoothing with the vanishing
gradient, caused by transformation and activation rather than aggregation. Our
finding challenges prior beliefs about oversmoothing being unique to GNNs.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that classical solutions such as skip connections
and normalization enable the successful stacking of deep GNN layers without
performance degradation. Our results clarify misconceptions about oversmoothing
and shed new light on the potential of deep GNNs.

*Wanfu Gao,Hanlin Pan,Qingqi Han,Kunpeng Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new PML feature selection method addresses the curse of dimensionality by leveraging label noise-resistance and connectivity, outperforming existing low-rank assumption-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PML methods struggle with the curse of dimensionality, rely on impractical low-rank assumptions, and poorly identify positive labels.

Method: Proposes a feature selection method using label noise-resistance for disambiguation, a reformed low-rank assumption, and label connectivity for weight matrix reconstruction.

Result: Experimental results show the method's superiority on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively mitigates dimensionality issues and improves label identification in PML.

Abstract: The "Curse of dimensionality" is prevalent across various data patterns,
which increases the risk of model overfitting and leads to a decline in model
classification performance. However, few studies have focused on this issue in
Partial Multi-label Learning (PML), where each sample is associated with a set
of candidate labels, at least one of which is correct. Existing PML methods
addressing this problem are mainly based on the low-rank assumption. However,
low-rank assumption is difficult to be satisfied in practical situations and
may lead to loss of high-dimensional information. Furthermore, we find that
existing methods have poor ability to identify positive labels, which is
important in real-world scenarios. In this paper, a PML feature selection
method is proposed considering two important characteristics of dataset: label
relationship's noise-resistance and label connectivity. Our proposed method
utilizes label relationship's noise-resistance to disambiguate labels. Then the
learning process is designed through the reformed low-rank assumption. Finally,
representative labels are found through label connectivity, and the weight
matrix is reconstructed to select features with strong identification ability
to these labels. The experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedAPM, an FL framework using ADMM, mitigates client drift in non-i.i.d. settings by combining first- and second-order proximal terms, achieving faster, more accurate convergence than SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing client drift in FL due to non-i.i.d. data and multimodal datasets, where partial model personalization worsens divergence.

Method: Proposes FedAPM, using ADMM with augmented Lagrangian function incorporating proximal terms for stable convergence.

Result: FedAPM outperforms SOTA with 12.3% higher accuracy, 16.4% better F1, and 18.0% higher AUC, requiring fewer communication rounds.

Conclusion: FedAPM effectively mitigates client drift, ensuring stable and efficient FL convergence in heterogeneous settings.

Abstract: In federated learning (FL), the assumption that datasets from different
devices are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) often does not
hold due to user differences, and the presence of various data modalities
across clients makes using a single model impractical. Personalizing certain
parts of the model can effectively address these issues by allowing those parts
to differ across clients, while the remaining parts serve as a shared model.
However, we found that partial model personalization may exacerbate client
drift (each client's local model diverges from the shared model), thereby
reducing the effectiveness and efficiency of FL algorithms. We propose an FL
framework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM),
referred to as FedAPM, to mitigate client drift. We construct the augmented
Lagrangian function by incorporating first-order and second-order proximal
terms into the objective, with the second-order term providing fixed correction
and the first-order term offering compensatory correction between the local and
shared models. Our analysis demonstrates that FedAPM, by using explicit
estimates of the Lagrange multiplier, is more stable and efficient in terms of
convergence compared to other FL frameworks. We establish the global
convergence of FedAPM training from arbitrary initial points to a stationary
point, achieving three types of rates: constant, linear, and sublinear, under
mild assumptions. We conduct experiments using four heterogeneous and
multimodal datasets with different metrics to validate the performance of
FedAPM. Specifically, FedAPM achieves faster and more accurate convergence,
outperforming the SOTA methods with average improvements of 12.3% in test
accuracy, 16.4% in F1 score, and 18.0% in AUC while requiring fewer
communication rounds.

TL;DR: Ensembles improve forecasting accuracy, especially in probabilistic settings, but at high computational cost. Reducing retraining frequency lowers costs with minimal accuracy loss. Small ensembles (2-3 models) often suffice for near-optimal results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between forecast accuracy and computational cost in ensemble learning for time series forecasting.

Method: Evaluated ten base models and eight ensemble configurations on M5 and VN1 datasets, considering point and probabilistic accuracy under varying retraining frequencies.

Result: Ensembles boost performance but increase costs. Reduced retraining frequency cuts costs with little accuracy loss. Small ensembles achieve near-optimal results efficiently.

Conclusion: Careful ensemble design and retraining strategies enable accurate, robust, and cost-effective forecasts, supporting sustainable AI in forecasting.

Abstract: Given the continuous increase in dataset sizes and the complexity of
forecasting models, the trade-off between forecast accuracy and computational
cost is emerging as an extremely relevant topic, especially in the context of
ensemble learning for time series forecasting. To asses it, we evaluated ten
base models and eight ensemble configurations across two large-scale retail
datasets (M5 and VN1), considering both point and probabilistic accuracy under
varying retraining frequencies. We showed that ensembles consistently improve
forecasting performance, particularly in probabilistic settings. However, these
gains come at a substantial computational cost, especially for larger,
accuracy-driven ensembles. We found that reducing retraining frequency
significantly lowers costs, with minimal impact on accuracy, particularly for
point forecasts. Moreover, efficiency-driven ensembles offer a strong balance,
achieving competitive accuracy with considerably lower costs compared to
accuracy-optimized combinations. Most importantly, small ensembles of two or
three models are often sufficient to achieve near-optimal results. These
findings provide practical guidelines for deploying scalable and cost-efficient
forecasting systems, supporting the broader goals of sustainable AI in
forecasting. Overall, this work shows that careful ensemble design and
retraining strategy selection can yield accurate, robust, and cost-effective
forecasts suitable for real-world applications.

TL;DR: DIPNet introduces learnable input distributions to smooth the loss landscape, improving generalization in overparameterized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training loss alone is insufficient for assessing generalization in overparameterized models; smoothness is linked to better generalization but hard to enforce directly.

Method: DIPNet projects inputs into learnable distributions at each layer, inducing a smoother loss landscape and reducing local smoothness measures and the Lipschitz constant.

Result: DIPNet improves test performance across various architectures (ViTs, LLMs, ResNet, MLPs) and scenarios (standard, adversarial, out-of-distribution, reasoning).

Conclusion: DIPNet is a general, effective method for enhancing generalization in deep learning models, easily integrable into existing architectures.

Abstract: As overparameterized models become increasingly prevalent, training loss
alone offers limited insight into generalization performance. While smoothness
has been linked to improved generalization across various settings, directly
enforcing smoothness in neural networks remains challenging. To address this,
we introduce Distributional Input Projection Networks (DIPNet), a novel
framework that projects inputs into learnable distributions at each layer. This
distributional representation induces a smoother loss landscape with respect to
the input, promoting better generalization. We provide theoretical analysis
showing that DIPNet reduces both local smoothness measures and the Lipschitz
constant of the network, contributing to improved generalization performance.
Empirically, we validate DIPNet across a wide range of architectures and tasks,
including Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large Language Models (LLMs), ResNet and
MLPs. Our method consistently enhances test performance under standard
settings, adversarial attacks, out-of-distribution inputs, and reasoning
benchmarks. We demonstrate that the proposed input projection strategy can be
seamlessly integrated into existing models, providing a general and effective
approach for boosting generalization performance in modern deep learning.

TL;DR: Proposes a proximal Bregman response function for GNNs to predict edge influence, relaxing convexity assumptions and accounting for message propagation, applicable to deletions and insertions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve interpretability and robustness of GNNs by accurately predicting edge influence without retraining, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Method: Introduces a proximal Bregman response function tailored for GNNs, capturing message propagation effects and handling edge deletions/insertions.

Result: Accurate influence predictions on real-world datasets, with applications in graph rewiring and adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: The method enhances GNN interpretability and robustness, offering a versatile tool for influence analysis.

Abstract: Understanding how individual edges influence the behavior of graph neural
networks (GNNs) is essential for improving their interpretability and
robustness. Graph influence functions have emerged as promising tools to
efficiently estimate the effects of edge deletions without retraining. However,
existing influence prediction methods rely on strict convexity assumptions,
exclusively consider the influence of edge deletions while disregarding edge
insertions, and fail to capture changes in message propagation caused by these
modifications. In this work, we propose a proximal Bregman response function
specifically tailored for GNNs, relaxing the convexity requirement and enabling
accurate influence prediction for standard neural network architectures.
Furthermore, our method explicitly accounts for message propagation effects and
extends influence prediction to both edge deletions and insertions in a
principled way. Experiments with real-world datasets demonstrate accurate
influence predictions for different characteristics of GNNs. We further
demonstrate that the influence function is versatile in applications such as
graph rewiring and adversarial attacks.

TL;DR: RLVR optimizes reasoning pattern selection, favoring high-success-rate patterns while maintaining stability. Theoretical analysis confirms convergence, with faster training for strong initial models and slower for weaker ones, mitigated by SFT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how RL improves reasoning abilities in models, given its empirical success but unclear mechanisms.

Method: Systematic study of RLVR, including experiments and theoretical analysis of gradient flow and convergence dynamics.

Result: RLVR selects high-success-rate reasoning patterns, with convergence speed depending on initial model strength. SFT can mitigate slower optimization in weaker models.

Conclusion: RLVR enhances reasoning by optimizing pattern selection, with theoretical insights for improving model training.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing
model capabilities, including instruction-following, preference learning, and
reasoning. Yet despite its empirical successes, the mechanisms by which RL
improves reasoning abilities remain poorly understood. We present a systematic
study of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), showing that
its primary benefit comes from optimizing the selection of existing reasoning
patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RLVR-trained
models preferentially adopt high-success-rate reasoning patterns while mostly
maintaining stable performance on individual patterns. We further develop
theoretical analyses on the convergence and training dynamics of RLVR based on
a simplified question-reason-answer model. We study the gradient flow and show
that RLVR can indeed find the solution that selects the reason pattern with the
highest success rate. Besides, our theoretical results
  reveal two distinct regimes regarding the convergence of RLVR training: (1)
rapid convergence for models with relatively strong initial reasoning
capabilities versus (2) slower optimization dynamics for weaker models.
Furthermore, we show that the slower optimization for weaker models can be
mitigated by applying the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) before RLVR, when using
a feasibly high-quality SFT dataset. We validate the theoretical findings
through extensive experiments. This work advances our theoretical understanding
of RL's role in LLM fine-tuning and offers insights for further enhancing
reasoning capabilities.

### [575] [Enhanced Drought Analysis in Bangladesh: A Machine Learning Approach for Severity Classification Using Satellite Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04696)
*Tonmoy Paul,Mrittika Devi Mati,Md. Mahmudul Islam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A machine learning framework using satellite data is proposed to classify drought severity in Bangladesh, addressing gaps in traditional indices and regional variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drought in Bangladesh affects agriculture and food security, but traditional indices like SPI and PDSI miss key factors. Machine learning models for drought prediction are underexplored here.

Method: The framework uses unsupervised algorithms (K-means, Bayesian Gaussian Mixture) for clustering and classification models (KNN, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes) with weather data (2012-2024).

Result: The model successfully classifies drought severity but reveals regional variabilities in vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: Machine learning effectively identifies and predicts drought conditions, highlighting regional differences.

Abstract: Drought poses a pervasive environmental challenge in Bangladesh, impacting
agriculture, socio-economic stability, and food security due to its unique
geographic and anthropogenic vulnerabilities. Traditional drought indices, such
as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Palmer Drought Severity Index
(PDSI), often overlook crucial factors like soil moisture and temperature,
limiting their resolution. Moreover, current machine learning models applied to
drought prediction have been underexplored in the context of Bangladesh,
lacking a comprehensive integration of satellite data across multiple
districts. To address these gaps, we propose a satellite data-driven machine
learning framework to classify drought across 38 districts of Bangladesh. Using
unsupervised algorithms like K-means and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture for
clustering, followed by classification models such as KNN, Random Forest,
Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes, the framework integrates weather data
(humidity, soil moisture, temperature) from 2012-2024. This approach
successfully classifies drought severity into different levels. However, it
shows significant variabilities in drought vulnerabilities across regions which
highlights the aptitude of machine learning models in terms of identifying and
predicting drought conditions.

*José Manuel de Frutos,Manuel A. Vázquez,Pablo M. Olmos,Joaquín Míguez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Dual-ISL is a novel likelihood-free objective for training implicit generative models, offering convexity and continuity advantages over classical divergences, with practical benefits like faster convergence and smoother training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of classical divergences (e.g., KL or Wasserstein) by introducing a convex and continuous rank-based discrepancy for training implicit generative models.

Method: Introduces dual-ISL, interchanging roles of target and model distributions in ISL, and develops a theoretical framework for its properties, including convexity, continuity, and density approximation.

Result: Dual-ISL shows faster convergence, smoother training, and better mode collapse prevention compared to classical ISL and other methods, with explicit density approximation.

Conclusion: Dual-ISL is a robust and effective tool for training implicit generative models, with theoretical and practical advantages over existing methods.

Abstract: Rank-based statistical metrics, such as the invariant statistical loss (ISL),
have recently emerged as robust and practically effective tools for training
implicit generative models. In this work, we introduce dual-ISL, a novel
likelihood-free objective for training implicit generative models that
interchanges the roles of the target and model distributions in the ISL
framework, yielding a convex optimization problem in the space of model
densities. We prove that the resulting rank-based discrepancy $d_K$ is i)
continuous under weak convergence and with respect to the $L^1$ norm, and ii)
convex in its first argument-properties not shared by classical divergences
such as KL or Wasserstein distances. Building on this, we develop a theoretical
framework that interprets $d_K$ as an $L^2$-projection of the density ratio $q
= p/\tilde p$ onto a Bernstein polynomial basis, from which we derive exact
bounds on the truncation error, precise convergence rates, and a closed-form
expression for the truncated density approximation. We further extend our
analysis to the multivariate setting via random one-dimensional projections,
defining a sliced dual-ISL divergence that retains both convexity and
continuity. We empirically show that these theoretical advantages translate
into practical ones. Specifically, across several benchmarks dual-ISL converges
more rapidly, delivers markedly smoother and more stable training, and more
effectively prevents mode collapse than classical ISL and other leading
implicit generative methods-while also providing an explicit density
approximation.

*Pinak Mandal,Georg A. Gottwald*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes fast unlearning algorithms for generative models to selectively remove data influence without full retraining, ensuring data forgetting, model quality, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for unlearning specific data in generative models due to privacy, legal, or harmful content concerns without costly retraining.

Method: Uses loss gradient orthogonalization to achieve selective unlearning, ensuring minimal impact on desired data and model performance.

Result: Demonstrates significantly faster unlearning times compared to predecessors like gradient surgery, validated on MNIST and CelebA datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms effectively balance forgetting undesired data while preserving model quality and efficiency.

Abstract: As generative models become increasingly powerful and pervasive, the ability
to unlearn specific data, whether due to privacy concerns, legal requirements,
or the correction of harmful content, has become increasingly important. Unlike
in conventional training, where data are accumulated and knowledge is
reinforced, unlearning aims to selectively remove the influence of particular
data points without costly retraining from scratch. To be effective and
reliable, such algorithms need to achieve (i) forgetting of the undesired data,
(ii) preservation of the quality of the generation, (iii) preservation of the
influence of the desired training data on the model parameters, and (iv) small
number of training steps. We propose fast unlearning algorithms based on loss
gradient orthogonalization. We show that our algorithms are able to forget data
while maintaining the fidelity of the original model. Using MNIST and CelebA
data, we demonstrate that our algorithms achieve orders of magnitude faster
unlearning times than their predecessors, such as gradient surgery.

*Fei Ding,Baiqiao Wang,Zijian Zeng,Youwei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MGRPO improves GRPO by adding a self-correction layer to fix errors in initial responses, enhancing reasoning and training stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO lacks intermediate supervision, leading to inefficient exploration and reward vanishing in complex reasoning tasks.

Method: MGRPO uses two layers: standard GRPO for initial responses and a second layer to correct errors, creating a self-correction loop.

Result: MGRPO outperforms GRPO on mathematical reasoning benchmarks by improving reasoning and self-correction.

Conclusion: MGRPO effectively addresses GRPO's limitations, offering better performance and stability without dense supervision.

Abstract: The Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm has demonstrated
considerable success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs), as evidenced by DeepSeek-R1. However, the absence of
intermediate supervision in GRPO frequently leads to inefficient exploration
dynamics. A single error in a complex reasoning chain can invalidate the entire
solution, resulting in abrupt reward vanishing and compromising training
stability.To address these challenges, we propose MGRPO (Multi-layer GRPO).
MGRPO operates in two layers: the first layer employs standard GRPO to generate
an initial response. This response, along with the original query, is then fed
into a second-layer GRPO process. This second layer is specifically trained to
identify and correct errors in the initial response, effectively creating a
self-correction loop. This mechanism provides implicit process-level
supervision by rewarding successful error correction, without requiring an
explicit, densely-annotated reward model. Experimental results on several
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MGRPO significantly
outperforms standard GRPO, achieving superior performance by fostering both
reasoning and self-correction abilities.

*Han Guo,Songlin Yang,Tarushii Goel,Eric P. Xing,Tri Dao,Yoon Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Log-linear attention balances efficiency and expressiveness by replacing fixed-size hidden states with logarithmically growing ones, enabling log-linear compute cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the bottlenecks of quadratic-compute and linear-memory complexity in Transformers while overcoming the limitations of fixed-size hidden states in RNN-like models.

Method: Develops log-linear attention, which uses a logarithmically growing set of hidden states and admits matmul-rich parallelization.

Result: Log-linear variants of Mamba-2 and Gated DeltaNet perform well compared to their linear-time counterparts.

Conclusion: Log-linear attention offers a scalable and efficient alternative to traditional attention mechanisms.

Abstract: The attention mechanism in Transformers is an important primitive for
accurate and scalable sequence modeling. Its quadratic-compute and
linear-memory complexity however remain significant bottlenecks. Linear
attention and state-space models enable linear-time, constant-memory sequence
modeling and can moreover be trained efficiently through matmul-rich
parallelization across sequence length. However, at their core these models are
still RNNs, and thus their use of a fixed-size hidden state to model the
context is a fundamental limitation. This paper develops log-linear attention,
an attention mechanism that balances linear attention's efficiency and the
expressiveness of softmax attention. Log-linear attention replaces the
fixed-size hidden state with a logarithmically growing set of hidden states. We
show that with a particular growth function, log-linear attention admits a
similarly matmul-rich parallel form whose compute cost is log-linear in
sequence length. Log-linear attention is a general framework and can be applied
on top of existing linear attention variants. As case studies, we instantiate
log-linear variants of two recent architectures -- Mamba-2 and Gated DeltaNet
-- and find they perform well compared to their linear-time variants.

*Jiachen Tang,Zhonghao Wang,Sirui Chen,Sheng Zhou,Jiawei Chen,Jiajun Bu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces OpenGT, a benchmark for Graph Transformers (GTs), addressing the lack of standardized evaluation and understanding of GTs' effectiveness and design choices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GTs show strong performance but lack exploration of their applicable scenarios and effective design choices. The community needs a comprehensive benchmark to understand and develop GTs further.

Method: The paper proposes OpenGT, a benchmark with standardized settings, diverse tasks, and datasets to evaluate GTs and GNNs. It includes a library for training and evaluation.

Result: OpenGT reveals insights like challenges in model transfer, limitations of local attention, efficiency trade-offs, and positional encoding scenarios.

Conclusion: OpenGT aims to advance GT research by promoting fairness, reproducibility, and generalizability, supported by an accessible library.

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance
across diverse domains. By leveraging attention mechanisms, GTs are capable of
modeling long-range dependencies and complex structural relationships beyond
local neighborhoods. However, their applicable scenarios are still
underexplored, this highlights the need to identify when and why they excel.
Furthermore, unlike GNNs, which predominantly rely on message-passing
mechanisms, GTs exhibit a diverse design space in areas such as positional
encoding, attention mechanisms, and graph-specific adaptations. Yet, it remains
unclear which of these design choices are truly effective and under what
conditions. As a result, the community currently lacks a comprehensive
benchmark and library to promote a deeper understanding and further development
of GTs. To address this gap, this paper introduces OpenGT, a comprehensive
benchmark for Graph Transformers. OpenGT enables fair comparisons and
multidimensional analysis by establishing standardized experimental settings
and incorporating a broad selection of state-of-the-art GNNs and GTs. Our
benchmark evaluates GTs from multiple perspectives, encompassing diverse tasks
and datasets with varying properties. Through extensive experiments, our
benchmark has uncovered several critical insights, including the difficulty of
transferring models across task levels, the limitations of local attention, the
efficiency trade-offs in several models, the application scenarios of specific
positional encodings, and the preprocessing overhead of some positional
encodings. We aspire for this work to establish a foundation for future graph
transformer research emphasizing fairness, reproducibility, and
generalizability. We have developed an easy-to-use library OpenGT for training
and evaluating existing GTs. The benchmark code is available at

### [581] [Improved Regret Bounds for Linear Bandits with Heavy-Tailed Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04775)
*Artin Tajdini,Jonathan Scarlett,Kevin Jamieson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper improves upper and lower bounds on minimax regret for stochastic linear bandits with heavy-tailed rewards, introducing a new algorithm and tighter bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work had loose bounds for heavy-tailed rewards, especially in linear bandits, motivating tighter theoretical guarantees.

Method: A new elimination-based algorithm guided by experimental design is proposed to achieve better regret bounds.

Result: The algorithm achieves improved regret bounds, recovering optimal results for finite-variance cases and establishing tighter lower bounds.

Conclusion: The work advances understanding of heavy-tailed linear bandits, with implications for finite and infinite-dimensional settings.

Abstract: We study stochastic linear bandits with heavy-tailed rewards, where the
rewards have a finite $(1+\epsilon)$-absolute central moment bounded by
$\upsilon$ for some $\epsilon \in (0,1]$. We improve both upper and lower
bounds on the minimax regret compared to prior work. When $\upsilon =
\mathcal{O}(1)$, the best prior known regret upper bound is
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$. While a lower with the same
scaling has been given, it relies on a construction using $\upsilon =
\mathcal{O}(d)$, and adapting the construction to the bounded-moment regime
with $\upsilon = \mathcal{O}(1)$ yields only a
$\Omega(d^{\frac{\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}} T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$ lower bound.
This matches the known rate for multi-armed bandits and is generally loose for
linear bandits, in particular being $\sqrt{d}$ below the optimal rate in the
finite-variance case ($\epsilon = 1$). We propose a new elimination-based
algorithm guided by experimental design, which achieves regret
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{\frac{1+3\epsilon}{2(1+\epsilon)}}
T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$, thus improving the dependence on $d$ for all
$\epsilon \in (0,1)$ and recovering a known optimal result for $\epsilon = 1$.
We also establish a lower bound of $\Omega(d^{\frac{2\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}}
T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$, which strictly improves upon the multi-armed bandit
rate and highlights the hardness of heavy-tailed linear bandit problems. For
finite action sets, we derive similarly improved upper and lower bounds for
regret. Finally, we provide action set dependent regret upper bounds showing
that for some geometries, such as $l_p$-norm balls for $p \le 1 + \epsilon$, we
can further reduce the dependence on $d$, and we can handle
infinite-dimensional settings via the kernel trick, in particular establishing
new regret bounds for the Mat\'ern kernel that are the first to be sublinear
for all $\epsilon \in (0, 1]$.

*Thore Gerlach,Sascha Mücke,Christian Bauckhage*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the connection between $k$-medoids clustering and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) in Vector Quantization (VQ) using Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO), revealing that KDE-QUBO is a special case of $k$-medoids-QUBO under certain assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between distance-based ($k$-medoids) and probability density-based (KDE) VQ methods by analyzing their relationship through QUBO formulations.

Method: Compare heuristic QUBO for $k$-medoids with a principled QUBO derived from minimizing Maximum Mean Discrepancy in KDE-based VQ.

Result: KDE-QUBO is a special case of $k$-medoids-QUBO under mild assumptions on the kernel's feature map, uncovering a structural relationship.

Conclusion: The findings provide new insights into the geometric interpretation of QUBO parameters in VQ and reveal a deeper connection between $k$-medoids and KDE approaches.

Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) is a widely used technique in machine learning and
data compression, valued for its simplicity and interpretability. Among hard VQ
methods, $k$-medoids clustering and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) approaches
represent two prominent yet seemingly unrelated paradigms -- one
distance-based, the other rooted in probability density matching. In this
paper, we investigate their connection through the lens of Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). We compare a heuristic QUBO
formulation for $k$-medoids, which balances centrality and diversity, with a
principled QUBO derived from minimizing Maximum Mean Discrepancy in KDE-based
VQ. Surprisingly, we show that the KDE-QUBO is a special case of the
$k$-medoids-QUBO under mild assumptions on the kernel's feature map. This
reveals a deeper structural relationship between these two approaches and
provides new insight into the geometric interpretation of the weighting
parameters used in QUBO formulations for VQ.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adam optimizer's adaptive preconditioners can trigger loss spikes due to slow response to gradient changes, leading to instability when the preconditioned Hessian's eigenvalue exceeds a threshold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why loss spikes occur during training with Adam optimizer, challenging the prior belief that they are due to the loss landscape's sharpness.

Method: Analyze the mechanism where squared gradients fall below second-order moment estimates, causing sluggish updates and instability. Validate through experiments on various neural networks.

Result: Identified a critical regime where Adam's preconditioners cause instability, leading to loss spikes when gradient-directional curvature exceeds a threshold.

Conclusion: Adam's adaptive preconditioners, not just the loss landscape, are key to loss spikes, providing new insights into training instability.

Abstract: Loss spikes emerge commonly during training across neural networks of varying
architectures and scales when using the Adam optimizer. In this work, we
investigate the underlying mechanism responsible for Adam spikes. While
previous explanations attribute these phenomena to the lower-loss-as-sharper
characteristics of the loss landscape, our analysis reveals that Adam's
adaptive preconditioners themselves can trigger spikes. Specifically, we
identify a critical regime where squared gradients become substantially smaller
than the second-order moment estimates, causing the latter to undergo a
$\beta_2$-exponential decay and to respond sluggishly to current gradient
information. This mechanism can push the maximum eigenvalue of the
preconditioned Hessian beyond the classical stability threshold $2/\eta$ for a
sustained period, inducing instability. This instability further leads to an
alignment between the gradient and the maximum eigendirection, and a loss spike
occurs precisely when the gradient-directional curvature exceeds $2/\eta$. We
verify this mechanism through extensive experiments on fully connected
networks, convolutional networks, and Transformer architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A 'play to learn' framework uses reinforcement learning on logic puzzles to improve LLMs' structured reasoning, showing gains in multi-step problem-solving and transferable skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard fine-tuning may lead to narrow heuristics; this work aims to foster general-purpose reasoning in LLMs.

Method: Fine-tuning LLMs via reinforcement learning on custom logic puzzles with verifiable binary feedback.

Result: Improved out-of-distribution performance on mathematical benchmarks, especially for mid-difficulty problems.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning over logic puzzles enhances LLMs' compositional generalization and reasoning without task-specific tools.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at many supervised tasks but often
struggle with structured reasoning in unfamiliar settings. This discrepancy
suggests that standard fine-tuning pipelines may instill narrow,
domain-specific heuristics rather than fostering general-purpose thinking
strategies. In this work, we propose a "play to learn" framework that
fine-tunes LLMs through reinforcement learning on a suite of seven custom logic
puzzles, each designed to cultivate distinct reasoning skills such as
constraint propagation, spatial consistency, and symbolic deduction. Using a
reinforcement learning setup with verifiable rewards, models receive binary
feedback based on puzzle correctness, encouraging iterative, hypothesis-driven
problem solving. We demonstrate that this training approach significantly
improves out-of-distribution performance on a range of mathematical benchmarks,
especially for mid-difficulty problems that require multi-step reasoning.
Analyses across problem categories and difficulty levels reveal that puzzle
training promotes transferable reasoning routines, strengthening algebraic
manipulation, geometric inference, and combinatorial logic, while offering
limited gains on rote or highly specialized tasks. These findings show that
reinforcement learning over logic puzzles reshapes the internal reasoning of
LLMs, enabling more robust and compositional generalization without relying on
task-specific symbolic tools.

*Yin Lu,Tong He,Xuening Zhu,David Wipf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques traditional sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs), proposing a hybrid model that outperforms both in sparsity and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address underappreciated weaknesses in canonical SAEs and VAEs, particularly in modeling sparse latent structures.

Method: Introduces a hybrid alternative model combining strengths of SAEs and VAEs, supported by theoretical proofs and empirical evaluations.

Result: The proposed model outperforms SAEs, VAEs, and diffusion models in sparsity and reconstruction accuracy on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The hybrid model offers a superior alternative for sparse representation learning, validated by theory and experiments.

Abstract: Is there really much more to say about sparse autoencoders (SAEs)?
Autoencoders in general, and SAEs in particular, represent deep architectures
that are capable of modeling low-dimensional latent structure in data. Such
structure could reflect, among other things, correlation patterns in large
language model activations, or complex natural image manifolds. And yet despite
the wide-ranging applicability, there have been relatively few changes to SAEs
beyond the original recipe from decades ago, namely, standard deep
encoder/decoder layers trained with a classical/deterministic sparse
regularizer applied within the latent space. One possible exception is the
variational autoencoder (VAE), which adopts a stochastic encoder module capable
of producing sparse representations when applied to manifold data. In this work
we formalize underappreciated weaknesses with both canonical SAEs, as well as
analogous VAEs applied to similar tasks, and propose a hybrid alternative model
that circumvents these prior limitations. In terms of theoretical support, we
prove that global minima of our proposed model recover certain forms of
structured data spread across a union of manifolds. Meanwhile, empirical
evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets substantiate the efficacy of
our approach in accurately estimating underlying manifold dimensions and
producing sparser latent representations without compromising reconstruction
error. In general, we are able to exceed the performance of equivalent-capacity
SAEs and VAEs, as well as recent diffusion models where applicable, within
domains such as images and language model activation patterns.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the ineffectiveness of contrastive losses in learning aligned multimodal representations due to modality-specific information. It proposes a regularization term to improve alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contrastive losses fail to align multimodal representations because they don't remove modality-specific information.

Method: Theoretical analysis via the Information Bottleneck Principle, empirical hyperparameter study, and a proposed regularization term derived from variational approximation.

Result: The regularization term improves representational alignment in controlled experiments and real-world applications.

Conclusion: The proposed regularization effectively addresses the alignment issue in multimodal representation learning.

Abstract: Contrastive losses have been extensively used as a tool for multimodal
representation learning. However, it has been empirically observed that their
use is not effective to learn an aligned representation space. In this paper,
we argue that this phenomenon is caused by the presence of modality-specific
information in the representation space. Although some of the most widely used
contrastive losses maximize the mutual information between representations of
both modalities, they are not designed to remove the modality-specific
information. We give a theoretical description of this problem through the lens
of the Information Bottleneck Principle. We also empirically analyze how
different hyperparameters affect the emergence of this phenomenon in a
controlled experimental setup. Finally, we propose a regularization term in the
loss function that is derived by means of a variational approximation and aims
to increase the representational alignment. We analyze in a set of controlled
experiments and real-world applications the advantages of including this
regularization term.

TL;DR: MCBMs improve CBMs by using an Information Bottleneck to ensure representations encode only relevant concept information, enhancing interpretability and intervention validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBMs lack a true bottleneck, allowing representations to encode extra information beyond predefined concepts, which undermines interpretability and intervention reliability.

Method: Proposes Minimal Concept Bottleneck Models (MCBMs) with an Information Bottleneck objective via variational regularization to constrain representations to concept-relevant information.

Result: MCBMs provide theoretical guarantees for concept-level interventions, align with Bayesian principles, and offer design flexibility.

Conclusion: MCBMs address CBM limitations by enforcing a stricter bottleneck, improving interpretability and intervention validity.

Abstract: Deep learning representations are often difficult to interpret, which can
hinder their deployment in sensitive applications. Concept Bottleneck Models
(CBMs) have emerged as a promising approach to mitigate this issue by learning
representations that support target task performance while ensuring that each
component predicts a concrete concept from a predefined set. In this work, we
argue that CBMs do not impose a true bottleneck: the fact that a component can
predict a concept does not guarantee that it encodes only information about
that concept. This shortcoming raises concerns regarding interpretability and
the validity of intervention procedures. To overcome this limitation, we
propose Minimal Concept Bottleneck Models (MCBMs), which incorporate an
Information Bottleneck (IB) objective to constrain each representation
component to retain only the information relevant to its corresponding concept.
This IB is implemented via a variational regularization term added to the
training loss. As a result, MCBMs support concept-level interventions with
theoretical guarantees, remain consistent with Bayesian principles, and offer
greater flexibility in key design choices.

TL;DR: A pipeline using GPDSSM for semi-automated dysplasia classification from CT scans improves accuracy and efficiency over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early dysplasia diagnosis is crucial for preventing hip OA, requiring better diagnostic tools.

Method: Developed GPDSSM, combining Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model with diffeomorphism, using 192 CT scans (100 training, 92 testing).

Result: GPDSSM outperforms angle-based methods (AUC 96.2% vs 91.2%) and identifies dysplastic regions.

Conclusion: GPDSSM enhances classification accuracy and reduces clinician workload by automating dysplasia detection.

Abstract: Dysplasia is a recognised risk factor for osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip,
early diagnosis of dysplasia is important to provide opportunities for surgical
interventions aimed at reducing the risk of hip OA. We have developed a
pipeline for semi-automated classification of dysplasia using volumetric CT
scans of patients' hips and a minimal set of clinically annotated landmarks,
combining the framework of the Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model with
diffeomorphism to create a statistical shape model, which we termed the
Gaussian Process Diffeomorphic Statistical Shape Model (GPDSSM). We used 192 CT
scans, 100 for model training and 92 for testing. The GPDSSM effectively
distinguishes dysplastic samples from controls while also highlighting regions
of the underlying surface that show dysplastic variations. As well as improving
classification accuracy compared to angle-based methods (AUC 96.2% vs 91.2%),
the GPDSSM can save time for clinicians by removing the need to manually
measure angles and interpreting 2D scans for possible markers of dysplasia.

TL;DR: ALFIA is an attention-based model for early ICU risk prediction, outperforming existing methods and enabling integration with other models for enhanced performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early identification of high-risk ICU patients is essential for efficient resource allocation and timely intervention.

Method: ALFIA uses a modular, attention-based architecture with LoRA adapters and adaptive layer-weighting to fuse multi-layer BERT features, trained on the cw-24 benchmark.

Result: ALFIA achieves superior AUPRC and balanced precision-recall, with its embeddings enhancing performance when paired with GBDTs or deep networks.

Conclusion: ALFIA provides a robust tool for risk stratification in critical care, leveraging clinical text for early warnings.

Abstract: Early identification of high-risk ICU patients is crucial for directing
limited medical resources. We introduce ALFIA (Adaptive Layer Fusion with
Intelligent Attention), a modular, attention-based architecture that jointly
trains LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapters and an adaptive layer-weighting
mechanism to fuse multi-layer semantic features from a BERT backbone. Trained
on our rigorous cw-24 (CriticalWindow-24) benchmark, ALFIA surpasses
state-of-the-art tabular classifiers in AUPRC while preserving a balanced
precision-recall profile. The embeddings produced by ALFIA's fusion module,
capturing both fine-grained clinical cues and high-level concepts, enable
seamless pairing with GBDTs (CatBoost/LightGBM) as ALFIA-boost, and deep neuro
networks as ALFIA-nn, yielding additional performance gains. Our experiments

*Marcos Lima Romero,Ricardo Suyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework integrating Agentic AI with intent-based paradigms to simplify human-machine interaction in Industry 5.0, demonstrated via predictive maintenance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To align automation with human-centric, sustainable, and resilient Industry 5.0 principles by reducing complexity in human-machine interaction.

Method: A conceptual framework combining Agentic AI and intent-based processing, tested using the CMAPSS dataset and Google ADK.

Result: Feasibility confirmed for intent decomposition, agent orchestration, and autonomous decision-making in predictive maintenance.

Conclusion: The approach reduces technical barriers and enables scalable, intent-driven automation, though data quality and explainability remain challenges.

Abstract: The recent development of Agentic AI systems, empowered by autonomous large
language models (LLMs) agents with planning and tool-usage capabilities,
enables new possibilities for the evolution of industrial automation and
reduces the complexity introduced by Industry 4.0. This work proposes a
conceptual framework that integrates Agentic AI with the intent-based paradigm,
originally developed in network research, to simplify human-machine interaction
(HMI) and better align automation systems with the human-centric, sustainable,
and resilient principles of Industry 5.0. Based on the intent-based processing,
the framework allows human operators to express high-level business or
operational goals in natural language, which are decomposed into actionable
components. These intents are broken into expectations, conditions, targets,
context, and information that guide sub-agents equipped with specialized tools
to execute domain-specific tasks. A proof of concept was implemented using the
CMAPSS dataset and Google Agent Developer Kit (ADK), demonstrating the
feasibility of intent decomposition, agent orchestration, and autonomous
decision-making in predictive maintenance scenarios. The results confirm the
potential of this approach to reduce technical barriers and enable scalable,
intent-driven automation, despite data quality and explainability concerns.

### [591] [FPTQuant: Function-Preserving Transforms for LLM Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04985)
*Boris van Breugel,Yelysei Bondarenko,Paul Whatmough,Markus Nagel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FPTQuant introduces lightweight function-preserving transforms (FPTs) to enable efficient INT4 quantization of LLMs without performance degradation, achieving up to 3.9x speed-up over FP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) consume significant energy during inference, and naive quantization harms performance due to outliers. FPTQuant aims to address this by preserving model function while improving quantization efficiency.

Method: FPTQuant uses four novel FPTs: (1) pre-RoPE transform for queries/keys, (2) transform for values, (3) scaling in MLP blocks, and (4) dynamic scaling. These leverage transformer equivariances to shape activations for quantization. Training is done locally and end-to-end.

Result: FPTQuant enables static INT4 quantization with minimal overhead, achieving up to 3.9x speed-up over FP while maintaining accuracy comparable to slower methods.

Conclusion: FPTQuant offers a state-of-the-art accuracy-speed trade-off for LLM quantization, outperforming prior work and matching full-precision models with minimal overhead.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require substantial compute, and thus energy, at
inference time. While quantizing weights and activations is effective at
improving efficiency, naive quantization of LLMs can significantly degrade
performance due to large magnitude outliers. This paper describes FPTQuant,
which introduces four novel, lightweight, and expressive function-preserving
transforms (FPTs) to facilitate quantization of transformers: (1) a mergeable
pre-RoPE transform for queries and keys, (2) a mergeable transform for values,
(3) a mergeable scaling transform within the MLP block, and (4) a cheap,
dynamic scaling transform. By leveraging the equivariances and independencies
inherent to canonical transformer operation, we designed these FPTs to maintain
the model's function while shaping the intermediate activation distributions to
be more quantization friendly. FPTQuant requires no custom kernels and adds
virtually no overhead during inference. The FPTs are trained both locally to
reduce outliers, and end-to-end such that the outputs of the quantized and
full-precision models match. FPTQuant enables static INT4 quantization with
minimal overhead and shows SOTA speed-up of up to 3.9 times over FP.
Empirically, FPTQuant has an excellent accuracy-speed trade-off -- it is
performing on par or exceeding most prior work and only shows slightly lower
accuracy compared to a method that is up to 29% slower.

### [592] [Cautious Optimism: A Meta-Algorithm for Near-Constant Regret in General Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05005)
*Ashkan Soleymani,Georgios Piliouras,Gabriele Farina*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Cautious Optimism,' a framework for accelerating no-regret learning in general games by adaptively pacing FTRL algorithms, achieving near-optimal regret bounds without relying on monotonic step-sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that adaptive pacing for no-regret learning acceleration is not limited to specific cases and to provide a faster, more flexible framework for general games.

Method: Proposes Cautious Optimism, which takes any FTRL instance and accelerates it with minimal overhead, retaining uncoupledness and avoiding monotonic step-sizes.

Result: Achieves near-optimal O_T(log T) regret in self-play and maintains O(sqrt(T)) regret in adversarial settings.

Conclusion: Cautious Optimism offers a novel, efficient approach for fast learning in general games without relying on restrictive assumptions.

Abstract: Recent work [Soleymani et al., 2025] introduced a variant of Optimistic
Multiplicative Weights Updates (OMWU) that adaptively controls the learning
pace in a dynamic, non-monotone manner, achieving new state-of-the-art regret
minimization guarantees in general games. In this work, we demonstrate that
no-regret learning acceleration through adaptive pacing of the learners is not
an isolated phenomenon. We introduce \emph{Cautious Optimism}, a framework for
substantially faster regularized learning in general games. Cautious Optimism
takes as input any instance of Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) and outputs
an accelerated no-regret learning algorithm by pacing the underlying FTRL with
minimal computational overhead. Importantly, we retain uncoupledness (learners
do not need to know other players' utilities). Cautious Optimistic FTRL
achieves near-optimal $O_T(\log T)$ regret in diverse self-play
(mixing-and-matching regularizers) while preserving the optimal $O(\sqrt{T})$
regret in adversarial scenarios. In contrast to prior works (e.g. Syrgkanis et
al. [2015], Daskalakis et al. [2021]), our analysis does not rely on monotonic
step-sizes, showcasing a novel route for fast learning in general games.

*Nektarios Kalampalikis,Kavya Gupta,Georgi Vitanov,Isabel Valera*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CREAM is a new CBM family that encodes concept-concept and concept-task relationships for better reasoning and performance, while maintaining concept importance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve model reasoning and performance in CBMs by explicitly embedding expert-specified relationships and using a regularized side-channel.

Method: CREAM embeds directed/bidirectional concept-concept and concept-task relationships, severs undesired flows, and uses a regularized black-box side-channel for performance.

Result: CREAM achieves task performance comparable to black-box models while relying on concepts and easing interventions.

Conclusion: CREAM effectively balances concept reliance and performance, mitigates concept leakage, and simplifies model interventions.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose $\textbf{C}$oncept $\textbf{REA}$soning
$\textbf{M}$odels (CREAM), a novel family of Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)
that: (i) explicitly encodes concept-concept (${\texttt{C-C}}$) and
concept-task (${\texttt{C$\rightarrow$Y}}$) relationships to enforce a desired
model reasoning; and (ii) use a regularized side-channel to achieve competitive
task performance, while keeping high concept importance. Specifically, CREAM
architecturally embeds (bi)directed concept-concept, and concept to task
relationships specified by a human expert, while severing undesired information
flows (e.g., to handle mutually exclusive concepts). Moreover, CREAM integrates
a black-box side-channel that is regularized to encourage task predictions to
be grounded in the relevant concepts, thereby utilizing the side-channel only
when necessary to enhance performance. Our experiments show that: (i) CREAM
mainly relies on concepts while achieving task performance on par with
black-box models; and (ii) the embedded ${\texttt{C-C}}$ and
${\texttt{C$\rightarrow$Y}}$ relationships ease model interventions and
mitigate concept leakage.

*John Collins*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MPP encoding converts geospatial shapes into vectors using scaled distances to reference points, outperforming rasterization in capturing geometric properties and spatial relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable machine learning models to use vector-mode geospatial data (points, lines, polygons) by encoding shapes into vectors that preserve geometric properties.

Method: MultiPoint Proximity (MPP) encoding, which measures scaled distances from a shape to reference points within a region of interest.

Result: MPP encoding is shape-centric, continuous, differentiates spatial objects, and captures pairwise relationships better than rasterization.

Conclusion: MPP encoding is a superior method for representing geospatial data in machine learning models compared to rasterization.

Abstract: Vector-mode geospatial data -- points, lines, and polygons -- must be encoded
into an appropriate form in order to be used with traditional machine learning
and artificial intelligence models. Encoding methods attempt to represent a
given shape as a vector that captures its essential geometric properties. This
paper presents an encoding method based on scaled distances from a shape to a
set of reference points within a region of interest. The method, MultiPoint
Proximity (MPP) encoding, can be applied to any type of shape, enabling the
parameterization of machine learning models with encoded representations of
vector-mode geospatial features. We show that MPP encoding possesses the
desirable properties of shape-centricity and continuity, can be used to
differentiate spatial objects based on their geometric features, and can
capture pairwise spatial relationships with high precision. In all cases, MPP
encoding is shown to perform better than an alternative method based on
rasterization.

*Kuang He,Wei Tang,Tong Wei,Min-Ling Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates foundation models in partial label learning (PLL), proposes PartialCLIP for efficient fine-tuning, and highlights performance trends and limitations of current PLL approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of focus on foundation models in PLL and improve generalizability by leveraging transferable representations.

Method: Empirical evaluation of 11 foundation models across 13 PLL approaches on 8 datasets under 3 PLL scenarios, and introduction of PartialCLIP for fine-tuning.

Result: Foundation models significantly boost PLL performance, approaches show similar results, stability across ambiguity levels, but are sensitive to model selection. PartialCLIP proves effective.

Conclusion: Current PLL approaches have limitations; foundation models and PartialCLIP offer promising directions for more generalizable PLL models.

Abstract: Partial label learning (PLL) seeks to train generalizable classifiers from
datasets with inexact supervision, a common challenge in real-world
applications. Existing studies have developed numerous approaches to
progressively refine and recover ground-truth labels by training convolutional
neural networks. However, limited attention has been given to foundation models
that offer transferrable representations. In this work, we empirically conduct
comprehensive evaluations of 11 foundation models across 13 PLL approaches on 8
benchmark datasets under 3 PLL scenarios. We further propose PartialCLIP, an
efficient fine-tuning framework for foundation models in PLL. Our findings
reveal that current PLL approaches tend to 1) achieve significant performance
gains when using foundation models, 2) exhibit remarkably similar performance
to each other, 3) maintain stable performance across varying ambiguity levels,
while 4) are susceptible to foundation model selection and adaptation
strategies. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficacy of text-embedding
classifier initialization and effective candidate label filtering using
zero-shot CLIP. Our experimental results and analysis underscore the
limitations of current PLL approaches and provide valuable insights for
developing more generalizable PLL models. The source code can be found at

*Hyeongwon Jang,Changhun Kim,Eunho Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TIMING, a method to enhance Integrated Gradients (IG) for time series XAI by incorporating temporal awareness, outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current XAI methods for time series overlook directional impact on predictions, and evaluation metrics fail to assess this, leading to suboptimal identification of significant points.

Method: Proposes TIMING, an enhancement of IG for time series, incorporating temporal awareness while maintaining IG's theoretical properties.

Result: TIMING outperforms existing time series XAI baselines under novel metrics (CPD and CPP).

Conclusion: TIMING effectively addresses limitations of conventional IG in time series XAI, improving identification of significant points with directional impact.

Abstract: Recent explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods for time series
primarily estimate point-wise attribution magnitudes, while overlooking the
directional impact on predictions, leading to suboptimal identification of
significant points. Our analysis shows that conventional Integrated Gradients
(IG) effectively capture critical points with both positive and negative
impacts on predictions. However, current evaluation metrics fail to assess this
capability, as they inadvertently cancel out opposing feature contributions. To
address this limitation, we propose novel evaluation metrics-Cumulative
Prediction Difference (CPD) and Cumulative Prediction Preservation (CPP)-to
systematically assess whether attribution methods accurately identify
significant positive and negative points in time series XAI. Under these
metrics, conventional IG outperforms recent counterparts. However, directly
applying IG to time series data may lead to suboptimal outcomes, as generated
paths ignore temporal relationships and introduce out-of-distribution samples.
To overcome these challenges, we introduce TIMING, which enhances IG by
incorporating temporal awareness while maintaining its theoretical properties.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world time series benchmarks
demonstrate that TIMING outperforms existing time series XAI baselines. Our
code is available at https://github.com/drumpt/TIMING.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: iN2V extends node2vec to an inductive setting, enabling embeddings for unseen nodes and improving node classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the limitation of transductive node embedding methods like node2vec, which require all nodes during training.

Method: Combines post-hoc embedding computation for unseen nodes with modified N2V training.

Result: Improves node classification by 1 point on average, with up to 6 points on some datasets.

Conclusion: iN2V is a versatile, plug-in approach for inductive node representation learning, compatible with other embedding methods.

Abstract: Shallow node embeddings like node2vec (N2V) can be used for nodes without
features or to supplement existing features with structure-based information.
Embedding methods like N2V are limited in their application on new nodes, which
restricts them to the transductive setting where the entire graph, including
the test nodes, is available during training. We propose inductive node2vec
(iN2V), which combines a post-hoc procedure to compute embeddings for nodes
unseen during training and modifications to the original N2V training procedure
to prepare the embeddings for this post-hoc procedure. We conduct experiments
on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate that iN2V is an effective
approach to bringing transductive embeddings to an inductive setting. Using
iN2V embeddings improves node classification by 1 point on average, with up to
6 points of improvement depending on the dataset and the number of unseen
nodes. Our iN2V is a plug-in approach to create new or enrich existing
embeddings. It can also be combined with other embedding methods, making it a
versatile approach for inductive node representation learning. Code to
reproduce the results is available at https://github.com/Foisunt/iN2V .

*Viet Nguyen Changjian Shui,Vijay Giri,Siddarth Arya,Amol Verma,Fahad Razak,Rahul G. Krishnan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: D3M is a monitoring algorithm for detecting post-deployment deterioration in models, using predictive model disagreement to efficiently flag performance degradation without labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Models in dynamic environments face data shifts, but not all degrade performance. Current methods lack label-free detection of harmful shifts.

Method: Proposes D3M, an algorithm based on predictive model disagreement to monitor shifts, with low false positives and sample complexity bounds for high true positives.

Result: Effective on benchmark and real-world medical data, showing viability as an alert system for high-stakes ML pipelines.

Conclusion: D3M provides a practical solution for detecting harmful shifts in deployed models, enhancing reliability in dynamic environments.

Abstract: The distribution of data changes over time; models operating operating in
dynamic environments need retraining. But knowing when to retrain, without
access to labels, is an open challenge since some, but not all shifts degrade
model performance. This paper formalizes and addresses the problem of
post-deployment deterioration (PDD) monitoring. We propose D3M, a practical and
efficient monitoring algorithm based on the disagreement of predictive models,
achieving low false positive rates under non-deteriorating shifts and provides
sample complexity bounds for high true positive rates under deteriorating
shifts. Empirical results on both standard benchmark and a real-world
large-scale internal medicine dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the
framework and highlight its viability as an alert mechanism for high-stakes
machine learning pipelines.

*Shijian Xu,Marcello Massimo Negri,Volker Roth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NIMO combines neural networks and linear models for interpretability and performance, maintaining linear coefficients' interpretability while improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between the interpretability of linear models and the performance of neural networks.

Method: Introduces NIMO, where a neural network learns nonlinear corrections to linear predictions, using profile likelihood optimization and adaptive ridge regression for sparsity.

Result: Recovers underlying linear coefficients and improves predictive accuracy, outperforming other hybrid interpretable models.

Conclusion: NIMO successfully balances interpretability and performance, maintaining linear coefficients' interpretability while enhancing accuracy.

Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) have achieved tremendous success over the past decade,
yet they are still extremely difficult to interpret. In contrast, linear models
are less expressive but offer inherent interpretability. Linear coefficients
are interpretable as the marginal effect of a feature on the prediction,
assuming all other features are kept fixed. To combine the benefits of both
approaches, we introduce NIMO (Nonlinear Interpretable MOdel). The key idea is
to define a model where the NN is designed to learn nonlinear corrections to
the linear model predictions, while also maintaining the original
interpretability of the linear coefficients. Relevantly, we develop an
optimization algorithm based on profile likelihood that elegantly allows for
optimizing over the NN parameters while updating the linear coefficients
analytically. By relying on adaptive ridge regression we can easily incorporate
sparsity constraints as well. We show empirically that we can recover the
underlying linear coefficients while significantly improving the predictive
accuracy. Compared to other hybrid interpretable approaches, our model is the
only one that actually maintains the same interpretability of linear
coefficients as in linear models. We also achieve higher performance on various
regression and classification settings.

*Marten Lienen,Abdullah Saydemir,Stephan Günnemann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Extends HiPPO theory to handle measurement noise, providing an uncertainty-aware initialization for state space models without runtime increase.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HiPPO assumes noise-free data, which is often unrealistic. This work addresses this limitation by incorporating noise into the framework.

Method: Reformulates HiPPO as a linear stochastic control problem, treating data as noisy outputs of a latent system to infer posterior dynamics.

Result: Improved noise resistance in state-space models during both training and inference.

Conclusion: The proposed initialization enhances robustness to noise while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: State space models are emerging as a dominant model class for sequence
problems with many relying on the HiPPO framework to initialize their dynamics.
However, HiPPO fundamentally assumes data to be noise-free; an assumption often
violated in practice. We extend the HiPPO theory with measurement noise and
derive an uncertainty-aware initialization for state space model dynamics. In
our analysis, we interpret HiPPO as a linear stochastic control problem where
the data enters as a noise-free control signal. We then reformulate the problem
so that the data become noisy outputs of a latent system and arrive at an
alternative dynamics initialization that infers the posterior of this latent
system from the data without increasing runtime. Our experiments show that our
initialization improves the resistance of state-space models to noise both at
training and inference time. Find our implementation at

TL;DR: Proposes a kernelized KL divergence estimator with importance sampling correction for stable and efficient semi-implicit variational inference, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges of high variance and bias in KL divergence training for SIVI in high dimensions.

Method: Introduces a kernelized KL divergence estimator with nonparametric smoothing and importance sampling correction, linking it to Stein variational gradient descent.

Result: Achieves lower gradient variance and benign bias, leading to stable and efficient optimization, outperforming existing SIVI methods.

Conclusion: The method enhances training stability and efficiency in high-dimensional SIVI, matching or surpassing current state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Semi-implicit variational inference (SIVI) is a powerful framework for
approximating complex posterior distributions, but training with the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence can be challenging due to high variance and
bias in high-dimensional settings. While current state-of-the-art semi-implicit
variational inference methods, particularly Kernel Semi-Implicit Variational
Inference (KSIVI), have been shown to work in high dimensions, training remains
moderately expensive. In this work, we propose a kernelized KL divergence
estimator that stabilizes training through nonparametric smoothing. To further
reduce the bias, we introduce an importance sampling correction. We provide a
theoretical connection to the amortized version of the Stein variational
gradient descent, which estimates the score gradient via Stein's identity,
showing that both methods minimize the same objective, but our semi-implicit
approach achieves lower gradient variance. In addition, our method's bias in
function space is benign, leading to more stable and efficient optimization.
Empirical results demonstrate that our method outperforms or matches
state-of-the-art SIVI methods in both performance and training efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores privacy amplification in synthetic data generation, showing risks when adversaries control the seed but benefits when using random inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To theoretically understand privacy amplification in synthetic data, which lacks rigorous analysis despite empirical evidence.

Method: Investigates the question using linear regression, analyzing scenarios where adversaries control the seed versus random inputs.

Result: Adversarial seed control leaks as much info as releasing the model, while random inputs amplify privacy beyond the model's guarantees.

Conclusion: The findings in linear regression provide a foundation for broader privacy bounds in synthetic data generation.

Abstract: Synthetic data inherits the differential privacy guarantees of the model used
to generate it. Additionally, synthetic data may benefit from privacy
amplification when the generative model is kept hidden. While empirical studies
suggest this phenomenon, a rigorous theoretical understanding is still lacking.
In this paper, we investigate this question through the well-understood
framework of linear regression. First, we establish negative results showing
that if an adversary controls the seed of the generative model, a single
synthetic data point can leak as much information as releasing the model
itself. Conversely, we show that when synthetic data is generated from random
inputs, releasing a limited number of synthetic data points amplifies privacy
beyond the model's inherent guarantees. We believe our findings in linear
regression can serve as a foundation for deriving more general bounds in the
future.

Result: Achieved over 96% accuracy in anomaly detection and maintained memory usage below 160 KB during training.

Conclusion: The system is suitable for resource-constrained environments, upholding privacy and collaborative learning principles.

Abstract: Recently, federated learning frameworks such as Python TestBed for Federated

algorithm, FLiForest, based on Isolation Forests has been developed, offering a
low-resource, unsupervised method well-suited for edge deployment and
continuous learning. In this paper, we present an application of Isolation
Forest-based temperature anomaly detection, developed using the previously

systems running MicroPython. The system has been experimentally evaluated,
achieving over 96% accuracy in distinguishing normal from abnormal readings and
above 78% precision in detecting anomalies across all tested configurations,
while maintaining a memory usage below 160 KB during model training. These

TL;DR: The paper explores links between generative diffusion and continuous-state associative memory models, highlighting Morse-Smale systems as universal approximators. It describes universal properties of associative memory and transitions from generation to memory as noise reduces. Stability is analyzed, with applications to learning landscapes and diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge generative diffusion models and associative memory models, leveraging Morse-Smale dynamical systems for universal approximation and stability analysis.

Method: Emphasizes Morse-Smale systems as universal approximators, analyzes structural stability, and examines transitions in noise levels. Uses bifurcations to characterize learning and generation landscapes.

Result: Shows stability in associative memory and diffusion models at vanishing noise levels, with isolated exceptions. Demonstrates transitions via bifurcations.

Conclusion: The study provides a unified framework for understanding generative diffusion and associative memory models, highlighting stability and transitions through bifurcations.

Abstract: Connections between generative diffusion and continuous-state associative
memory models are studied. Morse-Smale dynamical systems are emphasized as
universal approximators of gradient-based associative memory models and
diffusion models as white-noise perturbed systems thereof. Universal properties
of associative memory that follow from this description are described and used
to characterize a generic transition from generation to memory as noise levels
diminish. Structural stability inherited by Morse-Smale flows is shown to imply
a notion of stability for diffusions at vanishing noise levels. Applied to one-
and two-parameter families of gradients, this indicates stability at all but
isolated points of associative memory learning landscapes and the learning and
generation landscapes of diffusion models with gradient drift in the zero-noise
limit, at which small sets of generic bifurcations characterize qualitative
transitions between stable systems. Examples illustrating the characterization
of these landscapes by sequences of these bifurcations are given, along with
structural stability criterion for classic and modern Hopfield networks
(equivalently, the attention mechanism).

*Zhicheng Yang,Zhijiang Guo,Yinya Huang,Xiaodan Liang,Yiwei Wang,Jing Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces \textbf{\name}, a method using tree sampling to estimate step-level rewards for LLMs, improving reasoning performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods lack fine-grained reward signals for intermediate reasoning steps, limiting LLM optimization.

Method: \textbf{\name} employs tree sampling to estimate step-level rewards and integrates them with GRPO's group-relative reward mechanism.

Result: \name boosts Pass@1 accuracy from 19.0% to 35.5% and outperforms GRPO by 2.9% while reducing response length by 18.1%.

Conclusion: \name effectively enhances LLM reasoning by providing dense, step-level rewards, improving both performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities
through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods. However,
a key limitation of existing approaches is that rewards defined at the full
trajectory level provide insufficient guidance for optimizing the intermediate
steps of a reasoning process. To address this, we introduce \textbf{\name}, a
novel method that estimates the mathematical expectations of rewards at various
reasoning steps using tree sampling. Unlike prior methods that rely on a
separate step reward model, \name directly estimates these rewards through this
sampling process. Building on the group-relative reward training mechanism of
GRPO, \name innovatively computes rewards based on step-level groups generated
during tree sampling. This advancement allows \name to produce fine-grained and
dense reward signals, significantly enhancing the learning process and overall
performance of LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our \name algorithm
substantially improves the average Pass@1 accuracy of Qwen-2.5-Math on test
benchmarks, increasing it from 19.0\% to 35.5\%. Furthermore, \name
significantly outperforms GRPO by 2.9\% in performance while simultaneously
reducing the average response length by 18.1\%, showcasing its effectiveness
and efficiency. Our code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based methods lose discriminative power over distance; LPMT aims to preserve locality and improve global retrieval.

Method: LPMT uses Bidirectional Collaborative Diffusion (BCD) and Locality State Embedding (LSE) with a Thermodynamic Markovian Transition (TMT) process.

Result: LPMT improves instance retrieval across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: LPMT effectively balances local and global retrieval performance.

Abstract: Diffusion-based re-ranking methods are effective in modeling the data
manifolds through similarity propagation in affinity graphs. However, positive
signals tend to diminish over several steps away from the source, reducing
discriminative power beyond local regions. To address this issue, we introduce
the Locality Preserving Markovian Transition (LPMT) framework, which employs a
long-term thermodynamic transition process with multiple states for accurate
manifold distance measurement. The proposed LPMT first integrates diffusion
processes across separate graphs using Bidirectional Collaborative Diffusion
(BCD) to establish strong similarity relationships. Afterwards, Locality State
Embedding (LSE) encodes each instance into a distribution for enhanced local
consistency. These distributions are interconnected via the Thermodynamic
Markovian Transition (TMT) process, enabling efficient global retrieval while
maintaining local effectiveness. Experimental results across diverse tasks
confirm the effectiveness of LPMT for instance retrieval.

### [607] [Transformers Meet In-Context Learning: A Universal Approximation Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05200)
*Gen Li,Yuchen Jiao,Yu Huang,Yuting Wei,Yuxin Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops a universal approximation theory for transformers, explaining how they enable in-context learning without fine-tuning or parameter updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how transformers perform in-context learning and provide a theoretical foundation for their ability to adapt dynamically to new tasks.

Method: Constructs transformers capable of universal function approximation, allowing reliable prediction from in-context examples without weight updates.

Result: Demonstrates that transformers can approximate any class of functions, extending beyond convex problems and linear function classes.

Conclusion: The work provides a novel perspective on transformers' adaptability and general-purpose representation learning, distinct from algorithm approximation approaches.

Abstract: Modern large language models are capable of in-context learning, the ability
to perform new tasks at inference time using only a handful of input-output
examples in the prompt, without any fine-tuning or parameter updates. We
develop a universal approximation theory to better understand how transformers
enable in-context learning. For any class of functions (each representing a
distinct task), we demonstrate how to construct a transformer that, without any
further weight updates, can perform reliable prediction given only a few
in-context examples. In contrast to much of the recent literature that frames
transformers as algorithm approximators -- i.e., constructing transformers to
emulate the iterations of optimization algorithms as a means to approximate
solutions of learning problems -- our work adopts a fundamentally different
approach rooted in universal function approximation. This alternative approach
offers approximation guarantees that are not constrained by the effectiveness
of the optimization algorithms being approximated, thereby extending far beyond
convex problems and linear function classes. Our construction sheds light on
how transformers can simultaneously learn general-purpose representations and
adapt dynamically to in-context examples.

### [608] [Learning Theory of Decentralized Robust Kernel-Based Learning Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05215)
*Zhan Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A decentralized robust kernel-based learning algorithm is proposed, unifying robust regression in RKHS with networked systems. It offers rigorous convergence analysis and optimal learning rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing distributed robust kernel learning schemes are divide-and-conquer based, lacking a unified decentralized framework. This work aims to fill that gap.

Method: Utilizes a robust loss function in RKHS with a networked system represented as a graph. Derives convergence bounds via kernel-based integral operator techniques.

Result: Local estimators approximate the regression function with high confidence bounds. Optimal learning rates are achieved under proper parameter selection.

Conclusion: The algorithm bridges decentralization, robustness, and convergence, with the scaling parameter σ playing a key role in performance.

Abstract: We propose a new decentralized robust kernel-based learning algorithm within
the framework of reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) by utilizing a
networked system that can be represented as a connected graph. The robust loss
function $\mathcal{L}_\sigma$ induced by a windowing function $W$ and a
robustness scaling parameter $\sigma>0$, can encompass a broad spectrum of
robust losses. Consequently, the proposed algorithm effectively provides a
unified decentralized learning framework for robust regression, which
fundamentally differs from the existing distributed robust kernel learning
schemes, all of which are divide-and-conquer based. We rigorously establish the
learning theory and offer a comprehensive convergence analysis for the
algorithm. We show each local robust estimator generated from the decentralized
algorithm can be utilized to approximate the regression function. Based on
kernel-based integral operator techniques, we derive general high confidence
convergence bounds for each local approximating sequence in terms of the mean
square distance, RKHS norm, and generalization error, respectively. Moreover,
we provide rigorous selection rules for local sample size and show that, under
properly selected step size and scaling parameter $\sigma$, the decentralized
robust algorithm can achieve optimal learning rates (up to logarithmic factors)
in both norms. The parameter $\sigma$ is shown to be essential for enhancing
robustness while also ensuring favorable convergence behavior. The intrinsic
connection among decentralization, sample selection, robustness of the
algorithm, and its convergence is clearly reflected.

*Tyler Chen,Akshay Seshadri,Mattia J. Villani,Pradeep Niroula,Shouvanik Chakrabarti,Archan Ray,Pranav Deshpande,Romina Yalovetzky,Marco Pistoia,Niraj Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified framework for Shapley value estimators, including KernelSHAP, and provides the first theoretical guarantees for KernelSHAP. It validates the approach with low error on small/medium datasets and improves scalability for high-dimensional ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exact Shapley value computation is computationally expensive, and existing randomized estimators like KernelSHAP lack theoretical guarantees. The paper aims to unify and analyze these estimators theoretically and practically.

Method: The authors propose a broad framework encompassing KernelSHAP and related estimators, using with/without replacement sampling. They prove non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees and implement scalability improvements for high-dimensional datasets.

Result: The framework achieves low mean squared error on small/medium datasets and outperforms KernelSHAP on high-dimensional datasets like MNIST and CIFAR10.

Conclusion: The study provides the first theoretical guarantees for KernelSHAP, unifies existing estimators, and demonstrates practical improvements in accuracy and scalability.

Abstract: Shapley values have emerged as a critical tool for explaining which features
impact the decisions made by machine learning models. However, computing exact
Shapley values is difficult, generally requiring an exponential (in the feature
dimension) number of model evaluations. To address this, many model-agnostic
randomized estimators have been developed, the most influential and widely used
being the KernelSHAP method (Lundberg & Lee, 2017). While related estimators
such as unbiased KernelSHAP (Covert & Lee, 2021) and LeverageSHAP (Musco &
Witter, 2025) are known to satisfy theoretical guarantees, bounds for
KernelSHAP have remained elusive. We describe a broad and unified framework
that encompasses KernelSHAP and related estimators constructed using both with
and without replacement sampling strategies. We then prove strong
non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees that apply to all estimators from our
framework. This provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first theoretical
guarantees for KernelSHAP and sheds further light on tradeoffs between existing
estimators. Through comprehensive benchmarking on small and medium dimensional
datasets for Decision-Tree models, we validate our approach against exact
Shapley values, consistently achieving low mean squared error with modest
sample sizes. Furthermore, we make specific implementation improvements to
enable scalability of our methods to high-dimensional datasets. Our methods,
tested on datasets such MNIST and CIFAR10, provide consistently better results
compared to the KernelSHAP library.

*Severi Rissanen,RuiKang OuYang,Jiajun He,Wenlin Chen,Markus Heinonen,Arno Solin,José Miguel Hernández-Lobato*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PTSD, a method combining Progressive Tempering and diffusion models to improve neural samplers, outperforming existing approaches in efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural samplers lag behind MCMC methods like Parallel Tempering in efficiency. PTSD aims to bridge this gap while avoiding the computational cost of rerunning MCMC.

Method: PTSD trains diffusion models sequentially across temperatures, using MCMC to refine samples and train subsequent models.

Result: PTSD generates well-mixed, uncorrelated samples efficiently, surpassing diffusion-based neural samplers.

Conclusion: PTSD successfully combines the strengths of PT and neural samplers, offering a more efficient and reusable sampling method.

Abstract: Recent research has focused on designing neural samplers that amortize the
process of sampling from unnormalized densities. However, despite significant
advancements, they still fall short of the state-of-the-art MCMC approach,
Parallel Tempering (PT), when it comes to the efficiency of target evaluations.
On the other hand, unlike a well-trained neural sampler, PT yields only
dependent samples and needs to be rerun -- at considerable computational cost
-- whenever new samples are required. To address these weaknesses, we propose
the Progressive Tempering Sampler with Diffusion (PTSD), which trains diffusion
models sequentially across temperatures, leveraging the advantages of PT to
improve the training of neural samplers. We also introduce a novel method to
combine high-temperature diffusion models to generate approximate
lower-temperature samples, which are minimally refined using MCMC and used to
train the next diffusion model. PTSD enables efficient reuse of sample
information across temperature levels while generating well-mixed, uncorrelated
samples. Our method significantly improves target evaluation efficiency,
outperforming diffusion-based neural samplers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates sparse autoencoders (SAEs) in a controlled MNIST setting, identifies limitations due to quasi-orthogonality assumptions, and proposes a multi-iteration SAE (MP-SAE) for better feature extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current shallow SAEs in extracting correlated features, especially in hierarchical settings like handwritten digit generation.

Method: Introduces a multi-iteration SAE by unrolling Matching Pursuit (MP-SAE), enabling residual-guided extraction of correlated features with guaranteed reconstruction improvement.

Result: MP-SAE outperforms shallow SAEs by effectively extracting correlated features and improving reconstruction monotonically.

Conclusion: MP-SAE advances SAE capabilities for interpretability by overcoming quasi-orthogonality limitations and handling hierarchical feature structures.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently become central tools for
interpretability, leveraging dictionary learning principles to extract sparse,
interpretable features from neural representations whose underlying structure
is typically unknown. This paper evaluates SAEs in a controlled setting using
MNIST, which reveals that current shallow architectures implicitly rely on a
quasi-orthogonality assumption that limits the ability to extract correlated
features. To move beyond this, we introduce a multi-iteration SAE by unrolling
Matching Pursuit (MP-SAE), enabling the residual-guided extraction of
correlated features that arise in hierarchical settings such as handwritten
digit generation while guaranteeing monotonic improvement of the reconstruction
as more atoms are selected.

*Zhen Qin,Jinxin Zhou,Zhihui Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the convergence behavior of a single-layer Transformer with self-attention, feedforward networks, and residual connections, showing linear convergence under proper initialization and highlighting the role of residual connections in stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the empirical success of Transformers, their theoretical foundations, especially training dynamics, are underdeveloped. The paper aims to understand the interdependencies between Transformer components like self-attention and residual connections.

Method: The study examines a single-layer Transformer with self-attention, feedforward networks, and residual connections, analyzing gradient descent convergence under specific initialization conditions.

Result: Gradient descent exhibits linear convergence, influenced by the singular values of the attention output matrix. Residual connections improve optimization stability by addressing ill-conditioning from the softmax operation.

Conclusion: The theoretical insights are validated empirically, confirming the benefits of residual connections in enhancing convergence stability, with findings extended to multi-layer Transformers.

Abstract: Transformer models have emerged as fundamental tools across various
scientific and engineering disciplines, owing to their outstanding performance
in diverse applications. Despite this empirical success, the theoretical
foundations of Transformers remain relatively underdeveloped, particularly in
understanding their training dynamics. Existing research predominantly examines
isolated components--such as self-attention mechanisms and feedforward
networks--without thoroughly investigating the interdependencies between these
components, especially when residual connections are present. In this paper, we
aim to bridge this gap by analyzing the convergence behavior of a structurally
complete yet single-layer Transformer, comprising self-attention, a feedforward
network, and residual connections. We demonstrate that, under appropriate
initialization, gradient descent exhibits a linear convergence rate, where the
convergence speed is determined by the minimum and maximum singular values of
the output matrix from the attention layer. Moreover, our analysis reveals that
residual connections serve to ameliorate the ill-conditioning of this output
matrix, an issue stemming from the low-rank structure imposed by the softmax
operation, thereby promoting enhanced optimization stability. We also extend
our theoretical findings to a multi-layer Transformer architecture, confirming
the linear convergence rate of gradient descent under suitable initialization.
Empirical results corroborate our theoretical insights, illustrating the
beneficial role of residual connections in promoting convergence stability.

TL;DR: The paper explores learnability in machine learning when agents genuinely improve for better classification, extending prior work by characterizing learnability across new axes, including proper and improper learning, and resolving open questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how machine learning performs when classified agents improve genuinely, beyond deceptive behaviors, and to extend learnability characterizations to more natural and practical settings.

Method: Introduces asymmetric variant of minimally consistent concept classes, studies learnability under Euclidean ball improvement sets, and addresses bounded noise models and online learning.

Result: Provides exact characterizations for proper learning in realizable settings, positive results for natural improvement sets, and resolves open questions from prior work.

Conclusion: The work advances understanding of learnability with agent improvements, offering practical insights and solutions for real-world applications.

Abstract: Machine learning is now ubiquitous in societal decision-making, for example
in evaluating job candidates or loan applications, and it is increasingly
important to take into account how classified agents will react to the learning
algorithms. The majority of recent literature on strategic classification has
focused on reducing and countering deceptive behaviors by the classified
agents, but recent work of Attias et al. identifies surprising properties of
learnability when the agents genuinely improve in order to attain the desirable
classification, such as smaller generalization error than standard
PAC-learning. In this paper we characterize so-called learnability with
improvements across multiple new axes. We introduce an asymmetric variant of
minimally consistent concept classes and use it to provide an exact
characterization of proper learning with improvements in the realizable
setting. While prior work studies learnability only under general, arbitrary
agent improvement regions, we give positive results for more natural Euclidean
ball improvement sets. In particular, we characterize improper learning under a
mild generative assumption on the data distribution. We further show how to
learn in more challenging settings, achieving lower generalization error under
well-studied bounded noise models and obtaining mistake bounds in realizable
and agnostic online learning. We resolve open questions posed by Attias et al.
for both proper and improper learning.

*Guillaume Pourcel,Maxence Ernoult*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Recurrent Hamiltonian Echo Learning (RHEL), a physics-grounded algorithm for training deep state space models efficiently, matching BPTT performance without explicit Jacobian computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a learning algorithm for dynamical systems that adheres to physical principles, enabling efficient simulation and scalable design.

Method: Proposes RHEL, which computes gradients as finite differences of Hamiltonian system trajectories, requiring only three forward passes. Extends to discrete-time for practical use with Hamiltonian Recurrent Units (HRUs).

Result: RHEL matches BPTT performance on time-series tasks with sequences up to ~50k, demonstrating scalability and efficiency.

Conclusion: RHEL enables scalable, energy-efficient physical systems for sequence modeling, bridging physics and machine learning.

Abstract: Deep State Space Models (SSMs) reignite physics-grounded compute paradigms,
as RNNs could natively be embodied into dynamical systems. This calls for
dedicated learning algorithms obeying to core physical principles, with
efficient techniques to simulate these systems and guide their design. We
propose Recurrent Hamiltonian Echo Learning (RHEL), an algorithm which provably
computes loss gradients as finite differences of physical trajectories of
non-dissipative, Hamiltonian systems. In ML terms, RHEL only requires three
"forward passes" irrespective of model size, without explicit Jacobian
computation, nor incurring any variance in the gradient estimation. Motivated
by the physical realization of our algorithm, we first introduce RHEL in
continuous time and demonstrate its formal equivalence with the continuous
adjoint state method. To facilitate the simulation of Hamiltonian systems
trained by RHEL, we propose a discrete-time version of RHEL which is equivalent
to Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) when applied to a class of recurrent
modules which we call Hamiltonian Recurrent Units (HRUs). This setting allows
us to demonstrate the scalability of RHEL by generalizing these results to
hierarchies of HRUs, which we call Hamiltonian SSMs (HSSMs). We apply RHEL to
train HSSMs with linear and nonlinear dynamics on a variety of time-series
tasks ranging from mid-range to long-range classification and regression with
sequence length reaching $\sim 50k$. We show that RHEL consistently matches the
performance of BPTT across all models and tasks. This work opens new doors for
the design of scalable, energy-efficient physical systems endowed with
self-learning capabilities for sequence modelling.

TL;DR: The paper provides a tight analysis of error feedback schemes (EF and EF²¹) in distributed learning, comparing their convergence rates and performance with compressed gradient descent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Communication bottlenecks in distributed learning due to compressed information exchange degrade convergence, prompting the need for precise analysis of error feedback methods.

Method: The study uses Lyapunov functions to derive optimal convergence rates for EF and EF²¹, with matching lower bounds, in a simplified setting for clarity.

Result: The analysis yields sharp performance guarantees and enables a rigorous comparison between EF, EF²¹, and compressed gradient descent.

Conclusion: The work provides principled insights into error feedback mechanisms, facilitating fair comparisons and improved understanding of their convergence properties.

Abstract: Communication between agents often constitutes a major computational
bottleneck in distributed learning. One of the most common mitigation
strategies is to compress the information exchanged, thereby reducing
communication overhead. To counteract the degradation in convergence associated
with compressed communication, error feedback schemes -- most notably
$\mathrm{EF}$ and $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$ -- were introduced. In this work, we
provide a tight analysis of both of these methods. Specifically, we find the
Lyapunov function that yields the best possible convergence rate for each
method -- with matching lower bounds. This principled approach yields sharp
performance guarantees and enables a rigorous, apples-to-apples comparison
between $\mathrm{EF}$, $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$, and compressed gradient descent. Our
analysis is carried out in a simplified yet representative setting, which
allows for clean theoretical insights and fair comparison of the underlying
mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with controlling properties in generated time series, especially for precise modifications while preserving coherence.

Method: CocktailEdit combines confidence-weighted anchor control for point-wise constraints and classifier-based control for segment-level statistical properties, integrated with diffusion-based models.

Result: The framework achieves precise local control and coherence, validated across diverse datasets and models.

Conclusion: CocktailEdit bridges generative modeling and real-world editing needs, offering a flexible solution for human-in-the-loop time series tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in time series generation have shown promise, yet controlling
properties in generated sequences remains challenging. Time Series Editing
(TSE) - making precise modifications while preserving temporal coherence -
consider both point-level constraints and segment-level controls that current
methods struggle to provide. We introduce the CocktailEdit framework to enable
simultaneous, flexible control across different types of constraints. This
framework combines two key mechanisms: a confidence-weighted anchor control for
point-wise constraints and a classifier-based control for managing statistical
properties such as sums and averages over segments. Our methods achieve precise
local control during the denoising inference stage while maintaining temporal
coherence and integrating seamlessly, with any conditionally trained
diffusion-based time series models. Extensive experiments across diverse
datasets and models demonstrate its effectiveness. Our work bridges the gap
between pure generative modeling and real-world time series editing needs,
offering a flexible solution for human-in-the-loop time series generation and
editing. The code and demo are provided for validation.

TL;DR: Fast-DataShapley is a one-pass training method for efficiently calculating Shapley values of training data without retraining, improving performance and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protecting data providers' rights and fairly rewarding their contributions in AI, while addressing the computational inefficiency of Shapley value methods.

Method: Leverages weighted least squares to train a reusable explainer model, with three methods to reduce training overhead via utility approximation and group calculation.

Result: Achieves 2.5x performance improvement and 100x faster training speed compared to baselines on image datasets.

Conclusion: Fast-DataShapley efficiently computes Shapley values with real-time reasoning, offering a scalable solution for data valuation.

Abstract: The value and copyright of training data are crucial in the artificial
intelligence industry. Service platforms should protect data providers'
legitimate rights and fairly reward them for their contributions. Shapley
value, a potent tool for evaluating contributions, outperforms other methods in
theory, but its computational overhead escalates exponentially with the number
of data providers. Recent works based on Shapley values attempt to mitigate
computation complexity by approximation algorithms. However, they need to
retrain for each test sample, leading to intolerable costs. We propose
Fast-DataShapley, a one-pass training method that leverages the weighted least
squares characterization of the Shapley value to train a reusable explainer
model with real-time reasoning speed. Given new test samples, no retraining is
required to calculate the Shapley values of the training data. Additionally, we
propose three methods with theoretical guarantees to reduce training overhead
from two aspects: the approximate calculation of the utility function and the
group calculation of the training data. We analyze time complexity to show the
efficiency of our methods. The experimental evaluations on various image
datasets demonstrate superior performance and efficiency compared to baselines.
Specifically, the performance is improved to more than 2.5 times, and the
explainer's training speed can be increased by two orders of magnitude.

TL;DR: Reservoir computing can generalize to unexplored state space regions without explicit structural priors, using a multiple-trajectory training scheme.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning struggles to generalize dynamics poorly represented in training data without structural priors.

Method: A multiple-trajectory training scheme for reservoir computers is introduced, applied to multistable systems.

Result: RCs trained on single-basin trajectories generalize to unobserved basins.

Conclusion: Reservoir computing enables effective generalization in dynamical systems without explicit priors.

Abstract: Machine learning techniques offer an effective approach to modeling dynamical
systems solely from observed data. However, without explicit structural priors
-- built-in assumptions about the underlying dynamics -- these techniques
typically struggle to generalize to aspects of the dynamics that are poorly
represented in the training data. Here, we demonstrate that reservoir computing
-- a simple, efficient, and versatile machine learning framework often used for
data-driven modeling of dynamical systems -- can generalize to unexplored
regions of state space without explicit structural priors. First, we describe a
multiple-trajectory training scheme for reservoir computers that supports
training across a collection of disjoint time series, enabling effective use of
available training data. Then, applying this training scheme to multistable
dynamical systems, we show that RCs trained on trajectories from a single basin
of attraction can achieve out-of-domain generalization by capturing system
behavior in entirely unobserved basins.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAILOR, a method for imitation learning that improves upon behavioral cloning by enabling agents to recover from mistakes using learned world and reward models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Behavioral cloning (BC) fails when agents deviate from expert-demonstrated states, lacking recovery strategies. The goal is to teach agents to plan and recover independently.

Method: The approach, SAILOR, learns a world model and a reward model from expert demonstrations, enabling planning to match expert outcomes even after mistakes.

Result: SAILOR outperforms state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies trained via BC across multiple benchmarks, even with 5-10x more BC demonstrations. It is robust to reward hacking.

Conclusion: SAILOR effectively addresses BC's limitations by enabling independent reasoning and recovery, proving superior in performance and robustness.

Abstract: The fundamental limitation of the behavioral cloning (BC) approach to
imitation learning is that it only teaches an agent what the expert did at
states the expert visited. This means that when a BC agent makes a mistake
which takes them out of the support of the demonstrations, they often don't
know how to recover from it. In this sense, BC is akin to giving the agent the
fish -- giving them dense supervision across a narrow set of states -- rather
than teaching them to fish: to be able to reason independently about achieving
the expert's outcome even when faced with unseen situations at test-time. In
response, we explore learning to search (L2S) from expert demonstrations, i.e.
learning the components required to, at test time, plan to match expert
outcomes, even after making a mistake. These include (1) a world model and (2)
a reward model. We carefully ablate the set of algorithmic and design decisions
required to combine these and other components for stable and
sample/interaction-efficient learning of recovery behavior without additional
human corrections. Across a dozen visual manipulation tasks from three
benchmarks, our approach $\texttt{SAILOR}$ consistently out-performs
state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies trained via BC on the same data.
Furthermore, scaling up the amount of demonstrations used for BC by
5-10$\times$ still leaves a performance gap. We find that $\texttt{SAILOR}$ can
identify nuanced failures and is robust to reward hacking. Our code is
available at https://github.com/arnavkj1995/SAILOR .

TL;DR: The paper analyzes test-time scaling strategies for LLMs, comparing self-consistency and best-of-$n$ sampling efficiency, and introduces self-correction with verifier feedback as a multi-task solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To theoretically understand the sample efficiency of test-time strategies like self-consistency, best-of-$n$, and self-correction in LLMs, which lack theoretical grounding despite empirical success.

Method: Theoretical analysis of sample efficiency for self-consistency and best-of-$n$, and an expressiveness result for self-correction with verifier feedback, validated empirically.

Result: Self-consistency requires Θ(1/Δ²) samples, while best-of-$n$ needs Θ(1/Δ). Self-correction enables Transformers to simulate online learning for multi-task settings.

Conclusion: Self-correction with verifier feedback is theoretically and empirically effective, extending Transformer capabilities to multi-task scenarios without prior task knowledge.

Abstract: Test-time scaling paradigms have significantly advanced the capabilities of
large language models (LLMs) on complex tasks. Despite their empirical success,
theoretical understanding of the sample efficiency of various test-time
strategies -- such as self-consistency, best-of-$n$, and self-correction --
remains limited. In this work, we first establish a separation result between
two repeated sampling strategies: self-consistency requires
$\Theta(1/\Delta^2)$ samples to produce the correct answer, while best-of-$n$
only needs $\Theta(1/\Delta)$, where $\Delta < 1$ denotes the probability gap
between the correct and second most likely answers. Next, we present an
expressiveness result for the self-correction approach with verifier feedback:
it enables Transformers to simulate online learning over a pool of experts at
test time. Therefore, a single Transformer architecture can provably solve
multiple tasks without prior knowledge of the specific task associated with a
user query, extending the representation theory of Transformers from
single-task to multi-task settings. Finally, we empirically validate our
theoretical results, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of
self-correction methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SiftAttention replaces top-$k$ operations in attention computations with an efficient element-wise filtering method, reducing GPU memory bandwidth usage while maintaining model quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory bandwidth limitations in GPUs during attention computations hinder efficient inference with large language models. Existing approximate methods rely on costly top-$k$ operations, which are inefficient on GPUs.

Method: SiftAttention uses a dynamic threshold-based filtering operation instead of top-$k$, leveraging the predictable power-law behavior of attention scores. Only scores above the threshold are used, minimizing data movement.

Result: SiftAttention reduces memory bandwidth usage and outperforms existing methods in preserving model quality.

Conclusion: SiftAttention offers a more efficient and effective solution for approximate attention in large language models on GPUs.

Abstract: Efficient inference on GPUs using large language models remains challenging
due to memory bandwidth limitations, particularly during data transfers between
High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) and SRAM in attention computations. Approximate
attention methods address this issue by reducing computational and memory
overhead but often rely on expensive top-$k$ operations, which perform poorly
on GPUs. We propose SiftAttention, a novel approximate attention method that
replaces the top-$k$ step with a computationally efficient element-wise
filtering operation based on a threshold value. Our intuition for doing this is
based on our empirical observation that the $\tau$-th quantile of attention
scores follows a predictable power-law over sequential generation steps.
Exploiting this insight, our approach dynamically estimates a threshold value
per prompt at each generation step. Only attention scores above this threshold
and their corresponding value vectors are loaded/used to compute the attention
output, reducing data movement between HBM and SRAM. Our evaluation
demonstrates that SiftAttention preserves model quality better than existing
approximate attention methods while reducing memory bandwidth usage when
loading value vectors.

*Florentin Guth,Zahra Kadkhodaie,Eero P Simoncelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for learning normalized energy models inspired by diffusion generative models, using a modified score network architecture to compute energy while preserving inductive biases. The approach achieves competitive cross-entropy results on ImageNet64 and demonstrates strong generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning probability models from data is challenging due to the curse of dimensionality. The paper aims to address this by leveraging insights from diffusion generative models to develop a normalized energy model framework.

Method: A score network architecture is modified to compute energy, with gradients optimized using a denoising objective. A secondary objective ensures consistent energies across noise levels. The model is trained on ImageNet64.

Result: The model achieves cross-entropy comparable to state-of-the-art methods and shows strong generalization, with log probabilities nearly independent of training images. It also reveals variability in image probability and local dimensionality.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively learns normalized energy models, generalizes well, and challenges traditional assumptions about image probability and dimensionality.

Abstract: Learning probability models from data is at the heart of many machine
learning endeavors, but is notoriously difficult due to the curse of
dimensionality. We introduce a new framework for learning \emph{normalized}
energy (log probability) models that is inspired from diffusion generative
models, which rely on networks optimized to estimate the score. We modify a
score network architecture to compute an energy while preserving its inductive
biases. The gradient of this energy network with respect to its input image is
the score of the learned density, which can be optimized using a denoising
objective. Importantly, the gradient with respect to the noise level provides
an additional score that can be optimized with a novel secondary objective,
ensuring consistent and normalized energies across noise levels. We train an
energy network with this \emph{dual} score matching objective on the ImageNet64
dataset, and obtain a cross-entropy (negative log likelihood) value comparable
to the state of the art. We further validate our approach by showing that our
energy model \emph{strongly generalizes}: estimated log probabilities are
nearly independent of the specific images in the training set. Finally, we
demonstrate that both image probability and dimensionality of local
neighborhoods vary significantly with image content, in contrast with
traditional assumptions such as concentration of measure or support on a
low-dimensional manifold.

TL;DR: LSM-2 with AIM introduces a self-supervised learning approach for handling incomplete wearable sensor data without imputation, achieving top performance across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of missing data in wearable sensor applications for robust self-supervised learning.

Method: Uses Adaptive and Inherited Masking (AIM) with learnable mask tokens to model missingness, pre-trained on 40M hours of multimodal sensor data.

Result: Achieves best performance in classification, regression, and generative tasks, with high robustness under targeted missingness.

Conclusion: AIM is a reliable solution for real-world wearable data, especially in clinical scenarios.

Abstract: Foundation models, a cornerstone of recent advancements in machine learning,
have predominantly thrived on complete and well-structured data. Wearable
sensor data frequently suffers from significant missingness, posing a
substantial challenge for self-supervised learning (SSL) models that typically
assume complete data inputs. This paper introduces the second generation of
Large Sensor Model (LSM-2) with Adaptive and Inherited Masking (AIM), a novel
SSL approach that learns robust representations directly from incomplete data
without requiring explicit imputation. AIM's core novelty lies in its use of
learnable mask tokens to model both existing ("inherited") and artificially
introduced missingness, enabling it to robustly handle fragmented real-world
data during inference. Pre-trained on an extensive dataset of 40M hours of
day-long multimodal sensor data, our LSM-2 with AIM achieves the best
performance across a diverse range of tasks, including classification,
regression and generative modeling. Furthermore, LSM-2 with AIM exhibits
superior scaling performance, and critically, maintains high performance even
under targeted missingness scenarios, reflecting clinically coherent patterns,
such as the diagnostic value of nighttime biosignals for hypertension
prediction. This makes AIM a more reliable choice for real-world wearable data
applications.

*Yingshuai Ji,Haomin Zhuang,Matthew Toole,James McKenzie,Xiaolong Liu,Xiangliang Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An AI-based framework for extracting single-scatterer QPI patterns from multi-scatterer images using a two-step learning strategy, achieving higher accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extracting single-scatterer QPI patterns from multi-scatterer images is a challenging, ill-posed inverse problem.

Method: A two-step learning strategy: (1) train a variational autoencoder to learn kernel representations, (2) align QPI observations with pre-learned kernels using a dedicated encoder.

Result: The method outperforms a direct one-step baseline, achieving higher extraction accuracy and better generalization to unseen kernels.

Conclusion: The proposed AI framework effectively addresses the QPI kernel extraction problem, offering robust performance under complex scattering conditions.

Abstract: Quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging is a powerful tool for probing
electronic structures in quantum materials, but extracting the single-scatterer
QPI pattern (i.e., the kernel) from a multi-scatterer image remains a
fundamentally ill-posed inverse problem. In this work, we propose the first
AI-based framework for QPI kernel extraction. We introduce a two-step learning
strategy that decouples kernel representation learning from
observation-to-kernel inference. In the first step, we train a variational
autoencoder to learn a compact latent space of scattering kernels. In the
second step, we align the latent representation of QPI observations with those
of the pre-learned kernels using a dedicated encoder. This design enables the
model to infer kernels robustly even under complex, entangled scattering
conditions. We construct a diverse and physically realistic QPI dataset
comprising 100 unique kernels and evaluate our method against a direct one-step
baseline. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
significantly higher extraction accuracy, and improved generalization to unseen
kernels.

### [625] [Exploring Diffusion Transformer Designs via Grafting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05340)
*Keshigeyan Chandrasegaran,Michael Poli,Daniel Y. Fu,Dongjun Kim,Lea M. Hadzic,Manling Li,Agrim Gupta,Stefano Massaroli,Azalia Mirhoseini,Juan Carlos Niebles,Stefano Ermon,Li Fei-Fei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Grafting enables efficient exploration of new diffusion model architectures by editing pretrained models, reducing compute costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating architectural decisions in models requires costly pretraining; grafting leverages pretrained models to study new designs cheaply.

Method: Grafting edits pretrained diffusion transformers (DiTs) to test hybrid designs (e.g., replacing attention with gated convolution) with minimal compute.

Result: Hybrid designs achieve comparable quality (FID: 2.38-2.64) using <2% pretraining compute; grafting also speeds up text-to-image models (1.43x) with minimal quality loss.

Conclusion: Grafting is a practical method for exploring new diffusion model architectures, from operator replacement to restructuring, without full pretraining.

Abstract: Designing model architectures requires decisions such as selecting operators
(e.g., attention, convolution) and configurations (e.g., depth, width).
However, evaluating the impact of these decisions on model quality requires
costly pretraining, limiting architectural investigation. Inspired by how new
software is built on existing code, we ask: can new architecture designs be
studied using pretrained models? To this end, we present grafting, a simple
approach for editing pretrained diffusion transformers (DiTs) to materialize
new architectures under small compute budgets. Informed by our analysis of
activation behavior and attention locality, we construct a testbed based on the
DiT-XL/2 design to study the impact of grafting on model quality. Using this
testbed, we develop a family of hybrid designs via grafting: replacing softmax
attention with gated convolution, local attention, and linear attention, and
replacing MLPs with variable expansion ratio and convolutional variants.
Notably, many hybrid designs achieve good quality (FID: 2.38-2.64 vs. 2.27 for
DiT-XL/2) using <2% pretraining compute. We then graft a text-to-image model
(PixArt-Sigma), achieving a 1.43x speedup with less than a 2% drop in GenEval
score. Finally, we present a case study that restructures DiT-XL/2 by
converting every pair of sequential transformer blocks into parallel blocks via
grafting. This reduces model depth by 2x and yields better quality (FID: 2.77)
than other models of comparable depth. Together, we show that new diffusion
model designs can be explored by grafting pretrained DiTs, with edits ranging
from operator replacement to architecture restructuring. Code and grafted

### [626] [BEAR: BGP Event Analysis and Reporting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04514)
*Hanqing Li,Melania Fedeli,Vinay Kolar,Diego Klabjan*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: BEAR is a framework using LLMs to generate detailed reports on BGP anomalies, improving interpretability and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BGP anomalies threaten network reliability and security, but existing detection methods require expert interpretation. BEAR aims to automate this process.

Method: BEAR uses LLMs to translate BGP data into textual narratives and includes a synthetic data generation framework for training.

Result: BEAR achieves 100% accuracy in evaluations, outperforming baseline methods.

Conclusion: BEAR pioneers automated BGP anomaly explanation, enhancing network management insights.

Abstract: The Internet comprises of interconnected, independently managed Autonomous
Systems (AS) that rely on the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) for inter-domain
routing. BGP anomalies--such as route leaks and hijacks--can divert traffic
through unauthorized or inefficient paths, jeopardizing network reliability and
security. Although existing rule-based and machine learning methods can detect
these anomalies using structured metrics, they still require experts with
in-depth BGP knowledge of, for example, AS relationships and historical
incidents, to interpret events and propose remediation. In this paper, we
introduce BEAR (BGP Event Analysis and Reporting), a novel framework that
leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate comprehensive
reports explaining detected BGP anomaly events. BEAR employs a multi-step
reasoning process that translates tabular BGP data into detailed textual
narratives, enhancing interpretability and analytical precision. To address the
limited availability of publicly documented BGP anomalies, we also present a
synthetic data generation framework powered by LLMs. Evaluations on both real
and synthetic datasets demonstrate that BEAR achieves 100% accuracy,
outperforming Chain-of-Thought and in-context learning baselines. This work
pioneers an automated approach for explaining BGP anomaly events, offering
valuable operational insights for network management.

### [627] [Intelligent Channel Allocation for IEEE 802.11be Multi-Link Operation: When MAB Meets LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04594)
*Shumin Lian,Jingwen Tong,Jun Zhang,Liqun Fu*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper addresses dynamic channel allocation in dense WiFi 7 networks with Multi-Link Operation (MLO), proposing a novel BAI-MCTS algorithm and its enhanced LLM-BAI-MCTS variant, achieving faster convergence rates than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research lacks solutions for dynamic channel allocation in dense WiFi 7 networks with MLO, which is critical for optimizing throughput and latency.

Method: The problem is modeled as a combinatorial optimization using a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework. The BAI-MCTS algorithm and its LLM-enhanced variant are proposed for online learning of optimal channel allocations.

Result: BAI-MCTS converges 50.44% faster than state-of-the-art algorithms, and LLM-BAI-MCTS improves convergence by 63.32% in dense networks.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms effectively address dynamic channel allocation in dense WiFi 7 networks, offering significant performance improvements.

Abstract: WiFi networks have achieved remarkable success in enabling seamless
communication and data exchange worldwide. The IEEE 802.11be standard, known as
WiFi 7, introduces Multi-Link Operation (MLO), a groundbreaking feature that
enables devices to establish multiple simultaneous connections across different
bands and channels. While MLO promises substantial improvements in network
throughput and latency reduction, it presents significant challenges in channel
allocation, particularly in dense network environments. Current research has
predominantly focused on performance analysis and throughput optimization
within static WiFi 7 network configurations. In contrast, this paper addresses
the dynamic channel allocation problem in dense WiFi 7 networks with MLO
capabilities. We formulate this challenge as a combinatorial optimization
problem, leveraging a novel network performance analysis mechanism. Given the
inherent lack of prior network information, we model the problem within a
Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework to enable online learning of optimal channel
allocations. Our proposed Best-Arm Identification-enabled Monte Carlo Tree
Search (BAI-MCTS) algorithm includes rigorous theoretical analysis, providing
upper bounds for both sample complexity and error probability. To further
reduce sample complexity and enhance generalizability across diverse network
scenarios, we put forth LLM-BAI-MCTS, an intelligent algorithm for the dynamic
channel allocation problem by integrating the Large Language Model (LLM) into
the BAI-MCTS algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the BAI-MCTS
algorithm achieves a convergence rate approximately $50.44\%$ faster than the
state-of-the-art algorithms when reaching $98\%$ of the optimal value. Notably,
the convergence rate of the LLM-BAI-MCTS algorithm increases by over $63.32\%$
in dense networks.

*Marcos Lima Romero,Ricardo Suyama*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper highlights the underutilization of data by Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) and introduces NWDAF as a tool for analytics, proposing new use cases to explore its monetization potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MNOs lag behind OTT players in leveraging data, despite its value. NWDAF offers a solution to enhance service opportunities and operational efficiency.

Method: Analysis of trends and gaps in over 70 articles, proposing two novel use cases for NWDAF.

Result: Identifies limitations in current research and suggests unexplored opportunities for NWDAF adoption and monetization.

Conclusion: NWDAF can bridge the gap in data utilization for MNOs, with potential for broader applications and revenue generation.

Abstract: Data has become a critical asset in the digital economy, yet it remains
underutilized by Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), unlike Over-the-Top (OTT)
players that lead global market valuations. To move beyond the commoditization
of connectivity and deliver greater value to customers, data analytics emerges
as a strategic enabler. Using data efficiently is essential for unlocking new
service opportunities, optimizing operational efficiency, and mitigating
operational and business risks. Since Release 15, the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP) has introduced the Network Data Analytics Function
(NWDAF) to provide powerful insights and predictions using data collected
across mobile networks, supporting both user-centric and network-oriented use
cases. However, academic research has largely focused on a limited set of
methods and use cases, driven by the availability of datasets, restricting
broader exploration. This study analyzes trends and gaps in more than 70
articles and proposes two novel use cases to promote the adoption of NWDAF and
explore its potential for monetization.

*Sydney Anuyah*

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: The study analyzes how socioeconomic and demographic factors influence crime victimization types (violent vs. property) using data from 1992-2022. Higher income/education reduces violent crime odds, while men, youth, and minorities face higher risks. Suburban models predict best, while rural crime remains unpredictable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how income, education, employment, and demographics shape crime victimization patterns.

Method: Uses National Crime Victimization Survey data, balanced classification splits, and logistic regression models (Group A: socioeconomic factors; Group B: demographic controls). Evaluated by F1-score.

Result: Higher income/education lowers violent crime odds; men, youth, and minorities face higher risks. Suburban models perform best (accuracy 0.607, F1 0.590); rural crime remains unpredictable.

Conclusion: Targeted interventions (e.g., education in cities, economic support in rural areas, demographic-aware strategies) are needed to address crime disparities.

Abstract: In this short article, I leverage the National Crime Victimization Survey
from 1992 to 2022 to examine how income, education, employment, and key
demographic factors shape the type of crime victims experience (violent vs
property). Using balanced classification splits and logistic regression models
evaluated by F1-score, there is an isolation of the socioeconomic drivers of
victimization "Group A" models and then an introduction of demographic factors
such as age, gender, race, and marital status controls called "Group B" models.
The results consistently proves that higher income and education lower the odds
of violent relative to property crime, while men younger individuals and racial
minorities face disproportionately higher violentcrime risks. On the geographic
spectrum, the suburban models achieve the strongest predictive performance with
an accuracy of 0.607 and F1 of 0.590, urban areas benefit from adding education
and employment predictors and crime in rural areas are still unpredictable
using these current factors. The patterns found in this study shows the need
for specific interventions like educational investments in metropolitan
settings economic support in rural communities and demographicaware prevention
strategies.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: AbBiBench is a benchmarking framework for antibody binding affinity and design, evaluating antibody-antigen complexes using protein model likelihood. It compares 14 models on curated datasets, finding inverse folding models superior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing antibody evaluation methods focus on antibody similarity to natural ones, lacking functional assessment of antibody-antigen binding. AbBiBench addresses this gap.

Method: AbBiBench evaluates antibody designs by measuring protein model likelihood on antibody-antigen complexes, using 9 datasets with 155,853 antibodies. It compares 14 protein models via affinity correlation.

Result: Inverse folding models perform best in affinity correlation and generation tasks. A case study confirms their effectiveness in improving antibody binding affinity.

Conclusion: AbBiBench offers a biologically grounded framework to advance function-aware antibody design models, with inverse folding models leading in performance.

Abstract: We introduce AbBiBench (Antibody Binding Benchmarking), a benchmarking
framework for antibody binding affinity maturation and design. Unlike existing
antibody evaluation strategies that rely on antibody alone and its similarity
to natural ones (e.g., amino acid identity rate, structural RMSD), AbBiBench
considers an antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) complex as a functional unit and
evaluates the potential of an antibody design binding to given antigen by
measuring protein model's likelihood on the Ab-Ag complex. We first curate,
standardize, and share 9 datasets containing 9 antigens (involving influenza,
anti-lysozyme, HER2, VEGF, integrin, and SARS-CoV-2) and 155,853 heavy chain
mutated antibodies. Using these datasets, we systematically compare 14 protein
models including masked language models, autoregressive language models,
inverse folding models, diffusion-based generative models, and geometric graph
models. The correlation between model likelihood and experimental affinity
values is used to evaluate model performance. Additionally, in a case study to
increase binding affinity of antibody F045-092 to antigen influenza H1N1, we
evaluate the generative power of the top-performing models by sampling a set of
new antibodies binding to the antigen and ranking them based on structural
integrity and biophysical properties of the Ab-Ag complex. As a result,
structure-conditioned inverse folding models outperform others in both affinity
correlation and generation tasks. Overall, AbBiBench provides a unified,
biologically grounded evaluation framework to facilitate the development of
more effective, function-aware antibody design models.

*Salil Patel*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Latent Space Hypothesis to unify diverse medical data into a shared geometric representation, enabling personalized diagnosis and treatment by modeling health as trajectories in this space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of interpreting heterogeneous medical data (genomic, imaging, lab results, narratives) by unifying them into a single, interpretable framework for better clinical decision-making.

Method: The Latent Space Hypothesis models medical observations as projections of a unified manifold, representing health as points, disease progression as trajectories, and interventions as vectors.

Result: The framework enables personalized diagnosis, longitudinal monitoring, and tailored treatment by revealing patient-specific trajectories and sub-trajectories.

Conclusion: While challenges like bias and data scarcity persist, the approach offers a promising shift from label-based grouping to individualized care, with potential solutions like continual learning and perturbation-based validation.

Abstract: Medical data range from genomic sequences and retinal photographs to
structured laboratory results and unstructured clinical narratives. Although
these modalities appear disparate, many encode convergent information about a
single underlying physiological state. The Latent Space Hypothesis frames each
observation as a projection of a unified, hierarchically organized manifold --
much like shadows cast by the same three-dimensional object. Within this
learned geometric representation, an individual's health status occupies a
point, disease progression traces a trajectory, and therapeutic intervention
corresponds to a directed vector. Interpreting heterogeneous evidence in a
shared space provides a principled way to re-examine eponymous conditions --
such as Parkinson's or Crohn's -- that often mask multiple pathophysiological
entities and involve broader anatomical domains than once believed. By
revealing sub-trajectories and patient-specific directions of change, the
framework supplies a quantitative rationale for personalised diagnosis,
longitudinal monitoring, and tailored treatment, moving clinical practice away
from grouping by potentially misleading labels toward navigation of each
person's unique trajectory. Challenges remain -- bias amplification, data
scarcity for rare disorders, privacy, and the correlation-causation divide --
but scale-aware encoders, continual learning on longitudinal data streams, and
perturbation-based validation offer plausible paths forward.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether existing NLP instruments effectively meet the needs of practitioners evaluating LLM-based systems for representational harms.

Method: Conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 practitioners to evaluate the usability and alignment of available instruments.

Result: Practitioners often cannot use these instruments due to misalignment with their needs or practical/institutional barriers.

Conclusion: Recommendations are provided to better align instruments with practitioner needs, drawing on measurement theory and pragmatic measurement.

Abstract: The NLP research community has made publicly available numerous instruments

TL;DR: Agentic AI systems intensify public sector oversight challenges, requiring five governance dimensions. Existing structures struggle with continuous oversight, integration, and coordination; solutions are proposed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address how agentic AI systems exacerbate traditional public sector oversight challenges and identify governance needs.

Method: Mixed-methods approach: literature review and interviews with civil servants in AI-related roles.

Result: Agent oversight intensifies three governance challenges: continuous oversight, governance-operational integration, and interdepartmental coordination.

Conclusion: Proposes adapting institutional structures and designing oversight compatible with public sector constraints.

Abstract: This paper finds that the introduction of agentic AI systems intensifies
existing challenges to traditional public sector oversight mechanisms -- which
rely on siloed compliance units and episodic approvals rather than continuous,
integrated supervision. We identify five governance dimensions essential for
responsible agent deployment: cross-departmental implementation, comprehensive
evaluation, enhanced security protocols, operational visibility, and systematic
auditing. We evaluate the capacity of existing oversight structures to meet
these challenges, via a mixed-methods approach consisting of a literature
review and interviews with civil servants in AI-related roles. We find that
agent oversight poses intensified versions of three existing governance
challenges: continuous oversight, deeper integration of governance and
operational capabilities, and interdepartmental coordination. We propose
approaches that both adapt institutional structures and design agent oversight
compatible with public sector constraints.

TL;DR: The paper argues against granting First Amendment protections to AI model outputs, stating they lack intentionality and don't qualify as speech, and that doing so would harm societal interests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that AI-generated outputs deserve free speech protections, highlighting potential societal risks.

Method: Legal analysis and argumentation based on the absence of intentionality in AI outputs and the purposes of free speech.

Result: AI outputs should not be protected as speech, and users cannot claim First Amendment rights to receive them.

Conclusion: Extending First Amendment protections to AI models is unnecessary and harmful, as it could impede regulation and enable misinformation.

Abstract: This paper challenges the assumption that courts should grant First Amendment
protections to outputs from large generative AI models, such as GPT-4 and
Gemini. We argue that because these models lack intentionality, their outputs
do not constitute speech as understood in the context of established legal
precedent, so there can be no speech to protect. Furthermore, if the model
outputs are not speech, users cannot claim a First Amendment speech right to
receive the outputs. We also argue that extending First Amendment rights to AI
models would not serve the fundamental purposes of free speech, such as
promoting a marketplace of ideas, facilitating self-governance, or fostering
self-expression. In fact, granting First Amendment protections to AI models
would be detrimental to society because it would hinder the government's
ability to regulate these powerful technologies effectively, potentially
leading to the unchecked spread of misinformation and other harms.

*Michael Hartisch,Leroy Chew*

Main category: cs.DM

TL;DR: The paper introduces an expansion-based approach for Quantified Integer Programming (QIP) using CEGAR, outperforming search-based solvers in certain cases and showing advantages over QBF solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend QBF techniques to QIP for solving multistage robust optimization problems with uncertainty.

Method: An expansion-based approach using CEGAR, adapted from QBF, applied to QIP and embedded in an optimization framework.

Result: Superior performance over search-based QIP solvers and notable gains over QBF solvers in specific instances.

Conclusion: The expansion-based approach enhances QIP's applicability, offering a powerful tool for complex optimization under uncertainty.

Abstract: Quantified Integer Programming (QIP) bridges multiple domains by extending
Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF) to incorporate general integer variables and
linear constraints while also generalizing Integer Programming through variable
quantification. As a special case of Quantified Constraint Satisfaction
Problems (QCSP), QIP provides a versatile framework for addressing complex
decision-making scenarios. Additionally, the inclusion of a linear objective
function enables QIP to effectively model multistage robust discrete linear
optimization problems, making it a powerful tool for tackling uncertainty in
optimization.
  While two primary solution paradigms exist for QBF -- search-based and
expansion-based approaches -- only search-based methods have been explored for
QIP and QCSP. We introduce an expansion-based approach for QIP using
Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR), adapting techniques from
QBF. We extend this methodology to tackle multistage robust discrete
optimization problems with linear constraints and further embed it in an
optimization framework, enhancing its applicability. Our experimental results

### [637] [TQml Simulator: Optimized Simulation of Quantum Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04891)
*Viacheslav Kuzmin,Basil Kyriacou,Mateusz Papierz,Mo Kordzanganeh,Alexey Melnikov*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks simulation techniques for quantum machine learning circuits, introducing TQml Simulator, which outperforms Pennylane's default.qubit by 2- to 100-fold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accelerate quantum machine learning research by improving the simulation of gate layers in quantum circuits.

Method: Benchmarked universal and gate-specific simulation techniques, then developed TQml Simulator to dynamically select the most efficient method per layer.

Result: TQml Simulator showed 2- to 100-fold performance gains over Pennylane's default.qubit, depending on circuit specifics.

Conclusion: Tailored simulation methods per gate layer significantly enhance quantum circuit simulation efficiency, benefiting quantum machine learning.

Abstract: Hardware-efficient circuits employed in Quantum Machine Learning are
typically composed of alternating layers of uniformly applied gates. High-speed
numerical simulators for such circuits are crucial for advancing research in
this field. In this work, we numerically benchmark universal and gate-specific
techniques for simulating the action of layers of gates on quantum state
vectors, aiming to accelerate the overall simulation of Quantum Machine
Learning algorithms. Our analysis shows that the optimal simulation method for
a given layer of gates depends on the number of qubits involved, and that a
tailored combination of techniques can yield substantial performance gains in
the forward and backward passes for a given circuit. Building on these
insights, we developed a numerical simulator, named TQml Simulator, that
employs the most efficient simulation method for each layer in a given circuit.
We evaluated TQml Simulator on circuits constructed from standard gate sets,
such as rotations and CNOTs, as well as on native gates from IonQ and IBM
quantum processing units. In most cases, our simulator outperforms equivalent
Pennylane's default.qubit simulator by approximately 2- to 100-fold, depending
on the circuit, the number of qubits, the batch size of the input data, and the
hardware used.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A diffusion-based framework for Anime-style facial sketch colorization, using SSIMBaD for balanced and faithful reconstructions, outperforming state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To preserve structural fidelity and transfer stylistic attributes from reference images, addressing perceptual inconsistency in traditional noise schedules.

Method: Uses continuous-time diffusion models with SSIMBaD, a sigma-space transformation aligning perceptual degradation linearly for uniform visual difficulty.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art models in pixel accuracy and perceptual quality, generalizing to diverse styles.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances reconstruction quality and style transfer, validated by superior performance on Anime face datasets.

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for automatic colorization of
Anime-style facial sketches. Our method preserves the structural fidelity of
the input sketch while effectively transferring stylistic attributes from a
reference image. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on predefined noise
schedules - which often compromise perceptual consistency -- our framework
builds on continuous-time diffusion models and introduces SSIMBaD (Sigma
Scaling with SSIM-Guided Balanced Diffusion). SSIMBaD applies a sigma-space
transformation that aligns perceptual degradation, as measured by structural
similarity (SSIM), in a linear manner. This scaling ensures uniform visual
difficulty across timesteps, enabling more balanced and faithful
reconstructions. Experiments on a large-scale Anime face dataset demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both pixel accuracy and
perceptual quality, while generalizing to diverse styles. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mesh deformation methods suffer from low quality, manual tuning, or data-intensive training.

Method: Leverages VLM for handle selection and deformation via prompt engineering, multi-view voting for uncertainty reduction.

Result: Produces deformations aligning with user intent (measured by CLIP and GPTEval3D) with low distortion.

Conclusion: Training-free, automated, and high-quality mesh deformation method.

Abstract: Mesh deformation is a fundamental tool in 3D content manipulation. Despite
extensive prior research, existing approaches often suffer from low output
quality, require significant manual tuning, or depend on data-intensive
training. To address these limitations, we introduce a training-free,
handle-based mesh deformation method. % Our core idea is to leverage a
Vision-Language Model (VLM) to interpret and manipulate a handle-based
interface through prompt engineering. We begin by applying cone singularity
detection to identify a sparse set of potential handles. The VLM is then
prompted to select both the deformable sub-parts of the mesh and the handles
that best align with user instructions. Subsequently, we query the desired
deformed positions of the selected handles in screen space. To reduce
uncertainty inherent in VLM predictions, we aggregate the results from multiple
camera views using a novel multi-view voting scheme. % Across a suite of
benchmarks, our method produces deformations that align more closely with user
intent, as measured by CLIP and GPTEval3D scores, while introducing low
distortion -- quantified via membrane energy. In summary, our approach is
training-free, highly automated, and consistently delivers high-quality mesh
deformations.

*Wuyang Li,Zhu Yu,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: VoxDet reformulates 3D semantic occupancy prediction as dense object detection, using voxel-to-instance conversion and task-decoupled predictors to achieve state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior works treat 3D semantic occupancy as dense segmentation, ignoring instance-level discriminability, leading to incompleteness and ambiguities. VoxDet leverages implicit instance-level insights from voxel labels.

Method: Introduces Voxel-to-Instance (VoxNT) trick for free label conversion, then VoxDet framework with spatially-decoupled voxel encoder and task-decoupled dense predictor for offset regression and semantic prediction.

Result: Achieves 63.0 IoU on SemanticKITTI, ranking 1st on the leaderboard, and works efficiently with both camera and LiDAR inputs.

Conclusion: VoxDet advances 3D semantic occupancy prediction by emphasizing instance-centric approaches, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction aims to reconstruct the 3D geometry and
semantics of the surrounding environment. With dense voxel labels, prior works
typically formulate it as a dense segmentation task, independently classifying
each voxel. However, this paradigm neglects critical instance-centric
discriminability, leading to instance-level incompleteness and adjacent
ambiguities. To address this, we highlight a free lunch of occupancy labels:
the voxel-level class label implicitly provides insight at the instance level,
which is overlooked by the community. Motivated by this observation, we first
introduce a training-free Voxel-to-Instance (VoxNT) trick: a simple yet
effective method that freely converts voxel-level class labels into
instance-level offset labels. Building on this, we further propose VoxDet, an
instance-centric framework that reformulates the voxel-level occupancy
prediction as dense object detection by decoupling it into two sub-tasks:
offset regression and semantic prediction. Specifically, based on the lifted 3D
volume, VoxDet first uses (a) Spatially-decoupled Voxel Encoder to generate
disentangled feature volumes for the two sub-tasks, which learn task-specific
spatial deformation in the densely projected tri-perceptive space. Then, we
deploy (b) Task-decoupled Dense Predictor to address this task via dense
detection. Here, we first regress a 4D offset field to estimate distances (6
directions) between voxels and object borders in the voxel space. The regressed
offsets are then used to guide the instance-level aggregation in the
classification branch, achieving instance-aware prediction. Experiments show
that VoxDet can be deployed on both camera and LiDAR input, jointly achieving
state-of-the-art results on both benchmarks. VoxDet is not only highly
efficient, but also achieves 63.0 IoU on the SemanticKITTI test set, ranking
1st on the online leaderboard.

TL;DR: A fast, unsupervised method for polygonal approximation of closed digital curves, outperforming state-of-the-art in speed and matching in quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the speed and aesthetic quality of polygonal approximations for closed digital curves while maintaining robustness.

Method: Three-phase scheme: initial segmentation (detects high-curvature vertices), iterative vertex insertion (adds low-curvature vertices), and iterative merging (removes redundant vertices), followed by vertex adjustment.

Result: Faster than state-of-the-art methods, competitive in Rosin's measure and aesthetic quality, and robust to geometric transformations.

Conclusion: The proposed scheme is efficient, high-quality, and robust, making it suitable for practical applications.

Abstract: This paper proposes a fast and unsupervised scheme for a polygonal
approximation of a closed digital curve. It is demonstrated that the
approximation scheme is faster than state-of-the-art approximation and is
competitive with the same in Rosin's measure and in its aesthetic aspect. The
scheme comprises of three phases: initial segmentation, iterative vertex
insertion, and iterative merging, followed by vertex adjustment. The initial
segmentation is used to detect sharp turnings - the vertices that seemingly
have high curvature. It is likely that some of important vertices with low
curvature might have been missed out at the first phase and so iterative vertex
insertion is used to add vertices in a region where the curvature changes
slowly but steadily. The initial phase may pick up some undesirable vertices
and so merging is used to eliminate the redundant vertices. Finally, vertex
adjustment is used to facilitate enhancement in the aesthetic look of the
approximation. The quality of the approximations is measured using Rosin's
measure. The robustness of the proposed scheme with respect to geometric
transformation is observed.

TL;DR: The paper critiques AI's limited impact in medicine due to a technology-centric approach and proposes a sociotechnical framework to better align AI tools with clinical practice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The translational gap in AI's application to medicine, caused by incompatibility with clinical reasoning, motivates the need for a new approach.

Method: The authors propose a sociotechnical conceptualization of AI tools, focusing on complementing doctors' cognitive and epistemic activities rather than outperforming benchmarks.

Result: The framework prioritizes real-world impact over achieving superhuman performance on irrelevant benchmarks.

Conclusion: A shift from technology-centric to sociotechnical AI tools is needed to bridge the translational gap in medicine.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence promises to revolutionise medicine, yet its impact
remains limited because of the pervasive translational gap. We posit that the
prevailing technology-centric approaches underpin this challenge, rendering
such systems fundamentally incompatible with clinical practice, specifically
diagnostic reasoning and decision making. Instead, we propose a novel
sociotechnical conceptualisation of data-driven support tools designed to
complement doctors' cognitive and epistemic activities. Crucially, it

TL;DR: The paper proposes AI-augmented frameworks for team optimization, focusing on formation, feedback, and simulation to enhance satisfaction, engagement, and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tools for team optimization lack adaptability to dynamic team dynamics, personalities, and evolving goals, leading to dissatisfaction and suboptimal performance.

Method: A multi-armed bandit algorithm for team formation, an AI feedback assistant (tAIfa) using LLMs, and PuppeteerLLM for simulating team dynamics.

Result: Improved team satisfaction, cohesion, and performance through iterative refinement and personalized feedback.

Conclusion: AI-driven approaches can effectively address dynamic team challenges, enhancing both individual and collective outcomes.

Abstract: Effective teamwork is essential across diverse domains. During the team
formation stage, a key challenge is forming teams that effectively balance user
preferences with task objectives to enhance overall team satisfaction. In the
team performing stage, maintaining cohesion and engagement is critical for
sustaining high team performance. However, existing computational tools and
algorithms for team optimization often rely on static data inputs, narrow
algorithmic objectives, or solutions tailored for specific contexts, failing to
account for the dynamic interplay of team members personalities, evolving
goals, and changing individual preferences. Therefore, teams may encounter
member dissatisfaction, as purely algorithmic assignments can reduce members
commitment to team goals or experience suboptimal engagement due to the absence
of timely, personalized guidance to help members adjust their behaviors and
interactions as team dynamics evolve. Ultimately, these challenges can lead to
reduced overall team performance. My Ph.D. dissertation aims to develop
AI-augmented team optimization frameworks and practical systems that enhance
team satisfaction, engagement, and performance. First, I propose a team
formation framework that leverages a multi-armed bandit algorithm to
iteratively refine team composition based on user preferences, ensuring
alignment between individual needs and collective team goals to enhance team
satisfaction. Second, I introduce tAIfa (Team AI Feedback Assistant), an
AI-powered system that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to deliver
immediate, personalized feedback to both teams and individual members,
enhancing cohesion and engagement. Finally, I present PuppeteerLLM, an
LLM-based simulation framework that simulates multi-agent teams to model
complex team dynamics within realistic environments, incorporating task-driven
collaboration and long-term coordination.

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: A diffusion transformer-based denoising framework was developed to enhance fast, accurate dose calculation in IMPT for H&N cancer, showing generalization across multiple disease sites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IMPT's sensitivity to anatomical changes requires frequent adaptation via oART, but fast MC dose calculation is hindered by accuracy degradation with reduced particle counts.

Method: A diffusion transformer model was trained on noisy and high-statistics MC dose maps from H&N patients, using combined loss functions (MSE, residual loss, regional MAE). Testing included multiple cancer sites.

Result: The model achieved low MAEs (0.120-0.376 Gy[RBE]), high 3D Gamma passing rates (>92%), and accurate DVH indices for CTVs and OARs.

Conclusion: The framework generalizes well beyond H&N, enabling fast, high-quality dose generation for IMPT across various cancer sites.

Abstract: Purpose: Intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) offers precise tumor
coverage while sparing organs at risk (OARs) in head and neck (H&N) cancer.
However, its sensitivity to anatomical changes requires frequent adaptation
through online adaptive radiation therapy (oART), which depends on fast,
accurate dose calculation via Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Reducing particle
count accelerates MC but degrades accuracy. To address this, denoising
low-statistics MC dose maps is proposed to enable fast, high-quality dose
generation.
  Methods: We developed a diffusion transformer-based denoising framework. IMPT
plans and 3D CT images from 80 H&N patients were used to generate noisy and
high-statistics dose maps using MCsquare (1 min and 10 min per plan,
respectively). Data were standardized into uniform chunks with zero-padding,
normalized, and transformed into quasi-Gaussian distributions. Testing was done
on 10 H&N, 10 lung, 10 breast, and 10 prostate cancer cases, preprocessed
identically. The model was trained with noisy dose maps and CT images as input
and high-statistics dose maps as ground truth, using a combined loss of mean
square error (MSE), residual loss, and regional MAE (focusing on top/bottom 10%
dose voxels). Performance was assessed via MAE, 3D Gamma passing rate, and DVH
indices.
  Results: The model achieved MAEs of 0.195 (H&N), 0.120 (lung), 0.172
(breast), and 0.376 Gy[RBE] (prostate). 3D Gamma passing rates exceeded 92%
(3%/2mm) across all sites. DVH indices for clinical target volumes (CTVs) and
OARs closely matched the ground truth.
  Conclusion: A diffusion transformer-based denoising framework was developed
and, though trained only on H&N data, generalizes well across multiple disease
sites.

TL;DR: FlashDMoE is a GPU-resident MoE operator that improves efficiency by fusing computation and communication into a single kernel, achieving significant performance gains over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MoE implementations suffer from low GPU utilization, high latency, and inefficiencies due to CPU-managed scheduling and frequent kernel launches.

Method: FlashDMoE integrates expert computation and inter-GPU communication into a single persistent GPU kernel, enabling fine-grained pipelining and device-initiated communication.

Result: FlashDMoE achieves up to 6x lower latency, 5.7x higher throughput, 4x better weak scaling efficiency, and 9x higher GPU utilization compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Principled GPU kernel-hardware co-design is essential for optimizing large-scale distributed ML workloads, as demonstrated by FlashDMoE.

Abstract: The computational sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enables
sub-linear growth in compute cost as model size increases, offering a scalable
path to training massive neural networks. However, existing implementations
suffer from \emph{low GPU utilization}, \emph{significant latency overhead},
and a fundamental \emph{inability to leverage task locality}, primarily due to
CPU-managed scheduling, host-initiated communication, and frequent kernel
launches. To overcome these limitations, we develop FlashDMoE, a fully
GPU-resident MoE operator that fuses expert computation and inter-GPU
communication into a \emph{single persistent GPU kernel}. FlashDMoE enables
fine-grained pipelining of dispatch, compute, and combine phases, eliminating
launch overheads and reducing idle gaps. Its device-initiated communication
protocol introduces \emph{payload-efficient} data transfers, significantly
shrinking buffer sizes in sparsely activated MoE layers. When evaluated on a
single 8-H100 GPU node with MoE models having up to 128 experts and 16K token
sequences, FlashDMoE achieves up to \textbf{6}x lower latency, \textbf{5,7}x
higher throughput, \textbf{4}x better weak scaling efficiency, and \textbf{9}x
higher GPU utilization compared to state-of-the-art baselines, despite using
FP32 while baselines use FP16. FlashDMoE demonstrates that principled GPU
kernel-hardware co-design is key to unlocking the performance ceiling of
large-scale distributed ML workloads.

private data on-device. To simultaneously enhance privacy and training
efficiency, recently parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of large-scale
pretrained models has gained substantial attention in FL. While keeping a
pretrained (backbone) model frozen, each user fine-tunes only a few lightweight
modules to be used in conjunction, to fit specific downstream applications.
Accordingly, only the gradients with respect to these lightweight modules are
shared with the server. In this work, we investigate how the privacy of the
fine-tuning data of the users can be compromised via a malicious design of the
pretrained model and trainable adapter modules. We demonstrate gradient
inversion attacks on a popular PEFT mechanism, the adapter, which allow an
attacker to reconstruct local data samples of a target user, using only the
accessible adapter gradients. Via extensive experiments, we demonstrate that a
large batch of fine-tuning images can be retrieved with high fidelity. Our
attack highlights the need for privacy-preserving mechanisms for PEFT, while
opening up several future directions. Our code is available at

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A lightweight deep learning method integrates Retinex decomposition and Poisson denoising for low-light image enhancement, improving visibility without color distortion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional noise assumptions like Gaussian noise fail in low-light conditions where Poisson noise is more accurate. Addressing this gap is crucial for real-world applications.

Method: The proposed method combines Retinex-based decomposition with Poisson denoising in an encoder-decoder network, using a Poisson denoising loss for signal-dependent noise.

Result: The method enhances visibility and brightness in low-light conditions while preserving image structure and color constancy.

Conclusion: The approach effectively denoises and enhances low-light images, proving practical for real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Low-light image denoising and enhancement are challenging, especially when
traditional noise assumptions, such as Gaussian noise, do not hold in majority.
In many real-world scenarios, such as low-light imaging, noise is
signal-dependent and is better represented as Poisson noise. In this work, we
address the problem of denoising images degraded by Poisson noise under extreme
low-light conditions. We introduce a light-weight deep learning-based method
that integrates Retinex based decomposition with Poisson denoising into a
unified encoder-decoder network. The model simultaneously enhances illumination
and suppresses noise by incorporating a Poisson denoising loss to address
signal-dependent noise. Without prior requirement for reflectance and
illumination, the network learns an effective decomposition process while
ensuring consistent reflectance and smooth illumination without causing any
form of color distortion. The experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and practicality of the proposed low-light illumination
enhancement method. Our method significantly improves visibility and brightness
in low-light conditions, while preserving image structure and color constancy
under ambient illumination.

TL;DR: DACN, a dual-attention CNN, improves hyperspectral image super-resolution by combining multi-head attention and channel attention, outperforming single-attention methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2D CNNs lack global contextual understanding and suffer from band correlation and data scarcity in hyperspectral image super-resolution.

Method: DACN uses augmented convolutions with multi-head attention for local-global feature capture, channel-spatial attention maps, and a custom loss function with L2 and spatial-spectral gradient loss.

Result: Experiments show DACN outperforms single-attention methods on two hyperspectral datasets.

Conclusion: DACN effectively addresses limitations of 2D CNNs by integrating dual attention and optimized loss, enhancing super-resolution performance.

Abstract: 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have attracted significant attention
for hyperspectral image super-resolution tasks. However, a key limitation is
their reliance on local neighborhoods, which leads to a lack of global
contextual understanding. Moreover, band correlation and data scarcity continue
to limit their performance. To mitigate these issues, we introduce DACN, a
dual-attention convolutional network for hyperspectral image super-resolution.
Specifically, the model first employs augmented convolutions, integrating
multi-head attention to effectively capture both local and global feature
dependencies. Next, we infer separate attention maps for the channel and
spatial dimensions to determine where to focus across different channels and
spatial positions. Furthermore, a custom optimized loss function is proposed
that combines L2 regularization with spatial-spectral gradient loss to ensure
accurate spectral fidelity. Experimental results on two hyperspectral datasets
demonstrate that the combination of multi-head attention and channel attention
outperforms either attention mechanism used individually.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: PixCell is a diffusion-based generative model for histopathology, trained on a large dataset (PanCan-30M) without annotations. It generates high-quality synthetic images for tasks like data augmentation, privacy-preserving sharing, and virtual staining, improving downstream performance and enabling molecular marker inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in pathology like annotated data scarcity, privacy concerns, and generative tasks (e.g., virtual staining), leveraging generative models for synthetic data creation.

Method: PixCell uses a progressive training strategy and self-supervision-based conditioning on PanCan-30M (69,184 H&E-stained slides). It generates diverse, high-quality images and allows precise control with minimal annotations.

Result: PixCell produces synthetic images usable for training discriminative models, targeted data augmentation (improving segmentation tasks), and inferring molecular markers (e.g., IHC staining from H&E).

Conclusion: PixCell is a versatile foundation model for computational pathology, enabling synthetic data applications while reducing regulatory barriers. The model is publicly released to foster research.

Abstract: The digitization of histology slides has revolutionized pathology, providing
massive datasets for cancer diagnosis and research. Contrastive self-supervised
and vision-language models have been shown to effectively mine large pathology
datasets to learn discriminative representations. On the other hand, generative
models, capable of synthesizing realistic and diverse images, present a
compelling solution to address unique problems in pathology that involve
synthesizing images; overcoming annotated data scarcity, enabling
privacy-preserving data sharing, and performing inherently generative tasks,
such as virtual staining. We introduce PixCell, the first diffusion-based
generative foundation model for histopathology. We train PixCell on PanCan-30M,
a vast, diverse dataset derived from 69,184 H\&E-stained whole slide images
covering various cancer types. We employ a progressive training strategy and a
self-supervision-based conditioning that allows us to scale up training without
any annotated data. PixCell generates diverse and high-quality images across
multiple cancer types, which we find can be used in place of real data to train
a self-supervised discriminative model. Synthetic images shared between
institutions are subject to fewer regulatory barriers than would be the case
with real clinical images. Furthermore, we showcase the ability to precisely
control image generation using a small set of annotated images, which can be
used for both data augmentation and educational purposes. Testing on a cell
segmentation task, a mask-guided PixCell enables targeted data augmentation,
improving downstream performance. Finally, we demonstrate PixCell's ability to
use H\&E structural staining to infer results from molecular marker studies; we
use this capability to infer IHC staining from H\&E images. Our trained models
are publicly released to accelerate research in computational pathology.

Motivation: Existing State Space Models (SSMs) for medical image segmentation struggle with encoder-decoder incompatibility, compromising spatial structures and state propagation.

Method: DM-SegNet features a quadri-directional spatial Mamba module, gated spatial convolution, and Mamba-driven decoding for bidirectional state synchronization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art DSC of 85.44% on Synapse and 90.22% on BraTS2023 datasets.

Conclusion: DM-SegNet effectively reconciles global context modeling with spatial topology preservation, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Accurate 3D medical image segmentation demands architectures capable of
reconciling global context modeling with spatial topology preservation. While
State Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba show potential for sequence modeling,
existing medical SSMs suffer from encoder-decoder incompatibility: the
encoder's 1D sequence flattening compromises spatial structures, while
conventional decoders fail to leverage Mamba's state propagation. We present
DM-SegNet, a Dual-Mamba architecture integrating directional state transitions
with anatomy-aware hierarchical decoding. The core innovations include a
quadri-directional spatial Mamba module employing four-directional 3D scanning
to maintain anatomical spatial coherence, a gated spatial convolution layer
that enhances spatially sensitive feature representation prior to state
modeling, and a Mamba-driven decoding framework enabling bidirectional state
synchronization across scales. Extensive evaluation on two clinically
significant benchmarks demonstrates the efficacy of DM-SegNet: achieving
state-of-the-art Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 85.44% on the Synapse
dataset for abdominal organ segmentation and 90.22% on the BraTS2023 dataset
for brain tumor segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge optical physics and generative AI by leveraging natural self-organization principles from nonlinear optical equations.

Method: Analyzes six optical equations (linear and nonlinear), comparing their performance in generative models. Nonlinear models include Kerr effects, cubic-quintic nonlinearities, and intensity-dependent refractive indices.

Result: Nonlinear models achieve significant improvements: 40-60% parameter reduction, 20-40% better coverage, and superior FID scores (e.g., 0.0089 vs. 1.0909 for linear models). Memory and training efficiency also improve.

Conclusion: The framework advances both AI and optical physics, revealing deep connections between physical self-organization and AI, with potential for efficient optical computing.

Abstract: This paper establishes a comprehensive mathematical framework connecting
optical physics equations to generative models, demonstrating how light
propagation dynamics inspire powerful artificial intelligence approaches. We
analyze six fundamental optical equations, comparing linear models (Helmholtz,
dissipative wave, and Eikonal equations) with their nonlinear extensions
incorporating Kerr effects, cubic-quintic nonlinearities, and
intensity-dependent refractive indices. Our nonlinear optical models reveal
remarkable capabilities through natural self-organization principles. The
nonlinear Helmholtz model achieves 40-60% parameter reduction while maintaining
superior mode separation via self-focusing phenomena. The cubic-quintic
dissipative wave model prevents mode collapse through balanced
attractive-repulsive interactions, enabling stable soliton formation with
20-40% improved coverage. The intensity-dependent Eikonal model creates
adaptive pathways that dynamically respond to content, providing enhanced
controllability in conditional generation. Experimental validation demonstrates
consistent superiority over linear predecessors and traditional generative
approaches. The nonlinear Helmholtz model achieves FID scores of 0.0089 versus
1.0909 for linear versions, while the cubic-quintic model reaches 0.0156 FID
with exceptional stability. Memory usage drops 40-60% and training time
improves 30-50% due to inherent nonlinear stability properties. The framework
enables bidirectional benefits, advancing both generative AI and optical
physics through novel approaches to soliton analysis, wavefront control, and
refractive index reconstruction with 95% accuracy. This work reveals deep
connections between physical self-organization and artificial intelligence,

Motivation: To address the parameter identification problem in soil properties, specifically diffusivity (D) and hydraulic conductivity (K), from water moisture measurements.

Method: Simulated data generated via the Fokas method for vertical infiltration in a homogeneous soil profile. Various machine learning models (SVMs, NNs) were tested under full, noisy, and limited data conditions.

Result: Diffusivity (D) predictions were more accurate than hydraulic conductivity (K). SVMs and NNs performed best, achieving near-perfect accuracy and minimal errors.

Conclusion: SVMs and NNs are robust for estimating soil properties from water moisture data, with D being easier to predict than K.

Abstract: This work focuses on estimating soil properties from water moisture
measurements. We consider simulated data generated by solving the
initial-boundary value problem governing vertical infiltration in a
homogeneous, bounded soil profile, with the usage of the Fokas method. To
address the parameter identification problem, which is formulated as a
two-output regression task, we explore various machine learning models. The
performance of each model is assessed under different data conditions: full,
noisy, and limited. Overall, the prediction of diffusivity $D$ tends to be more
accurate than that of hydraulic conductivity $K.$ Among the models considered,
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Neural Networks (NNs) demonstrate the
highest robustness, achieving near-perfect accuracy and minimal errors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of publicly available Verilog code compared to software languages like Python limits LLM performance in hardware code generation.

Method: hdl2v translates three hardware description languages (VHDL, Chisel, PyMTL3) to Verilog, creating a larger dataset for training.

Result: hdl2v improves a 32B-parameter model's performance by up to 23% in VerilogEvalV2 and boosts a data augmentation-based approach by 63%.

Conclusion: hdl2v effectively enhances LLM Verilog generation, and future work can expand on dataset characteristics for further improvements.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are playing an increasingly large role in
domains such as code generation, including hardware code generation, where
Verilog is the key language. However, the amount of publicly available Verilog
code pales in comparison to the amount of code available for software languages
like Python. In this work, we present hdl2v ("HDL-to-Verilog"), a dataset which
seeks to increase the amount of available human-written Verilog data by
translating or compiling three other hardware description languages - VHDL,
Chisel, and PyMTL3 - to Verilog. Furthermore, we demonstrate the value of hdl2v
in enhancing LLM Verilog generation by improving performance of a 32
billion-parameter open-weight model by up to 23% (pass@10) in VerilogEvalV2,
without utilizing any data augmentation or knowledge distillation from larger
models. We also show hdl2v's ability to boost the performance of a data
augmentation-based fine-tuning approach by 63%. Finally, we characterize and
analyze our dataset to better understand which characteristics of
HDL-to-Verilog datasets can be expanded upon in future work for even better

Conclusion: QiMeng provides a feasible solution for automated chip design, with future work focusing on full system integration and iterative refinement.

Abstract: Processor chip design technology serves as a key frontier driving

advancement of information technology, conventional design paradigms face three
major challenges: the physical constraints of fabrication technologies, the

design.
  In this paper, we propose QiMeng, a novel system for fully automated hardware
and software design of processor chips. QiMeng comprises three hierarchical
layers. In the bottom-layer, we construct a domain-specific Large Processor
Chip Model (LPCM) that introduces novel designs in architecture, training, and
inference, to address key challenges such as knowledge representation gap, data
scarcity, correctness assurance, and enormous solution space. In the
middle-layer, leveraging the LPCM's knowledge representation and inference
capabilities, we develop the Hardware Design Agent and the Software Design
Agent to automate the design of hardware and software for processor chips.
Currently, several components of QiMeng have been completed and successfully
applied in various top-layer applications, demonstrating significant advantages
and providing a feasible solution for efficient, fully automated
hardware/software design of processor chips. Future research will focus on
integrating all components and performing iterative top-down and bottom-up
design processes to establish a comprehensive QiMeng system.

### [666] [The GAIN Model: A Nature-Inspired Neural Network Framework Based on an Adaptation of the Izhikevich Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04247)
*Gage K. R. Hooper*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The GAIN model uses a grid-based structure for biologically plausible neural interactions, combining the Izhikevich model for computational efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve biological plausibility and dynamics in neural networks by mimicking neuron interactions.

Method: Grid-based structure with the Izhikevich model for efficient and accurate simulations.

Result: Enhanced dynamics and accuracy, suitable for specialized neural network applications.

Conclusion: The GAIN model offers a biologically accurate and computationally efficient approach for neural simulations.

Abstract: While many neural networks focus on layers to process information, the GAIN
model uses a grid-based structure to improve biological plausibility and the
dynamics of the model. The grid structure helps neurons to interact with their
closest neighbors and improve their connections with one another, which is seen
in biological neurons. While also being implemented with the Izhikevich model
this approach allows for a computationally efficient and biologically accurate
simulation that can aid in the development of neural networks, large scale
simulations, and the development in the neuroscience field. This adaptation of
the Izhikevich model can improve the dynamics and accuracy of the model,
allowing for its uses to be specialized but efficient.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: POSSM is a hybrid architecture combining spike tokenization and a recurrent state-space model for real-time neural decoding, offering fast, accurate, and generalizable performance with lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between generalization (Transformers) and speed (traditional methods) in real-time neural decoding for neuroscience and neurotechnology.

Method: POSSM uses cross-attention for spike tokenization and a recurrent SSM backbone, enabling causal online prediction and multi-dataset pretraining.

Result: POSSM matches Transformer accuracy in decoding tasks (monkey motor, human handwriting, speech) but is up to 9x faster on GPU.

Conclusion: Hybrid SSMs like POSSM bridge accuracy, speed, and generalization, making them promising for real-time neural decoding applications.

Abstract: Real-time decoding of neural activity is central to neuroscience and
neurotechnology applications, from closed-loop experiments to brain-computer
interfaces, where models are subject to strict latency constraints. Traditional
methods, including simple recurrent neural networks, are fast and lightweight
but often struggle to generalize to unseen data. In contrast, recent
Transformer-based approaches leverage large-scale pretraining for strong
generalization performance, but typically have much larger computational
requirements and are not always suitable for low-resource or real-time
settings. To address these shortcomings, we present POSSM, a novel hybrid
architecture that combines individual spike tokenization via a cross-attention
module with a recurrent state-space model (SSM) backbone to enable (1) fast and
causal online prediction on neural activity and (2) efficient generalization to
new sessions, individuals, and tasks through multi-dataset pretraining. We
evaluate POSSM's decoding performance and inference speed on intracortical
decoding of monkey motor tasks, and show that it extends to clinical
applications, namely handwriting and speech decoding in human subjects.
Notably, we demonstrate that pretraining on monkey motor-cortical recordings
improves decoding performance on the human handwriting task, highlighting the
exciting potential for cross-species transfer. In all of these tasks, we find
that POSSM achieves decoding accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art
Transformers, at a fraction of the inference cost (up to 9x faster on GPU).
These results suggest that hybrid SSMs are a promising approach to bridging the
gap between accuracy, inference speed, and generalization when training neural
decoders for real-time, closed-loop applications.

### [668] [Solving engineering eigenvalue problems with neural networks using the Rayleigh quotient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04375)
*Conor Rowan,John Evans,Kurt Maute,Alireza Doostan*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neural network-based method for solving eigenvalue problems using the Rayleigh quotient and Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization, demonstrating its effectiveness for various engineering applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Eigenvalue problems are common in engineering but understudied in physics-informed machine learning, especially with neural network discretizations.

Method: A neural network discretization of the eigenfunction is combined with the Rayleigh quotient and Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization to solve eigenvalue problems.

Result: The method proves robust for finding eigenvalues and eigenfunctions on irregular domains, handling parametric/nonlinear problems, and high-dimensional eigenanalysis.

Conclusion: The approach offers unique advantages for continuous eigenvalue problems, with potential applications in approximating PDE solutions.

Abstract: From characterizing the speed of a thermal system's response to computing
natural modes of vibration, eigenvalue analysis is ubiquitous in engineering.
In spite of this, eigenvalue problems have received relatively little treatment
compared to standard forward and inverse problems in the physics-informed
machine learning literature. In particular, neural network discretizations of
solutions to eigenvalue problems have seen only a handful of studies. Owing to
their nonlinearity, neural network discretizations prevent the conversion of
the continuous eigenvalue differential equation into a standard discrete
eigenvalue problem. In this setting, eigenvalue analysis requires more
specialized techniques. Using a neural network discretization of the
eigenfunction, we show that a variational form of the eigenvalue problem called
the "Rayleigh quotient" in tandem with a Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization
procedure is a particularly simple and robust approach to find the eigenvalues
and their corresponding eigenfunctions. This method is shown to be useful for
finding sets of harmonic functions on irregular domains, parametric and
nonlinear eigenproblems, and high-dimensional eigenanalysis. We also discuss
the utility of harmonic functions as a spectral basis for approximating
solutions to partial differential equations. Through various examples from
engineering mechanics, the combination of the Rayleigh quotient objective,
Gram-Schmidt procedure, and the neural network discretization of the
eigenfunction is shown to offer unique advantages for handling continuous
eigenvalue problems.

Result: The method was validated using NBA and Dunk City Dynasty datasets, showing efficacy and deployed online in the industry.

Conclusion: The \oursys framework provides a practical and explainable MVP evaluation method, successfully applied in real-world gaming scenarios.

Abstract: The burgeoning growth of the esports and multiplayer online gaming community
has highlighted the critical importance of evaluating the Most Valuable Player
(MVP). The establishment of an explainable and practical MVP evaluation method
is very challenging. In our study, we specifically focus on play-by-play data,
which records related events during the game, such as assists and points. We
aim to address the challenges by introducing a new MVP evaluation framework,
denoted as \oursys, which leverages Shapley values. This approach encompasses
feature processing, win-loss model training, Shapley value allocation, and MVP
ranking determination based on players' contributions. Additionally, we
optimize our algorithm to align with expert voting results from the perspective
of causality. Finally, we substantiated the efficacy of our method through
validation using the NBA dataset and the Dunk City Dynasty dataset and
implemented online deployment in the industry.

TL;DR: A model is proposed to generate phonemic and prosodic labels coherent with graphemes using implicit and explicit conditioning methods, improving consistency and aiding downstream tasks like TTS and accent estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of coherence between graphemes and phonemic/prosodic labels in speech, enabling better parallel data creation for downstream applications.

Method: 1) Implicit grapheme conditioning via BERT-based prompt encoder. 2) Explicit pruning of label hypotheses inconsistent with graphemes during inference.

Result: Improved consistency between graphemes and labels, and enhanced accuracy in accent estimation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively align speech labels with graphemes, benefiting applications like text-to-speech and accent estimation.

Abstract: We propose a model to obtain phonemic and prosodic labels of speech that are
coherent with graphemes. Unlike previous methods that simply fine-tune a
pre-trained ASR model with the labels, the proposed model conditions the label
generation on corresponding graphemes by two methods: 1) Add implicit grapheme
conditioning through prompt encoder using pre-trained BERT features. 2)
Explicitly prune the label hypotheses inconsistent with the grapheme during
inference. These methods enable obtaining parallel data of speech, the labels,
and graphemes, which is applicable to various downstream tasks such as
text-to-speech and accent estimation from text. Experiments showed that the
proposed method significantly improved the consistency between graphemes and
the predicted labels. Further, experiments on accent estimation task confirmed
that the created parallel data by the proposed method effectively improve the
estimation accuracy.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper proposes LLM-based phoneme-to-grapheme (LLM-P2G) decoding for phoneme-based ASR, outperforming WFST-based systems with relative WER reductions of 3.6% and 6.9% for Polish and German.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Phoneme-based multilingual pre-training and crosslingual fine-tuning in ASR are data-efficient but limited by WFST-based decoding's complexity and inability to leverage large language models (LLMs).

Method: Introduces LLM-P2G decoding with speech-to-phoneme (S2P) and phoneme-to-grapheme (P2G) components, addressing information loss via data augmentation (DANP) and randomized top-K marginalized (TKM) training.

Result: LLM-P2G achieves relative WER reductions of 3.6% (Polish) and 6.9% (German) compared to WFST-based systems.

Conclusion: LLM-P2G is a promising alternative to WFST-based decoding, improving crosslingual ASR performance.

Abstract: In automatic speech recognition (ASR), phoneme-based multilingual
pre-training and crosslingual fine-tuning is attractive for its high data
efficiency and competitive results compared to subword-based models. However,
Weighted Finite State Transducer (WFST) based decoding is limited by its
complex pipeline and inability to leverage large language models (LLMs).
Therefore, we propose LLM-based phoneme-to-grapheme (LLM-P2G) decoding for
phoneme-based ASR, consisting of speech-to-phoneme (S2P) and
phoneme-to-grapheme (P2G). A challenge is that there seems to have information
loss in cascading S2P and P2G. To address this challenge, we propose two
training strategies: data augmentation with noisy phonemes (DANP), and
randomized top-$K$ marginalized (TKM) training and decoding. Our experimental
results show that LLM-P2G outperforms WFST-based systems in crosslingual ASR
for Polish and German, by relative WER reductions of 3.6% and 6.9%
respectively.

TL;DR: Audio-text models struggle with background noise in zero-shot sound classification. A new method integrates background sound contributions, improving performance without retraining, and analyzes the audio-text modality gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing audio-text models perform poorly with background noise, limiting their practical use in real-world environments.

Method: Proposes quantifying and integrating background sound contributions into classification and narrowing the audio-text modality gap.

Result: Enhances classification accuracy across various backgrounds and SNR levels, generalizing well across prototypical approaches.

Conclusion: The method is scalable and robust, improving performance without requiring model retraining.

Abstract: Audio-text models are widely used in zero-shot environmental sound
classification as they alleviate the need for annotated data. However, we show
that their performance severely drops in the presence of background sound
sources. Our analysis reveals that this degradation is primarily driven by SNR
levels of background soundscapes, and independent of background type. To
address this, we propose a novel method that quantifies and integrates the
contribution of background sources into the classification process, improving
performance without requiring model retraining. Our domain adaptation technique
enhances accuracy across various backgrounds and SNR conditions. Moreover, we
analyze the modality gap between audio and text embeddings, showing that
narrowing this gap improves classification performance. The method generalizes
effectively across state-of-the-art prototypical approaches, showcasing its
scalability and robustness for diverse environments.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper proposes a human-computation approach to improve AI music generation by incorporating user feedback via a genetic algorithm, showing incremental rating improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI music generation lacks personalization due to fixed datasets, making user interaction challenging.

Method: A genetic algorithm aggregates user ratings to fine-tune the model, using feedback as the loss function.

Result: Pilot tests showed rating increases: 0.2 in the first iteration and 0.39 in the second.

Conclusion: User feedback integration enhances AI music generation, demonstrating measurable improvements.

Abstract: AI music generation has advanced rapidly, with models like diffusion and
autoregressive algorithms enabling high-fidelity outputs. These tools can alter
styles, mix instruments, or isolate them. Since sound can be visualized as
spectrograms, image-generation algorithms can be applied to generate novel
music. However, these algorithms are typically trained on fixed datasets, which
makes it challenging for them to interpret and respond to user input
accurately. This is especially problematic because music is highly subjective
and requires a level of personalization that image generation does not provide.
In this work, we propose a human-computation approach to gradually improve the
performance of these algorithms based on user interactions. The
human-computation element involves aggregating and selecting user ratings to
use as the loss function for fine-tuning the model. We employ a genetic
algorithm that incorporates user feedback to enhance the baseline performance
of a model initially trained on a fixed dataset. The effectiveness of this
approach is measured by the average increase in user ratings with each
iteration. In the pilot test, the first iteration showed an average rating
increase of 0.2 compared to the baseline. The second iteration further improved
upon this, achieving an additional increase of 0.39 over the first iteration.

Conclusion: The paper serves as a reference for AI and financial researchers, highlighting key trends and research gaps in LLM-based credit scoring.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM), which have developed in recent years, enable
credit risk assessment through the analysis of financial texts such as analyst
reports and corporate disclosures. This paper presents the first systematic
review and taxonomy focusing on LLMbased approaches in credit risk estimation.
We determined the basic model architectures by selecting 60 relevant papers
published between 2020-2025 with the PRISMA research strategy. And we examined
the data used for scenarios such as credit default prediction and risk
analysis. Since the main focus of the paper is interpretability, we classify
concepts such as explainability mechanisms, chain of thought prompts and
natural language justifications for LLM-based credit models. The taxonomy
organizes the literature under four main headings: model architectures, data
types, explainability mechanisms and application areas. Based on this analysis,
we highlight the main future trends and research gaps for LLM-based credit
scoring systems. This paper aims to be a reference paper for artificial

Motivation: Addresses the challenge of sampling in deep learning where global Lipschitz continuity is often unmet.

Result: Achieves best-known convergence rate (2−ε) in KL divergence, with improved Wasserstein-2 bounds.

Conclusion: kTULA provides theoretical guarantees for sampling and optimization, demonstrated in high-dimensional and neural network applications.

Abstract: Motivated by applications in deep learning, where the global Lipschitz
continuity condition is often not satisfied, we examine the problem of sampling
from distributions with super-linearly growing log-gradients. We propose a
novel tamed Langevin dynamics-based algorithm, called kTULA, to solve the
aforementioned sampling problem, and provide a theoretical guarantee for its
performance. More precisely, we establish a non-asymptotic convergence bound in
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence with the best-known rate of convergence equal
to $2-\overline{\epsilon}$, $\overline{\epsilon}>0$, which significantly
improves relevant results in existing literature. This enables us to obtain an
improved non-asymptotic error bound in Wasserstein-2 distance, which can be
used to further derive a non-asymptotic guarantee for kTULA to solve the
associated optimization problems. To illustrate the applicability of kTULA, we
apply the proposed algorithm to the problem of sampling from a high-dimensional
double-well potential distribution and to an optimization problem involving a
neural network. We show that our main results can be used to provide
theoretical guarantees for the performance of kTULA.

Motivation: Address the high costs of data collection and policy deployment in RL, focusing on reducing burn-in and switching/communication costs.

Method: Proposes two model-free RL algorithms for single-agent and federated RL, designed to achieve low burn-in costs (linear in S and A) and logarithmic switching/communication costs.

Result: The algorithms achieve near-optimal regret, low burn-in costs, and logarithmic switching/communication costs, with improved gap-dependent guarantees.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms outperform existing methods by simultaneously optimizing regret, burn-in, and switching/communication costs, setting new benchmarks in RL efficiency.

Abstract: Motivated by real-world settings where data collection and policy deployment
-- whether for a single agent or across multiple agents -- are costly, we study
the problem of on-policy single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) and federated
RL (FRL) with a focus on minimizing burn-in costs (the sample sizes needed to
reach near-optimal regret) and policy switching or communication costs. In
parallel finite-horizon episodic Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with $S$
states and $A$ actions, existing methods either require superlinear burn-in
costs in $S$ and $A$ or fail to achieve logarithmic switching or communication
costs. We propose two novel model-free RL algorithms -- Q-EarlySettled-LowCost
and FedQ-EarlySettled-LowCost -- that are the first in the literature to
simultaneously achieve: (i) the best near-optimal regret among all known
model-free RL or FRL algorithms, (ii) low burn-in cost that scales linearly
with $S$ and $A$, and (iii) logarithmic policy switching cost for single-agent
RL or communication cost for FRL. Additionally, we establish gap-dependent
theoretical guarantees for both regret and switching/communication costs,
improving or matching the best-known gap-dependent bounds.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a distributional encoding (DE) method for Gaussian Process (GP) regression to handle categorical variables, improving predictive performance and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GP regression struggles with categorical variables, limiting its effectiveness in applications like Bayesian optimization (BO).

Method: The authors generalize naive target encoding to DE, using all target variable samples for a category, and integrate it into GP using characteristic kernels for probability distributions.

Result: Empirical validation shows state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: DE enhances GP regression for categorical variables and complements recent BO advancements in discrete and mixed spaces.

Abstract: Gaussian Process (GP) regression is a popular and sample-efficient approach
for many engineering applications, where observations are expensive to acquire,
and is also a central ingredient of Bayesian optimization (BO), a highly
prevailing method for the optimization of black-box functions. However, when
all or some input variables are categorical, building a predictive and
computationally efficient GP remains challenging. Starting from the naive
target encoding idea, where the original categorical values are replaced with
the mean of the target variable for that category, we propose a generalization
based on distributional encoding (DE) which makes use of all samples of the
target variable for a category. To handle this type of encoding inside the GP,
we build upon recent results on characteristic kernels for probability
distributions, based on the maximum mean discrepancy and the Wasserstein
distance. We also discuss several extensions for classification, multi-task
learning and incorporation or auxiliary information. Our approach is validated
empirically, and we demonstrate state-of-the-art predictive performance on a
variety of synthetic and real-world datasets. DE is naturally complementary to
recent advances in BO over discrete and mixed-spaces.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to estimate joint interventional effects using only observational data and single-variable interventions, achieving results comparable to models trained on joint interventional data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimating joint interventional effects is important but challenging due to the difficulty of obtaining joint intervention data.

Method: The study presents an identifiability result for nonlinear additive outcome mechanisms and proposes a practical estimator that decomposes causal effects into confounded and unconfounded contributions.

Result: Experiments on synthetic data show the method performs comparably to models trained on joint interventional data and outperforms observational estimators.

Conclusion: The approach successfully infers joint interventional effects without requiring joint intervention data, offering a practical solution for causal inference.

Abstract: Estimating causal effects of joint interventions on multiple variables is
crucial in many domains, but obtaining data from such simultaneous
interventions can be challenging. Our study explores how to learn joint
interventional effects using only observational data and single-variable
interventions. We present an identifiability result for this problem, showing
that for a class of nonlinear additive outcome mechanisms, joint effects can be
inferred without access to joint interventional data. We propose a practical
estimator that decomposes the causal effect into confounded and unconfounded
contributions for each intervention variable. Experiments on synthetic data
demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to models trained
directly on joint interventional data, outperforming a purely observational
estimator.

### [683] [Nonlinear Causal Discovery for Grouped Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05120)
*Konstantin Göbler,Tobias Windisch,Mathias Drton*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper extends nonlinear additive noise models to handle random vectors for causal inference, introducing a two-step approach for causal graph learning and demonstrating effectiveness in simulations and real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many domains involve causal units as groups of variables, not just scalar measurements, necessitating methods to infer cause-effect relationships among random vectors.

Method: A two-step approach: first infer causal order among random vectors, then perform model selection to identify the best graph consistent with this order. Novel solutions are introduced for both steps.

Result: Strong performance in simulations and successful application to real-world assembly line data with partial causal ordering knowledge.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively extends causal inference to random vectors, showing promise for applications in neuroscience, psychology, social science, and industrial manufacturing.

Abstract: Inferring cause-effect relationships from observational data has gained
significant attention in recent years, but most methods are limited to scalar
random variables. In many important domains, including neuroscience,
psychology, social science, and industrial manufacturing, the causal units of
interest are groups of variables rather than individual scalar measurements.
Motivated by these applications, we extend nonlinear additive noise models to
handle random vectors, establishing a two-step approach for causal graph
learning: First, infer the causal order among random vectors. Second, perform
model selection to identify the best graph consistent with this order. We
introduce effective and novel solutions for both steps in the vector case,
demonstrating strong performance in simulations. Finally, we apply our method
to real-world assembly line data with partial knowledge of causal ordering
among variable groups.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores causal effect identification in latent variable linear models using higher-order cumulants, tackling challenging setups with latent confounders. It proves identifiability with a single proxy or instrument and offers estimation methods, showing improved accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the difficulty of causal inference in linear systems with latent confounders, particularly in setups with single proxy variables or underspecified instrumental variables.

Method: Uses higher-order cumulants in lvLiNGAM to identify causal effects, providing estimation methods for cases with a single proxy or instrument.

Result: Demonstrates that causal effects are identifiable with minimal proxies or instruments, with experimental results showing superior accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: Advances theoretical and practical understanding of causal inference in linear systems with latent confounders, offering reliable methods for challenging scenarios.

Abstract: This paper investigates causal effect identification in latent variable
Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Models (lvLiNGAM) using higher-order cumulants,
addressing two prominent setups that are challenging in the presence of latent
confounding: (1) a single proxy variable that may causally influence the
treatment and (2) underspecified instrumental variable cases where fewer
instruments exist than treatments. We prove that causal effects are
identifiable with a single proxy or instrument and provide corresponding
estimation methods. Experimental results demonstrate the accuracy and
robustness of our approaches compared to existing methods, advancing the
theoretical and practical understanding of causal inference in linear systems

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Adaptive trials strictly dominate non-adaptive ones in best-arm identification with ≥3 arms, proven via efficiency exponent analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if adaptive trials are always preferable to non-adaptive ones in best-arm identification.

Method: Analyzed batched arm elimination designs, focusing on efficiency exponent for large samples.

Result: Found adaptive designs universally and strictly dominate non-adaptive trials for ≥3 arms.

Conclusion: Adaptive trials are superior, resolving an open problem from Qin [2022].

Abstract: When an experimenter has the option of running an adaptive trial, is it
admissible to ignore this option and run a non-adaptive trial instead? We
provide a negative answer to this question in the best-arm identification
problem, where the experimenter aims to allocate measurement efforts
judiciously to confidently deploy the most effective treatment arm. We find
that, whenever there are at least three treatment arms, there exist simple
adaptive designs that universally and strictly dominate non-adaptive completely
randomized trials. This dominance is characterized by a notion called
efficiency exponent, which quantifies a design's statistical efficiency when
the experimental sample is large. Our analysis focuses on the class of batched
arm elimination designs, which progressively eliminate underperforming arms at
pre-specified batch intervals. We characterize simple sufficient conditions
under which these designs universally and strictly dominate completely
randomized trials. These results resolve the second open problem posed in Qin
[2022].

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: ChemReservoir is an open-source framework for chemically-inspired reservoir computing, addressing limitations of previous DNA-focused tools by offering a general, reproducible, and well-tested solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous reservoir computing tools were limited to DNA chemistry and lacked maintenance, necessitating a versatile, open-source alternative.

Method: Developed ChemReservoir, a general framework for constructing and analyzing chemically-inspired reservoirs, with enhanced testing and reproducibility.

Result: Demonstrated stable performance in memory capacity tasks across various cycle-based reservoir topologies.

Conclusion: ChemReservoir provides a robust, general-purpose solution for chemically-inspired reservoir computing, overcoming prior limitations.

Abstract: Reservoir computing is a type of a recurrent neural network, mapping the
inputs into higher dimensional space using fixed and nonlinear dynamical
systems, called reservoirs. In the literature, there are various types of
reservoirs ranging from in-silico to in-vitro. In cheminformatics, previous
studies contributed to the field by developing simulation-based chemically
inspired in-silico reservoir models. Yahiro used a DNA-based chemical reaction
network as its reservoir and Nguyen developed a DNA chemistry-inspired tool
based on Gillespie algorithm. However, these software tools were designed
mainly with the focus on DNA chemistry and their maintenance status has limited
their current usability. Due to these limitations, there was a need for a
proper open-source tool. This study introduces ChemReservoir, an open-source
framework for chemically-inspired reservoir computing. In contrast to the
former studies focused on DNA-chemistry, ChemReservoir is a general framework
for the construction and analysis of chemically-inspired reservoirs, which also
addresses the limitations in these previous studies by ensuring enhanced
testing, evaluation, and reproducibility. The tool was evaluated using various
cycle-based reservoir topologies and demonstrated stable performance across a
range of configurations in memory capacity tasks.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper explores using Parler TTS, a large speech model, to reconstruct voices of dysarthric speakers pre-condition onset, aiming for intelligible speech while preserving speaker identity. Results show partial success but highlight challenges in controllability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech disorders hinder communication; personalized TTS offers a potential aid. The study aims to reconstruct pre-condition voices for dysarthric speakers.

Method: Fine-tuned Parler TTS on a curated dataset annotated for speaker and intelligibility, testing its ability to generate intelligible speech while maintaining identity.

Result: The model learns from challenging data but struggles with intelligibility control and consistent speaker identity.

Conclusion: Future work should focus on improving controllability for voice reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: Speech disorders can make communication hard or even impossible for those who
develop them. Personalised Text-to-Speech is an attractive option as a
communication aid. We attempt voice reconstruction using a large speech model,
with which we generate an approximation of a dysarthric speaker's voice prior
to the onset of their condition. In particular, we investigate whether a
state-of-the-art large speech model, Parler TTS, can generate intelligible
speech while maintaining speaker identity. We curate a dataset and annotate it
with relevant speaker and intelligibility information, and use this to
fine-tune the model. Our results show that the model can indeed learn to
generate from the distribution of this challenging data, but struggles to
control intelligibility and to maintain consistent speaker identity. We propose
future directions to improve controllability of this class of model, for the
voice reconstruction task.

Motivation: To evaluate and improve the performance, efficiency, and alignment quality of joint speech-text decoding paradigms in speech language models.

Method: Systematic comparison of interleaved and parallel generation paradigms using the same base model, tokenizer, and data. Introduction of the ESI pattern to address slow inference.

Result: Interleaved decoding achieves the best alignment but is slow; ESI improves speed and slightly enhances performance. QA datasets further boost speech QA performance.

Conclusion: The ESI method effectively balances alignment quality and efficiency, while curated QA datasets enhance practical applications like speech QA.

Abstract: Speech language models (Speech LMs) enable end-to-end speech-text modelling
within a single model, offering a promising direction for spoken dialogue
systems. The choice of speech-text jointly decoding paradigm plays a critical
role in performance, efficiency, and alignment quality. In this work, we
systematically compare representative joint speech-text decoding
strategies-including the interleaved, and parallel generation paradigms-under a
controlled experimental setup using the same base language model, speech
tokenizer and training data. Our results show that the interleaved approach
achieves the best alignment. However it suffers from slow inference due to long
token sequence length. To address this, we propose a novel early-stop
interleaved (ESI) pattern that not only significantly accelerates decoding but
also yields slightly better performance. Additionally, we curate high-quality
question answering (QA) datasets to further improve speech QA performance.

*Bruno Deprez,Bart Baesens,Tim Verdonck,Wouter Verbeke*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: GARG-AML is a graph-based method for detecting smurfing in money laundering, offering a transparent and efficient single-metric solution that outperforms current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Money laundering, especially smurfing, is a major global issue, but existing black-box network embedding methods lack transparency for business adoption.

Method: GARG-AML quantifies smurfing risk using a single interpretable metric from second-order transaction networks, combined with tree-based methods and neighbor scores.

Result: Experiments show GARG-AML outperforms state-of-the-art methods in smurfing detection on synthetic and open-source networks.

Conclusion: GARG-AML demonstrates the effectiveness of fundamental network properties in advancing fraud detection with transparency and efficiency.

Abstract: Money laundering poses a significant challenge as it is estimated to account
for 2%-5% of the global GDP. This has compelled regulators to impose stringent
controls on financial institutions. One prominent laundering method for evading
these controls, called smurfing, involves breaking up large transactions into
smaller amounts. Given the complexity of smurfing schemes, which involve
multiple transactions distributed among diverse parties, network analytics has
become an important anti-money laundering tool. However, recent advances have
focused predominantly on black-box network embedding methods, which has
hindered their adoption in businesses. In this paper, we introduce GARG-AML, a
novel graph-based method that quantifies smurfing risk through a single
interpretable metric derived from the structure of the second-order transaction
network of each individual node in the network. Unlike traditional methods,
GARG-AML strikes an effective balance among computational efficiency, detection
power and transparency, which enables its integration into existing AML
workflows. To enhance its capabilities, we combine the GARG-AML score
calculation with different tree-based methods and also incorporate the scores
of the node's neighbours. An experimental evaluation on large-scale synthetic
and open-source networks demonstrate that the GARG-AML outperforms the current
state-of-the-art smurfing detection methods. By leveraging only the adjacency
matrix of the second-order neighbourhood and basic network features, this work
highlights the potential of fundamental network properties towards advancing
fraud detection.

TL;DR: The paper identifies challenges in using MLLMs for detecting out-of-context misinformation and proposes CMIE, a framework with CRG and AS mechanisms, which outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle to detect deeper semantic relationships and are affected by noisy evidence in out-of-context misinformation detection.

Method: Proposes CMIE, incorporating Coexistence Relationship Generation (CRG) and Association Scoring (AS) to identify underlying relationships and selectively use evidence.

Result: CMIE outperforms existing methods in detecting out-of-context misinformation.

Conclusion: CMIE effectively addresses the limitations of MLLMs in misinformation detection by leveraging semantic relationships and selective evidence use.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in visual reasoning and text generation. While previous studies
have explored the application of MLLM for detecting out-of-context (OOC)
misinformation, our empirical analysis reveals two persisting challenges of
this paradigm. Evaluating the representative GPT-4o model on direct reasoning
and evidence augmented reasoning, results indicate that MLLM struggle to
capture the deeper relationships-specifically, cases in which the image and
text are not directly connected but are associated through underlying semantic
links. Moreover, noise in the evidence further impairs detection accuracy. To
address these challenges, we propose CMIE, a novel OOC misinformation detection
framework that incorporates a Coexistence Relationship Generation (CRG)
strategy and an Association Scoring (AS) mechanism. CMIE identifies the
underlying coexistence relationships between images and text, and selectively
utilizes relevant evidence to enhance misinformation detection. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods.

*Lingyuan Liu,Mengxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Exp4Fuse, a novel fusion ranking framework, enhances sparse retrieval by combining original and LLM-augmented queries, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high cost and computational intensity of LLM-based query expansion while improving sparse retrieval performance.

Method: Exp4Fuse uses two retrieval routes (original and LLM-augmented queries), fuses ranked lists via modified reciprocal rank fusion, and evaluates on multiple datasets.

Result: Exp4Fuse surpasses existing LLM-based methods and achieves SOTA results when combined with advanced sparse retrievers.

Conclusion: Exp4Fuse is effective and superior for improving query expansion in sparse retrieval.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in generating hypothetical
documents for query expansion, thereby enhancing information retrieval
performance. However, the efficacy of this method is highly dependent on the
quality of the generated documents, which often requires complex prompt
strategies and the integration of advanced dense retrieval techniques. This can
be both costly and computationally intensive. To mitigate these limitations, we
explore the use of zero-shot LLM-based query expansion to improve sparse
retrieval, particularly for learned sparse retrievers. We introduce a novel
fusion ranking framework, Exp4Fuse, which enhances the performance of sparse
retrievers through an indirect application of zero-shot LLM-based query
expansion. Exp4Fuse operates by simultaneously considering two retrieval
routes-one based on the original query and the other on the LLM-augmented
query. It then generates two ranked lists using a sparse retriever and fuses
them using a modified reciprocal rank fusion method. We conduct extensive
evaluations of Exp4Fuse against leading LLM-based query expansion methods and
advanced retrieval techniques on three MS MARCO-related datasets and seven
low-resource datasets. Experimental results reveal that Exp4Fuse not only
surpasses existing LLM-based query expansion methods in enhancing sparse
retrievers but also, when combined with advanced sparse retrievers, achieves
SOTA results on several benchmarks. This highlights the superior performance
and effectiveness of Exp4Fuse in improving query expansion for sparse
retrieval.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: GOLFer is a method using smaller LMs for query expansion, filtering hallucinations and combining documents, outperforming larger LM-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high cost and limited accessibility of large LMs in query expansion by leveraging smaller LMs.

Method: GOLFer uses a hallucination filter to remove non-factual content and a combiner to integrate filtered documents with queries.

Result: GOLFer outperforms smaller LM methods and competes with large LM methods on web search and low-resource datasets.

Conclusion: GOLFer is an effective, cost-efficient alternative to large LM-based query expansion.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-based query expansion for information retrieval
augments queries with generated hypothetical documents with LLMs. However, its
performance relies heavily on the scale of the language models (LMs),
necessitating larger, more advanced LLMs. This approach is costly,
computationally intensive, and often has limited accessibility. To address
these limitations, we introduce GOLFer - Smaller LMs-Generated Documents
Hallucination Filter & Combiner - a novel method leveraging smaller open-source
LMs for query expansion. GOLFer comprises two modules: a hallucination filter
and a documents combiner. The former detects and removes non-factual and
inconsistent sentences in generated documents, a common issue with smaller LMs,
while the latter combines the filtered content with the query using a weight
vector to balance their influence. We evaluate GOLFer alongside dominant
LLM-based query expansion methods on three web search and ten low-resource
datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that GOLFer consistently outperforms
other methods using smaller LMs, and maintains competitive performance against
methods using large-size LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper investigates reducing memory usage in Visualized Document Retrieval (VDR) by minimizing patch-level embeddings. It evaluates token pruning and merging, finding merging more effective, and introduces Light-ColPali/ColQwen2, which retains high performance with significantly lower memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods like ColPali/ColQwen2 in VDR use excessive memory due to multiple patch-level embeddings per page. This study aims to reduce memory usage without significant performance loss.

Method: The study evaluates two token-reduction strategies: token pruning (random and sophisticated methods) and token merging (optimal combinations across three dimensions).

Result: Token pruning proved unsuitable for VDR, while token merging succeeded. Light-ColPali/ColQwen2 maintained 98.2% performance with 11.8% memory usage and 94.6% effectiveness at 2.8% memory.

Conclusion: The findings highlight token merging's superiority for VDR, offering a competitive baseline for future efficient VDR research.

Abstract: Despite the strong performance of ColPali/ColQwen2 in Visualized Document
Retrieval (VDR), it encodes each page into multiple patch-level embeddings and
leads to excessive memory usage. This empirical study investigates methods to
reduce patch embeddings per page at minimum performance degradation. We
evaluate two token-reduction strategies: token pruning and token merging.
Regarding token pruning, we surprisingly observe that a simple random strategy
outperforms other sophisticated pruning methods, though still far from
satisfactory. Further analysis reveals that pruning is inherently unsuitable
for VDR as it requires removing certain page embeddings without query-specific
information. Turning to token merging (more suitable for VDR), we search for
the optimal combinations of merging strategy across three dimensions and
develop Light-ColPali/ColQwen2. It maintains 98.2% of retrieval performance
with only 11.8% of original memory usage, and preserves 94.6% effectiveness at

*Lingyuan Liu,Mengxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Exp4Fuse, a novel fusion ranking framework, enhances sparse retrieval by combining LLM-augmented and original queries, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high cost and computational intensity of LLM-based query expansion by improving sparse retrieval efficiency.

Method: Introduces Exp4Fuse, which fuses ranked lists from original and LLM-augmented queries using a modified reciprocal rank fusion method.

Result: Exp4Fuse surpasses existing LLM-based methods and achieves SOTA results when combined with advanced sparse retrievers.

Conclusion: Exp4Fuse is effective and superior for improving query expansion in sparse retrieval.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in generating hypothetical
documents for query expansion, thereby enhancing information retrieval
performance. However, the efficacy of this method is highly dependent on the
quality of the generated documents, which often requires complex prompt
strategies and the integration of advanced dense retrieval techniques. This can
be both costly and computationally intensive. To mitigate these limitations, we
explore the use of zero-shot LLM-based query expansion to improve sparse
retrieval, particularly for learned sparse retrievers. We introduce a novel
fusion ranking framework, Exp4Fuse, which enhances the performance of sparse
retrievers through an indirect application of zero-shot LLM-based query
expansion. Exp4Fuse operates by simultaneously considering two retrieval
routes-one based on the original query and the other on the LLM-augmented
query. It then generates two ranked lists using a sparse retriever and fuses
them using a modified reciprocal rank fusion method. We conduct extensive
evaluations of Exp4Fuse against leading LLM-based query expansion methods and
advanced retrieval techniques on three MS MARCO-related datasets and seven
low-resource datasets. Experimental results reveal that Exp4Fuse not only
surpasses existing LLM-based query expansion methods in enhancing sparse
retrievers but also, when combined with advanced sparse retrievers, achieves
SOTA results on several benchmarks. This highlights the superior performance
and effectiveness of Exp4Fuse in improving query expansion for sparse
retrieval.

### [700] [GOLFer: Smaller LM-Generated Documents Hallucination Filter & Combiner for Query Expansion in Information Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04762)
*Lingyuan Liu,Mengxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: GOLFer is a method using smaller LMs for query expansion, filtering hallucinations and combining documents, outperforming larger LMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the cost, computational intensity, and limited accessibility of large LMs in query expansion.

Method: GOLFer uses a hallucination filter and documents combiner with smaller LMs.

Result: Outperforms other methods with smaller LMs and competes with large LLMs.

Conclusion: GOLFer is effective and efficient for query expansion with smaller LMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-based query expansion for information retrieval
augments queries with generated hypothetical documents with LLMs. However, its
performance relies heavily on the scale of the language models (LMs),
necessitating larger, more advanced LLMs. This approach is costly,
computationally intensive, and often has limited accessibility. To address
these limitations, we introduce GOLFer - Smaller LMs-Generated Documents
Hallucination Filter & Combiner - a novel method leveraging smaller open-source
LMs for query expansion. GOLFer comprises two modules: a hallucination filter
and a documents combiner. The former detects and removes non-factual and
inconsistent sentences in generated documents, a common issue with smaller LMs,
while the latter combines the filtered content with the query using a weight
vector to balance their influence. We evaluate GOLFer alongside dominant
LLM-based query expansion methods on three web search and ten low-resource
datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that GOLFer consistently outperforms
other methods using smaller LMs, and maintains competitive performance against
methods using large-size LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness.

*Yubo Ma,Jinsong Li,Yuhang Zang,Xiaobao Wu,Xiaoyi Dong,Pan Zhang,Yuhang Cao,Haodong Duan,Jiaqi Wang,Yixin Cao,Aixin Sun*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper investigates methods to reduce memory usage in Visualized Document Retrieval (VDR) by minimizing patch embeddings per page while maintaining performance. It evaluates token pruning and merging, finding merging more suitable, and develops Light-ColPali/ColQwen2, which achieves high efficiency with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the excessive memory usage in ColPali/ColQwen2 due to multiple patch-level embeddings per page in VDR, aiming to reduce embeddings without significant performance degradation.

Method: Evaluates two token-reduction strategies: token pruning (random and sophisticated methods) and token merging (optimal combinations across three dimensions). Develops Light-ColPali/ColQwen2.

Result: Token merging proves more suitable than pruning. Light-ColPali/ColQwen2 retains 98.2% retrieval performance at 11.8% memory usage and 94.6% effectiveness at 2.8% memory footprint.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights for efficient VDR, with Light-ColPali/ColQwen2 serving as a competitive baseline for future research.

Abstract: Despite the strong performance of ColPali/ColQwen2 in Visualized Document
Retrieval (VDR), it encodes each page into multiple patch-level embeddings and
leads to excessive memory usage. This empirical study investigates methods to
reduce patch embeddings per page at minimum performance degradation. We
evaluate two token-reduction strategies: token pruning and token merging.
Regarding token pruning, we surprisingly observe that a simple random strategy
outperforms other sophisticated pruning methods, though still far from
satisfactory. Further analysis reveals that pruning is inherently unsuitable
for VDR as it requires removing certain page embeddings without query-specific
information. Turning to token merging (more suitable for VDR), we search for
the optimal combinations of merging strategy across three dimensions and
develop Light-ColPali/ColQwen2. It maintains 98.2% of retrieval performance
with only 11.8% of original memory usage, and preserves 94.6% effectiveness at
2.8% memory footprint. We expect our empirical findings and resulting
Light-ColPali/ColQwen2 offer valuable insights and establish a competitive
baseline for future research towards efficient VDR.

### [702] [Reason-to-Recommend: Using Interaction-of-Thought Reasoning to Enhance LLM Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05069)
*Keyu Zhao,Fengli Xu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: R2Rec is a reasoning-enhanced LLM framework for recommendations, using interaction chains and progressive prompting to simulate step-by-step decision-making, outperforming baselines by 10.48% in HitRatio@1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM reasoning methods for recommendations are ineffective due to implicit user feedback and lack of reasoning supervision.

Method: R2Rec samples interaction chains, converts them into structured interaction-of-thoughts via masked prompting, and uses a two-stage training pipeline (supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning).

Result: R2Rec achieves a 10.48% improvement in HitRatio@1 and 131.81% gain over the original LLM, with enhanced interpretability.

Conclusion: R2Rec effectively integrates reasoning into LLM-based recommendations, improving performance and interpretability.

Abstract: Driven by advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), integrating them into
recommendation tasks has gained interest due to their strong semantic
understanding and prompt flexibility. Prior work encoded user-item interactions
or metadata into prompts for recommendations. In parallel, LLM reasoning,
boosted by test-time scaling and reinforcement learning, has excelled in fields
like mathematics and code, where reasoning traces and correctness signals are
clear, enabling high performance and interpretability. However, directly
applying these reasoning methods to recommendation is ineffective because user
feedback is implicit and lacks reasoning supervision. To address this, we
propose $\textbf{R2Rec}$, a reasoning-enhanced recommendation framework that
samples interaction chains from the user-item graph and converts them into
structured interaction-of-thoughts via a progressive masked prompting strategy,
with each thought representing stepwise reasoning grounded in interaction
context. This allows LLMs to simulate step-by-step decision-making based on
implicit patterns. We design a two-stage training pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning teaches basic reasoning from high-quality traces, and reinforcement
learning refines reasoning via reward signals, alleviating sparse explicit
supervision. Experiments on three real-world datasets show R2Rec outperforms
classical and LLM-based baselines with an average $\textbf{10.48%}$ improvement
in HitRatio@1 and $\textbf{131.81%}$ gain over the original LLM. Furthermore,
the explicit reasoning chains enhance interpretability by revealing the
decision process. Our code is available at:

### [703] [Was Residual Penalty and Neural Operators All We Needed for Solving Optimal Control Problems?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04742)
*Oliver G. S. Lundqvist,Fabricio Oliveira*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: Neural networks can solve optimal control problems without including cost functions in training, simplifying the architecture by decoupling training from optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To streamline the process of solving optimal control problems by avoiding the need to include cost functions in the neural network training phase.

Method: Uses a simple neural operator (e.g., DeepONet) with a physics-informed training phase, followed by an optimization phase where gradients are computed via automatic differentiation.

Result: Demonstrated on nine optimal control problems, showing accurate performance across varying cost functions with just three trained models.

Conclusion: Decoupling training from optimization simplifies the architecture and maintains performance, making the approach versatile for multiple problems.

Abstract: Neural networks have been used to solve optimal control problems, typically
by training neural networks using a combined loss function that considers data,
differential equation residuals, and objective costs. We show that including
cost functions in the training process is unnecessary, advocating for a simpler
architecture and streamlined approach by decoupling the optimal control problem
from the training process. Thus, our work shows that a simple neural operator
architecture, such as DeepONet, coupled with an unconstrained optimization
routine, can solve multiple optimal control problems with a single
physics-informed training phase and a subsequent optimization phase. We achieve
this by adding a penalty term based on the differential equation residual to
the cost function and computing gradients with respect to the control using
automatic differentiation through the trained neural operator within an
iterative optimization routine. We showcase our method on nine distinct optimal
control problems by training three separate DeepONet models, each corresponding
to a different differential equation. For each model, we solve three problems
with varying cost functions, demonstrating accurate and consistent performance
across all cases.

TL;DR: MOPBnB(so) is a simulation optimization algorithm for stochastic multi-objective problems, using single observations and neighboring solutions to estimate objectives. It outperforms NSGA-II and is computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address stochastic multi-objective optimization problems efficiently, avoiding the computational intensity of multiple replications.

Method: Evaluates noisy functions once per solution, using neighboring solutions for estimation. Analyzes finite-time performance and asymptotic convergence.

Result: Outperforms NSGA-II and is less resource-intensive than multiple-replication variants.

Conclusion: MOPBnB(so) is effective for approximating Pareto optimal sets in stochastic problems with computational efficiency.

Abstract: A multiple objective simulation optimization algorithm named Multiple
Objective Probabilistic Branch and Bound with Single Observation (MOPBnB(so))
is presented for approximating the Pareto optimal set and the associated
efficient frontier for stochastic multi-objective optimization problems.
MOPBnB(so) evaluates a noisy function exactly once at any solution and uses
neighboring solutions to estimate the objective functions, in contrast to a
variant that uses multiple replications at a solution to estimate the objective
functions. A finite-time performance analysis for deterministic multi-objective
problems provides a bound on the probability that MOPBnB(so) captures the
Pareto optimal set. Asymptotic convergence of MOPBnB(so) on stochastic problems
is derived, in that the algorithm captures the Pareto optimal set and the
estimations converge to the true objective function values. Numerical results
reveal that the variant with multiple replications is extremely intensive in
terms of computational resources compared to MOPBnB(so). In addition, numerical
results show that MOPBnB(so) outperforms a genetic algorithm NSGA-II on test
problems.

Motivation: To address the underexplored area of vulnerability patching in Automated Program Repair (APR) using pre-trained language models for security-critical applications.

Method: Investigates CodeBERT and CodeT5 across six datasets and four languages, evaluating accuracy and generalization to unknown vulnerabilities.

Result: CodeBERT performs better with fragmented context, while CodeT5 excels in complex patterns and scalability. Fine-tuning improves in-distribution performance but lacks generalization to unseen data.

Conclusion: The study benchmarks model performance, identifies generalization challenges, and provides insights for advancing automated vulnerability patching in real-world security.

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities pose significant security threats, requiring
effective mitigation. While Automated Program Repair (APR) has advanced in
fixing general bugs, vulnerability patching, a security-critical aspect of APR
remains underexplored. This study investigates pre-trained language models,
CodeBERT and CodeT5, for automated vulnerability patching across six datasets
and four languages. We evaluate their accuracy and generalization to unknown
vulnerabilities. Results show that while both models face challenges with
fragmented or sparse context, CodeBERT performs comparatively better in such
scenarios, whereas CodeT5 excels in capturing complex vulnerability patterns.
CodeT5 also demonstrates superior scalability. Furthermore, we test fine-tuned
models on both in-distribution (trained) and out-of-distribution (unseen)
datasets. While fine-tuning improves in-distribution performance, models
struggle to generalize to unseen data, highlighting challenges in robust
vulnerability detection. This study benchmarks model performance, identifies
limitations in generalization, and provides actionable insights to advance
automated vulnerability patching for real-world security applications.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CoRAL is a DL framework using reinforcement learning to automate code review comment generation, focusing on semantic similarity and usefulness for code refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code review is time-consuming and subjective; automation can improve efficiency and consistency.

Method: CoRAL employs reinforcement learning with a reward mechanism based on comment semantics and usefulness for code refinement.

Result: CoRAL outperforms baseline techniques in generating meaningful and useful comments.

Conclusion: CoRAL effectively automates code review comment generation, demonstrating superiority over existing methods.

Abstract: Code review is a crucial component of modern software development, involving
the evaluation of code quality, providing feedback on potential issues, and
refining the code to address identified problems. Despite these benefits, code
review can be rather time consuming, and influenced by subjectivity and human
factors. For these reasons, techniques to (partially) automate the code review
process have been proposed in the literature. Among those, the ones exploiting
deep learning (DL) are able to tackle the generative aspect of code review, by
commenting on a given code as a human reviewer would do (i.e., comment
generation task) or by automatically implementing code changes required to
address a reviewer's comment (i.e., code refinement task). In this paper, we
introduce CoRAL, a deep learning framework automating review comment generation
by exploiting reinforcement learning with a reward mechanism considering both
the semantics of the generated comments as well as their usefulness as input
for other models automating the code refinement task. The core idea is that if
the DL model generates comments that are semantically similar to the expected
ones or can be successfully implemented by a second model specialized in code
refinement, these comments are likely to be meaningful and useful, thus
deserving a high reward in the reinforcement learning framework. We present
both quantitative and qualitative comparisons between the comments generated by
CoRAL and those produced by the latest baseline techniques, highlighting the
effectiveness and superiority of our approach.

Main category: nlin.PS

TL;DR: A Neural ODE-based framework for learning reduced-order moment dynamics from PDE systems, robust to sparse and noisy data, with applications in nonlinear Schrödinger and Fisher-KPP equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of derivative-based methods like SINDy, which require dense data and are noise-sensitive, by leveraging Neural ODEs for robust modeling of moment dynamics.

Method: Uses Neural ODEs to model moment trajectories directly, introduces Stiefel manifold optimization for data-driven coordinate transformation in systems without analytical closure.

Result: Accurately recovers governing moment dynamics with limited data, outperforms expert-derived ODE models in extrapolation accuracy, even under sparse sampling.

Conclusion: Neural ODEs are a flexible and powerful tool for learning interpretable, low-dimensional moment dynamics in complex PDE systems.

Abstract: We propose a data-driven framework for learning reduced-order moment dynamics
from PDE-governed systems using Neural ODEs. In contrast to derivative-based
methods like SINDy, which necessitate densely sampled data and are sensitive to
noise, our approach based on Neural ODEs directly models moment trajectories,
enabling robust learning from sparse and potentially irregular time series.
Using as an application platform the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation, the
framework accurately recovers governing moment dynamics when closure is
available, even with limited and irregular observations. For systems without
analytical closure, we introduce a data-driven coordinate transformation
strategy based on Stiefel manifold optimization, enabling the discovery of
low-dimensional representations in which the moment dynamics become closed,
facilitating interpretable and reliable modeling. We also explore cases where a
closure model is not known, such as a Fisher-KPP reaction-diffusion system.
Here we demonstrate that Neural ODEs can still effectively approximate the
unclosed moment dynamics and achieve superior extrapolation accuracy compared
to physical-expert-derived ODE models. This advantage remains robust even under
sparse and irregular sampling, highlighting the method's robustness in
data-limited settings. Our results highlight the Neural ODE framework as a
powerful and flexible tool for learning interpretable, low-dimensional moment
dynamics in complex PDE-governed systems.

TL;DR: RoboRefer, a 3D-aware VLM, enhances spatial understanding and reasoning in robots via supervised and reinforcement fine-tuning, outperforming benchmarks like Gemini-2.5-Pro.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving robots' ability to accurately understand and interact with complex 3D scenes, addressing limitations of current VLMs.

Method: Integrates a depth encoder via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and advances reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) with tailored rewards. Uses RefSpatial dataset (20M QA pairs) and RefSpatial-Bench for evaluation.

Result: SFT-trained RoboRefer achieves 89.6% success rate; RFT-trained version surpasses baselines, including Gemini-2.5-Pro by 17.4%.

Conclusion: RoboRefer enables precise spatial understanding and reasoning, adaptable to diverse robots and real-world tasks.

Abstract: Spatial referring is a fundamental capability of embodied robots to interact
with the 3D physical world. However, even with the powerful pretrained vision
language models (VLMs), recent approaches are still not qualified to accurately
understand the complex 3D scenes and dynamically reason about the
instruction-indicated locations for interaction. To this end, we propose
RoboRefer, a 3D-aware VLM that can first achieve precise spatial understanding
by integrating a disentangled but dedicated depth encoder via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboRefer advances generalized multi-step spatial
reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), with metric-sensitive process
reward functions tailored for spatial referring tasks. To support SFT and RFT
training, we introduce RefSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 20M QA pairs (2x
prior), covering 31 spatial relations (vs. 15 prior) and supporting complex
reasoning processes (up to 5 steps). In addition, we introduce
RefSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap in evaluating spatial
referring with multi-step reasoning. Experiments show that SFT-trained
RoboRefer achieves state-of-the-art spatial understanding, with an average
success rate of 89.6%. RFT-trained RoboRefer further outperforms all other
baselines by a large margin, even surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 17.4% in average
accuracy on RefSpatial-Bench. Notably, RoboRefer can be integrated with various
control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots
(e,g., UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.

TL;DR: SPARTA estimates traversability based on approach angles from point clouds using a smooth analytical function, improving efficiency and success rates in off-road autonomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The traversability of terrain depends on the vehicle's state, and learning this interaction requires large datasets and is computationally inefficient.

Method: SPARTA uses a network to output a smooth analytical function over the 1-Sphere, composed of Fourier basis functions, to predict risk distribution for any approach angle.

Result: Achieves a 91% success rate in simulation (vs. 73% baseline) and demonstrates generalization to real-world hardware.

Conclusion: SPARTA efficiently estimates traversability with minimal overhead, improving performance in off-road autonomy.

Abstract: A key open challenge in off-road autonomy is that the traversability of
terrain often depends on the vehicle's state. In particular, some obstacles are
only traversable from some orientations. However, learning this interaction by
encoding the angle of approach as a model input demands a large and diverse
training dataset and is computationally inefficient during planning due to
repeated model inference. To address these challenges, we present SPARTA, a
method for estimating approach angle conditioned traversability from point
clouds. Specifically, we impose geometric structure into our network by
outputting a smooth analytical function over the 1-Sphere that predicts risk
distribution for any angle of approach with minimal overhead and can be reused
for subsequent queries. The function is composed of Fourier basis functions,
which has important advantages for generalization due to their periodic nature
and smoothness. We demonstrate SPARTA both in a high-fidelity simulation
platform, where our model achieves a 91\% success rate crossing a 40m boulder
field (compared to 73\% for the baseline), and on hardware, illustrating the
generalization ability of the model to real-world settings.

Motivation: Lack of diverse and realistic datasets for validating landmine detection algorithms in robotics and computer vision.

Method: Creation of MineInsight dataset with 35 targets, dual-view sensor scans, and multi-spectral images (RGB, VIS-SWIR, LWIR) in daylight and nighttime.

Result: Dataset includes ~38,000 RGB, ~53,000 VIS-SWIR, and ~108,000 LWIR frames, providing a benchmark for detection algorithms.

Conclusion: MineInsight addresses the dataset gap, offering a realistic and diverse benchmark for advancing landmine detection research.

Abstract: The use of robotics in humanitarian demining increasingly involves computer
vision techniques to improve landmine detection capabilities. However, in the
absence of diverse and realistic datasets, the reliable validation of
algorithms remains a challenge for the research community. In this paper, we
introduce MineInsight, a publicly available multi-sensor, multi-spectral
dataset designed for off-road landmine detection. The dataset features 35
different targets (15 landmines and 20 commonly found objects) distributed
along three distinct tracks, providing a diverse and realistic testing
environment. MineInsight is, to the best of our knowledge, the first dataset to
integrate dual-view sensor scans from both an Unmanned Ground Vehicle and its
robotic arm, offering multiple viewpoints to mitigate occlusions and improve
spatial awareness. It features two LiDARs, as well as images captured at
diverse spectral ranges, including visible (RGB, monochrome), visible
short-wave infrared (VIS-SWIR), and long-wave infrared (LWIR). Additionally,
the dataset comes with an estimation of the location of the targets, offering a
benchmark for evaluating detection algorithms. We recorded approximately one
hour of data in both daylight and nighttime conditions, resulting in around
38,000 RGB frames, 53,000 VIS-SWIR frames, and 108,000 LWIR frames. MineInsight

TL;DR: Proposes a method for automatically generating annotated synthetic data in Unreal Engine using photorealistic 3D Gaussian splats, achieving performance comparable to real-world datasets and reducing manual effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual creation of annotated datasets for object detection is time-consuming, error-prone, and lacks diversity, especially in dynamic robotics scenarios like robot soccer.

Method: Leverages Unreal Engine and photorealistic 3D Gaussian splats to generate synthetic data automatically, combining it with real-world data for improved performance.

Result: Synthetic datasets perform comparably to real-world datasets, and combining both enhances object detection performance.

Conclusion: The method provides a scalable, efficient alternative to manual annotation, particularly valuable for robotics applications requiring diverse and dynamic training data.

Abstract: Annotated datasets are critical for training neural networks for object
detection, yet their manual creation is time- and labour-intensive, subjective
to human error, and often limited in diversity. This challenge is particularly
pronounced in the domain of robotics, where diverse and dynamic scenarios
further complicate the creation of representative datasets. To address this, we
propose a novel method for automatically generating annotated synthetic data in
Unreal Engine. Our approach leverages photorealistic 3D Gaussian splats for
rapid synthetic data generation. We demonstrate that synthetic datasets can
achieve performance comparable to that of real-world datasets while
significantly reducing the time required to generate and annotate data.
Additionally, combining real-world and synthetic data significantly increases
object detection performance by leveraging the quality of real-world images
with the easier scalability of synthetic data. To our knowledge, this is the
first application of synthetic data for training object detection algorithms in
the highly dynamic and varied environment of robot soccer. Validation
experiments reveal that a detector trained on synthetic images performs on par
with one trained on manually annotated real-world images when tested on robot
soccer match scenarios. Our method offers a scalable and comprehensive
alternative to traditional dataset creation, eliminating the labour-intensive
error-prone manual annotation process. By generating datasets in a simulator
where all elements are intrinsically known, we ensure accurate annotations
while significantly reducing manual effort, which makes it particularly
valuable for robotics applications requiring diverse and scalable training
data.

Result: SFT-trained RoboRefer achieves 89.6% success rate; RFT-trained version surpasses baselines, including Gemini-2.5-Pro by 17.4%. It enables dynamic task execution across diverse robots.

Conclusion: RoboRefer significantly improves spatial referring capabilities in robots, demonstrating superior performance and versatility in real-world applications.

Abstract: Spatial referring is a fundamental capability of embodied robots to interact
with the 3D physical world. However, even with the powerful pretrained vision
language models (VLMs), recent approaches are still not qualified to accurately
understand the complex 3D scenes and dynamically reason about the
instruction-indicated locations for interaction. To this end, we propose
RoboRefer, a 3D-aware VLM that can first achieve precise spatial understanding
by integrating a disentangled but dedicated depth encoder via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboRefer advances generalized multi-step spatial
reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), with metric-sensitive process
reward functions tailored for spatial referring tasks. To support SFT and RFT
training, we introduce RefSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 20M QA pairs (2x
prior), covering 31 spatial relations (vs. 15 prior) and supporting complex
reasoning processes (up to 5 steps). In addition, we introduce
RefSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap in evaluating spatial
referring with multi-step reasoning. Experiments show that SFT-trained
RoboRefer achieves state-of-the-art spatial understanding, with an average
success rate of 89.6%. RFT-trained RoboRefer further outperforms all other
baselines by a large margin, even surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 17.4% in average
accuracy on RefSpatial-Bench. Notably, RoboRefer can be integrated with various
control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots
(e,g., UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.

### [714] [Learning Smooth State-Dependent Traversability from Dense Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04362)
*Zihao Dong,Alan Papalia,Leonard Jung,Alenna Spiro,Philip R. Osteen,Christa S. Robison,Michael Everett*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SPARTA estimates traversability based on approach angle from point clouds using a smooth analytical function, improving efficiency and success rates in off-road autonomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traversability in off-road autonomy depends on vehicle state, requiring large datasets and inefficient planning. SPARTA addresses this by encoding angle-conditioned traversability.

Method: SPARTA uses a network to output a smooth analytical function over the 1-Sphere, composed of Fourier basis functions, for predicting risk distribution by approach angle.

Result: Achieves 91% success rate in simulation (vs. 73% baseline) and demonstrates real-world generalization on hardware.

Conclusion: SPARTA efficiently estimates traversability with minimal overhead, improving performance and generalization in off-road autonomy.

Abstract: A key open challenge in off-road autonomy is that the traversability of
terrain often depends on the vehicle's state. In particular, some obstacles are
only traversable from some orientations. However, learning this interaction by
encoding the angle of approach as a model input demands a large and diverse
training dataset and is computationally inefficient during planning due to
repeated model inference. To address these challenges, we present SPARTA, a
method for estimating approach angle conditioned traversability from point
clouds. Specifically, we impose geometric structure into our network by
outputting a smooth analytical function over the 1-Sphere that predicts risk
distribution for any angle of approach with minimal overhead and can be reused
for subsequent queries. The function is composed of Fourier basis functions,
which has important advantages for generalization due to their periodic nature
and smoothness. We demonstrate SPARTA both in a high-fidelity simulation
platform, where our model achieves a 91\% success rate crossing a 40m boulder
field (compared to 73\% for the baseline), and on hardware, illustrating the
generalization ability of the model to real-world settings.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MineInsight, a multi-sensor, multi-spectral dataset for landmine detection, addressing the lack of diverse datasets in humanitarian demining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of reliable algorithm validation due to the absence of realistic datasets in humanitarian demining motivates the creation of MineInsight.

Method: The dataset includes 35 targets (15 landmines, 20 common objects) across three tracks, integrating dual-view sensor scans from a UGV and robotic arm, with LiDARs and multi-spectral images (RGB, VIS-SWIR, LWIR).

Result: MineInsight provides ~38,000 RGB, ~53,000 VIS-SWIR, and ~108,000 LWIR frames, with target location estimates, serving as a benchmark for detection algorithms.

Conclusion: MineInsight is a valuable resource for developing and evaluating landmine detection algorithms, available publicly.

Abstract: The use of robotics in humanitarian demining increasingly involves computer
vision techniques to improve landmine detection capabilities. However, in the
absence of diverse and realistic datasets, the reliable validation of
algorithms remains a challenge for the research community. In this paper, we
introduce MineInsight, a publicly available multi-sensor, multi-spectral
dataset designed for off-road landmine detection. The dataset features 35
different targets (15 landmines and 20 commonly found objects) distributed
along three distinct tracks, providing a diverse and realistic testing
environment. MineInsight is, to the best of our knowledge, the first dataset to
integrate dual-view sensor scans from both an Unmanned Ground Vehicle and its
robotic arm, offering multiple viewpoints to mitigate occlusions and improve
spatial awareness. It features two LiDARs, as well as images captured at
diverse spectral ranges, including visible (RGB, monochrome), visible
short-wave infrared (VIS-SWIR), and long-wave infrared (LWIR). Additionally,
the dataset comes with an estimation of the location of the targets, offering a
benchmark for evaluating detection algorithms. We recorded approximately one
hour of data in both daylight and nighttime conditions, resulting in around
38,000 RGB frames, 53,000 VIS-SWIR frames, and 108,000 LWIR frames. MineInsight
serves as a benchmark for developing and evaluating landmine detection
algorithms. Our dataset is available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes a method for automatically generating annotated synthetic data in Unreal Engine using photorealistic 3D Gaussian splats, achieving comparable performance to real-world datasets while reducing annotation effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual creation of annotated datasets for object detection is time-consuming, error-prone, and lacks diversity, especially in dynamic robotics scenarios like robot soccer.

Method: Leverages photorealistic 3D Gaussian splats in Unreal Engine to generate synthetic data, combining it with real-world data for improved performance.

Result: Synthetic datasets perform comparably to real-world datasets, and combining both enhances object detection performance.

Conclusion: The method provides a scalable, accurate, and efficient alternative to manual annotation, particularly beneficial for robotics applications.

Abstract: Annotated datasets are critical for training neural networks for object
detection, yet their manual creation is time- and labour-intensive, subjective
to human error, and often limited in diversity. This challenge is particularly
pronounced in the domain of robotics, where diverse and dynamic scenarios
further complicate the creation of representative datasets. To address this, we
propose a novel method for automatically generating annotated synthetic data in
Unreal Engine. Our approach leverages photorealistic 3D Gaussian splats for
rapid synthetic data generation. We demonstrate that synthetic datasets can
achieve performance comparable to that of real-world datasets while
significantly reducing the time required to generate and annotate data.
Additionally, combining real-world and synthetic data significantly increases
object detection performance by leveraging the quality of real-world images
with the easier scalability of synthetic data. To our knowledge, this is the
first application of synthetic data for training object detection algorithms in
the highly dynamic and varied environment of robot soccer. Validation
experiments reveal that a detector trained on synthetic images performs on par
with one trained on manually annotated real-world images when tested on robot
soccer match scenarios. Our method offers a scalable and comprehensive
alternative to traditional dataset creation, eliminating the labour-intensive
error-prone manual annotation process. By generating datasets in a simulator
where all elements are intrinsically known, we ensure accurate annotations
while significantly reducing manual effort, which makes it particularly
valuable for robotics applications requiring diverse and scalable training
data.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hierarchical framework combining LLM and VLM for heterogeneous multi-robot systems improves adaptability in dynamic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional static models fail in diverse tasks and dynamic environments, necessitating generalizable intelligence for heterogeneous agents.

Method: Uses a prompted LLM for task decomposition and global mapping, and a GridMask-enhanced VLM for local semantic extraction and planning.

Result: Demonstrated adaptability and robustness in a real-world letter-cubes arrangement task.

Conclusion: First integration of VLM-based perception with LLM-driven reasoning in aerial-ground systems, showing promise for dynamic environments.

Abstract: Heterogeneous multi-robot systems show great potential in complex tasks
requiring coordinated hybrid cooperation. However, traditional approaches
relying on static models often struggle with task diversity and dynamic
environments. This highlights the need for generalizable intelligence that can
bridge high-level reasoning with low-level execution across heterogeneous
agents. To address this, we propose a hierarchical framework integrating a
prompted Large Language Model (LLM) and a GridMask-enhanced fine-tuned Vision
Language Model (VLM). The LLM performs task decomposition and global semantic
map construction, while the VLM extracts task-specified semantic labels and 2D
spatial information from aerial images to support local planning. Within this
framework, the aerial robot follows a globally optimized semantic path and
continuously provides bird-view images, guiding the ground robot's local
semantic navigation and manipulation, including target-absent scenarios where
implicit alignment is maintained. Experiments on a real-world letter-cubes
arrangement task demonstrate the framework's adaptability and robustness in
dynamic environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
demonstration of an aerial-ground heterogeneous system integrating VLM-based
perception with LLM-driven task reasoning and motion planning.

Motivation: To enable efficient robot navigation in partially observable environments by leveraging 3D scene graphs and reinforcement learning.

Method: Proposes SGN-CIRL, combining 3D scene graphs with reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and curriculum learning to train agents.

Result: Experiments in Isaac Sim demonstrated higher success rates in challenging navigation tasks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively improves navigation performance and is open-sourced for further development.

Abstract: The 3D scene graph models spatial relationships between objects, enabling the
agent to efficiently navigate in a partially observable environment and predict
the location of the target object.This paper proposes an original framework
named SGN-CIRL (3D Scene Graph-Based Reinforcement Learning Navigation) for
mapless reinforcement learning-based robot navigation with learnable
representation of open-vocabulary 3D scene graph. To accelerate and stabilize
the training of reinforcement learning-based algorithms, the framework also
employs imitation learning and curriculum learning. The first one enables the
agent to learn from demonstrations, while the second one structures the
training process by gradually increasing task complexity from simple to more
advanced scenarios. Numerical experiments conducted in the Isaac Sim
environment showed that using a 3D scene graph for reinforcement learning
significantly increased the success rate in difficult navigation cases. The

Motivation: Gas dynamics and environmental factors complicate olfactory navigation, necessitating a robust calibration method for OIO.

Method: Defines a calibration process for OIO adaptable to various olfaction sensors, tested on a robotic arm.

Result: The calibration improves performance in olfactory navigation tasks compared to cold-start scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed OIO calibration method enhances accuracy in odor source localization, with potential applications in robotic surgery and security screening.

Abstract: Visual inertial odometry (VIO) is a process for fusing visual and kinematic
data to understand a machine's state in a navigation task. Olfactory inertial
odometry (OIO) is an analog to VIO that fuses signals from gas sensors with
inertial data to help a robot navigate by scent. Gas dynamics and environmental
factors introduce disturbances into olfactory navigation tasks that can make
OIO difficult to facilitate. With our work here, we define a process for
calibrating a robot for OIO that generalizes to several olfaction sensor types.
Our focus is specifically on calibrating OIO for centimeter-level accuracy in
localizing an odor source on a slow-moving robot platform to demonstrate use
cases in robotic surgery and touchless security screening. We demonstrate our
process for OIO calibration on a real robotic arm and show how this calibration
improves performance over a cold-start olfactory navigation task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High viscosity and slow mass transport in RTILs prolong CA measurements, necessitating faster techniques.

Method: Uses a mathematical regression approach and inference algorithm on transient current response to predict steady-state parameters.

Result: Validated against standard CA, the method maintains accuracy while drastically cutting measurement time.

Conclusion: Enables faster multiplexing for applications like analytical chemistry, sensors, and battery science.

Abstract: Chronoamperometry (CA) is a fundamental electrochemical technique used for
quantifying redox-active species. However, in room-temperature ionic liquids
(RTILs), the high viscosity and slow mass transport often lead to extended
measurement durations. This paper presents a novel mathematical regression
approach that reduces CA measurement windows to under 1 second, significantly
faster than previously reported methods, which typically require 1-4 seconds or
longer. By applying an inference algorithm to the initial transient current
response, this method accurately predicts steady-state electrochemical
parameters without requiring additional hardware modifications. The approach is
validated through comparison with standard chronoamperometric techniques and is
demonstrated to maintain reasonable accuracy while dramatically reducing data
acquisition time. The implications of this technique are explored in analytical
chemistry, sensor technology, and battery science, where rapid electrochemical
quantification is critical. Our technique is focused on enabling faster
multiplexing of chronoamperometric measurements for rapid olfactory and
electrochemical analysis.

Motivation: Conventional GSA methods lack clinical context, leading to redundant or irrelevant results, which reduce reliability and reproducibility.

Method: cGSA integrates gene cluster detection, enrichment analysis, and large language models to prioritize biologically meaningful pathways.

Result: Benchmarking on 102 gene sets across 19 diseases showed cGSA outperforms baselines by 30%, with expert validation confirming its precision.

Conclusion: cGSA demonstrates potential for uncovering context-specific insights, as shown in melanoma and breast cancer case studies.

Abstract: Gene set analysis (GSA) is a foundational approach for interpreting genomic
data of diseases by linking genes to biological processes. However,
conventional GSA methods overlook clinical context of the analyses, often
generating long lists of enriched pathways with redundant, nonspecific, or
irrelevant results. Interpreting these requires extensive, ad-hoc manual
effort, reducing both reliability and reproducibility. To address this
limitation, we introduce cGSA, a novel AI-driven framework that enhances GSA by
incorporating context-aware pathway prioritization. cGSA integrates gene
cluster detection, enrichment analysis, and large language models to identify
pathways that are not only statistically significant but also biologically
meaningful. Benchmarking on 102 manually curated gene sets across 19 diseases
and ten disease-related biological mechanisms shows that cGSA outperforms
baseline methods by over 30%, with expert validation confirming its increased
precision and interpretability. Two independent case studies in melanoma and
breast cancer further demonstrate its potential to uncover context-specific

*Lei Hsiung,Tianyu Pang,Yung-Chen Tang,Linyue Song,Tsung-Yi Ho,Pin-Yu Chen,Yaoqing Yang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper examines how the similarity between upstream safety-alignment data and downstream fine-tuning tasks affects the robustness of large language models (LLMs) against jailbreaks. High similarity weakens safety guardrails, while low similarity enhances model robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mitigation strategies for LLM jailbreaks focus on reactive measures or fine-tuning adjustments, neglecting the role of upstream safety-alignment data. This paper addresses this gap by analyzing representation similarity.

Method: The study investigates the degradation of safety guardrails by measuring representation similarity between upstream alignment datasets and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Experiments compare high and low similarity scenarios.

Result: High similarity between datasets weakens safety guardrails, increasing jailbreak susceptibility. Low similarity improves robustness, reducing harmfulness scores by up to 10.33%.

Conclusion: Upstream dataset design is crucial for durable safety guardrails. Fine-tuning service providers should prioritize low similarity between alignment and fine-tuning datasets to reduce jailbreak vulnerability.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have underscored their
vulnerability to safety alignment jailbreaks, particularly when subjected to
downstream fine-tuning. However, existing mitigation strategies primarily focus
on reactively addressing jailbreak incidents after safety guardrails have been
compromised, removing harmful gradients during fine-tuning, or continuously
reinforcing safety alignment throughout fine-tuning. As such, they tend to
overlook a critical upstream factor: the role of the original safety-alignment
data. This paper therefore investigates the degradation of safety guardrails
through the lens of representation similarity between upstream alignment
datasets and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that
high similarity between these datasets significantly weakens safety guardrails,
making models more susceptible to jailbreaks. Conversely, low similarity
between these two types of datasets yields substantially more robust models and
thus reduces harmfulness score by up to 10.33%. By highlighting the importance
of upstream dataset design in the building of durable safety guardrails and
reducing real-world vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, these findings offer

TL;DR: RAG systems are vulnerable to stealthy poisoned passage attacks. Existing attacks lack stealth, making detection possible. A new method using attention patterns improves defense, but adaptive attacks challenge its limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address vulnerabilities in RAG systems where poisoned passages can manipulate responses, and to improve detection and mitigation methods.

Method: Formalize stealth using a security game, propose the Normalized Passage Attention Score, and develop the Attention-Variance Filter algorithm to detect poisoned passages.

Result: The method improves accuracy by ~20% over baselines, but adaptive attacks achieve up to 35% success rate, revealing defense challenges.

Conclusion: Attention-based defenses are effective but have limits; adaptive attacks highlight the need for further research to improve stealth and robustness.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are vulnerable to attacks that
inject poisoned passages into the retrieved set, even at low corruption rates.
We show that existing attacks are not designed to be stealthy, allowing
reliable detection and mitigation. We formalize stealth using a
distinguishability-based security game. If a few poisoned passages are designed
to control the response, they must differentiate themselves from benign ones,
inherently compromising stealth. This motivates the need for attackers to
rigorously analyze intermediate signals involved in
generation$\unicode{x2014}$such as attention patterns or next-token probability
distributions$\unicode{x2014}$to avoid easily detectable traces of
manipulation. Leveraging attention patterns, we propose a passage-level
score$\unicode{x2014}$the Normalized Passage Attention
Score$\unicode{x2014}$used by our Attention-Variance Filter algorithm to
identify and filter potentially poisoned passages. This method mitigates
existing attacks, improving accuracy by up to $\sim 20 \%$ over baseline
defenses. To probe the limits of attention-based defenses, we craft stealthier
adaptive attacks that obscure such traces, achieving up to $35 \%$ attack

TL;DR: A framework for fine-tuning LLMs with differential privacy (DP) for multi-abnormality classification in radiology reports, balancing privacy and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate privacy risks in sensitive patient data while maintaining classification performance in radiology reports.

Method: Used 50,232 radiology reports from MIMIC-CXR and CT-RATE datasets, fine-tuned LLMs with DP-LoRA across privacy budgets, and evaluated performance using weighted F1 scores.

Result: DP fine-tuned models achieved comparable performance (F1: 0.88 on MIMIC-CXR, 0.59 on CT-RATE) under moderate privacy, slightly below non-private baselines (0.90, 0.78).

Conclusion: DP-LoRA enables privacy-preserving multi-abnormality classification, addressing challenges in fine-tuning LLMs on medical data.

Abstract: Purpose: This study proposes a framework for fine-tuning large language
models (LLMs) with differential privacy (DP) to perform multi-abnormality
classification on radiology report text. By injecting calibrated noise during
fine-tuning, the framework seeks to mitigate the privacy risks associated with
sensitive patient data and protect against data leakage while maintaining
classification performance. Materials and Methods: We used 50,232 radiology
reports from the publicly available MIMIC-CXR chest radiography and CT-RATE
computed tomography datasets, collected between 2011 and 2019. Fine-tuning of
LLMs was conducted to classify 14 labels from MIMIC-CXR dataset, and 18 labels
from CT-RATE dataset using Differentially Private Low-Rank Adaptation (DP-LoRA)
in high and moderate privacy regimes (across a range of privacy budgets =
{0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0}). Model performance was evaluated using weighted F1
score across three model architectures: BERT-medium, BERT-small, and
ALBERT-base. Statistical analyses compared model performance across different
privacy levels to quantify the privacy-utility trade-off. Results: We observe a
clear privacy-utility trade-off through our experiments on 2 different datasets
and 3 different models. Under moderate privacy guarantees the DP fine-tuned
models achieved comparable weighted F1 scores of 0.88 on MIMIC-CXR and 0.59 on
CT-RATE, compared to non-private LoRA baselines of 0.90 and 0.78, respectively.
Conclusion: Differentially private fine-tuning using LoRA enables effective and
privacy-preserving multi-abnormality classification from radiology reports,
addressing a key challenge in fine-tuning LLMs on sensitive medical data.

*Xuhao Ren,Haotian Liang,Yajie Wang,Chuan Zhang,Zehui Xiong,Liehuang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: BESA is a boosting encoder stealing attack with perturbation recovery to counter perturbation-based defenses, improving surrogate encoder accuracy by up to 24.63%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance encoder stealing attacks under perturbation-based defenses that degrade attack performance.

Method: Combines perturbation detection (to infer defense mechanisms) and perturbation recovery (to restore clean feature vectors) with existing attacks.

Result: BESA improves surrogate encoder accuracy by up to 24.63% against advanced defenses.

Conclusion: BESA effectively overcomes perturbation-based defenses, significantly boosting attack performance.

Abstract: To boost the encoder stealing attack under the perturbation-based defense
that hinders the attack performance, we propose a boosting encoder stealing
attack with perturbation recovery named BESA. It aims to overcome
perturbation-based defenses. The core of BESA consists of two modules:
perturbation detection and perturbation recovery, which can be combined with
canonical encoder stealing attacks. The perturbation detection module utilizes
the feature vectors obtained from the target encoder to infer the defense
mechanism employed by the service provider. Once the defense mechanism is
detected, the perturbation recovery module leverages the well-designed
generative model to restore a clean feature vector from the perturbed one.
Through extensive evaluations based on various datasets, we demonstrate that
BESA significantly enhances the surrogate encoder accuracy of existing encoder
stealing attacks by up to 24.63\% when facing state-of-the-art defenses and
combinations of multiple defenses.

*Pablo Fernández Saura,K. R. Jayaram,Vatche Isahagian,Jorge Bernal Bernabé,Antonio Skarmeta*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A framework using LLMs and RAG automates attack mitigation policy compliance, improving precision and recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the need for robust, adaptive security enforcement in complex computing environments.

Method: Leverages LLMs with RAG to decompose policies into tasks and translate them into API calls.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score with RAG.

Conclusion: The framework effectively automates security policy compliance, outperforming non-RAG baselines.

Abstract: The complexity of modern computing environments and the growing
sophistication of cyber threats necessitate a more robust, adaptive, and
automated approach to security enforcement. In this paper, we present a
framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) for automating attack
mitigation policy compliance through an innovative combination of in-context
learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We begin by describing how
our system collects and manages both tool and API specifications, storing them
in a vector database to enable efficient retrieval of relevant information. We
then detail the architectural pipeline that first decomposes high-level
mitigation policies into discrete tasks and subsequently translates each task
into a set of actionable API calls. Our empirical evaluation, conducted using
publicly available CTI policies in STIXv2 format and Windows API documentation,
demonstrates significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score when
employing RAG compared to a non-RAG baseline.

*Robert J. Joyce,Gideon Miller,Phil Roth,Richard Zak,Elliott Zaresky-Williams,Hyrum Anderson,Edward Raff,James Holt*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: EMBER2024 is a new dataset addressing limitations in existing malware datasets by including diverse file formats, multiple classification tasks, and evasive malware samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing malware datasets are limited in scope, platform coverage, and lack evasive samples, hindering comprehensive malware analysis research.

Method: The EMBER2024 dataset includes 3.2 million files with hashes, metadata, feature vectors, and labels, supporting seven classification tasks. It also introduces a 'challenge' set of undetected malware.

Result: EMBER2024 enables holistic evaluation of malware classifiers and includes EMBER feature version 3 with new feature types.

Conclusion: The dataset promotes reproducibility and advances malware research by addressing gaps in existing datasets.

Abstract: A lack of accessible data has historically restricted malware analysis
research, and practitioners have relied heavily on datasets provided by
industry sources to advance. Existing public datasets are limited by narrow
scope - most include files targeting a single platform, have labels supporting
just one type of malware classification task, and make no effort to capture the
evasive files that make malware detection difficult in practice. We present
EMBER2024, a new dataset that enables holistic evaluation of malware
classifiers. Created in collaboration with the authors of EMBER2017 and
EMBER2018, the EMBER2024 dataset includes hashes, metadata, feature vectors,
and labels for more than 3.2 million files from six file formats. Our dataset
supports the training and evaluation of machine learning models on seven
malware classification tasks, including malware detection, malware family
classification, and malware behavior identification. EMBER2024 is the first to
include a collection of malicious files that initially went undetected by a set
of antivirus products, creating a "challenge" set to assess classifier
performance against evasive malware. This work also introduces EMBER feature
version 3, with added support for several new feature types. We are releasing
the EMBER2024 dataset to promote reproducibility and empower researchers in the
pursuit of new malware research topics.

### [733] [Membership Inference Attacks on Sequence Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05126)
*Lorenzo Rossi,Michael Aerni,Jie Zhang,Florian Tramèr*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper addresses privacy leakage in sequence models by leveraging sequential correlations to improve memorization audits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tools for auditing privacy risks in sequence models are insufficient due to mismatched assumptions.

Method: Adapts a state-of-the-art membership inference attack to model within-sequence correlations.

Result: The adapted attack improves memorization audit effectiveness without added computational costs.

Conclusion: The work advances reliable memorization audits for large sequence models.

Abstract: Sequence models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and autoregressive
image generators, have a tendency to memorize and inadvertently leak sensitive
information. While this tendency has critical legal implications, existing
tools are insufficient to audit the resulting risks. We hypothesize that those
tools' shortcomings are due to mismatched assumptions. Thus, we argue that
effectively measuring privacy leakage in sequence models requires leveraging
the correlations inherent in sequential generation. To illustrate this, we
adapt a state-of-the-art membership inference attack to explicitly model
within-sequence correlations, thereby demonstrating how a strong existing
attack can be naturally extended to suit the structure of sequence models.
Through a case study, we show that our adaptations consistently improve the
effectiveness of memorization audits without introducing additional
computational costs. Our work hence serves as an important stepping stone
toward reliable memorization audits for large sequence models.

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a calculus to verify probabilistic queries and defines four trustworthiness notions for ML system copies, analyzing their relations and composition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of methods for verifying trustworthiness preservation in copied ML systems, a critical concern in responsible AI.

Method: Develops a calculus for modeling and verifying probabilistic queries, defining four trustworthiness notions (Justifiably, Equally, Weakly, Almost) and studying their relations.

Result: Provides a computational tool to check trustworthiness of copied systems by analyzing their behavior relative to the original.

Conclusion: The framework offers a systematic way to verify trustworthiness in copied ML systems, contributing to responsible AI practices.

Abstract: A common practice of ML systems development concerns the training of the same
model under different data sets, and the use of the same (training and test)
sets for different learning models. The first case is a desirable practice for
identifying high quality and unbiased training conditions. The latter case
coincides with the search for optimal models under a common dataset for
training. These differently obtained systems have been considered akin to
copies. In the quest for responsible AI, a legitimate but hardly investigated
question is how to verify that trustworthiness is preserved by copies. In this
paper we introduce a calculus to model and verify probabilistic complex queries
over data and define four distinct notions: Justifiably, Equally, Weakly and
Almost Trustworthy which can be checked analysing the (partial) behaviour of
the copy with respect to its original. We provide a study of the relations
between these notions of trustworthiness, and how they compose with each other
and under logical operations. The aim is to offer a computational tool to check
the trustworthiness of possibly complex systems copied from an original whose
behavour is known.

TL;DR: The paper advocates for computational methods to reuse qualitative data, proposing a scheme for secondary analysis and addressing challenges in data sharing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the untapped potential of qualitative data and the benefits of computationally intensive secondary analysis.

Method: Proposes a scheme for computationally intensive secondary analysis of qualitative data.

Result: Identifies opportunities for cross-contextual and longitudinal research, along with challenges in data sharing.

Conclusion: Computational secondary analysis can innovate research designs but faces challenges in data reuse.

Abstract: This paper draws attention to the potential of computational methods in
reworking data generated in past qualitative studies. While qualitative
inquiries often produce rich data through rigorous and resource-intensive
processes, much of this data usually remains unused. In this paper, we first
make a general case for secondary analysis of qualitative data by discussing
its benefits, distinctions, and epistemological aspects. We then argue for
opportunities with computationally intensive secondary analysis, highlighting
the possibility of drawing on data assemblages spanning multiple contexts and
timeframes to address cross-contextual and longitudinal research phenomena and
questions. We propose a scheme to perform computationally intensive secondary
analysis and advance ideas on how this approach can help facilitate the
development of innovative research designs. Finally, we enumerate some key
challenges and ongoing concerns associated with qualitative data sharing and
reuse.

### [736] [Time to Talk: LLM Agents for Asynchronous Group Communication in Mafia Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05309)
*Niv Eckhaus,Uri Berger,Gabriel Stanovsky*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent that decides both what and when to speak, evaluated in online Mafia games, performing on par with humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world communication is often asynchronous (e.g., group chats, meetings), but LLMs are typically used in synchronous settings. This work addresses the gap by developing an agent for asynchronous interactions.

Method: An adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent is developed to decide when and what to speak. It is evaluated using a dataset of online Mafia games with human and agent participants.

Result: The agent performs similarly to humans in game performance and blending in, with behavior mirroring human timing but differing in message content.

Conclusion: The work advances LLM integration into realistic asynchronous human group settings, with potential applications in team discussions, education, and professional environments.

Abstract: LLMs are used predominantly in synchronous communication, where a human user
and a model communicate in alternating turns. In contrast, many real-world
settings are inherently asynchronous. For example, in group chats, online team
meetings, or social games, there is no inherent notion of turns; therefore, the
decision of when to speak forms a crucial part of the participant's decision
making. In this work, we develop an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent which, in
addition to determining what to say, also decides when to say it. To evaluate
our agent, we collect a unique dataset of online Mafia games, including both
human participants, as well as our asynchronous agent. Overall, our agent
performs on par with human players, both in game performance, as well as in its
ability to blend in with the other human players. Our analysis shows that the
agent's behavior in deciding when to speak closely mirrors human patterns,
although differences emerge in message content. We release all our data and
code to support and encourage further research for more realistic asynchronous
communication between LLM agents. This work paves the way for integration of
LLMs into realistic human group settings, from assistance in team discussions
to educational and professional environments where complex social dynamics must
be navigated.

*Botao Amber Hu,Helena Rong*

TL;DR: The paper explores whether open Artificial Life (ALife) systems, like Spore.fun, using decentralized infrastructure and economic incentives, can achieve Open-Ended Evolution (OEE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional closed ALife systems plateau in novelty. Open systems, like Spore.fun, may sustain OEE by interacting with environments via decentralized networks.

Method: Case study of Spore.fun, analyzing autonomous on-chain AI agents' behaviors and evolution using digital ethology.

Result: Findings suggest open ALife systems with economic incentives and decentralized substrates could enable sustained OEE.

Conclusion: Open ALife systems 'in-the-wild' may finally achieve OEE, sparking further research and discussion.

Abstract: In Artificial Life (ALife) research, replicating Open-Ended Evolution
(OEE)-the continuous emergence of novelty observed in biological life-has
traditionally been pursued within isolated closed system simulations, such as
Tierra and Avida, which have typically plateaued after an initial burst of
novelty, failing to achieve sustained OEE. Scholars suggest that OEE requires
an "open" system that continually exchanges information or energy with its
environment. A recent technological innovation in decentralized physical
infrastructure networks (DePIN) providing permissionless computational
substrates enables deploying large language model (LLM)-based AI agents on
blockchains integrated with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). This enables
on-chain agents to operate autonomously "in the wild," achieving
self-sovereignty without human oversight. These agents can control their own
social media accounts and cryptocurrency wallets, allowing them to interact
directly with blockchain-based financial networks and broader human social
media. Building on this new paradigm of on-chain agents, Spore.fun is a recent
real-world AI evolution experiment that enables autonomous breeding and
evolution of new on-chain agents. This paper presents a detailed case study of
Spore.fun, examining agent behaviors and their evolutionary trajectories
through digital ethology. We aim to spark discussion about whether "open" ALife
systems "in-the-wild," based on permissionless computational substrates and
driven by economic incentives to interact with their environment, could finally
achieve the long-sought goal of OEE.

*Mengda Ji,Genjiu Xu,Liying Wang*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper addresses credit assignment in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) by proposing CORA, a coalition-level method that ensures rational advantage decomposition and outperforms baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MARL methods often fail to account for distinct agent contributions at the coalition level, leading to suboptimal policy updates.

Method: Proposes Coalitional Rational Advantage Decomposition (CORA), which evaluates coalitional advantages via marginal contributions and uses cooperative game theory's core solution for rational decomposition. Random coalition sampling reduces computational costs.

Result: CORA outperforms baselines in matrix games, differential games, and multi-agent collaboration tasks, especially in scenarios with multiple local optima.

Conclusion: Coalition-aware credit assignment, as demonstrated by CORA, is crucial for improving MARL performance.

Abstract: This work focuses on the credit assignment problem in cooperative multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Sharing the global advantage among agents often
leads to suboptimal policy updates as it fails to account for the distinct
contributions of agents. Although numerous methods consider global or
individual contributions for credit assignment, a detailed analysis at the
coalition level remains lacking in many approaches. This work analyzes the
over-updating problem during multi-agent policy updates from a coalition-level
perspective. To address this issue, we propose a credit assignment method
called Coalitional Rational Advantage Decomposition (CORA). CORA evaluates
coalitional advantages via marginal contributions from all possible coalitions
and decomposes advantages using the core solution from cooperative game theory,
ensuring coalitional rationality. To reduce computational overhead, CORA
employs random coalition sampling. Experiments on matrix games, differential
games, and multi-agent collaboration benchmarks demonstrate that CORA
outperforms strong baselines, particularly in tasks with multiple local optima.
These findings highlight the importance of coalition-aware credit assignment
for improving MARL performance.

TL;DR: HoAs-PALN is a multi-agent scheduling algorithm for post-disaster environments, reducing decision time and improving task completion rates through adaptive dimensionality reduction and local Nash equilibrium games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sensing technologies struggle with adaptability and efficiency in complex post-disaster environments, necessitating a better solution for timely information collection.

Method: HoAs-PALN uses adaptive dimensionality reduction in matching and local Nash equilibrium games to optimize collaboration among UAVs, workers, and vehicles.

Result: HoAs-PALN outperforms baselines (GREEDY, K-WTA, MADL, MARL) with 64.12%, 46.48%, 16.55%, and 14.03% higher task completion rates, and decisions take <10 seconds.

Conclusion: HoAs-PALN is effective for dynamic post-disaster environments, enhancing sensing scheduling efficiency and adaptability.

Abstract: Natural disasters have caused significant losses to human society, and the
timely and efficient acquisition of post-disaster environmental information is
crucial for the effective implementation of rescue operations. Due to the
complexity of post-disaster environments, existing sensing technologies face
challenges such as weak environmental adaptability, insufficient specialized
sensing capabilities, and limited practicality of sensing solutions. This paper
explores the heterogeneous multi-agent online autonomous collaborative
scheduling algorithm HoAs-PALN, aimed at achieving efficient collection of
post-disaster environmental information. HoAs-PALN is realized through adaptive
dimensionality reduction in the matching process and local Nash equilibrium
game, facilitating autonomous collaboration among time-dependent UAVs, workers
and vehicles to enhance sensing scheduling. (1) In terms of adaptive
dimensionality reduction during the matching process, HoAs-PALN significantly
reduces scheduling decision time by transforming a five-dimensional matching
process into two categories of three-dimensional matching processes; (2)
Regarding the local Nash equilibrium game, HoAs-PALN combines the softmax
function to optimize behavior selection probabilities and introduces a local
Nash equilibrium determination mechanism to ensure scheduling decision
performance. Finally, we conducted detailed experiments based on extensive
real-world and simulated data. Compared with the baselines (GREEDY, K-WTA, MADL
and MARL), HoAs-PALN improves task completion rates by 64.12%, 46.48%, 16.55%,
and 14.03% on average, respectively, while each online scheduling decision
takes less than 10 seconds, demonstrating its effectiveness in dynamic
post-disaster environments.

To control\ntheir propagation, Multimodal Misinformation Detection (MMD) becomes an active\ntopic in the community to automatically identify misinformation. Previous MMD\nmethods focus on supervising detectors by collecting offline data. However, in\nreal-world scenarios, new events always continually emerge, making MMD models\ntrained on offline data consistently outdated and ineffective. To address this\nissue, training MMD models under online data streams is an alternative,\ninducing an emerging task named continual MMD. Unfortunately, it is hindered by\ntwo major challenges. First, training on new data consistently decreases the\ndetection performance on past data, named past knowledge forgetting.

Latent reasoning tackles this\nbottleneck by performing multi-step inference entirely in the model's\ncontinuous hidden state, eliminating token-level supervision. To advance latent\nreasoning research, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of the\nemerging field of latent reasoning. We begin by examining the foundational role\nof neural network layers as the computational substrate for reasoning,\nhighlighting how hierarchical representations support complex transformations.\nNext, we explore diverse latent reasoning methodologies, including\nactivation-based recurrence, hidden state propagation, and fine-tuning\nstrategies that compress or internalize explicit reasoning traces. Finally, we\ndiscuss advanced paradigms such as infinite-depth latent reasoning via masked\ndiffusion models, which enable globally consistent and reversible reasoning\nprocesses. By unifying these perspectives, we aim to clarify the conceptual\nlandscape of latent reasoning and chart future directions for research at the\nfrontier of LLM cognition.

As the key\ntechnique to implement the personalized learning, learning path recommendation\nsequentially recommends personalized learning items such as lectures and\nexercises. Advances in deep learning, particularly deep reinforcement learning,\nhave made modeling such recommendations more practical and effective. This\npaper proposes a multi-task LSTM model that enhances learning path\nrecommendation by leveraging shared information across tasks. The approach\nreframes learning path recommendation as a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq)\nprediction problem, generating personalized learning paths from a learner's\nhistorical interactions. The model uses a shared LSTM layer to capture common\nfeatures for both learning path recommendation and deep knowledge tracing,\nalong with task-specific LSTM layers for each objective. To avoid redundant\nrecommendations, a non-repeat loss penalizes repeated items within the\nrecommended learning path. Experiments on the ASSIST09 dataset show that the\nproposed model significantly outperforms baseline methods for the learning path\nrecommendation.", "AI": {"tldr": "A multi-task LSTM model enhances personalized learning path recommendations by leveraging shared information across tasks, outperforming baselines on the ASSIST09 dataset.", "motivation": "Personalized learning requires adaptive content and pacing, with learning path recommendation being key.

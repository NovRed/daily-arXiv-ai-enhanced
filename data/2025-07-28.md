<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of various feature extraction techniques, particularly ViTs, in advancing computer vision.

Method: Analyzes architectures like ViTs (patch embedding, positional encoding, multi-head self-attention) and compares them with CNNs, GANs, and traditional methods.

Result: ViTs outperform CNNs, but the study also identifies their limitations and practical applications.

Conclusion: ViTs show promise in computer vision but require further exploration to address their limitations.

Abstract: This study examines various feature extraction techniques in computer vision,
the primary focus of which is on Vision Transformers (ViTs) and other
approaches such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), deep feature models,
traditional approaches (SIFT, SURF, ORB), and non-contrastive and contrastive
feature models. Emphasizing ViTs, the report summarizes their architecture,
including patch embedding, positional encoding, and multi-head self-attention
mechanisms with which they overperform conventional convolutional neural
networks (CNNs). Experimental results determine the merits and limitations of
both methods and their utilitarian applications in advancing computer vision.

### [4] [Adapt, But Don't Forget: Fine-Tuning and Contrastive Routing for Lane Detection under Distribution Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18653)
*Mohammed Abdul Hafeez Khan,Parth Ganeriwala,Sarah M. Lehman,Siddhartha Bhattacharyya,Amy Alvarez,Natasha Neogi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses catastrophic forgetting in lane detection models due to cross-dataset distribution shifts by proposing a parameter-efficient adaptation framework with dynamic routing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lane detection models suffer from severe catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuned on new datasets, even within the same domain.

Method: Train a base model on a source dataset, adapt to target datasets via separate branches, fine-tune selectively, and use supervised contrastive learning for dynamic routing.

Result: Achieves near-optimal F1-scores with fewer parameters than training separate models for each distribution.

Conclusion: The framework enables efficient adaptation to new datasets while mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Lane detection models are often evaluated in a closed-world setting, where
training and testing occur on the same dataset. We observe that, even within
the same domain, cross-dataset distribution shifts can cause severe
catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. To address this, we first train a
base model on a source distribution and then adapt it to each new target
distribution by creating separate branches, fine-tuning only selected
components while keeping the original source branch fixed. Based on a
component-wise analysis, we identify effective fine-tuning strategies for
target distributions that enable parameter-efficient adaptation. At inference
time, we propose using a supervised contrastive learning model to identify the
input distribution and dynamically route it to the corresponding branch. Our
framework achieves near-optimal F1-scores while using significantly fewer
parameters than training separate models for each distribution.

### [5] [Part Segmentation of Human Meshes via Multi-View Human Parsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18655)
*James Dickens,Kamyar Hamad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper bridges point cloud deep learning and human parsing by enabling per-vertex semantic segmentation of human meshes using a novel pseudo-ground truth pipeline and memory-efficient sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combine advancements in point cloud deep learning and human parsing for accurate semantic segmentation of human meshes without relying on texture.

Method: Developed a pseudo-ground truth pipeline for Thuman2.1 dataset, introduced windowed iterative FPS with space-filling curve-based serialization, and used PointTransformer for geometric segmentation.

Result: The approach achieved effective and accurate semantic parsing of human meshes.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully bridges the two domains, offering a texture-independent solution for human mesh segmentation.

Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud deep learning have led to models that achieve
high per-part labeling accuracy on large-scale point clouds, using only the raw
geometry of unordered point sets. In parallel, the field of human parsing
focuses on predicting body part and clothing/accessory labels from images. This
work aims to bridge these two domains by enabling per-vertex semantic
segmentation of large-scale human meshes. To achieve this, a pseudo-ground
truth labeling pipeline is developed for the Thuman2.1 dataset: meshes are
first aligned to a canonical pose, segmented from multiple viewpoints, and the
resulting point-level labels are then backprojected onto the original mesh to
produce per-point pseudo ground truth annotations. Subsequently, a novel,
memory-efficient sampling strategy is introduced, a windowed iterative farthest
point sampling (FPS) with space-filling curve-based serialization to
effectively downsample the point clouds. This is followed by a purely geometric
segmentation using PointTransformer, enabling semantic parsing of human meshes
without relying on texture information. Experimental results confirm the
effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach.

### [6] [ShrinkBox: Backdoor Attack on Object Detection to Disrupt Collision Avoidance in Machine Learning-based Advanced Driver Assistance Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18656)
*Muhammad Zaeem Shahzad,Muhammad Abdullah Hanif,Bassem Ouni,Muhammad Shafique*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ShrinkBox, a backdoor attack on ML-ADAS collision avoidance systems, subtly shrinking bounding boxes to disrupt distance estimation without detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose security vulnerabilities in ML-ADAS, particularly in cost-effective systems relying on camera inputs, which are critical for road safety.

Method: ShrinkBox manipulates ground truth bounding boxes in training data, tested on YOLOv9m with the KITTI dataset, achieving high attack success with minimal poisoning.

Result: ShrinkBox achieves 96% ASR with 4% poisoning, increasing MAE in distance estimation by over 3x, potentially delaying or preventing collision warnings.

Conclusion: ShrinkBox highlights severe security risks in ML-ADAS, urging the need for robust defenses against subtle backdoor attacks in safety-critical systems.

Abstract: Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) significantly enhance road safety
by detecting potential collisions and alerting drivers. However, their reliance
on expensive sensor technologies such as LiDAR and radar limits accessibility,
particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Machine learning-based ADAS
(ML-ADAS), leveraging deep neural networks (DNNs) with only standard camera
input, offers a cost-effective alternative. Critical to ML-ADAS is the
collision avoidance feature, which requires the ability to detect objects and
estimate their distances accurately. This is achieved with specialized DNNs
like YOLO, which provides real-time object detection, and a lightweight,
detection-wise distance estimation approach that relies on key features
extracted from the detections like bounding box dimensions and size. However,
the robustness of these systems is undermined by security vulnerabilities in
object detectors. In this paper, we introduce ShrinkBox, a novel backdoor
attack targeting object detection in collision avoidance ML-ADAS. Unlike
existing attacks that manipulate object class labels or presence, ShrinkBox
subtly shrinks ground truth bounding boxes. This attack remains undetected in
dataset inspections and standard benchmarks while severely disrupting
downstream distance estimation. We demonstrate that ShrinkBox can be realized
in the YOLOv9m object detector at an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 96%, with
only a 4% poisoning ratio in the training instances of the KITTI dataset.
Furthermore, given the low error targets introduced in our relaxed poisoning
strategy, we find that ShrinkBox increases the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in
downstream distance estimation by more than 3x on poisoned samples, potentially
resulting in delays or prevention of collision warnings altogether.

### [7] [VGS-ATD: Robust Distributed Learning for Multi-Label Medical Image Classification Under Heterogeneous and Imbalanced Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18657)
*Zehui Zhao,Laith Alzubaidi,Haider A. Alwzwazy,Jinglan Zhang,Yuantong Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VGS-ATD is a novel distributed learning framework addressing privacy, data heterogeneity, and scalability in medical imaging, outperforming centralized and swarm learning with 92.7% accuracy and 50% lower costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centralized learning risks privacy, while decentralized methods like federated and swarm learning struggle with data imbalance and inefficiency. Clinical environments need scalable AI systems resilient to catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Proposed VGS-ATD, a distributed learning framework, evaluated on 30 datasets and 80 labels across nodes.

Result: VGS-ATD achieved 92.7% accuracy, outperforming centralized (84.9%) and swarm learning (72.99%), with only a 1% accuracy drop after expansion and 50% cost reduction.

Conclusion: VGS-ATD is efficient, scalable, and resilient, making it suitable for dynamic clinical environments.

Abstract: In recent years, advanced deep learning architectures have shown strong
performance in medical imaging tasks. However, the traditional centralized
learning paradigm poses serious privacy risks as all data is collected and
trained on a single server. To mitigate this challenge, decentralized
approaches such as federated learning and swarm learning have emerged, allowing
model training on local nodes while sharing only model weights. While these
methods enhance privacy, they struggle with heterogeneous and imbalanced data
and suffer from inefficiencies due to frequent communication and the
aggregation of weights. More critically, the dynamic and complex nature of
clinical environments demands scalable AI systems capable of continuously
learning from diverse modalities and multilabels. Yet, both centralized and
decentralized models are prone to catastrophic forgetting during system
expansion, often requiring full model retraining to incorporate new data. To
address these limitations, we propose VGS-ATD, a novel distributed learning
framework. To validate VGS-ATD, we evaluate it in experiments spanning 30
datasets and 80 independent labels across distributed nodes, VGS-ATD achieved
an overall accuracy of 92.7%, outperforming centralized learning (84.9%) and
swarm learning (72.99%), while federated learning failed under these conditions
due to high requirements on computational resources. VGS-ATD also demonstrated
strong scalability, with only a 1% drop in accuracy on existing nodes after
expansion, compared to a 20% drop in centralized learning, highlighting its
resilience to catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, it reduced computational
costs by up to 50% relative to both centralized and swarm learning, confirming
its superior efficiency and scalability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores fuzzy logic's role in computer vision for handling uncertainty, noise, and imprecision, highlighting its advantages in object recognition, segmentation, and feature extraction. It reviews key techniques and applications, including integration with deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address uncertainty and imprecision in image data, leveraging fuzzy logic's ability to model gradual transitions and human-like reasoning for improved computer vision tasks.

Method: Discusses fuzzy techniques like fuzzy clustering, fuzzy inference systems, type-2 fuzzy sets, and fuzzy rule-based decision-making, along with integration with deep learning models like CNNs.

Conclusion: Fuzzy logic is a promising approach for computer vision, with emerging trends like hybrid fuzzy-deep learning models and explainable AI further expanding its potential.

Abstract: Computer vision applications are omnipresent nowadays. The current paper
explores the use of fuzzy logic in computer vision, stressing its role in
handling uncertainty, noise, and imprecision in image data. Fuzzy logic is able
to model gradual transitions and human-like reasoning and provides a promising
approach to computer vision. Fuzzy approaches offer a way to improve object
recognition, image segmentation, and feature extraction by providing more
adaptable and interpretable solutions compared to traditional methods. We
discuss key fuzzy techniques, including fuzzy clustering, fuzzy inference
systems, type-2 fuzzy sets, and fuzzy rule-based decision-making. The paper
also discusses various applications, including medical imaging, autonomous
systems, and industrial inspection. Additionally, we explore the integration of
fuzzy logic with deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) to enhance performance in complex vision tasks. Finally, we examine
emerging trends such as hybrid fuzzy-deep learning models and explainable AI.

### [9] [Eyes Will Shut: A Vision-Based Next GPS Location Prediction Model by Reinforcement Learning from Visual Map Feed Back](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18661)
*Ruixing Zhang,Yang Zhang,Tongyu Zhu,Leilei Sun,Weifeng Lv*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a human-like approach for next-location prediction using Vision-Language Models (VLMs), proposing Vision-Guided Location Search (VGLS) and VLMLocPredictor, achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models lack human-like reasoning over maps for trajectory prediction, while VLMs offer strong visual perception and reasoning capabilities.

Method: Proposes VGLS to test VLM capabilities, then VLMLocPredictor with SFT tasks and reinforcement learning for self-improvement.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance and superior cross-city generalization on datasets from four cities.

Conclusion: VLMs enable human-like trajectory prediction, with VLMLocPredictor outperforming LLM-based approaches.

Abstract: Next Location Prediction is a fundamental task in the study of human
mobility, with wide-ranging applications in transportation planning, urban
governance, and epidemic forecasting. In practice, when humans attempt to
predict the next location in a trajectory, they often visualize the trajectory
on a map and reason based on road connectivity and movement trends. However,
the vast majority of existing next-location prediction models do not reason
over maps \textbf{in the way that humans do}. Fortunately, the recent
development of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has demonstrated strong
capabilities in visual perception and even visual reasoning. This opens up a
new possibility: by rendering both the road network and trajectory onto an
image and leveraging the reasoning abilities of VLMs, we can enable models to
perform trajectory inference in a human-like manner. To explore this idea, we
first propose a method called Vision-Guided Location Search (VGLS), which
evaluates whether a general-purpose VLM is capable of trajectory-based
reasoning without modifying any of its internal parameters. Based on insights
from the VGLS results, we further propose our main approach: VLMLocPredictor,
which is composed of two stages: In the first stage, we design two Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) tasks that help the VLM understand road network and
trajectory structures and acquire basic reasoning ability on such visual
inputs. In the second stage, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Visual
Map Feedback, enabling the model to self-improve its next-location prediction
ability through interaction with the environment. Experiments conducted on
datasets from four different cities show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits superior cross-city
generalization compared to other LLM-based approaches.

### [10] [Gen-AI Police Sketches with Stable Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18667)
*Nicholas Fidalgo,Aaron Contreras,Katherine Harvey,Johnny Ni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores multimodal AI for suspect sketching, comparing three models: a baseline Stable Diffusion, a CLIP-integrated version, and a novel LoRA fine-tuned approach. The baseline performed best in metrics like SSIM and PSNR, while the fine-tuned model improved perceptual similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate and enhance suspect sketching using multimodal AI, addressing the need for better alignment between text descriptions and generated sketches.

Method: Three pipelines were tested: (1) baseline Stable Diffusion, (2) CLIP-integrated Stable Diffusion, and (3) LoRA fine-tuned CLIP with Stable Diffusion. Ablation studies and performance metrics (SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS) were used for evaluation.

Result: Model 1 (baseline) achieved the highest SSIM (0.72) and PSNR (25 dB). Model 3 improved perceptual similarity (LPIPS) but lagged in structural metrics. Model 1 produced the clearest sketches.

Conclusion: The baseline Stable Diffusion model is robust for suspect sketching, though fine-tuning CLIP improves perceptual alignment. Simplicity may outperform complexity in this task.

Abstract: This project investigates the use of multimodal AI-driven approaches to
automate and enhance suspect sketching. Three pipelines were developed and
evaluated: (1) baseline image-to-image Stable Diffusion model, (2) same model
integrated with a pre-trained CLIP model for text-image alignment, and (3)
novel approach incorporating LoRA fine-tuning of the CLIP model, applied to
self-attention and cross-attention layers, and integrated with Stable
Diffusion. An ablation study confirmed that fine-tuning both self- and
cross-attention layers yielded the best alignment between text descriptions and
sketches. Performance testing revealed that Model 1 achieved the highest
structural similarity (SSIM) of 0.72 and a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of
25 dB, outperforming Model 2 and Model 3. Iterative refinement enhanced
perceptual similarity (LPIPS), with Model 3 showing improvement over Model 2
but still trailing Model 1. Qualitatively, sketches generated by Model 1
demonstrated the clearest facial features, highlighting its robustness as a
baseline despite its simplicity.

### [11] [Advancing Vision-based Human Action Recognition: Exploring Vision-Language CLIP Model for Generalisation in Domain-Independent Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18675)
*Sanyam Jain,Marsha Mariya Kappan,Vijeta Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates CLIP for human action recognition, identifies its limitations under masking strategies, and proposes a noise-based enhancement to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human action recognition is vital in healthcare, but traditional models struggle with generalization. Vision-language models like CLIP offer potential solutions.

Method: CLIP is tested on UCF-101 with three masking strategies (black, feature-specific, isolation). A noise-based enhancement is proposed to address limitations.

Result: CLIP shows inconsistent performance under masking. The proposed noise method improves accuracy and reduces bias.

Conclusion: Challenges remain for clinical applications, but future work can enhance generalizability in healthcare.

Abstract: Human action recognition plays a critical role in healthcare and medicine,
supporting applications such as patient behavior monitoring, fall detection,
surgical robot supervision, and procedural skill assessment. While traditional
models like CNNs and RNNs have achieved moderate success, they often struggle
to generalize across diverse and complex actions. Recent advancements in
vision-language models, especially the transformer-based CLIP model, offer
promising capabilities for generalizing action recognition from video data. In
this work, we evaluate CLIP on the UCF-101 dataset and systematically analyze
its performance under three masking strategies: (1) percentage-based and
shape-based black masking at 10%, 30%, and 50%, (2) feature-specific masking to
suppress bias-inducing elements, and (3) isolation masking that retains only
class-specific regions. Our results reveal that CLIP exhibits inconsistent
behavior and frequent misclassifications, particularly when essential visual
cues are obscured. To overcome these limitations, we propose incorporating
class-specific noise, learned via a custom loss function, to reinforce
attention to class-defining features. This enhancement improves classification
accuracy and model confidence while reducing bias. We conclude with a
discussion on the challenges of applying such models in clinical domains and
outline directions for future work to improve generalizability across
domain-independent healthcare scenarios.

### [12] [HeartUnloadNet: A Weakly-Supervised Cycle-Consistent Graph Network for Predicting Unloaded Cardiac Geometry from Diastolic States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18677)
*Siyu Mu,Wei Xuan Chan,Choon Hwai Yap*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HeartUnloadNet is a deep learning framework that predicts the unloaded left ventricular shape from clinical images, outperforming traditional methods in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The unloaded cardiac geometry is crucial for biomechanical modeling, but estimating it from clinical images is challenging. Traditional methods are computationally expensive.

Method: HeartUnloadNet uses a graph attention architecture and cycle-consistency strategy to predict the unloaded LV shape from an end-diastolic mesh, incorporating biophysical priors.

Result: The model achieves sub-millimeter accuracy (DSC 0.986, HD 0.083 cm) and is 10^5 times faster than traditional solvers, even with limited training data.

Conclusion: HeartUnloadNet offers a scalable, accurate, and fast alternative to inverse FE solvers, enabling real-time clinical applications.

Abstract: The unloaded cardiac geometry (i.e., the state of the heart devoid of luminal
pressure) serves as a valuable zero-stress and zero-strain reference and is
critical for personalized biomechanical modeling of cardiac function, to
understand both healthy and diseased physiology and to predict the effects of
cardiac interventions. However, estimating the unloaded geometry from clinical
images remains a challenging task. Traditional approaches rely on inverse
finite element (FE) solvers that require iterative optimization and are
computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce HeartUnloadNet, a deep
learning framework that predicts the unloaded left ventricular (LV) shape
directly from the end diastolic (ED) mesh while explicitly incorporating
biophysical priors. The network accepts a mesh of arbitrary size along with
physiological parameters such as ED pressure, myocardial stiffness scale, and
fiber helix orientation, and outputs the corresponding unloaded mesh. It adopts
a graph attention architecture and employs a cycle-consistency strategy to
enable bidirectional (loading and unloading) prediction, allowing for partial
self-supervision that improves accuracy and reduces the need for large training
datasets. Trained and tested on 20,700 FE simulations across diverse LV
geometries and physiological conditions, HeartUnloadNet achieves sub-millimeter
accuracy, with an average DSC of 0.986 and HD of 0.083 cm, while reducing
inference time to just 0.02 seconds per case, over 10^5 times faster and
significantly more accurate than traditional inverse FE solvers. Ablation
studies confirm the effectiveness of the architecture. Notably, the
cycle-consistent design enables the model to maintain a DSC of 97% even with as
few as 200 training samples. This work thus presents a scalable and accurate
surrogate for inverse FE solvers, supporting real-time clinical applications in
the future.

### [13] [Towards Scalable Spatial Intelligence via 2D-to-3D Data Lifting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18678)
*Xingyu Miao,Haoran Duan,Quanhao Qian,Jiuniu Wang,Yang Long,Ling Shao,Deli Zhao,Ran Xu,Gongjie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A scalable pipeline converts single-view images into realistic 3D representations (point clouds, depth maps, etc.), addressing the scarcity of 3D datasets and reducing data collection costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets limits spatial intelligence in AI, unlike abundant 2D imagery.

Method: Integrated depth estimation, camera calibration, and scale calibration to generate 3D data from single-view images.

Result: Two datasets (COCO-3D, Objects365-v2-3D) are released, showing benefits for 3D tasks like perception and reasoning.

Conclusion: The pipeline effectively bridges the gap between 2D imagery and 3D spatial understanding, advancing AI capabilities.

Abstract: Spatial intelligence is emerging as a transformative frontier in AI, yet it
remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets. Unlike the
abundant 2D imagery, acquiring 3D data typically requires specialized sensors
and laborious annotation. In this work, we present a scalable pipeline that
converts single-view images into comprehensive, scale- and appearance-realistic
3D representations - including point clouds, camera poses, depth maps, and
pseudo-RGBD - via integrated depth estimation, camera calibration, and scale
calibration. Our method bridges the gap between the vast repository of imagery
and the increasing demand for spatial scene understanding. By automatically
generating authentic, scale-aware 3D data from images, we significantly reduce
data collection costs and open new avenues for advancing spatial intelligence.
We release two generated spatial datasets, i.e., COCO-3D and Objects365-v2-3D,
and demonstrate through extensive experiments that our generated data can
benefit various 3D tasks, ranging from fundamental perception to MLLM-based
reasoning. These results validate our pipeline as an effective solution for
developing AI systems capable of perceiving, understanding, and interacting
with physical environments.

### [14] [SaLF: Sparse Local Fields for Multi-Sensor Rendering in Real-Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18713)
*Yun Chen,Matthew Haines,Jingkang Wang,Krzysztof Baron-Lis,Sivabalan Manivasagam,Ze Yang,Raquel Urtasun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SaLF introduces a fast, versatile volumetric representation for sensor simulation, combining rasterization and raytracing for efficient, high-fidelity autonomy testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like NeRF and 3DGS are slow or limited in sensor compatibility, hindering scalable autonomy testing.

Method: SaLF uses sparse 3D voxel primitives with local implicit fields, enabling fast training (<30 min) and rendering (50+ FPS for cameras, 600+ FPS for LiDARs).

Result: SaLF matches realism of existing methods while improving efficiency and supporting diverse sensors.

Conclusion: SaLF enhances scalability and versatility for sensor simulation in autonomy testing.

Abstract: High-fidelity sensor simulation of light-based sensors such as cameras and
LiDARs is critical for safe and accurate autonomy testing. Neural radiance
field (NeRF)-based methods that reconstruct sensor observations via ray-casting
of implicit representations have demonstrated accurate simulation of driving
scenes, but are slow to train and render, hampering scale. 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated faster training and rendering times through
rasterization, but is primarily restricted to pinhole camera sensors,
preventing usage for realistic multi-sensor autonomy evaluation. Moreover, both
NeRF and 3DGS couple the representation with the rendering procedure (implicit
networks for ray-based evaluation, particles for rasterization), preventing
interoperability, which is key for general usage. In this work, we present
Sparse Local Fields (SaLF), a novel volumetric representation that supports
rasterization and raytracing. SaLF represents volumes as a sparse set of 3D
voxel primitives, where each voxel is a local implicit field. SaLF has fast

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges like high class imbalance and limited training data in OMR for historical Chinese musical notations.

Method: Developed a character recognition model for imbalanced data, used temperature scaling for calibration, and employed leave-one-edition-out cross-validation.

Result: Reduced CER from 10.4% to 7.1% for suzipu and achieved 0.9% for lülüpu, outperforming human transcribers (15.9% average CER).

Conclusion: The work advances digitization of historical Chinese music, enhancing cultural diversity in OMR.

Abstract: Optical Music Recognition (OMR) for historical Chinese musical notations,
such as suzipu and l\"ul\"upu, presents unique challenges due to high class
imbalance and limited training data. This paper introduces significant
advancements in OMR for Jiang Kui's influential collection Baishidaoren Gequ
from 1202. In this work, we develop and evaluate a character recognition model
for scarce imbalanced data. We improve upon previous baselines by reducing the
Character Error Rate (CER) from 10.4% to 7.1% for suzipu, despite working with
77 highly imbalanced classes, and achieve a remarkable CER of 0.9% for
l\"ul\"upu. Our models outperform human transcribers, with an average human CER
of 15.9% and a best-case CER of 7.6%. We employ temperature scaling to achieve
a well-calibrated model with an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) below 0.0162.
Using a leave-one-edition-out cross-validation approach, we ensure robust
performance across five historical editions. Additionally, we extend the
KuiSCIMA dataset to include all 109 pieces from Baishidaoren Gequ, encompassing
suzipu, l\"ul\"upu, and jianzipu notations. Our findings advance the
digitization and accessibility of historical Chinese music, promoting cultural
diversity in OMR and expanding its applicability to underrepresented music
traditions.

*Xinjun Cheng,Yiguo He,Junjie Zhu,Chunping Qiu,Jun Wang,Qiangjuan Huang,Ke Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAR-Text, a large-scale dataset of 130,000 SAR image-text pairs, and the SAR-Narrator framework for generating descriptions. It demonstrates improved performance in retrieval, captioning, and VQA tasks using models like SAR-RS-CLIP, SAR-RS-CoCa, and SAR-GPT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of large-scale, high-quality SAR image-text datasets hinders semantic understanding in remote sensing, prompting the creation of SAR-Text.

Method: The SAR-Narrator framework uses multi-stage progressive transfer learning to generate textual descriptions for SAR images. Models like SAR-RS-CLIP, SAR-RS-CoCa, and SAR-GPT are tested on retrieval, captioning, and VQA tasks.

Result: SAR-RS-CLIP improves retrieval recall by 16.43% and 10.54%. SAR-RS-CoCa outperforms CoCa in captioning metrics (BLEU-4, SPICE, CIDEr). SAR-GPT shows superior VQA performance.

Conclusion: SAR-Text and SAR-Narrator advance SAR semantic understanding, with models achieving significant improvements in vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in the
field of remote sensing in recent years. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
imagery, with its all-weather capability, is essential in remote sensing, yet
the lack of large-scale, high-quality SAR image-text datasets hinders its
semantic understanding. In this paper, we construct SAR-Text, a large-scale and
high-quality dataset consisting of over 130,000 SAR image-text pairs. To
construct the SAR-Text dataset, we design the SAR-Narrator framework, which
generates textual descriptions for SAR images through a multi-stage progressive
transfer learning strategy. To verify the effectiveness of the SAR-TEXT
dataset, we conduct experiments on three typical vision-language tasks:
image-text retrieval, image captioning, and visual question answering (VQA).
Specifically, we construct three representative models on SAR-TEXT:
SAR-RS-CLIP, SAR-RS-CoCa, and SAR-GPT. SAR-RS-CLIP achieves notable
improvements in retrieval performance, boosting average recall by 16.43% and
10.54% on the OSdataset-512 and HRSID test sets, respectively. In the
captioning task, SAR-RS-CoCa achieves BLEU-4, SPICE, and CIDEr scores exceeding
those of the original CoCa model by more than 8x, 4x, and 10x, respectively. In
the VQA task, SAR-GPT outperforms baseline and single-stage models on multiple
SAR-VQA datasets, demonstrating stronger semantic understanding and reasoning
ability, as further confirmed by qualitative results. It is worth noting that,
as a flexible captioning tool, SAR-Narrator can be readily adopted by the
community to construct larger-scale SAR image-text datasets.

*Yifan Liu,Shengjun Zhang,Chensheng Dai,Yang Chen,Hao Liu,Chen Li,Yueqi Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Human Gaussian Graph to model connections between 3D Gaussians and human SMPL mesh for animatable avatars, improving frame relations and animation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods predict Gaussians per frame independently, missing inter-frame relations. The goal is to leverage all frames for animatable human representation.

Method: Uses a dual-layer Human Gaussian Graph (Gaussians and mesh vertices) with intra-node (aggregation) and inter-node (message passing) operations.

Result: Shows efficiency and generalization in novel view synthesis and pose animation.

Conclusion: The method effectively captures Gaussian relations across frames, enabling animatable human avatars.

Abstract: Modeling animatable human avatars from videos is a long-standing and
challenging problem. While conventional methods require per-instance
optimization, recent feed-forward methods have been proposed to generate 3D
Gaussians with a learnable network. However, these methods predict Gaussians
for each frame independently, without fully capturing the relations of
Gaussians from different timestamps. To address this, we propose Human Gaussian
Graph to model the connection between predicted Gaussians and human SMPL mesh,
so that we can leverage information from all frames to recover an animatable
human representation. Specifically, the Human Gaussian Graph contains dual
layers where Gaussians are the first layer nodes and mesh vertices serve as the
second layer nodes. Based on this structure, we further propose the intra-node
operation to aggregate various Gaussians connected to one mesh vertex, and
inter-node operation to support message passing among mesh node neighbors.
Experimental results on novel view synthesis and novel pose animation
demonstrate the efficiency and generalization of our method.

*Keshav Gupta,Tejas S. Stanley,Pranjal Paul,Arun K. Singh,K. Madhava Krishna*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a self-supervised method for predicting drivable free-space corridors using monocular camera input, introducing ContourDiff for structured predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on BEV-centric representations, which are hard to obtain. The paper aims to predict navigable corridors using only monocular images.

Method: A self-supervised approach generates free-space samples using future ego trajectories and camera images. ContourDiff, a diffusion-based architecture, denoises contour points for structured predictions.

Result: The method accurately predicts multimodal navigable corridors on nuScenes and CARLA datasets.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses drivable free-space prediction as an image perception task, improving interpretability and accuracy.

Abstract: Drivable Free-space prediction is a fundamental and crucial problem in
autonomous driving. Recent works have addressed the problem by representing the
entire non-obstacle road regions as the free-space. In contrast our aim is to
estimate the driving corridors that are a navigable subset of the entire road
region. Unfortunately, existing corridor estimation methods directly assume a
BEV-centric representation, which is hard to obtain. In contrast, we frame
drivable free-space corridor prediction as a pure image perception task, using
only monocular camera input. However such a formulation poses several
challenges as one doesn't have the corresponding data for such free-space
corridor segments in the image. Consequently, we develop a novel
self-supervised approach for free-space sample generation by leveraging future
ego trajectories and front-view camera images, making the process of visual
corridor estimation dependent on the ego trajectory. We then employ a diffusion
process to model the distribution of such segments in the image. However, the
existing binary mask-based representation for a segment poses many limitations.
Therefore, we introduce ContourDiff, a specialized diffusion-based architecture
that denoises over contour points rather than relying on binary mask
representations, enabling structured and interpretable free-space predictions.
We evaluate our approach qualitatively and quantitatively on both nuScenes and
CARLA, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately predicting safe multimodal
navigable corridors in the image.

*Hitesh Kumar Gupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents an iterative development of image captioning models, from CNN-LSTM to an advanced attention-based system (Nexus), highlighting the importance of attention mechanisms for performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically explore and validate architectural enhancements in image captioning, particularly the role of attention mechanisms alongside visual backbone upgrades.

Method: Developed five models, starting with CNN-LSTM (Genesis) and ending with Nexus (EfficientNetV2B3 backbone + dynamic attention). Evaluated on MS COCO 2017.

Result: Nexus achieved a BLEU-4 score of 31.4, outperforming benchmarks, showing attention mechanisms are crucial for performance.

Conclusion: The iterative approach validates the shift to attention mechanisms and provides a blueprint for vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Image captioning, a task at the confluence of computer vision and natural
language processing, requires a sophisticated understanding of both visual
scenes and linguistic structure. While modern approaches are dominated by
large-scale Transformer architectures, this paper documents a systematic,
iterative development of foundational image captioning models, progressing from
a simple CNN-LSTM encoder-decoder to a competitive attention-based system. We
present a series of five models, beginning with Genesis and concluding with
Nexus, an advanced model featuring an EfficientNetV2B3 backbone and a dynamic
attention mechanism. Our experiments chart the impact of architectural
enhancements and demonstrate a key finding within the classic CNN-LSTM
paradigm: merely upgrading the visual backbone without a corresponding
attention mechanism can degrade performance, as the single-vector bottleneck
cannot transmit the richer visual detail. This insight validates the
architectural shift to attention. Trained on the MS COCO 2017 dataset, our
final model, Nexus, achieves a BLEU-4 score of 31.4, surpassing several
foundational benchmarks and validating our iterative design process. This work
provides a clear, replicable blueprint for understanding the core architectural
principles that underpin modern vision-language tasks.

*Benjamin Carter,Nathan Dilla,Micheal Callahan,Atuhaire Ambala*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using facial landmarks for deepfake detection, focusing on subtle inconsistencies in facial movements instead of raw image processing, achieving high accuracy with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing difficulty in distinguishing AI-generated media from genuine content necessitates new detection methods beyond traditional image processing.

Method: Extracts facial landmarks from videos to identify inconsistencies, testing the approach on RNN, ANN, and CNN models.

Result: High accuracy (96% for RNN, 93% for ANN, 78% for CNN) demonstrates the effectiveness of facial landmarks for detection.

Conclusion: Facial landmarks offer a viable alternative to raw image processing for deepfake detection, with promising real-world applicability.

Abstract: The rise of deepfake technology brings forth new questions about the
authenticity of various forms of media found online today. Videos and images
generated by artificial intelligence (AI) have become increasingly more
difficult to differentiate from genuine media, resulting in the need for new
models to detect artificially-generated media. While many models have attempted
to solve this, most focus on direct image processing, adapting a convolutional
neural network (CNN) or a recurrent neural network (RNN) that directly
interacts with the video image data. This paper introduces an approach of using
solely facial landmarks for deepfake detection. Using a dataset consisting of
both deepfake and genuine videos of human faces, this paper describes an
approach for extracting facial landmarks for deepfake detection, focusing on
identifying subtle inconsistencies in facial movements instead of raw image
processing. Experimental results demonstrated that this feature extraction
technique is effective in various neural network models, with the same facial
landmarks tested on three neural network models, with promising performance
metrics indicating its potential for real-world applications. The findings
discussed in this paper include RNN and artificial neural network (ANN) models
with accuracy between 96% and 93%, respectively, with a CNN model hovering
around 78%. This research challenges the assumption that raw image processing
is necessary to identify deepfake videos by presenting a facial feature
extraction approach compatible with various neural network models while
requiring fewer parameters.

Motivation: Addressing the limitations of low-rank parameterization in previous segmentation methods and improving efficiency and expressiveness in generative segmentation models.

Method: Introduces Flow-SSN, featuring discrete-time autoregressive and continuous-time flow variants, focusing on learning the base distribution for efficient sampling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on medical imaging benchmarks, with higher efficiency and expressive prior learning.

Conclusion: Flow-SSNs offer a powerful alternative to standard diffusion models, with superior performance and efficiency in segmentation tasks.

Abstract: We introduce the Flow Stochastic Segmentation Network (Flow-SSN), a
generative segmentation model family featuring discrete-time autoregressive and
modern continuous-time flow variants. We prove fundamental limitations of the
low-rank parameterisation of previous methods and show that Flow-SSNs can
estimate arbitrarily high-rank pixel-wise covariances without assuming the rank
or storing the distributional parameters. Flow-SSNs are also more efficient to
sample from than standard diffusion-based segmentation models, thanks to most
of the model capacity being allocated to learning the base distribution of the
flow, constituting an expressive prior. We apply Flow-SSNs to challenging
medical imaging benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art results. Code

*Beidi Zhao,SangMook Kim,Hao Chen,Chen Zhou,Zu-hua Gao,Gang Wang,Xiaoxiao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PTCMIL introduces prompt token clustering in ViT for MIL aggregation, improving WSI analysis by dynamically aligning clustering with tasks, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MIL methods struggle with WSI complexity and heterogeneity, and current approaches like ViTs and clustering are computationally heavy or lack task-specific adaptability.

Method: PTCMIL integrates learnable prompt tokens into ViT, unifying clustering and prediction end-to-end, using projection-based clustering and token merging for efficiency.

Result: PTCMIL outperforms state-of-the-art methods on eight datasets in classification and survival analysis, with robust interpretability.

Conclusion: PTCMIL effectively addresses WSI analysis challenges, offering superior performance, efficiency, and interpretability.

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has advanced WSI analysis but struggles with
the complexity and heterogeneity of WSIs. Existing MIL methods face challenges
in aggregating diverse patch information into robust WSI representations. While
ViTs and clustering-based approaches show promise, they are computationally
intensive and fail to capture task-specific and slide-specific variability. To
address these limitations, we propose PTCMIL, a novel Prompt Token
Clustering-based ViT for MIL aggregation. By introducing learnable prompt
tokens into the ViT backbone, PTCMIL unifies clustering and prediction tasks in
an end-to-end manner. It dynamically aligns clustering with downstream tasks,
using projection-based clustering tailored to each WSI, reducing complexity
while preserving patch heterogeneity. Through token merging and prototype-based
pooling, PTCMIL efficiently captures task-relevant patterns. Extensive
experiments on eight datasets demonstrate its superior performance in
classification and survival analysis tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods. Systematic ablation studies confirm its robustness and strong
interpretability. The code is released at https://github.com/ubc-tea/PTCMIL.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel phoneme-based two-stage framework for Visual Automatic Speech Recognition (V-ASR) improves accuracy by combining visual and landmark features, followed by word reconstruction using an LLM model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing V-ASR methods suffer from high error rates due to viseme ambiguity and require extensive training data. The proposed method aims to address these limitations.

Method: A two-stage framework: Stage 1 predicts phonemes using visual and landmark motion features, reducing training complexity. Stage 2 reconstructs words from phonemes using an LLM model (NLLB).

Result: Achieves 17.4% WER on LRS2 and 21.0% WER on LRS3 datasets, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed PV-ASR method effectively addresses viseme ambiguity and reduces error rates, demonstrating superior performance in V-ASR tasks.

Abstract: Visual Automatic Speech Recognition (V-ASR) is a challenging task that
involves interpreting spoken language solely from visual information, such as
lip movements and facial expressions. This task is notably challenging due to
the absence of auditory cues and the visual ambiguity of phonemes that exhibit
similar visemes-distinct sounds that appear identical in lip motions. Existing
methods often aim to predict words or characters directly from visual cues, but
they commonly suffer from high error rates due to viseme ambiguity and require
large amounts of pre-training data. We propose a novel phoneme-based two-stage
framework that fuses visual and landmark motion features, followed by an LLM
model for word reconstruction to address these challenges. Stage 1 consists of
V-ASR, which outputs the predicted phonemes, thereby reducing training
complexity. Meanwhile, the facial landmark features address speaker-specific
facial characteristics. Stage 2 comprises an encoder-decoder LLM model, NLLB,
that reconstructs the output phonemes back to words. Besides using a large
visual dataset for deep learning fine-tuning, our PV-ASR method demonstrates
superior performance by achieving 17.4% WER on the LRS2 and 21.0% WER on the
LRS3 dataset.

*Keke Tang,Yuze Gao,Weilong Peng,Xiaofei Wang,Meie Fang,Peican Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAT-Adv is a novel adversarial attack framework for point clouds, enhancing transferability and undefendability by perturbing medial axis transform (MAT) representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial attack methods on point clouds lack transferability and robustness against defenses, necessitating a more effective approach.

Method: MAT-Adv uses an autoencoder to project point clouds into MAT representations, perturbs these intrinsic structures, and employs dropout to avoid overfitting.

Result: MAT-Adv outperforms state-of-the-art methods in transferability and undefendability.

Conclusion: The framework successfully introduces structural-level adversarial characteristics, improving robustness across diverse models and defenses.

Abstract: Studying adversarial attacks on point clouds is essential for evaluating and
improving the robustness of 3D deep learning models. However, most existing
attack methods are developed under ideal white-box settings and often suffer
from limited transferability to unseen models and insufficient robustness
against common defense mechanisms. In this paper, we propose MAT-Adv, a novel
adversarial attack framework that enhances both transferability and
undefendability by explicitly perturbing the medial axis transform (MAT)
representations, in order to induce inherent adversarialness in the resulting
point clouds. Specifically, we employ an autoencoder to project input point
clouds into compact MAT representations that capture the intrinsic geometric
structure of point clouds. By perturbing these intrinsic representations,
MAT-Adv introduces structural-level adversarial characteristics that remain
effective across diverse models and defense strategies. To mitigate overfitting
and prevent perturbation collapse, we incorporate a dropout strategy into the
optimization of MAT perturbations, further improving transferability and
undefendability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAT-Adv significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both transferability and
undefendability. Codes will be made public upon paper acceptance.

*Bolei Chen,Jiaxu Kang,Haonan Yang,Ping Zhong,Jianxin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a 3D geometric prior-enhanced method for 2D floorplan localization to address challenges like visual changes and occlusions, outperforming existing methods without extra computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Floorplans are robust for self-localization but lack detail, causing errors due to visual changes and occlusions. Existing methods rely on 2D features, missing 3D context.

Method: The method models 3D geometric priors using multi-view constraints and view-scene alignment via self-supervised contrastive learning, avoiding extra annotations.

Result: The approach significantly improves localization accuracy and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in comparative studies.

Conclusion: Injecting 3D priors into 2D floorplan localization bridges modal gaps and enhances performance without added computational burden.

Abstract: Since a building's floorplans are easily accessible, consistent over time,
and inherently robust to changes in visual appearance, self-localization within
the floorplan has attracted researchers' interest. However, since floorplans
are minimalist representations of a building's structure, modal and geometric
differences between visual perceptions and floorplans pose challenges to this
task. While existing methods cleverly utilize 2D geometric features and pose
filters to achieve promising performance, they fail to address the localization
errors caused by frequent visual changes and view occlusions due to variously
shaped 3D objects. To tackle these issues, this paper views the 2D Floorplan
Localization (FLoc) problem from a higher dimension by injecting 3D geometric
priors into the visual FLoc algorithm. For the 3D geometric prior modeling, we
first model geometrically aware view invariance using multi-view constraints,
i.e., leveraging imaging geometric principles to provide matching constraints
between multiple images that see the same points. Then, we further model the
view-scene aligned geometric priors, enhancing the cross-modal geometry-color
correspondences by associating the scene's surface reconstruction with the RGB
frames of the sequence. Both 3D priors are modeled through self-supervised
contrastive learning, thus no additional geometric or semantic annotations are
required. These 3D priors summarized in extensive realistic scenes bridge the
modal gap while improving localization success without increasing the
computational burden on the FLoc algorithm. Sufficient comparative studies
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
and substantially boosts the FLoc accuracy. All data and code will be released
after the anonymous review.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Syn-to-Real Camouflaged Object Detection (S2R-COD) to address limited real-world data by leveraging synthetic datasets and unannotated real images. The proposed CSRDA framework uses pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization to improve model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited datasets for camouflaged object detection (COD) due to high labeling costs, especially for specialized categories, degrade model performance when synthetic data is used directly.

Method: The Cycling Syn-to-Real Domain Adaptation Framework (CSRDA) employs a student-teacher model, pseudo-labeling, and consistency regularization to transfer class information from synthetic to real domains. A recurrent learning framework narrows intra-domain gaps.

Result: Extensive experiments show CSRDA effectively mitigates data limitations and reduces reliance on handcrafted annotations in COD.

Conclusion: CSRDA successfully bridges synthetic and real domains, improving COD performance with limited real-world data.

Abstract: Due to the high cost of collection and labeling, there are relatively few
datasets for camouflaged object detection (COD). In particular, for certain
specialized categories, the available image dataset is insufficiently
populated. Synthetic datasets can be utilized to alleviate the problem of
limited data to some extent. However, directly training with synthetic datasets
compared to real datasets can lead to a degradation in model performance. To
tackle this problem, in this work, we investigate a new task, namely
Syn-to-Real Camouflaged Object Detection (S2R-COD). In order to improve the
model performance in real world scenarios, a set of annotated synthetic
camouflaged images and a limited number of unannotated real images must be
utilized. We propose the Cycling Syn-to-Real Domain Adaptation Framework
(CSRDA), a method based on the student-teacher model. Specially, CSRDA
propagates class information from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled
target domain through pseudo labeling combined with consistency regularization.
Considering that narrowing the intra-domain gap can improve the quality of
pseudo labeling, CSRDA utilizes a recurrent learning framework to build an
evolving real domain for bridging the source and target domain. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, mitigating the
problem of limited data and handcraft annotations in COD. Our code is publicly

TL;DR: HQ-SMem improves Video Object Segmentation (VOS) by refining masks, optimizing memory, and updating appearance models, achieving top performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VOS models struggle with precise mask delineation, deformable objects, tracking drift, and long sequences. HQ-SMem addresses these limitations.

Method: HQ-SMem combines SAM-HQ for refined masks, a dynamic smart memory mechanism, and dynamic appearance model updates.

Result: Top performance on VOTS and VOTSt 2024 datasets, with new benchmarks on Long Video Dataset and LVOS.

Conclusion: HQ-SMem effectively addresses VOS challenges, excelling in complex scenarios and long-term tracking.

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation (VOS) is foundational to numerous computer vision
applications, including surveillance, autonomous driving, robotics and
generative video editing. However, existing VOS models often struggle with
precise mask delineation, deformable objects, topologically transforming
objects, tracking drift and long video sequences. In this paper, we introduce
HQ-SMem, for High Quality video segmentation and tracking using Smart Memory, a
novel method that enhances the performance of VOS base models by addressing
these limitations. Our approach incorporates three key innovations: (i)
leveraging SAM with High-Quality masks (SAM-HQ) alongside appearance-based
candidate-selection to refine coarse segmentation masks, resulting in improved
object boundaries; (ii) implementing a dynamic smart memory mechanism that
selectively stores relevant key frames while discarding redundant ones, thereby
optimizing memory usage and processing efficiency for long-term videos; and
(iii) dynamically updating the appearance model to effectively handle complex
topological object variations and reduce drift throughout the video. These
contributions mitigate several limitations of existing VOS models including,
coarse segmentations that mix-in background pixels, fixed memory update
schedules, brittleness to drift and occlusions, and prompt ambiguity issues
associated with SAM. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple public
datasets and state-of-the-art base trackers demonstrate that our method
consistently ranks among the top two on VOTS and VOTSt 2024 datasets. Moreover,
HQ-SMem sets new benchmarks on Long Video Dataset and LVOS, showcasing its
effectiveness in challenging scenarios characterized by complex multi-object
dynamics over extended temporal durations.

*Zhentao Huang,Di Wu,Zhenbang He,Minglun Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GSSR improves 3D Gaussian Splatting by ensuring even Gaussian distribution and alignment with surface normals, enhancing geometric accuracy and scene editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like 3DGS and PGSR fail to accurately reconstruct scene geometry due to uneven Gaussian distribution and lack of individual placement optimization.

Method: GSSR enforces geometric alignment via pixel-level and Gaussian-level normal consistency and photometric consistency, with opacity regularization and periodic reinitialization for cleaner distribution.

Result: GSSR achieves improved geometric precision in Gaussian placement, enabling better scene editing and novel view synthesis.

Conclusion: GSSR enhances geometric accuracy while maintaining rendering quality, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) effectively synthesizes novel views through its
flexible representation, yet fails to accurately reconstruct scene geometry.
While modern variants like PGSR introduce additional losses to ensure proper
depth and normal maps through Gaussian fusion, they still neglect individual
placement optimization. This results in unevenly distributed Gaussians that
deviate from the latent surface, complicating both reconstruction refinement
and scene editing. Motivated by pioneering work on Point Set Surfaces, we
propose Gaussian Set Surface Reconstruction (GSSR), a method designed to
distribute Gaussians evenly along the latent surface while aligning their
dominant normals with the surface normal. GSSR enforces fine-grained geometric
alignment through a combination of pixel-level and Gaussian-level single-view
normal consistency and multi-view photometric consistency, optimizing both
local and global perspectives. To further refine the representation, we
introduce an opacity regularization loss to eliminate redundant Gaussians and
apply periodic depth- and normal-guided Gaussian reinitialization for a
cleaner, more uniform spatial distribution. Our reconstruction results
demonstrate significantly improved geometric precision in Gaussian placement,
enabling intuitive scene editing and efficient generation of novel
Gaussian-based 3D environments. Extensive experiments validate GSSR's
effectiveness, showing enhanced geometric accuracy while preserving
high-quality rendering performance.

Method: Proposes WiSE-OD, a weight-space ensembling method with two variants (WiSE-OD$_{ZS}$ and WiSE-OD$_{LP}$), and introduces LLVIP-C and FLIR-C benchmarks for evaluation.

Result: WiSE-OD improves cross-modality and corruption robustness without extra training or inference cost.

Conclusion: The method effectively leverages complementary knowledge from RGB and IR models, enhancing robustness in IR object detection.

Abstract: Object detection (OD) in infrared (IR) imagery is critical for low-light and
nighttime applications. However, the scarcity of large-scale IR datasets forces
models to rely on weights pre-trained on RGB images. While fine-tuning on IR
improves accuracy, it often compromises robustness under distribution shifts
due to the inherent modality gap between RGB and IR. To address this, we
introduce LLVIP-C and FLIR-C, two cross-modality out-of-distribution (OOD)
benchmarks built by applying corruption to standard IR datasets. Additionally,
to fully leverage the complementary knowledge from RGB and infrared trained
models, we propose WiSE-OD, a weight-space ensembling method with two variants:
WiSE-OD$_{ZS}$, which combines RGB zero-shot and IR fine-tuned weights, and
WiSE-OD$_{LP}$, which blends zero-shot and linear probing. Evaluated across
three RGB-pretrained detectors and two robust baselines, WiSE-OD improves both
cross-modality and corruption robustness without any additional training or
inference cost.

*Jian Chen,Yuxuan Hu,Haifeng Lu,Wei Wang,Min Yang,Chengming Li,Xiping Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MGHFT, a multi-granularity hierarchical fusion transformer, to improve sticker emotion recognition by fusing multi-view textual context with visual features using Multimodal Large Language Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sticker emotion understanding is challenging due to its reliance on multi-view information like background knowledge and stylistic cues, which existing pre-trained visual models struggle with.

Method: MGHFT uses Multimodal Large Language Models for multi-view textual context, a hierarchical fusion strategy with a pyramid visual transformer, and contrastive learning with attention mechanisms to fuse textual and visual features.

Result: MGHFT outperforms existing methods on two datasets, achieving 5.4% higher F1 and 4.0% higher accuracy than the best pre-trained visual models.

Conclusion: MGHFT effectively enhances sticker emotion recognition by integrating multi-view textual and visual features, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Although pre-trained visual models with text have demonstrated strong
capabilities in visual feature extraction, sticker emotion understanding
remains challenging due to its reliance on multi-view information, such as
background knowledge and stylistic cues. To address this, we propose a novel
multi-granularity hierarchical fusion transformer (MGHFT), with a multi-view
sticker interpreter based on Multimodal Large Language Models. Specifically,
inspired by the human ability to interpret sticker emotions from multiple
views, we first use Multimodal Large Language Models to interpret stickers by
providing rich textual context via multi-view descriptions. Then, we design a
hierarchical fusion strategy to fuse the textual context into visual
understanding, which builds upon a pyramid visual transformer to extract both
global and local sticker features at multiple stages. Through contrastive
learning and attention mechanisms, textual features are injected at different
stages of the visual backbone, enhancing the fusion of global- and
local-granularity visual semantics with textual guidance. Finally, we introduce
a text-guided fusion attention mechanism to effectively integrate the overall
multimodal features, enhancing semantic understanding. Extensive experiments on
2 public sticker emotion datasets demonstrate that MGHFT significantly
outperforms existing sticker emotion recognition approaches, achieving higher
accuracy and more fine-grained emotion recognition. Compared to the best
pre-trained visual models, our MGHFT also obtains an obvious improvement, 5.4%
on F1 and 4.0% on accuracy. The code is released at

### [31] [PDT: Point Distribution Transformation with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18939)
*Jionghao Wang,Cheng Lin,Yuan Liu,Rui Xu,Zhiyang Dou,Xiao-Xiao Long,Hao-Xiang Guo,Taku Komura,Wenping Wang,Xin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PDT is a framework using diffusion models to transform unstructured point clouds into semantically meaningful distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extracting structured information from unstructured point clouds for semantic purposes is under-explored.

Method: Uses diffusion models with novel architecture and learning strategy to correlate source and target distributions via denoising.

Result: Successfully transforms point clouds into structured outputs like keypoints, joints, and feature lines.

Conclusion: PDT effectively captures geometric and semantic features, proving useful for 3D geometry processing tasks.

Abstract: Point-based representations have consistently played a vital role in
geometric data structures. Most point cloud learning and processing methods
typically leverage the unordered and unconstrained nature to represent the
underlying geometry of 3D shapes. However, how to extract meaningful structural
information from unstructured point cloud distributions and transform them into
semantically meaningful point distributions remains an under-explored problem.
We present PDT, a novel framework for point distribution transformation with
diffusion models. Given a set of input points, PDT learns to transform the
point set from its original geometric distribution into a target distribution
that is semantically meaningful. Our method utilizes diffusion models with
novel architecture and learning strategy, which effectively correlates the
source and the target distribution through a denoising process. Through
extensive experiments, we show that our method successfully transforms input
point clouds into various forms of structured outputs - ranging from
surface-aligned keypoints, and inner sparse joints to continuous feature lines.
The results showcase our framework's ability to capture both geometric and
semantic features, offering a powerful tool for various 3D geometry processing
tasks where structured point distributions are desired. Code will be available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes OASIS, a method for semi-supervised video object segmentation, improving accuracy and speed by refining object boundaries and handling occlusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in occlusion and object interactions in SVOS, while meeting real-time processing needs.

Method: Uses a lightweight structure refinement module with Canny filter edge priors and evidential learning for uncertainty.

Result: Achieves superior performance (91.6 F on DAVIS-17, 86.6 G on YouTubeVOS) and 48 FPS speed.

Conclusion: OASIS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Given an object mask, Semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation (SVOS)
technique aims to track and segment the object across video frames, serving as
a fundamental task in computer vision. Although recent memory-based methods
demonstrate potential, they often struggle with scenes involving occlusion,
particularly in handling object interactions and high feature similarity. To
address these issues and meet the real-time processing requirements of
downstream applications, in this paper, we propose a novel bOundary Amendment
video object Segmentation method with Inherent Structure refinement, hereby
named OASIS. Specifically, a lightweight structure refinement module is
proposed to enhance segmentation accuracy. With the fusion of rough edge priors
captured by the Canny filter and stored object features, the module can
generate an object-level structure map and refine the representations by
highlighting boundary features. Evidential learning for uncertainty estimation
is introduced to further address challenges in occluded regions. The proposed
method, OASIS, maintains an efficient design, yet extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks demonstrate its superior performance and competitive
inference speed compared to other state-of-the-art methods, i.e., achieving the
F values of 91.6 (vs. 89.7 on DAVIS-17 validation set) and G values of 86.6
(vs. 86.2 on YouTubeVOS 2019 validation set) while maintaining a competitive
speed of 48 FPS on DAVIS.

Motivation: Addressing the lack of large-scale annotated datasets for automated diagnosis of apical periodontitis, a common oral pathology.

Method: Proposes PerioDet, integrating Background-Denoising Attention (BDA) and IoU-Dynamic Calibration (IDC) to tackle background noise and small target detection.

Result: PerioDet outperforms on the PerioXrays dataset, demonstrating clinical applicability in human-computer collaborative experiments.

Conclusion: The PerioXrays dataset and PerioDet method advance automated apical periodontitis detection, offering a practical tool for dentists.

Abstract: Apical periodontitis is a prevalent oral pathology that presents significant
public health challenges. Despite advances in automated diagnostic systems
across various medical fields, the development of Computer-Aided Diagnosis
(CAD) applications for apical periodontitis is still constrained by the lack of
a large-scale, high-quality annotated dataset. To address this issue, we
release a large-scale panoramic radiograph benchmark called "PerioXrays",
comprising 3,673 images and 5,662 meticulously annotated instances of apical
periodontitis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first benchmark
dataset for automated apical periodontitis diagnosis. This paper further
proposes a clinical-oriented apical periodontitis detection (PerioDet)
paradigm, which jointly incorporates Background-Denoising Attention (BDA) and
IoU-Dynamic Calibration (IDC) mechanisms to address the challenges posed by
background noise and small targets in automated detection. Extensive
experiments on the PerioXrays dataset demonstrate the superiority of PerioDet
in advancing automated apical periodontitis detection. Additionally, a
well-designed human-computer collaborative experiment underscores the clinical
applicability of our method as an auxiliary diagnostic tool for professional
dentists.

Motivation: Accurate vehicle attribute identification is crucial for law enforcement and intelligence applications.

Method: Three YOLO-based models were tested on a large real-world dataset using MVI. Experiments varied model sizes and tasks (make, shape, color).

Result: High classification accuracy (up to 94.86%) was achieved. YOLO-v11 and YOLO-World outperformed classification-only models, with smaller variants offering efficiency benefits.

Conclusion: MVI is essential for usable models in complex datasets. The work provides a robust baseline for real-world vehicle metadata extraction, aiding in efficient dataset filtering.

Abstract: Accurate identification of vehicle attributes such as make, colour, and shape
is critical for law enforcement and intelligence applications. This study
evaluates the effectiveness of three state-of-the-art deep learning approaches
YOLO-v11, YOLO-World, and YOLO-Classification on a real-world vehicle image
dataset. This dataset was collected under challenging and unconstrained
conditions by NSW Police Highway Patrol Vehicles. A multi-view inference (MVI)
approach was deployed to enhance the performance of the models' predictions. To
conduct the analyses, datasets with 100,000 plus images were created for each
of the three metadata prediction tasks, specifically make, shape and colour.
The models were tested on a separate dataset with 29,937 images belonging to
1809 number plates. Different sets of experiments have been investigated by
varying the models sizes. A classification accuracy of 93.70%, 82.86%, 85.19%,
and 94.86% was achieved with the best performing make, shape, colour, and
colour-binary models respectively. It was concluded that there is a need to use
MVI to get usable models within such complex real-world datasets. Our findings
indicated that the object detection models YOLO-v11 and YOLO-World outperformed
classification-only models in make and shape extraction. Moreover, smaller YOLO
variants perform comparably to larger counterparts, offering substantial
efficiency benefits for real-time predictions. This work provides a robust
baseline for extracting vehicle metadata in real-world scenarios. Such models
can be used in filtering and sorting user queries, minimising the time required
to search large vehicle images datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate detection of underwater waste is critical for environmental monitoring and cleanup efforts.

Method: Evaluated five object recognition models (YOLOv7-v10, Faster R-CNN) on a diverse dataset under challenging conditions.

Result: YOLOv8 achieved the highest mAP (80.9%) due to its advanced architecture features.

Conclusion: YOLOv8 is a promising tool for enhancing underwater pollution detection and cleanup operations.

Abstract: Underwater pollution is one of today's most significant environmental
concerns, with vast volumes of garbage found in seas, rivers, and landscapes
around the world. Accurate detection of these waste materials is crucial for
successful waste management, environmental monitoring, and mitigation
strategies. In this study, we investigated the performance of five cutting-edge
object recognition algorithms, namely YOLO (You Only Look Once) models,
including YOLOv7, YOLOv8, YOLOv9, YOLOv10, and Faster Region-Convolutional
Neural Network (R-CNN), to identify which model was most effective at
recognizing materials in underwater situations. The models were thoroughly
trained and tested on a large dataset containing fifteen different classes
under diverse conditions, such as low visibility and variable depths. From the
above-mentioned models, YOLOv8 outperformed the others, with a mean Average
Precision (mAP) of 80.9%, indicating a significant performance. This increased
performance is attributed to YOLOv8's architecture, which incorporates advanced
features such as improved anchor-free mechanisms and self-supervised learning,
allowing for more precise and efficient recognition of items in a variety of
settings. These findings highlight the YOLOv8 model's potential as an effective
tool in the global fight against pollution, improving both the detection

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AEDR (AutoEncoder Double-Reconstruction) is a training-free attribution method for generative models, improving accuracy and efficiency over existing reconstruction-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the security concerns of image-generation technologies by tracing image origins, especially with SOTA models, where current methods lack accuracy and efficiency.

Method: AEDR performs two consecutive reconstructions using a model's autoencoder, using the ratio of losses as the attribution signal, calibrated by image homogeneity for accuracy.

Result: AEDR achieves 25.5% higher attribution accuracy than existing methods and requires only 1% of the computational time.

Conclusion: AEDR is a promising solution for efficient and accurate attribution in generative models, addressing key limitations of current approaches.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of image-generation technologies has made it possible
for anyone to create photorealistic images using generative models, raising
significant security concerns. To mitigate malicious use, tracing the origin of
such images is essential. Reconstruction-based attribution methods offer a
promising solution, but they often suffer from reduced accuracy and high
computational costs when applied to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. To address
these challenges, we propose AEDR (AutoEncoder Double-Reconstruction), a novel
training-free attribution method designed for generative models with continuous
autoencoders. Unlike existing reconstruction-based approaches that rely on the
value of a single reconstruction loss, AEDR performs two consecutive
reconstructions using the model's autoencoder, and adopts the ratio of these
two reconstruction losses as the attribution signal. This signal is further
calibrated using the image homogeneity metric to improve accuracy, which
inherently cancels out absolute biases caused by image complexity, with
autoencoder-based reconstruction ensuring superior computational efficiency.
Experiments on eight top latent diffusion models show that AEDR achieves 25.5%
higher attribution accuracy than existing reconstruction-based methods, while
requiring only 1% of the computational time.

*Zixiang Ai,Zhenyu Cui,Yuxin Peng,Jiahuan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified point-level prompting method is proposed to enhance noisy and incomplete point clouds for robust downstream analysis, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point cloud enhancement methods are isolated from downstream tasks and struggle with conflicting objectives, limiting their real-world applicability.

Method: Introduces Rectification and Completion Prompters to filter noise and generate auxiliary points, unified by a Shape-Aware Unit for downstream tasks.

Result: Demonstrates superiority and robustness on four datasets for handling noisy and incomplete point clouds.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively unifies point cloud enhancement and analysis, improving performance in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Pre-trained point cloud analysis models have shown promising advancements in
various downstream tasks, yet their effectiveness is typically suffering from
low-quality point cloud (i.e., noise and incompleteness), which is a common
issue in real scenarios due to casual object occlusions and unsatisfactory data
collected by 3D sensors. To this end, existing methods focus on enhancing point
cloud quality by developing dedicated denoising and completion models. However,
due to the isolation between the point cloud enhancement and downstream tasks,
these methods fail to work in various real-world domains. In addition, the
conflicting objectives between denoising and completing tasks further limit the
ensemble paradigm to preserve critical geometric features. To tackle the above
challenges, we propose a unified point-level prompting method that reformulates
point cloud denoising and completion as a prompting mechanism, enabling robust
analysis in a parameter-efficient manner. We start by introducing a
Rectification Prompter to adapt to noisy points through the predicted
rectification vector prompts, effectively filtering noise while preserving
intricate geometric features essential for accurate analysis. Sequentially, we
further incorporate a Completion Prompter to generate auxiliary point prompts
based on the rectified point clouds, facilitating their robustness and
adaptability. Finally, a Shape-Aware Unit module is exploited to efficiently
unify and capture the filtered geometric features for the downstream point
cloud analysis.Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the
superiority and robustness of our method when handling noisy and incomplete
point cloud data against existing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is
released at https://github.com/zhoujiahuan1991/ICCV2025-UPP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPSMamba combines adaptive semantic-frequency prompts and thermal-spectral attention to enhance infrared image super-resolution, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared images suffer from low contrast and sparse textures, requiring robust long-range modeling for global coherence.

Method: Proposes GPSMamba with an Adaptive Semantic-Frequency State Space Module (ASF-SSM) and Thermal-Spectral Attention with Phase Consistency Loss for non-causal supervision.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in infrared image restoration.

Conclusion: GPSMamba effectively addresses the limitations of causal modeling in infrared image super-resolution.

Abstract: Infrared Image Super-Resolution (IRSR) is challenged by the low contrast and
sparse textures of infrared data, requiring robust long-range modeling to
maintain global coherence. While State-Space Models like Mamba offer
proficiency in modeling long-range dependencies for this task, their inherent
1D causal scanning mechanism fragments the global context of 2D images,
hindering fine-detail restoration. To address this, we propose Global Phase and
Spectral Prompt-guided Mamba (GPSMamba), a framework that synergizes
architectural guidance with non-causal supervision. First, our Adaptive
Semantic-Frequency State Space Module (ASF-SSM) injects a fused
semantic-frequency prompt directly into the Mamba block, integrating non-local
context to guide reconstruction. Then, a novel Thermal-Spectral Attention and
Phase Consistency Loss provides explicit, non-causal supervision to enforce
global structural and spectral fidelity. By combining these two innovations,
our work presents a systematic strategy to mitigate the limitations of causal
modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GPSMamba achieves
state-of-the-art performance, validating our approach as a powerful new
paradigm for infrared image restoration. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation frameworks for image generation systems fail to align with human aesthetic preferences, assigning low scores to high-quality images.

Method: Proposes ICT score for text-image alignment and HP score for aesthetics, training models using CLIP and BLIP architectures.

Result: Improves scoring accuracy by over 10% and optimizes text-to-image models effectively.

Conclusion: The research advances image generation evaluation toward higher-order human aesthetic preferences.

Abstract: Contemporary image generation systems have achieved high fidelity and
superior aesthetic quality beyond basic text-image alignment. However, existing
evaluation frameworks have failed to evolve in parallel. This study reveals
that human preference reward models fine-tuned based on CLIP and BLIP
architectures have inherent flaws: they inappropriately assign low scores to
images with rich details and high aesthetic value, creating a significant
discrepancy with actual human aesthetic preferences. To address this issue, we
design a novel evaluation score, ICT (Image-Contained-Text) score, that
achieves and surpasses the objectives of text-image alignment by assessing the
degree to which images represent textual content. Building upon this
foundation, we further train an HP (High-Preference) score model using solely
the image modality to enhance image aesthetics and detail quality while
maintaining text-image alignment. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
evaluation model improves scoring accuracy by over 10\% compared to existing
methods, and achieves significant results in optimizing state-of-the-art
text-to-image models. This research provides theoretical and empirical support
for evolving image generation technology toward higher-order human aesthetic
preferences. Code is available at https://github.com/BarretBa/ICTHP.

Result: Identifies common hallucination types, benchmarks, and detection techniques, while noting current limitations.

Conclusion: Highlights gaps in benchmarks and detection methods, suggesting future research directions.

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm
for integrating visual and textual information, supporting a wide range of
multi-modal tasks. However, these models often suffer from hallucination,
producing content that appears plausible but contradicts the input content or
established world knowledge. This survey offers an in-depth review of
hallucination evaluation benchmarks and detection methods across Image-to-Text

a taxonomy of hallucination based on faithfulness and factuality, incorporating
the common types of hallucinations observed in practice. Then we provide an
overview of existing hallucination evaluation benchmarks for both T2I and I2T
tasks, highlighting their construction process, evaluation objectives, and
employed metrics. Furthermore, we summarize recent advances in hallucination
detection methods, which aims to identify hallucinated content at the instance
level and serve as a practical complement of benchmark-based evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mixed modality search is important but underexplored, and existing models like CLIP suffer from a modality gap, causing bias and fusion issues.

Method: Proposes GR-CLIP, a lightweight post-hoc calibration method to remove the modality gap in CLIP's embedding space.

Result: GR-CLIP improves NDCG@10 by up to 26 points over CLIP and outperforms other models by 4 points with 75x less compute.

Conclusion: GR-CLIP effectively bridges the modality gap, enhancing mixed modality search performance efficiently.

Abstract: Mixed modality search -- retrieving information across a heterogeneous corpus
composed of images, texts, and multimodal documents -- is an important yet
underexplored real-world application. In this work, we investigate how
contrastive vision-language models, such as CLIP, perform on the mixed modality
search task. Our analysis reveals a critical limitation: these models exhibit a
pronounced modality gap in the embedding space, where image and text embeddings
form distinct clusters, leading to intra-modal ranking bias and inter-modal
fusion failure. To address this issue, we propose GR-CLIP, a lightweight
post-hoc calibration method that removes the modality gap in CLIP's embedding
space. Evaluated on MixBench -- the first benchmark specifically designed for
mixed modality search -- GR-CLIP improves NDCG@10 by up to 26 percentage points
over CLIP, surpasses recent vision-language generative embedding models by 4
percentage points, while using 75x less compute.

TL;DR: A modified OSFL framework with FG-RF and DLKD improves training efficiency, privacy, and performance in non-IID medical imaging scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address low efficiency, privacy risks, and non-IID challenges in existing OSFL methods.

Method: Proposes FG-RF for feature-level image synthesis and DLKD for dual-layer knowledge distillation.

Result: Outperforms multi-round FL by 21.73% and FedISCA by 21.75%, with reduced privacy risks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively tackles OSFL challenges in healthcare, offering efficiency, privacy, and performance gains.

Abstract: In multi-center scenarios, One-Shot Federated Learning (OSFL) has attracted
increasing attention due to its low communication overhead, requiring only a
single round of transmission. However, existing generative model-based OSFL
methods suffer from low training efficiency and potential privacy leakage in
the healthcare domain. Additionally, achieving convergence within a single
round of model aggregation is challenging under non-Independent and Identically
Distributed (non-IID) data. To address these challenges, in this paper a
modified OSFL framework is proposed, in which a new Feature-Guided Rectified
Flow Model (FG-RF) and Dual-Layer Knowledge Distillation (DLKD) aggregation
method are developed. FG-RF on the client side accelerates generative modeling
in medical imaging scenarios while preserving privacy by synthesizing
feature-level images rather than pixel-level images. To handle non-IID
distributions, DLKD enables the global student model to simultaneously mimic
the output logits and align the intermediate-layer features of client-side
teacher models during aggregation. Experimental results on three non-IID
medical imaging datasets show that our new framework and method outperform
multi-round federated learning approaches, achieving up to 21.73% improvement,
and exceeds the baseline FedISCA by an average of 21.75%. Furthermore, our
experiments demonstrate that feature-level synthetic images significantly
reduce privacy leakage risks compared to pixel-level synthetic images.

Method: Developed brain encoding models using X-CLIP (visual) and Whisper (auditory) feature extractors, evaluated on in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.

Result: A simpler linear model outperformed a complex attention-based model on OOD data by 18%, and linguistic features did not improve accuracy. Performance gains were notable in the auditory cortex.

Conclusion: Rigorous OOD testing is crucial for robust neuro-AI models, and model architecture, stimulus characteristics, and sensory hierarchies significantly influence neural encoding.

Abstract: Predicting brain activity in response to naturalistic, multimodal stimuli is
a key challenge in computational neuroscience. While encoding models are
becoming more powerful, their ability to generalize to truly novel contexts
remains a critical, often untested, question. In this work, we developed brain
encoding models using state-of-the-art visual (X-CLIP) and auditory (Whisper)
feature extractors and rigorously evaluated them on both in-distribution (ID)
and diverse out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our results reveal a fundamental
trade-off between model complexity and generalization: a higher-capacity
attention-based model excelled on ID data, but a simpler linear model was more
robust, outperforming a competitive baseline by 18\% on the OOD set.
Intriguingly, we found that linguistic features did not improve predictive
accuracy, suggesting that for familiar languages, neural encoding may be
dominated by the continuous visual and auditory streams over redundant textual
information. Spatially, our approach showed marked performance gains in the
auditory cortex, underscoring the benefit of high-fidelity speech
representations. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that rigorous OOD
testing is essential for building robust neuro-AI models and provides nuanced
insights into how model architecture, stimulus characteristics, and sensory
hierarchies shape the neural encoding of our rich, multimodal world.

*Chong Xia,Shengjun Zhang,Fangfu Liu,Chang Liu,Khodchaphun Hirunyaratsameewong,Yueqi Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScenePainter addresses semantic drift in 3D scene generation by aligning scene-specific priors with current scene comprehension using a hierarchical graph structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for perpetual 3D scene generation suffer from semantic drift due to accumulated deviations in outpainting.

Method: Proposes ScenePainter with a SceneConceptGraph to hierarchically relate multi-level scene concepts, guiding consistent novel view generation.

Result: Overcomes semantic drift, producing more consistent and immersive 3D view sequences.

Conclusion: ScenePainter effectively enhances semantic consistency and diversity in 3D scene generation.

Abstract: Perpetual 3D scene generation aims to produce long-range and coherent 3D view
sequences, which is applicable for long-term video synthesis and 3D scene
reconstruction. Existing methods follow a "navigate-and-imagine" fashion and
rely on outpainting for successive view expansion. However, the generated view
sequences suffer from semantic drift issue derived from the accumulated
deviation of the outpainting module. To tackle this challenge, we propose
ScenePainter, a new framework for semantically consistent 3D scene generation,
which aligns the outpainter's scene-specific prior with the comprehension of
the current scene. To be specific, we introduce a hierarchical graph structure
dubbed SceneConceptGraph to construct relations among multi-level scene
concepts, which directs the outpainter for consistent novel views and can be
dynamically refined to enhance diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our framework overcomes the semantic drift issue and generates more
consistent and immersive 3D view sequences. Project Page:

*Xiaocheng Fang,Jieyi Cai,Huanyu Liu,Wenxiu Cai,Yishu Liu,Bingzhi Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes NRQO, combining NT-FPN and PS-RPN, to improve small object detection by reducing noise in FPN and enhancing query quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based detectors for small object detection struggle with noise in FPN and poor query quality in label assignment.

Method: Introduces NT-FPN for noise-resilient feature fusion and PS-RPN for high-quality query generation via anchor-ground truth matching.

Result: NRQO outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: NRQO effectively addresses noise and query issues, advancing small object detection.

Abstract: Despite advancements in Transformer-based detectors for small object
detection (SOD), recent studies show that these detectors still face challenges
due to inherent noise sensitivity in feature pyramid networks (FPN) and
diminished query quality in existing label assignment strategies. In this
paper, we propose a novel Noise-Resilient Query Optimization (NRQO) paradigm,
which innovatively incorporates the Noise-Tolerance Feature Pyramid Network
(NT-FPN) and the Pairwise-Similarity Region Proposal Network (PS-RPN).
Specifically, NT-FPN mitigates noise during feature fusion in FPN by preserving
spatial and semantic information integrity. Unlike existing label assignment
strategies, PS-RPN generates a sufficient number of high-quality positive
queries by enhancing anchor-ground truth matching through position and shape
similarities, without the need for additional hyperparameters. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks consistently demonstrate the superiority of
NRQO over state-of-the-art baselines.

### [47] [Negation-Aware Test-Time Adaptation for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19064)
*Haochen Han,Alex Jinpeng Wang,Fangming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of negation understanding in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), proposing a low-resource adaptation method called NEAT to handle distribution shifts between affirmation and negation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications, like medical imaging, require models to identify false or non-existent elements, but VLMs struggle with negation due to scarce training data.

Method: The proposed NEAT method adjusts distribution-related parameters during inference to mitigate dual-concept shifts between affirmation and negation.

Result: Experiments show NEAT effectively reduces distribution shifts and improves negation understanding in VLMs.

Conclusion: NEAT offers a sustainable, low-resource solution for negation understanding, validated across various tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we study a practical but less-touched problem in
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), \ie, negation understanding. Specifically, many
real-world applications require models to explicitly identify what is false or
non-existent, \eg, radiologists may search for images that exclude specific
conditions. Despite the impressive transferability of VLMs through large-scale
training, they suffer from a critical limitation that fails to handle negation.
To address this challenge, existing methods attribute its root cause to the
scarcity of negation training data and propose to fine-tune VLMs on massive
data containing explicit negation. Undoubtedly, such data-centric solutions
demand substantial data and computational resources, limiting their sustainable
widespread adoption. To tackle negation in a low-carbon manner, we empirically
observe that the key obstacle lies in the dual-concept shifts between the
affirmation and negation distributions. Therefore, we propose a Negation-Aware
Test-Time Adaptation (NEAT) method to efficiently adjust distribution-related
parameters during inference. In brief, NEAT can reduce distribution shift in
consistent semantics while eliminating false distributional consistency in
unrelated semantics. Extensive experiments on the various negation
understanding tasks verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code
is available at https://github.com/hhc1997/NEAT.

*Yangyang Xu,Bangzhen Liu,Wenqi Shao,Yong Du,Shengfeng He,Tingting Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new framework, Bidirectional Autoencoder Intertwining, improves cross-subject fMRI image decoding by addressing sequential errors and leveraging bidirectional mapping, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail in cross-subject fMRI decoding due to cognitive variability and sequential errors, leading to degraded reconstruction fidelity.

Method: Proposes a Bidirectional Autoencoder Intertwining framework with Subject Bias Modulation, Semantic Refinement, and Visual Coherence Modules, integrated with ControlNet and Stable Diffusion.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in qualitative and quantitative evaluations and shows strong adaptability to new subjects with minimal training.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses cross-subject decoding challenges, enhancing reconstruction fidelity and adaptability.

Abstract: Decoding stimulus images from fMRI signals has advanced with pre-trained
generative models. However, existing methods struggle with cross-subject
mappings due to cognitive variability and subject-specific differences. This
challenge arises from sequential errors, where unidirectional mappings generate
partially inaccurate representations that, when fed into diffusion models,
accumulate errors and degrade reconstruction fidelity. To address this, we
propose the Bidirectional Autoencoder Intertwining framework for accurate
decoded representation prediction. Our approach unifies multiple subjects
through a Subject Bias Modulation Module while leveraging bidirectional mapping
to better capture data distributions for precise representation prediction. To
further enhance fidelity when decoding representations into stimulus images, we
introduce a Semantic Refinement Module to improve semantic representations and
a Visual Coherence Module to mitigate the effects of inaccurate visual
representations. Integrated with ControlNet and Stable Diffusion, our method
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on benchmark datasets in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Moreover, our framework exhibits
strong adaptability to new subjects with minimal training samples.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LOTUS is a leaderboard for evaluating detailed image captions by LVLMs, addressing gaps like lack of standards, bias, and user preferences. It assesses quality, risks, and biases, showing no single model excels in all areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations lack standardized criteria, bias-aware assessments, and user preference considerations, prompting the need for LOTUS.

Method: LOTUS evaluates caption quality (alignment, descriptiveness), risks (hallucination), societal biases (gender bias), and incorporates user preferences.

Result: No single LVLM excels across all criteria; caption detail correlates with bias risks. User preferences influence optimal model selection.

Conclusion: LOTUS provides a comprehensive evaluation framework, highlighting the trade-offs in LVLM performance and the importance of user-specific priorities.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have transformed image captioning,
shifting from concise captions to detailed descriptions. We introduce LOTUS, a
leaderboard for evaluating detailed captions, addressing three main gaps in
existing evaluations: lack of standardized criteria, bias-aware assessments,
and user preference considerations. LOTUS comprehensively evaluates various
aspects, including caption quality (e.g., alignment, descriptiveness), risks
(\eg, hallucination), and societal biases (e.g., gender bias) while enabling
preference-oriented evaluations by tailoring criteria to diverse user
preferences. Our analysis of recent LVLMs reveals no single model excels across
all criteria, while correlations emerge between caption detail and bias risks.
Preference-oriented evaluations demonstrate that optimal model selection
depends on user priorities.

TL;DR: SP-Mamba, a spatial-perception Mamba framework, is introduced for unsupervised medical anomaly detection, leveraging structural regularity and spatial information in radiography images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods (CNNs and transformers) have limitations in capturing long-range dependencies or computational efficiency, while Mamba-based models offer superior long-range modeling and linear complexity.

Method: SP-Mamba uses window-sliding prototype learning and Circular-Hilbert scanning-based Mamba to exploit anatomical patterns and spatial information. Anomaly maps' concentration and contrast characteristics are also utilized.

Result: Extensive experiments on three benchmarks show SP-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in medical anomaly detection.

Conclusion: SP-Mamba is effective and robust for unsupervised medical anomaly detection, validated by superior performance on diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Radiography imaging protocols target on specific anatomical regions,
resulting in highly consistent images with recurrent structural patterns across
patients. Recent advances in medical anomaly detection have demonstrated the
effectiveness of CNN- and transformer-based approaches. However, CNNs exhibit
limitations in capturing long-range dependencies, while transformers suffer
from quadratic computational complexity. In contrast, Mamba-based models,
leveraging superior long-range modeling, structural feature extraction, and
linear computational efficiency, have emerged as a promising alternative. To
capitalize on the inherent structural regularity of medical images, this study
introduces SP-Mamba, a spatial-perception Mamba framework for unsupervised
medical anomaly detection. The window-sliding prototype learning and
Circular-Hilbert scanning-based Mamba are introduced to better exploit
consistent anatomical patterns and leverage spatial information for medical
anomaly detection. Furthermore, we excavate the concentration and contrast
characteristics of anomaly maps for improving anomaly detection. Extensive
experiments on three diverse medical anomaly detection benchmarks confirm the
proposed method's state-of-the-art performance, validating its efficacy and
robustness. The code is available at https://github.com/Ray-RuiPan/SP-Mamba.

TL;DR: MMBench-GUI is a hierarchical benchmark for evaluating GUI automation agents across multiple platforms, introducing the EQA metric for efficiency assessment. It highlights the importance of visual grounding, modular frameworks, and task efficiency.


<details>

Motivation: To address the lack of a comprehensive benchmark for GUI automation agents and the underexplored dimension of task efficiency.

Method: Develops MMBench-GUI with four levels (GUI Content Understanding, Element Grounding, Task Automation, Task Collaboration) and proposes the EQA metric.

Result: Identifies visual grounding as critical for task success and emphasizes modular frameworks, planning, and cross-platform generalization. Task efficiency remains a challenge.

Conclusion: Precise localization, effective planning, and early stopping are essential for efficient and scalable GUI automation. The benchmark and tools will be publicly available.

Abstract: We introduce MMBench-GUI, a hierarchical benchmark for evaluating GUI
automation agents across Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and Web
platforms. It comprises four levels: GUI Content Understanding, Element
Grounding, Task Automation, and Task Collaboration, covering essential skills
for GUI agents. In addition, we propose a novel Efficiency-Quality Area (EQA)
metric to assess GUI agent execution efficiency in online automation scenarios.
Through MMBench-GUI, we identify accurate visual grounding as a critical
determinant of overall task success, emphasizing the substantial benefits of
modular frameworks that integrate specialized grounding modules. Furthermore,
to achieve reliable GUI automation, an agent requires strong task planning and
cross-platform generalization abilities, with long-context memory, a broad
action space, and long-term reasoning playing a critical role. More important,
task efficiency remains a critically underexplored dimension, and all models
suffer from substantial inefficiencies, with excessive redundant steps even
when tasks are ultimately completed. The integration of precise localization,
effective planning, and early stopping strategies is indispensable to enable
truly efficient and scalable GUI automation. Our benchmark code, evaluation
data, and running environment will be publicly available at

*Yangyang Xu,Xi Ye,Duo Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FGMoE, a novel MTL architecture combining intra-task, shared, and global experts for efficient dense prediction, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in balancing shared representations and task-specific specialization in MTL for dense prediction.

Method: Proposes FGMoE with intra-task, shared, and global experts, plus fine-tuning for parameter efficiency.

Result: FGMoE uses fewer parameters and outperforms current MoE-based MTL models on NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context datasets.

Conclusion: FGMoE effectively balances specialization and sharing, improving performance and efficiency in dense prediction tasks.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) for dense prediction has shown promising results
but still faces challenges in balancing shared representations with
task-specific specialization. In this paper, we introduce a novel Fine-Grained
Mixture of Experts (FGMoE) architecture that explores MoE-based MTL models
through a combination of three key innovations and fine-tuning. First, we
propose intra-task experts that partition along intermediate hidden dimensions
of MLPs, enabling finer decomposition of task information while maintaining
parameter efficiency. Second, we introduce shared experts that consolidate
common information across different contexts of the same task, reducing
redundancy, and allowing routing experts to focus on unique aspects. Third, we
design a global expert that facilitates adaptive knowledge transfer across
tasks based on both input feature and task requirements, promoting beneficial
information sharing while preventing harmful interference. In addition, we use
the fine-tuning approach to improve parameter efficiency only by training the
parameters of the decoder. Extensive experimental results show that the
proposed FGMoE uses fewer parameters and significantly outperforms current
MoE-based competitive MTL models on two dense prediction datasets
(\textit{i.e.,} NYUD-v2, PASCAL-Context) in various metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for reliable predictions and uncertainty estimates in high-stakes medical imaging.

Method: Uses Symmetrical Flow Matching for classification, generation, and uncertainty quantification, with semantic mask conditioning for diagnostic relevance.

Result: Matches or outperforms baselines in accuracy and AUC on MedMNIST datasets, with validated uncertainty estimates.

Conclusion: MedSymmFlow effectively unifies classification, generation, and uncertainty quantification in medical imaging.

Abstract: Reliable medical image classification requires accurate predictions and
well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, especially in high-stakes clinical
settings. This work presents MedSymmFlow, a generative-discriminative hybrid
model built on Symmetrical Flow Matching, designed to unify classification,
generation, and uncertainty quantification in medical imaging. MedSymmFlow
leverages a latent-space formulation that scales to high-resolution inputs and
introduces a semantic mask conditioning mechanism to enhance diagnostic
relevance. Unlike standard discriminative models, it naturally estimates
uncertainty through its generative sampling process. The model is evaluated on
four MedMNIST datasets, covering a range of modalities and pathologies. The
results show that MedSymmFlow matches or exceeds the performance of established
baselines in classification accuracy and AUC, while also delivering reliable
uncertainty estimates validated by performance improvements under selective
prediction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LISA is a plug-and-play approach to reduce object hallucinations in MLLMs by hierarchical modulation and multi-layer fusion, improving consistency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs often hallucinate objects not in images, degrading reliability in vision-language tasks.

Method: LISA uses layer-wise spectral modulation and token-level logit fusion to stabilize attention and integrate features adaptively.

Result: LISA reduces hallucinations by up to 53.6% and improves POPE F1 by 4.5%.

Conclusion: LISA effectively mitigates hallucinations in MLLMs, enhancing their reliability and generalization.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language tasks such
as image captioning but remain prone to object hallucinations, where they
describe objects that do not appear in the image. To mitigate this, we propose
\textbf{LISA}, a \textbf{L}ayer-wise \textbf{I}ntegration and
\textbf{S}uppression \textbf{A}pproach that enhances generation consistency
through hierarchical modulation and multi-layer fusion. LISA leverages the
functional hierarchy within MLLMs, where shallow layers provide visual
grounding, middle layers encode semantics, and deep layers tend to amplify
spurious signals. First, zone-specific spectral modulation stabilizes attention
by suppressing over-amplified activations in deeper layers while preserving
alignment cues in earlier layers. Second, token-level logits from selected
layers are fused via anchor-based routing, with token-wise anchor selection and
soft logit fusion enabling adaptive integration during decoding. LISA is fully
\textbf{plug-and-play} and can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLMs,
including Qwen2.5-VL. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that LISA reduces
hallucinations by up to 53.6\% in $\mathrm{CHAIR}_I$ and improves POPE F1 by
4.5\%, demonstrating strong generalization across models and tasks.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Cross Spatial Temporal Fusion (CSTF) mechanism for cross-modal remote sensing image matching, improving feature representation and achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in cross-modal remote sensing image matching due to geometric and radiometric differences, and limitations of existing methods in capturing cross-modal similarities.

Method: CSTF integrates scale-invariant keypoints, creates correspondence maps, and reformulates similarity matching as a classification task using SoftMax and FCN layers.

Result: Achieves 90.99% mAP on HRSC2016 and 90.86% on DOTA, with 12.5 FPS inference speed.

Conclusion: CSTF enhances cross-modal feature matching, improving downstream applications like object detection.

Abstract: Effectively describing features for cross-modal remote sensing image matching
remains a challenging task due to the significant geometric and radiometric
differences between multimodal images. Existing methods primarily extract
features at the fully connected layer but often fail to capture cross-modal
similarities effectively. We propose a Cross Spatial Temporal Fusion (CSTF)
mechanism that enhances feature representation by integrating scale-invariant
keypoints detected independently in both reference and query images. Our
approach improves feature matching in two ways: First, by creating
correspondence maps that leverage information from multiple image regions
simultaneously, and second, by reformulating the similarity matching process as
a classification task using SoftMax and Fully Convolutional Network (FCN)
layers. This dual approach enables CSTF to maintain sensitivity to distinctive
local features while incorporating broader contextual information, resulting in
robust matching across diverse remote sensing modalities. To demonstrate the
practical utility of improved feature matching, we evaluate CSTF on object
detection tasks using the HRSC2016 and DOTA benchmark datasets. Our method
achieves state-of-theart performance with an average mAP of 90.99% on HRSC2016
and 90.86% on DOTA, outperforming existing models. The CSTF model maintains
computational efficiency with an inference speed of 12.5 FPS. These results
validate that our approach to crossmodal feature matching directly enhances
downstream remote sensing applications such as object detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PatchTraj is a dynamic patch-based framework for pedestrian trajectory prediction, unifying time and frequency domains to improve motion dynamics modeling and long-range dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods inadequately model human motion dynamics and lack interaction between time and frequency domains in trajectory sequences.

Method: Decomposes trajectories into time and frequency components, uses dynamic patch partitioning, adaptive embedding, hierarchical feature aggregation, and cross-modal attention for fusion.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ETH-UCY, SDD, NBA, and JRDB datasets.

Conclusion: PatchTraj effectively balances local details and long-range dependencies, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving and
robotics. While existing point-based and grid-based methods expose two key
limitations: insufficiently modeling human motion dynamics, as they fail to
balance local motion details with long-range spatiotemporal dependencies, and
the time representation lacks interaction with the frequency domain in modeling
trajectory sequences. To address these challenges, we propose PatchTraj, a
dynamic patch-based trajectory prediction framework that unifies time-domain
and frequency-domain representations. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory
into raw time sequences and frequency components, employing dynamic patch
partitioning for multi-scale trajectory segmentation to capture hierarchical
motion patterns. Each patch is processed by an adaptive embedding layer with
scale-aware feature extraction, followed by hierarchical feature aggregation to
model both fine-grained and long-range dependencies. The outputs of two
branches interact via cross-modal attention, enabling complementary fusion of
temporal and spectral cues. Finally, a Transformer encoder-decoder integrates
both modalities to autoregressively predict future trajectories. Extensive
experiments on ETH-UCY, SDD, NBA, and JRDB datasets demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TopGeoFormer is an end-to-end architecture for point cloud recovery, combining topological and geometric features in sampling and restoration phases. It uses topological embedding, InterTwining Attention, and dual loss functions for optimization, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to effectively leverage both topological and geometric attributes in point cloud recovery.

Method: Proposes TopGeoFormer with topological embedding, InterTwining Attention for feature fusion, and dual loss functions (geometry and topological constraint) for optimization.

Result: Outperforms conventional and learning-based sampling/upsampling methods in quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: TopGeoFormer effectively integrates topological and geometric features, achieving superior performance in point cloud recovery.

Abstract: Recovering point clouds involves the sequential process of sampling and
restoration, yet existing methods struggle to effectively leverage both
topological and geometric attributes. To address this, we propose an end-to-end
architecture named \textbf{TopGeoFormer}, which maintains these critical
features throughout the sampling and restoration phases. First, we revisit
traditional feature extraction techniques to yield topological embedding using
a continuous mapping of relative relationships between neighboring points, and
integrate it in both phases for preserving the structure of the original space.
Second, we propose the \textbf{InterTwining Attention} to fully merge
topological and geometric embeddings, which queries shape with local awareness
in both phases to form a learnable shape context facilitated with point-wise,
point-shape-wise, and intra-shape features. Third, we introduce a full geometry
loss and a topological constraint loss to optimize the embeddings in both
Euclidean and topological spaces. The geometry loss uses inconsistent matching
between coarse-to-fine generations and targets for reconstructing better
geometric details, and the constraint loss limits embedding variances for
better approximation of the topological space. In experiments, we
comprehensively analyze the circumstances using the conventional and
learning-based sampling/upsampling algorithms. The quantitative and qualitative
results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing sampling
and recovery methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MixA-Q is a mixed-precision activation quantization framework for window-based vision transformers, improving efficiency by assigning lower bit widths to less important windows. It achieves speedups without accuracy loss and reduces quantization degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the efficiency of quantized window-based vision transformers by leveraging intra-layer activation sparsity, balancing performance and computational speed.

Method: MixA-Q separates window computations, assigns lower bit widths to less important windows, and introduces a Two-Branch Swin Block for high- and low-bit precision processing.

Result: Achieves 1.35x speedup without accuracy loss in PTQ, 1.25x speedup in QAT, and 1.53x speedup with minimal mAP drop. Also improves mAP of W4A4 model by 0.7%.

Conclusion: MixA-Q effectively balances efficiency and performance in quantized vision transformers, offering significant speedups and reduced quantization degradation.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose MixA-Q, a mixed-precision activation quantization
framework that leverages intra-layer activation sparsity (a concept widely
explored in activation pruning methods) for efficient inference of quantized
window-based vision transformers. For a given uniform-bit quantization
configuration, MixA-Q separates the batched window computations within Swin
blocks and assigns a lower bit width to the activations of less important
windows, improving the trade-off between model performance and efficiency. We
introduce a Two-Branch Swin Block that processes activations separately in
high- and low-bit precision, enabling seamless integration of our method with
most quantization-aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization (PTQ)
methods, or with simple modifications. Our experimental evaluations over the
COCO dataset demonstrate that MixA-Q achieves a training-free 1.35x
computational speedup without accuracy loss in PTQ configuration. With QAT,
MixA-Q achieves a lossless 1.25x speedup and a 1.53x speedup with only a 1% mAP
drop by incorporating activation pruning. Notably, by reducing the quantization
error in important regions, our sparsity-aware quantization adaptation improves
the mAP of the quantized W4A4 model (with both weights and activations in 4-bit
precision) by 0.7%, reducing quantization degradation by 24%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAHNet balances conservative and aggressive predictions in few-shot segmentation by combining prototype and affinity learning, improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the imbalance between conservative predictions of prototype learning and aggressive predictions of affinity learning in few-shot segmentation.

Method: Proposes PAHNet with Prototype-guided Feature Enhancement (PFE) and Attention Score Calibration (ASC) modules to refine affinity learning using prototype predictions.

Result: Outperforms recent methods on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets in 1-shot and 5-shot settings.

Conclusion: PAHNet effectively mitigates aggressiveness in affinity learning, enhancing segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: This paper studies the few-shot segmentation (FSS) task, which aims to
segment objects belonging to unseen categories in a query image by learning a
model on a small number of well-annotated support samples. Our analysis of two
mainstream FSS paradigms reveals that the predictions made by prototype
learning methods are usually conservative, while those of affinity learning
methods tend to be more aggressive. This observation motivates us to balance
the conservative and aggressive information captured by these two types of FSS
frameworks so as to improve the segmentation performance. To achieve this, we
propose a **P**rototype-**A**ffinity **H**ybrid **Net**work (PAHNet), which
introduces a Prototype-guided Feature Enhancement (PFE) module and an Attention
Score Calibration (ASC) module in each attention block of an affinity learning
model (called affinity learner). These two modules utilize the predictions
generated by a pre-trained prototype learning model (called prototype
predictor) to enhance the foreground information in support and query image
representations and suppress the mismatched foreground-background (FG-BG)
relationships between them, respectively. In this way, the aggressiveness of
the affinity learner can be effectively mitigated, thereby eventually
increasing the segmentation accuracy of our PAHNet method. Experimental results
show that PAHNet outperforms most recently proposed methods across 1-shot and
5-shot settings on both PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets, suggesting its
effectiveness. The code is available at: [GitHub - tianyu-zou/PAHNet: Balancing

### [60] [DASH: 4D Hash Encoding with Self-Supervised Decomposition for Real-Time Dynamic Scene Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19141)
*Jie Chen,Zhangchi Hu,Peixi Wu,Huyue Zhu,Hebei Li,Xiaoyan Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DASH is a real-time dynamic scene rendering framework using 4D hash encoding and self-supervised decomposition to improve rendering quality and avoid low-rank assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for dynamic scene reconstruction suffer from feature overlap, poor rendering quality, and hash collisions due to unsuitable assumptions.

Method: DASH employs self-supervised decomposition, multiresolution 4D hash encoding for dynamics, and spatio-temporal smoothness regularization.

Result: DASH achieves state-of-the-art performance with 264 FPS on a single GPU, offering enhanced visual quality.

Conclusion: DASH effectively addresses challenges in dynamic scene rendering, providing high-quality real-time results.

Abstract: Dynamic scene reconstruction is a long-term challenge in 3D vision. Existing
plane-based methods in dynamic Gaussian splatting suffer from an unsuitable
low-rank assumption, causing feature overlap and poor rendering quality.
Although 4D hash encoding provides an explicit representation without low-rank
constraints, directly applying it to the entire dynamic scene leads to
substantial hash collisions and redundancy. To address these challenges, we
present DASH, a real-time dynamic scene rendering framework that employs 4D
hash encoding coupled with self-supervised decomposition. Our approach begins
with a self-supervised decomposition mechanism that separates dynamic and
static components without manual annotations or precomputed masks. Next, we
introduce a multiresolution 4D hash encoder for dynamic elements, providing an
explicit representation that avoids the low-rank assumption. Finally, we
present a spatio-temporal smoothness regularization strategy to mitigate
unstable deformation artifacts. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate
that DASH achieves state-of-the-art dynamic rendering performance, exhibiting
enhanced visual quality at real-time speeds of 264 FPS on a single 4090 GPU.

### [61] [Patch Pruning Strategy Based on Robust Statistical Measures of Attention Weight Diversity in Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19175)
*Yuki Igaue,Hiroaki Aizawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A patch pruning strategy for vision transformers evaluates patch importance using variance of attention weights, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the quadratic computational complexity of multi-head self-attention in vision transformers by pruning redundant patches.

Method: Propose a patch pruning strategy based on variance of attention weights across heads, with optional robust statistical measures like median absolute deviation. Also introduce overlapping patch embeddings.

Result: Improved throughput while maintaining classification accuracy, especially in fine-tuning scenarios. Overlapping embeddings enhance performance with comparable throughput.

Conclusion: The method effectively balances computational efficiency and accuracy, leveraging multi-head attention's diversity and robust statistical measures.

Abstract: Multi-head self-attention is a distinctive feature extraction mechanism of
vision transformers that computes pairwise relationships among all input
patches, contributing significantly to their high performance. However, it is
known to incur a quadratic computational complexity with respect to the number
of patches. One promising approach to address this issue is patch pruning,
which improves computational efficiency by identifying and removing redundant
patches. In this work, we propose a patch pruning strategy that evaluates the
importance of each patch based on the variance of attention weights across
multiple attention heads. This approach is inspired by the design of multi-head
self-attention, which aims to capture diverse attention patterns across
different subspaces of feature representations. The proposed method can be
easily applied during both training and inference, and achieves improved
throughput while maintaining classification accuracy in scenarios such as
fine-tuning with pre-trained models. In addition, we also found that using
robust statistical measures, such as the median absolute deviation in place of
variance, to assess patch importance can similarly lead to strong performance.
Furthermore, by introducing overlapping patch embeddings, our method achieves
better performance with comparable throughput to conventional approaches that
utilize all patches.

*Kotha Kartheek,Lingamaneni Gnanesh Chowdary,Snehasis Mukherjee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a unified continual learning framework for image restoration across fog, snow, and rain, using selective kernel fusion, EWC, and cycle-contrastive loss, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on single weather conditions, but autonomous driving requires a unified model for diverse weather restoration.

Method: Uses selective kernel fusion, EWC for continual learning, and cycle-contrastive loss for feature discrimination and semantic consistency.

Result: Significant improvements in PSNR, SSIM, and perceptual quality on benchmark datasets for dehazing, desnowing, and deraining.

Conclusion: The framework effectively unifies restoration tasks, reduces data dependency, and outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Restoration of images contaminated by different adverse weather conditions
such as fog, snow, and rain is a challenging task due to the varying nature of
the weather conditions. Most of the existing methods focus on any one
particular weather conditions. However, for applications such as autonomous
driving, a unified model is necessary to perform restoration of corrupted
images due to different weather conditions. We propose a continual learning
approach to propose a unified framework for image restoration. The proposed
framework integrates three key innovations: (1) Selective Kernel Fusion layers
that dynamically combine global and local features for robust adaptive feature
selection; (2) Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) to enable continual learning
and mitigate catastrophic forgetting across multiple restoration tasks; and (3)
a novel Cycle-Contrastive Loss that enhances feature discrimination while
preserving semantic consistency during domain translation. Further, we propose
an unpaired image restoration approach to reduce the dependance of the proposed
approach on the training data. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark
datasets for dehazing, desnowing and deraining tasks demonstrate significant
improvements in PSNR, SSIM, and perceptual quality over the state-of-the-art.

*Haoang Lu,Yuanqi Su,Xiaoning Zhang,Longjun Gao,Yu Xue,Le Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisHall3D is a two-stage framework for monocular semantic scene completion, addressing feature entanglement and geometric inconsistency by separating visible region reconstruction and invisible region inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods suffer from feature entanglement and geometric inconsistency in scene completion tasks.

Method: VisHall3D uses VisFrontierNet for visible region reconstruction and OcclusionMAE for invisible region hallucination, with noise injection for plausible geometries.

Result: VisHall3D achieves state-of-the-art performance on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework improves reconstruction quality and advances scene understanding for applications like autonomous driving.

Abstract: This paper introduces VisHall3D, a novel two-stage framework for monocular
semantic scene completion that aims to address the issues of feature
entanglement and geometric inconsistency prevalent in existing methods.
VisHall3D decomposes the scene completion task into two stages: reconstructing
the visible regions (vision) and inferring the invisible regions
(hallucination). In the first stage, VisFrontierNet, a visibility-aware
projection module, is introduced to accurately trace the visual frontier while
preserving fine-grained details. In the second stage, OcclusionMAE, a
hallucination network, is employed to generate plausible geometries for the
invisible regions using a noise injection mechanism. By decoupling scene
completion into these two distinct stages, VisHall3D effectively mitigates
feature entanglement and geometric inconsistency, leading to significantly
improved reconstruction quality.
  The effectiveness of VisHall3D is validated through extensive experiments on
two challenging benchmarks: SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360. VisHall3D
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous methods by a
significant margin and paves the way for more accurate and reliable scene
understanding in autonomous driving and other applications.

### [64] [Querying Autonomous Vehicle Point Clouds: Enhanced by 3D Object Counting with CounterNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19209)
*Xiaoyu Zhang,Zhifeng Bao,Hai Dong,Ziwei Wang,Jiajun Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CounterNet improves object counting accuracy in 3D point cloud data, enhancing query reliability for autonomous vehicle analytics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for object counting in 3D point clouds are unreliable, leading to errors in query results for tasks like collision detection and traffic analysis.

Method: Proposes CounterNet, a heatmap-based network focusing on object centers for counting accuracy, with feature map partitioning and dynamic model selection.

Result: CounterNet boosts counting accuracy by 5% to 20% across object categories, improving query outcomes.

Conclusion: CounterNet addresses the limitations of prior work, offering a robust solution for accurate object counting in autonomous vehicle data.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles generate massive volumes of point cloud data, yet only a
subset is relevant for specific tasks such as collision detection, traffic
analysis, or congestion monitoring. Effectively querying this data is essential
to enable targeted analytics. In this work, we formalize point cloud querying
by defining three core query types: RETRIEVAL, COUNT, and AGGREGATION, each
aligned with distinct analytical scenarios. All these queries rely heavily on
accurate object counts to produce meaningful results, making precise object
counting a critical component of query execution. Prior work has focused on
indexing techniques for 2D video data, assuming detection models provide
accurate counting information. However, when applied to 3D point cloud data,
state-of-the-art detection models often fail to generate reliable object
counts, leading to substantial errors in query results. To address this
limitation, we propose CounterNet, a heatmap-based network designed for
accurate object counting in large-scale point cloud data. Rather than focusing
on accurate object localization, CounterNet detects object presence by finding
object centers to improve counting accuracy. We further enhance its performance
with a feature map partitioning strategy using overlapping regions, enabling
better handling of both small and large objects in complex traffic scenes. To
adapt to varying frame characteristics, we introduce a per-frame dynamic model
selection strategy that selects the most effective configuration for each
input. Evaluations on three real-world autonomous vehicle datasets show that
CounterNet improves counting accuracy by 5% to 20% across object categories,
resulting in more reliable query outcomes across all supported query types.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPA-ADV, a dataset for personalized attention in ads, and PRE-MAP, a reinforcement learning-based saliency model, addressing gaps in subjective cognitive diversity and precise point prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models overlook subjective cognitive diversity in visual attention and struggle with precise point prediction due to limitations like hallucinations in MLLMs.

Method: Proposes PRE-MAP, a reinforcement learning-optimized eye-tracking model, and C-GRPO for accurate point prediction, using a large-scale dataset (SPA-ADV) with diverse user profiles.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness on SPA-ADV and benchmarks, improving personalized attention prediction.

Conclusion: The approach advances personalized visual attention modeling and offers a scalable solution for diverse user profiles.

Abstract: Visual selective attention, driven by individual preferences, regulates human
prioritization of visual stimuli by bridging subjective cognitive mechanisms
with objective visual elements, thereby steering the semantic interpretation
and hierarchical processing of dynamic visual scenes. However, existing models
and datasets predominantly neglect the influence of subjective cognitive
diversity on fixation behavior. Conventional saliency prediction models,
typically employing segmentation approaches, rely on low-resolution imagery to
generate saliency heatmaps, subsequently upscaled to native resolutions, which
limiting their capacity to capture personalized attention patterns.
Furthermore, MLLMs are constrained by factors such as hallucinations, making it
very costly to strictly adhere to the expected format in tasks involving
multiple point predictions, and achieving precise point positioning is
challenging. To address these limitations, we present Subjective Personalized
Attention for Advertisement Videos, namely SPA-ADV, a large-scale multimodal
dataset capturing gaze behaviors from over 4,500 participants varying in age
and gender with 486 videos. Furthermore, we propose PRE-MAP, a novel
eye-tracking saliency model that characterizes Personalized visual disparities
through Reinforcement learning-optimized Eye-tracking, built upon MLLMs and
guided by Multi-Attribute user profiles to predict Points. To ensure MLLMs
produce prediction points that are both format-correct and spatially accurate,
we introduce Consistency Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO), inspired
by the variability in eye movement points and Multi-Attribute profiles.
Extensive experiments on SPA-ADV and other benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. The code and dataset are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for generating lively virtual scenes with multi-human contextual motions using LLMs, addressing human-human and human-scene interactions at scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the complexity of generating multi-human contextual motion by leveraging LLMs for holistic reasoning and scalable solutions.

Method: Uses an event generator to break scenes into sequences of small events, synthesizes motions based on spatial guidance, and employs a high-level module for scalable context translation.

Result: Benchmark results and user studies confirm the framework's effectiveness in capturing scene context with high scalability.

Conclusion: The framework successfully generates diverse and scalable multi-human contextual motions, supported by a benchmark for assessment.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a framework that creates a lively virtual dynamic
scene with contextual motions of multiple humans. Generating multi-human
contextual motion requires holistic reasoning over dynamic relationships among
human-human and human-scene interactions. We adapt the power of a large
language model (LLM) to digest the contextual complexity within textual input
and convert the task into tangible subproblems such that we can generate
multi-agent behavior beyond the scale that was not considered before.
Specifically, our event generator formulates the temporal progression of a
dynamic scene into a sequence of small events. Each event calls for a
well-defined motion involving relevant characters and objects. Next, we
synthesize the motions of characters at positions sampled based on spatial
guidance. We employ a high-level module to deliver scalable yet comprehensive
context, translating events into relative descriptions that enable the
retrieval of precise coordinates. As the first to address this problem at scale
and with diversity, we offer a benchmark to assess diverse aspects of
contextual reasoning. Benchmark results and user studies show that our
framework effectively captures scene context with high scalability. The code
and benchmark, along with result videos, are available at our project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoopTrack is an end-to-end framework for cooperative 3D multi-object tracking, using sparse instance-level features and adaptive cross-agent association to improve perception while minimizing transmission costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of single-vehicle autonomous systems and the lack of research on cooperative sequential perception tasks like 3D multi-object tracking.

Method: Proposes CoopTrack with learnable instance association, Multi-Dimensional Feature Extraction, and Cross-Agent Association and Aggregation.

Result: Achieves 39.0% mAP and 32.8% AMOTA on V2X-Seq, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: CoopTrack effectively enhances cooperative perception with efficient feature transmission and state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Cooperative perception aims to address the inherent limitations of
single-vehicle autonomous driving systems through information exchange among
multiple agents. Previous research has primarily focused on single-frame
perception tasks. However, the more challenging cooperative sequential
perception tasks, such as cooperative 3D multi-object tracking, have not been
thoroughly investigated. Therefore, we propose CoopTrack, a fully
instance-level end-to-end framework for cooperative tracking, featuring
learnable instance association, which fundamentally differs from existing
approaches. CoopTrack transmits sparse instance-level features that
significantly enhance perception capabilities while maintaining low
transmission costs. Furthermore, the framework comprises two key components:
Multi-Dimensional Feature Extraction, and Cross-Agent Association and
Aggregation, which collectively enable comprehensive instance representation
with semantic and motion features, and adaptive cross-agent association and
fusion based on a feature graph. Experiments on both the V2X-Seq and Griffin
datasets demonstrate that CoopTrack achieves excellent performance.
Specifically, it attains state-of-the-art results on V2X-Seq, with 39.0\% mAP
and 32.8\% AMOTA. The project is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel unified multimodal anomaly detection framework for 3D depth anomalies, disentangling depth and appearance, and enabling richer anomaly generation in RGB and depth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with 3D anomaly detection due to inadequate representation of 3D information in multimodal scenarios and scarcity of abnormal samples.

Method: Extracts visible depth from 3D point clouds, uses 2D RGB for appearance, and introduces anomaly generators for RGB and depth.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art on MVTec-3D AD and Eyecandies datasets.

Conclusion: The framework effectively bridges 2D and 3D anomaly detection, leveraging multimodal features without complex fusion.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection for 2D objects has gained significant attention
and achieved progress in anomaly detection (AD) methods. However, identifying
3D depth anomalies using only 2D information is insufficient. Despite
explicitly fusing depth information into RGB images or using point cloud
backbone networks to extract depth features, both approaches struggle to
adequately represent 3D information in multimodal scenarios due to the
disparities among different modal information. Additionally, due to the
scarcity of abnormal samples in industrial data, especially in multimodal
scenarios, it is necessary to perform anomaly generation to simulate real-world
abnormal samples. Therefore, we propose a novel unified multimodal anomaly
detection framework to address these issues. Our contributions consist of 3 key
aspects. (1) We extract visible depth information from 3D point cloud data
simply and use 2D RGB images to represent appearance, which disentangles depth
and appearance to support unified anomaly generation. (2) Benefiting from the
flexible input representation, the proposed Multi-Scale Gaussian Anomaly
Generator and Unified Texture Anomaly Generator can generate richer anomalies
in RGB and depth. (3) All modules share parameters for both RGB and depth data,
effectively bridging 2D and 3D anomaly detection. Subsequent modules can
directly leverage features from both modalities without complex fusion.
Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) on MVTec-3D AD
and Eyecandies datasets. Code available at:

TL;DR: OV-Fact is a novel method for evaluating factuality in long captions without human annotations, improving agreement with human judgments and enabling data filtering for better model training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large VLMs struggle with generating factual long captions, and traditional metrics fail to evaluate them effectively without human annotations.

Method: OV-Fact uses open-vocabulary visual grounding and tool-based verification to measure factuality, combining descriptiveness and precision in one metric.

Result: Models trained on OV-Fact-filtered data show improved factuality without losing descriptiveness on downstream benchmarks.

Conclusion: OV-Fact provides a reference-free, effective solution for evaluating and improving caption factuality in VLMs.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle to generate long and
factual captions. However, traditional measures for hallucination and
factuality are not well suited for evaluating longer, more diverse captions and
in settings where ground-truth human-annotated captions are unavailable. We
introduce OV-Fact, a novel method for measuring caption factuality of long
captions that leverages open-vocabulary visual grounding and tool-based
verification without depending on human annotations. Our method improves
agreement with human judgments and captures both caption descriptiveness
(recall) and factual precision in the same metric. Furthermore, unlike previous
metrics, our reference-free method design enables new applications towards
factuality-based data filtering. We observe models trained on an
OVFact-filtered (2.5-5x less) subset of a large-scale, noisy (VLM-generated)
pretraining set meaningfully improve factuality precision without sacrificing
caption descriptiveness across a range of downstream long caption benchmarks.

TL;DR: SimMLM is a simple, effective framework for multimodal learning with missing modalities, using a dynamic gating mechanism and MoFe ranking loss to improve accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for handling missing modalities rely on complex architectures or imputation techniques, which can be inefficient or ineffective. SimMLM aims to provide a simpler, more adaptable solution.

Method: SimMLM uses a Dynamic Mixture of Modality Experts (DMoME) with a learnable gating mechanism and introduces the More vs. Fewer (MoFe) ranking loss to ensure stable or improved accuracy with more modalities.

Result: SimMLM outperforms existing methods on medical image segmentation and multimodal classification tasks, showing better accuracy, robustness, and reliability in both full and missing modality scenarios.

Conclusion: SimMLM offers a generic, effective solution for multimodal learning with missing modalities, validated by superior performance and alignment with intuitive principles.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose SimMLM, a simple yet powerful framework for
multimodal learning with missing modalities. Unlike existing approaches that
rely on sophisticated network architectures or complex data imputation
techniques, SimMLM provides a generic and effective solution that can adapt to
various missing modality scenarios with improved accuracy and robustness.
Specifically, SimMLM consists of a generic Dynamic Mixture of Modality Experts
(DMoME) architecture, featuring a dynamic, learnable gating mechanism that
automatically adjusts each modality's contribution in both full and partial
modality settings. A key innovation of SimMLM is the proposed More vs. Fewer
(MoFe) ranking loss, which ensures that task accuracy improves or remains
stable as more modalities are made available. This aligns the model with an
intuitive principle: removing one or more modalities should not increase
accuracy. We validate SimMLM on multimodal medical image segmentation (BraTS
2018) and multimodal classification (UPMC Food-101, avMNIST) tasks, where it
consistently surpasses competitive methods, demonstrating superior accuracy,
interpretability, robustness, and reliability across both complete and missing
modality scenarios at test time.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most SSL methods ignore temporal cues in videos, limiting their ability to learn robust visual features for dynamic scenes.

Method: Train a single-image encoder to predict next-frame representations from current frames, injecting 3D spatial and temporal priors without optical flow or tracking.

Result: Pre-training on a 2-hour video raises mIoU on ADE20K from 35.0 (DoRA) to 36.4, maintaining compatibility with image-only pipelines.

Conclusion: Video self-distillation is a lightweight method to enhance geometry-aware perception, crucial for Physical AI and world models.

Abstract: Self-supervised image encoders such as DINO have recently gained significant
interest for learning robust visual features without labels. However, most SSL
methods train on static images and miss the temporal cues inherent in videos.
We introduce a video-distilled single-image encoder trained to predict the
next-frame representation from the current frame. This simple objective injects
3D spatial and temporal priors without optical flow or tracking. When
pre-training on a single 2-hour video, our approach raises the mean
Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) on ADE20K from 35.0 (DoRA) to 36.4 while
remaining a drop-in replacement for image-only pipelines. Our results highlight
video self-distillation as a lightweight route to geometry-aware perception an

TL;DR: RemoteReasoner is a flexible workflow for remote sensing reasoning tasks, integrating a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) and reinforcement learning for autonomous reasoning and diverse output formats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing remote sensing approaches lack autonomy and flexibility, relying on supervised fine-tuning, which limits reasoning capabilities.

Method: Proposes RemoteReasoner, combining MLLM for instruction interpretation and target localization with RL for autonomous reasoning and task adaptation strategies for diverse outputs.

Result: Achieves strong performance in multi-granularity tasks (region/pixel-level) and enables novel capabilities like contour extraction.

Conclusion: RemoteReasoner addresses limitations of existing methods, offering a robust and flexible solution for complex remote sensing reasoning.

Abstract: Remote sensing imagery presents vast, inherently unstructured spatial data,
demanding sophisticated reasoning to interpret complex user intents and
contextual relationships beyond simple recognition tasks. In this paper, we aim
to construct an Earth observation workflow to handle complex queries by
reasoning about spatial context and user intent. As a reasoning workflow, it
should be somewhat autonomous, where predefined ground-truth reasoning paths do
not constrain the learning process. Furthermore, its architecture ought to be
unified yet flexible, enabling the model to perform diverse reasoning tasks
with distinct output formats through a single forward pass. Existing remote
sensing approaches fail to address these requirements, as they rely on
supervised fine-tuning paradigms that constrain the autonomy of reasoning. To
this end, we propose RemoteReasoner, a flexible and robust workflow for remote
sensing reasoning tasks. The design of RemoteReasoner integrates a multi-modal
large language model (MLLM) for interpreting user instructions and localizing
targets, together with task adaptation strategies that enable multi-granularity
output generation. In contrast to existing methods, our framework is trained
with reinforcement learning (RL) to endow the MLLM sufficient autonomy for
precise reasoning. At the inference stage, our adaptation strategies enable
diverse output formats at inference time without requiring task-specific
decoders or further fine-tuning. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that
RemoteReasoner achieves remarkable performance across multi-granularity
reasoning tasks, including region-level and pixel-level. Additionally, our
framework enables novel capabilities such as the contour extraction task beyond
the reach of existing reasoning pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Outdoor 3D object detection faces challenges in effectively integrating LiDAR and RGB data for precise detection.

Method: The MuStD network uses a three-stream structure: LiDAR-PillarNet for sparse 2D pillar features, LiDAR-Height Compression for Bird's-Eye View features, and a 3D Multimodal stream combining RGB and LiDAR data via UV mapping and polar coordinate indexing.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive results on the KITTI Object Detection Benchmark while remaining efficient.

Conclusion: The MuStD network effectively fuses LiDAR and RGB data, enhancing 3D object detection accuracy and setting new benchmarks.

Abstract: Fusion of LiDAR and RGB data has the potential to enhance outdoor 3D object
detection accuracy. To address real-world challenges in outdoor 3D object
detection, fusion of LiDAR and RGB input has started gaining traction. However,
effective integration of these modalities for precise object detection task
still remains a largely open problem. To address that, we propose a MultiStream
Detection (MuStD) network, that meticulously extracts task-relevant information
from both data modalities. The network follows a three-stream structure. Its
LiDAR-PillarNet stream extracts sparse 2D pillar features from the LiDAR input
while the LiDAR-Height Compression stream computes Bird's-Eye View features. An
additional 3D Multimodal stream combines RGB and LiDAR features using UV
mapping and polar coordinate indexing. Eventually, the features containing
comprehensive spatial, textural and geometric information are carefully fused
and fed to a detection head for 3D object detection. Our extensive evaluation

Result: PINO generates realistic, physically coherent, and customizable multi-person interactions.

Conclusion: PINO is effective for diverse applications like animation, gaming, and robotics without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Generating realistic group interactions involving multiple characters remains
challenging due to increasing complexity as group size expands. While existing
conditional diffusion models incrementally generate motions by conditioning on
previously generated characters, they rely on single shared prompts, limiting
nuanced control and leading to overly simplified interactions. In this paper,
we introduce Person-Interaction Noise Optimization (PINO), a novel,
training-free framework designed for generating realistic and customizable
interactions among groups of arbitrary size. PINO decomposes complex group
interactions into semantically relevant pairwise interactions, and leverages
pretrained two-person interaction diffusion models to incrementally compose
group interactions. To ensure physical plausibility and avoid common artifacts
such as overlapping or penetration between characters, PINO employs
physics-based penalties during noise optimization. This approach allows precise
user control over character orientation, speed, and spatial relationships
without additional training. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that PINO
generates visually realistic, physically coherent, and adaptable multi-person
interactions suitable for diverse animation, gaming, and robotics applications.

*Viktar Dubovik,Łukasz Struski,Jacek Tabor,Dawid Rymarczyk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SIDE improves interpretability of prototypical neural networks by enforcing sparsity and using sigmoid activations, reducing explanation size by over 90% while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks lack transparency in high-stakes domains like medical imaging and autonomous driving, necessitating more interpretable models.

Method: SIDE introduces a training and pruning scheme for sparsity and replaces softmax with sigmoid activations to associate classes with fewer prototypes.

Result: SIDE matches existing methods' accuracy while reducing explanation size by over 90%, enhancing understandability.

Conclusion: SIDE offers a scalable and interpretable solution for prototype-based explanations in deep learning.

Abstract: Understanding the decisions made by deep neural networks is essential in
high-stakes domains such as medical imaging and autonomous driving. Yet, these
models often lack transparency, particularly in computer vision.
Prototypical-parts-based neural networks have emerged as a promising solution
by offering concept-level explanations. However, most are limited to
fine-grained classification tasks, with few exceptions such as InfoDisent.
InfoDisent extends prototypical models to large-scale datasets like ImageNet,
but produces complex explanations.
  We introduce Sparse Information Disentanglement for Explainability (SIDE), a
novel method that improves the interpretability of prototypical parts through a
dedicated training and pruning scheme that enforces sparsity. Combined with
sigmoid activations in place of softmax, this approach allows SIDE to associate
each class with only a small set of relevant prototypes. Extensive experiments
show that SIDE matches the accuracy of existing methods while reducing
explanation size by over $90\%$, substantially enhancing the understandability
of prototype-based explanations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ABCD, an improved YOLOX-based method for blood cell detection, incorporating CBAM and ASFF for better feature extraction and fusion, and CIOU loss for faster convergence. Outperforms baselines with higher mAP and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual blood cell detection is time-consuming and error-prone; deep learning offers a more efficient and accurate solution.

Method: Enhanced YOLOX with CBAM for feature extraction, ASFF for feature fusion, and CIOU loss for faster training.

Result: Achieved 95.49% mAP@0.5 and 86.89% mAP@0.5-0.9, with 2.9% faster detection than baseline.

Conclusion: ABCD is highly effective and efficient for real-time blood cell detection, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Detection of blood cells in microscopic images has become a major focus of
medical image analysis, playing a crucial role in gaining valuable insights
into a patient's health. Manual blood cell checks for disease detection are
known to be time-consuming, inefficient, and error-prone. To address these
limitations, analyzing blood cells using deep learning-based object detectors
can be regarded as a feasible solution. In this study, we propose automatic
blood cell detection method (ABCD) based on an improved version of YOLOX, an
object detector, for detecting various types of blood cells, including white
blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Firstly, we introduce the
Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) into the network's backbone to
enhance the efficiency of feature extraction. Furthermore, we introduce the
Adaptively Spatial Feature Fusion (ASFF) into the network's neck, which
optimizes the fusion of different features extracted from various stages of the
network. Finally, to speed up the model's convergence, we substitute the
Intersection over Union (IOU) loss function with the Complete Intersection over
Union (CIOU) loss function. The experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method is more effective than other existing methods for BCCD dataset.
Compared to the baseline algorithm, our method ABCD achieved 95.49 % mAP@0.5
and 86.89 % mAP@0.5-0.9, which are 2.8% and 23.41% higher, respectively, and
increased the detection speed by 2.9%, making it highly efficient for real-time
applications.

TL;DR: EffiComm reduces V2V communication data by 60% while maintaining high 3D object detection accuracy using selective transmission and adaptive grid reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming latency and scalability issues in V2V communication caused by transmitting raw sensor data.

Method: Two-stage reduction pipeline: Selective Transmission (ST) and Adaptive Grid Reduction (AGR) with a GNN, followed by feature fusion using a soft-gated MoE attention layer.

Result: Achieves 0.84 mAP@0.7 on OPV2V benchmark with only ~1.5 MB per frame, outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: EffiComm demonstrates the effectiveness of adaptive, learned communication for scalable V2X perception.

Abstract: Collaborative perception allows connected vehicles to exchange sensor
information and overcome each vehicle's blind spots. Yet transmitting raw point
clouds or full feature maps overwhelms Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications,
causing latency and scalability problems. We introduce EffiComm, an end-to-end
framework that transmits less than 40% of the data required by prior art while
maintaining state-of-the-art 3D object detection accuracy. EffiComm operates on
Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) feature maps from any modality and applies a two-stage
reduction pipeline: (1) Selective Transmission (ST) prunes low-utility regions
with a confidence mask; (2) Adaptive Grid Reduction (AGR) uses a Graph Neural
Network (GNN) to assign vehicle-specific keep ratios according to role and
network load. The remaining features are fused with a soft-gated
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) attention layer, offering greater capacity and
specialization for effective feature integration. On the OPV2V benchmark,
EffiComm reaches 0.84 mAP@0.7 while sending only an average of approximately
1.5 MB per frame, outperforming previous methods on the accuracy-per-bit curve.
These results highlight the value of adaptive, learned communication for
scalable Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) perception.

*Lanmiao Liu,Esam Ghaleb,Aslı Özyürek,Zerrin Yumak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel approach for generating semantically coherent gestures aligned with speech, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in realism and coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing gesture generation research focuses on rhythmic beat gestures, neglecting semantic context, creating a need for semantically grounded gestures.

Method: Uses a vector-quantized variational autoencoder for motion prior, followed by a module integrating speech, text semantics, and speaker identity to ensure semantic coherence.

Result: Enhances realism and coherence of gestures, outperforming benchmarks in objective and subjective metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively integrates semantic grounding, improving gesture generation quality.

Abstract: Creating a virtual avatar with semantically coherent gestures that are
aligned with speech is a challenging task. Existing gesture generation research
mainly focused on generating rhythmic beat gestures, neglecting the semantic
context of the gestures. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for
semantic grounding in co-speech gesture generation that integrates semantic
information at both fine-grained and global levels. Our approach starts with
learning the motion prior through a vector-quantized variational autoencoder.
Built on this model, a second-stage module is applied to automatically generate
gestures from speech, text-based semantics and speaker identity that ensures
consistency between the semantic relevance of generated gestures and
co-occurring speech semantics through semantic coherence and relevance modules.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enhances the realism and
coherence of semantic gestures. Extensive experiments and user studies show
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across two benchmarks
in co-speech gesture generation in both objective and subjective metrics. The
qualitative results of our model, code, dataset and pre-trained models can be

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EA-ViT proposes a framework for adapting Vision Transformers (ViTs) to diverse resource constraints without retraining multiple models, using a nested elastic architecture and a lightweight router.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying ViTs for varying resource constraints typically requires retraining multiple models, which is inefficient. EA-ViT aims to streamline this process.

Method: The approach involves a two-stage process: enhancing a pre-trained ViT with a nested elastic architecture for structural flexibility, and designing a lightweight router to select submodels based on computational budgets.

Result: Extensive experiments show EA-ViT's effectiveness and versatility in adapting ViTs for diverse constraints.

Conclusion: EA-ViT offers an efficient solution for deploying ViTs across varying resource constraints, reducing the need for multiple retraining efforts.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a foundational model in computer
vision, excelling in generalization and adaptation to downstream tasks.
However, deploying ViTs to support diverse resource constraints typically
requires retraining multiple, size-specific ViTs, which is both time-consuming
and energy-intensive. To address this issue, we propose an efficient ViT
adaptation framework that enables a single adaptation process to generate
multiple models of varying sizes for deployment on platforms with various
resource constraints. Our approach comprises two stages. In the first stage, we
enhance a pre-trained ViT with a nested elastic architecture that enables
structural flexibility across MLP expansion ratio, number of attention heads,
embedding dimension, and network depth. To preserve pre-trained knowledge and
ensure stable adaptation, we adopt a curriculum-based training strategy that
progressively increases elasticity. In the second stage, we design a
lightweight router to select submodels according to computational budgets and
downstream task demands. Initialized with Pareto-optimal configurations derived
via a customized NSGA-II algorithm, the router is then jointly optimized with
the backbone. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and versatility of EA-ViT. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses class imbalance in CXR diagnosis using a class-weighting mechanism with GMM clustering and Student t-distribution, improving zero-shot AUC by 7%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance in CXR datasets hinders self-supervised models, especially for long-tailed classes, despite CLIP's success in primary classes.

Method: Proposes a class-weighting mechanism using GMM clustering and Student t-distribution to refine latent space embeddings, enhancing rare class recognition.

Result: Achieves a 7% average improvement in zero-shot AUC scores across 40 classes in the MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses class imbalance, significantly boosting performance for rare classes in CXR diagnosis.

Abstract: Chest radiography (CXR) plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of various
diseases. However, the inherent class imbalance in the distribution of clinical
findings presents a significant challenge for current self-supervised deep
learning models. These models often fail to accurately classify long-tailed
classes. Current Vision-Language models such as Contrastive Language Image
Pre-training (CLIP) models effectively model the manifold distribution of the
latent space, enabling high zero-shot classification accuracies. Although CLIP
performs well on most of the primary classes in the dataset, our work reveals
that its effectiveness decreases significantly for classes with a long-tailed
distribution. Our approach employs a class-weighting mechanism that directly
aligns with the distribution of classes within the latent space. This method
ensures a substantial improvement in overall classification performance, with
particular emphasis on enhancing the recognition and accuracy of rarely
observed classes. We accomplish this by applying Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
clustering to the latent space. The subsequent clusters are further refined by
Student t-distribution, followed by a metric loss that utilizes the altered
embeddings. Our approach facilitates stable and adaptive clustering of the
features. This results in a notable average improvement of 7\% points in
zero-shot AUC scores across 40 classes in the MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset from
previous SOTA models.

Conclusion: BEV-LLM advances scene captioning for autonomous driving, offering improved performance and new datasets for diverse scenario testing.

Abstract: Autonomous driving technology has the potential to transform transportation,
but its wide adoption depends on the development of interpretable and
transparent decision-making systems. Scene captioning, which generates natural
language descriptions of the driving environment, plays a crucial role in
enhancing transparency, safety, and human-AI interaction. We introduce BEV-LLM,
a lightweight model for 3D captioning of autonomous driving scenes. BEV-LLM
leverages BEVFusion to combine 3D LiDAR point clouds and multi-view images,
incorporating a novel absolute positional encoding for view-specific scene
descriptions. Despite using a small 1B parameter base model, BEV-LLM achieves
competitive performance on the nuCaption dataset, surpassing state-of-the-art
by up to 5\% in BLEU scores. Additionally, we release two new datasets - nuView
(focused on environmental conditions and viewpoints) and GroundView (focused on
object grounding) - to better assess scene captioning across diverse driving
scenarios and address gaps in current benchmarks, along with initial
benchmarking results demonstrating their effectiveness.

*Toufiq Parag,Ahmed Elgammal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAELRE is a unified transformer architecture for efficient long-range encoding across modalities, combining token merging and attention approximation to reduce computational cost while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of long-context processing on a single device by mitigating the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms, overcoming limitations of existing modality-specific approaches.

Method: Proposes MAELRE, integrating token merging with attention approximation, progressively merging tokens and switching between lightweight and standard attention based on sequence length.

Result: MAELRE achieves superior accuracy with reduced computational cost on multi-modal classification tasks (text, time series, audio, vision).

Conclusion: MAELRE offers an efficient, modality-agnostic solution for long-context processing, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: The long-context capability of recent large transformer models can be
surmised to rely on techniques such as attention/model parallelism, as well as
hardware-level optimizations. While these strategies allow input lengths to
scale to millions of tokens, they do not fundamentally mitigate the quadratic
computational and memory complexity of the core attention mechanism. In this
paper, we address the challenge of long-context processing on a single device
using generic implementations by reducing the quadratic memory footprint and
inference cost. Existing approaches to extend the context length for generic
single device implementations -- such as token merging and modified attentions
-- are often modality specific and attain a suboptimal tradeoff between
accuracy and efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose MAELRE
(Modality Agnostic Efficient Long Range Encoder), a unified and efficient
transformer architecture designed for long-range encoding across diverse
modalities. MAELRE integrates token merging with attention approximation,
progressively merging tokens at different stages of internal computational
blocks. It employs a lightweight attention approximation when the number of
tokens is large, and switches to standard dot-product attention as the sequence
becomes shorter through successive aggregation. We demonstrate that MAELRE
achieves superior accuracy while reducing computational cost compared to
existing long-context models on classification tasks spanning multiple
modalities, including text, time series, audio, and vision.

TL;DR: DEFNet is a multitask-based Deep Evidential Fusion Network for BIQA, integrating scene and distortion classification with uncertainty estimation for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing BIQA methods lack sufficient integration and flexible uncertainty estimation, leading to suboptimal results.

Method: DEFNet uses multitask optimization, a novel trustworthy fusion strategy, and evidential learning for uncertainty estimation.

Result: Experiments show DEFNet's effectiveness, robustness, and strong generalization on synthetic and authentic distortion datasets.

Conclusion: DEFNet outperforms existing methods by integrating multitask learning and advanced uncertainty estimation.

Abstract: Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) methods often incorporate auxiliary
tasks to improve performance. However, existing approaches face limitations due
to insufficient integration and a lack of flexible uncertainty estimation,
leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose a
multitasks-based Deep Evidential Fusion Network (DEFNet) for BIQA, which
performs multitask optimization with the assistance of scene and distortion
type classification tasks. To achieve a more robust and reliable
representation, we design a novel trustworthy information fusion strategy. It
first combines diverse features and patterns across sub-regions to enhance
information richness, and then performs local-global information fusion by
balancing fine-grained details with coarse-grained context. Moreover, DEFNet
exploits advanced uncertainty estimation technique inspired by evidential
learning with the help of normal-inverse gamma distribution mixture. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and authentic distortion datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework. Additional evaluation
and analysis are carried out to highlight its strong generalization capability
and adaptability to previously unseen scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the internal reasoning mechanisms of LVLMs for spatiotemporal understanding, which remains poorly explored.

Method: A systematic framework with three circuits: visual auditing, semantic tracing, and attention flow, to analyze spatiotemporal semantics in LVLMs.

Result: Visual semantics are localized to specific object tokens (removal degrades performance by 92.6%), and interpretable concepts emerge in middle-to-late layers.

Conclusion: The findings provide mechanistic insights for spatiotemporal semantics in LVLMs, aiding the design of more robust and interpretable models.

Abstract: The processing mechanisms underlying language and image understanding in
large vision-language models (LVLMs) have been extensively studied. However,
the internal reasoning mechanisms of LVLMs for spatiotemporal understanding
remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a systematic,
circuit-based framework designed to investigate how spatiotemporal visual
semantics are represented and processed within these LVLMs. Specifically, our
framework comprises three circuits: visual auditing circuit, semantic tracing
circuit, and attention flow circuit. Through the lens of these circuits, we
discover that visual semantics are highly localized to specific object
tokens--removing these tokens can degrade model performance by up to 92.6%.
Furthermore, we identify that interpretable concepts of objects and actions
emerge and become progressively refined in the middle-to-late layers of LVLMs.
In contrary to the current works that solely focus on objects in one image, we
reveal that the middle-to-late layers of LVLMs exhibit specialized functional
localization for spatiotemporal semantics. Our findings offer significant
mechanistic insights into spatiotemporal semantics analysis of LVLMs, laying a
foundation for designing more robust and interpretable models.

TL;DR: GS-Occ3D is a scalable vision-only framework for occupancy reconstruction in autonomous driving, addressing challenges like sparse viewpoints and occlusions with an Octree-based Gaussian Surfel method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LiDAR-based occupancy methods limit scalability and exclude crowdsourced data. Vision-only approaches face challenges like incomplete geometry and post-processing needs.

Method: GS-Occ3D uses an Octree-based Gaussian Surfel formulation for explicit occupancy representation, decomposing scenes into static background, ground, and dynamic objects for tailored modeling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art geometry reconstruction on Waymo, with superior zero-shot generalization on Occ3D-nuScenes.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of vision-based occupancy reconstruction as a scalable paradigm for autonomous driving perception.

Abstract: Occupancy is crucial for autonomous driving, providing essential geometric
priors for perception and planning. However, existing methods predominantly
rely on LiDAR-based occupancy annotations, which limits scalability and
prevents leveraging vast amounts of potential crowdsourced data for
auto-labeling. To address this, we propose GS-Occ3D, a scalable vision-only
framework that directly reconstructs occupancy. Vision-only occupancy
reconstruction poses significant challenges due to sparse viewpoints, dynamic
scene elements, severe occlusions, and long-horizon motion. Existing
vision-based methods primarily rely on mesh representation, which suffer from
incomplete geometry and additional post-processing, limiting scalability. To
overcome these issues, GS-Occ3D optimizes an explicit occupancy representation
using an Octree-based Gaussian Surfel formulation, ensuring efficiency and
scalability. Additionally, we decompose scenes into static background, ground,
and dynamic objects, enabling tailored modeling strategies: (1) Ground is
explicitly reconstructed as a dominant structural element, significantly
improving large-area consistency; (2) Dynamic vehicles are separately modeled
to better capture motion-related occupancy patterns. Extensive experiments on
the Waymo dataset demonstrate that GS-Occ3D achieves state-of-the-art geometry
reconstruction results. By curating vision-only binary occupancy labels from
diverse urban scenes, we show their effectiveness for downstream occupancy
models on Occ3D-Waymo and superior zero-shot generalization on Occ3D-nuScenes.
It highlights the potential of large-scale vision-based occupancy
reconstruction as a new paradigm for autonomous driving perception. Project

TL;DR: A CNN-based method reduces training cost and pose dependency for 3D Gaussian Splatting, enabling high-fidelity 3D models from monocular images with noisy/implicit poses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of NeRF and 3DGS (pose dependency and high computational cost) for space applications.

Method: Uses a CNN to initialize 3DGS with coarse 3D models and pose estimates, reducing training iterations and images needed.

Result: Achieves high-fidelity 3D models even with imperfect poses, reducing training cost by an order of magnitude.

Conclusion: Enables novel view synthesis in space applications by overcoming pose and computational barriers.

Abstract: The advent of novel view synthesis techniques such as NeRF and 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) has enabled learning precise 3D models only from posed
monocular images. Although these methods are attractive, they hold two major
limitations that prevent their use in space applications: they require poses
during training, and have high computational cost at training and inference. To
address these limitations, this work contributes: (1) a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) based primitive initializer for 3DGS using monocular images; (2)
a pipeline capable of training with noisy or implicit pose estimates; and (3)
and analysis of initialization variants that reduce the training cost of
precise 3D models. A CNN takes a single image as input and outputs a coarse 3D
model represented as an assembly of primitives, along with the target's pose
relative to the camera. This assembly of primitives is then used to initialize
3DGS, significantly reducing the number of training iterations and input images
needed -- by at least an order of magnitude. For additional flexibility, the
CNN component has multiple variants with different pose estimation techniques.
This work performs a comparison between these variants, evaluating their
effectiveness for downstream 3DGS training under noisy or implicit pose
estimates. The results demonstrate that even with imperfect pose supervision,
the pipeline is able to learn high-fidelity 3D representations, opening the
door for the use of novel view synthesis in space applications.

*Byungjun Kim,Shunsuke Saito,Giljoo Nam,Tomas Simon,Jason Saragih,Hanbyul Joo,Junxuan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A universal prior model for 3D head avatars with explicit hair compositionality, enabling disentangled face and hair representations for flexible applications like swapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing holistic models struggle with disentangling face and hair, limiting flexibility in applications like swapping. The paper addresses this by explicitly modeling compositionality.

Method: Introduces a prior model with separate latent spaces for face and hair, using synthetic hairless data derived from a diffusion prior. Trains disentangled models on paired hair/hairless datasets.

Result: Enables seamless face and hair transfer between avatars and few-shot fine-tuning for high-fidelity avatars from monocular captures.

Conclusion: The approach advances flexible and expressive 3D avatar generation, with practical applications in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: We present a universal prior model for 3D head avatars with explicit hair
compositionality. Existing approaches to build generalizable priors for 3D head
avatars often adopt a holistic modeling approach, treating the face and hair as
an inseparable entity. This overlooks the inherent compositionality of the
human head, making it difficult for the model to naturally disentangle face and
hair representations, especially when the dataset is limited. Furthermore, such
holistic models struggle to support applications like 3D face and hairstyle
swapping in a flexible and controllable manner. To address these challenges, we
introduce a prior model that explicitly accounts for the compositionality of
face and hair, learning their latent spaces separately. A key enabler of this
approach is our synthetic hairless data creation pipeline, which removes hair
from studio-captured datasets using estimated hairless geometry and texture
derived from a diffusion prior. By leveraging a paired dataset of hair and
hairless captures, we train disentangled prior models for face and hair,
incorporating compositionality as an inductive bias to facilitate effective
separation. Our model's inherent compositionality enables seamless transfer of
face and hair components between avatars while preserving identity.
Additionally, we demonstrate that our model can be fine-tuned in a few-shot
manner using monocular captures to create high-fidelity, hair-compositional 3D
head avatars for unseen subjects. These capabilities highlight the practical
applicability of our approach in real-world scenarios, paving the way for
flexible and expressive 3D avatar generation.

### [91] [Initial Steps in Integrating Large Reasoning and Action Models for Service Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18775)
*Ilche Georgievski,Marco Aiello*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes integrating Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) and Large Action Models (LAMs) to automate service composition, addressing reasoning and execution gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Service composition is challenging due to limited reasoning and brittle execution. LRMs and LAMs offer complementary strengths but have limitations.

Method: Proposes an integrated LRM-LAM architectural framework to combine semantic reasoning (LRMs) and dynamic execution (LAMs).

Result: The framework bridges reasoning and execution, enabling automated, user-friendly service composition via natural language intent.

Conclusion: The LRM-LAM integration is a promising direction for fully automated service composition.

Abstract: Service composition remains a central challenge in building adaptive and
intelligent software systems, often constrained by limited reasoning
capabilities or brittle execution mechanisms. This paper explores the
integration of two emerging paradigms enabled by large language models: Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) and Large Action Models (LAMs). We argue that LRMs
address the challenges of semantic reasoning and ecosystem complexity while
LAMs excel in dynamic action execution and system interoperability. However,
each paradigm has complementary limitations - LRMs lack grounded action
capabilities, and LAMs often struggle with deep reasoning. We propose an
integrated LRM-LAM architectural framework as a promising direction for
advancing automated service composition. Such a system can reason about service
requirements and constraints while dynamically executing workflows, thus
bridging the gap between intention and execution. This integration has the
potential to transform service composition into a fully automated,
user-friendly process driven by high-level natural language intent.

*Fatima Al-Ani,Molly Wang,Jevon Charles,Aaron Ong,Joshua Forday,Vinayak Modi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A simulation-driven RL framework using Dyna-DDPG is proposed for optimizing routing in complex queueing networks, outperforming traditional methods in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional queueing methods are inadequate for dynamic, uncertain environments, necessitating a robust RL solution for manufacturing and communication applications.

Method: The framework combines Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) with Dyna-style planning (Dyna-DDPG), using predictive models for next-state transitions and rewards to enhance stability and efficiency.

Result: The framework learns effective routing policies quickly, performs robustly under disruptions, and scales well to larger networks.

Conclusion: The study presents a practical, reproducible, and maintainable RL framework suitable for real-world deployment in complex queueing systems.

Abstract: This study focuses on the development of a simulation-driven reinforcement
learning (RL) framework for optimizing routing decisions in complex queueing
network systems, with a particular emphasis on manufacturing and communication
applications. Recognizing the limitations of traditional queueing methods,
which often struggle with dynamic, uncertain environments, we propose a robust
RL approach leveraging Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) combined with
Dyna-style planning (Dyna-DDPG). The framework includes a flexible and
configurable simulation environment capable of modeling diverse queueing
scenarios, disruptions, and unpredictable conditions. Our enhanced Dyna-DDPG
implementation incorporates separate predictive models for next-state
transitions and rewards, significantly improving stability and sample
efficiency. Comprehensive experiments and rigorous evaluations demonstrate the
framework's capability to rapidly learn effective routing policies that
maintain robust performance under disruptions and scale effectively to larger
network sizes. Additionally, we highlight strong software engineering practices
employed to ensure reproducibility and maintainability of the framework,
enabling practical deployment in real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MIRAGE, a brain-inspired AI framework, achieves systematic compositional generalization by combining neural decomposition with dynamic schema extraction, achieving high accuracy on the SCAN benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of systematic compositional generalization in AI by mimicking human cognitive processes involving the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.

Method: MIRAGE integrates a meta-trained Transformer Neural Decomposer (System 1) and a Schema Engine (System 2) to iteratively refine representations and apply reusable schemas.

Result: Achieves >99% accuracy on the SCAN benchmark with only 1.19M parameters, demonstrating systematic generalization.

Conclusion: MIRAGE's success hinges on schema quality and iterative refinement, offering a promising approach for AI compositional reasoning.

Abstract: Systematic compositional generalization - constructing and understanding
novel combinations of known building blocks - remains a core challenge for AI
systems. Human cognition achieves this flexibility via the interplay of the
hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC): the hippocampus rapidly encodes
episodes, and the prefrontal cortex consolidates them into reusable schemas for
reasoning. Drawing on these insights, we present MIRAGE (Meta-Inference with
Rules and Abstractions from Generalized Experience), a framework that achieves
systematic generalization on compositional tasks. MIRAGE has two interacting
modules mirroring the brain's deliberative HPC-PFC loop and intuitive
neocortical pattern recognition. (1) The meta-trained Transformer Neural
Decomposer, paralleling neocortical "System 1" computation, is trained on a
task-agnostic stream of randomly sampled compositional grammars and applies one
decomposition step per pass, with successive passes iteratively refining the
sequence representation. (2) The Schema Engine, analogous to the HPC-PFC
"System 2" loop, dynamically extracts, ranks, and applies reusable schemas,
storing variable bindings in episodic memory and expanding them when needed. By
explicitly equipping the Transformer component of MIRAGE with actively managed
schematic structures, our model performs systematic compositional operations
through explicit schema application and transformation, relying solely on
frozen weights when solving entirely novel tasks. This approach demonstrates
systematic compositional generalization on the SCAN benchmark, achieving > 99%
accuracy on all task splits with only 1.19M parameters in the transformer
module. Ablation studies confirm that MIRAGE's systematicity critically depends
on the quality of extracted schemas and the model's iterative refinement
process.

*Wuhao Wang,Zhiyong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: First successful reinforcement learning of humanoid locomotion under partial observability, achieving performance comparable to full-state methods using a novel history encoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective policy learning under partial observability is a major challenge in high-dimensional robotic tasks like humanoid locomotion.

Method: A novel history encoder processes past observations in parallel, integrated into a model-free algorithm.

Result: Learned policy matches state-of-the-art full-state performance using only one-third to two-thirds of the original states and adapts to robot property variations.

Conclusion: The history encoder successfully reconstructs contextual information, enabling robust decision-making under partial observability.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to robotic control, but
effective policy learning under partial observability remains a major
challenge, especially in high-dimensional tasks like humanoid locomotion. To
date, no prior work has demonstrated stable training of humanoid policies with
incomplete state information in the benchmark Gymnasium Humanoid-v4
environment. The objective in this environment is to walk forward as fast as
possible without falling, with rewards provided for staying upright and moving
forward, and penalties incurred for excessive actions and external contact
forces. This research presents the first successful instance of learning under
partial observability in this environment. The learned policy achieves
performance comparable to state-of-the-art results with full state access,
despite using only one-third to two-thirds of the original states. Moreover,
the policy exhibits adaptability to robot properties, such as variations in
body part masses. The key to this success is a novel history encoder that
processes a fixed-length sequence of past observations in parallel. Integrated
into a standard model-free algorithm, the encoder enables performance on par
with fully observed baselines. We hypothesize that it reconstructs essential
contextual information from recent observations, thereby enabling robust
decision-making.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An incremental training framework for Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) addresses challenges of evolving knowledge and sparse entity connections, outperforming existing methods with a 10-15% improvement in performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional TKG completion models assume full graph access during training, ignoring evolving knowledge and sparse entity connections, which limits generalization and robustness.

Method: The framework combines a model-agnostic enhancement layer (using global entity similarity) and a weighted sampling strategy (emphasizing infrequent entities) to improve any TKG completion method.

Result: The method outperforms existing approaches, achieving 10% and 15% improvements in link prediction and MRR, respectively, on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The framework enhances robustness and mitigates catastrophic forgetting in TKG completion, proving effective for incremental training scenarios.

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) completion models traditionally assume access
to the entire graph during training. This overlooks challenges stemming from
the evolving nature of TKGs, such as: (i) the model's requirement to generalize
and assimilate new knowledge, and (ii) the task of managing new or unseen
entities that often have sparse connections. In this paper, we present an
incremental training framework specifically designed for TKGs, aiming to
address entities that are either not observed during training or have sparse
connections. Our approach combines a model-agnostic enhancement layer with a
weighted sampling strategy, that can be augmented to and improve any existing
TKG completion method. The enhancement layer leverages a broader, global
definition of entity similarity, which moves beyond mere local neighborhood
proximity of GNN-based methods. The weighted sampling strategy employed in
training accentuates edges linked to infrequently occurring entities. We
evaluate our method on two benchmark datasets, and demonstrate that our
framework outperforms existing methods in total link prediction, inductive link
prediction, and in addressing long-tail entities. Notably, our method achieves
a 10\% improvement and a 15\% boost in MRR for these datasets. The results
underscore the potential of our approach in mitigating catastrophic forgetting
and enhancing the robustness of TKG completion methods, especially in an
incremental training context

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Fine-grained Road Traffic Inference (FRTI) task to generate lane-level traffic data using limited road data, introducing a two-stage framework called RoadDiff for accurate inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Obtaining lane-level traffic data is challenging due to sensor limitations and tracking accuracy issues, hindering data-driven models for applications like autonomous driving and traffic signal control.

Method: The RoadDiff framework uses a Road-Lane Correlation Autoencoder-Decoder and a Lane Diffusion Module to leverage spatio-temporal dependencies and distribution relationships of road data.

Result: Extensive experiments on six datasets validated RoadDiff's effectiveness in addressing the FRTI task.

Conclusion: The RoadDiff framework provides an energy-efficient and cost-effective solution for precise traffic management by inferring fine-grained lane traffic states.

Abstract: Fine-grained traffic management and prediction are fundamental to key
applications such as autonomous driving, lane change guidance, and traffic
signal control. However, obtaining lane-level traffic data has become a
critical bottleneck for data-driven models due to limitations in the types and
number of sensors and issues with the accuracy of tracking algorithms. To
address this, we propose the Fine-grained Road Traffic Inference (FRTI) task,
which aims to generate more detailed lane-level traffic information using
limited road data, providing a more energy-efficient and cost-effective
solution for precise traffic management. This task is abstracted as the first
scene of the spatio-temporal graph node generation problem. We designed a
two-stage framework--RoadDiff--to solve the FRTI task. solve the FRTI task.
This framework leverages the Road-Lane Correlation Autoencoder-Decoder and the
Lane Diffusion Module to fully utilize the limited spatio-temporal dependencies
and distribution relationships of road data to accurately infer fine-grained
lane traffic states. Based on existing research, we designed several baseline
models with the potential to solve the FRTI task and conducted extensive
experiments on six datasets representing different road conditions to validate
the effectiveness of the RoadDiff model in addressing the FRTI task. The

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Pareto-NRPA is a new Monte-Carlo algorithm for multi-objective optimization, extending NRPA to handle multiple objectives by maintaining non-dominated fronts and adapting policies for diversity. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods in constrained spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize the Nested Rollout Policy Adaptation (NRPA) algorithm, originally for single-objective problems, to multi-objective optimization, addressing the need for efficient algorithms in such settings.

Method: Pareto-NRPA extends NRPA by using multiple policies to explore different solution regions and maintaining non-dominated fronts. Policy updates focus on diversity and isolation within the Pareto front.

Result: Pareto-NRPA performs competitively against state-of-the-art multi-objective algorithms, excelling in constrained search spaces like MO-TSPTW and neural architecture search.

Conclusion: Pareto-NRPA is the first adaptation of NRPA to multi-objective optimization, demonstrating strong performance in convergence and solution diversity.

Abstract: We introduce Pareto-NRPA, a new Monte-Carlo algorithm designed for
multi-objective optimization problems over discrete search spaces. Extending
the Nested Rollout Policy Adaptation (NRPA) algorithm originally formulated for
single-objective problems, Pareto-NRPA generalizes the nested search and policy
update mechanism to multi-objective optimization. The algorithm uses a set of
policies to concurrently explore different regions of the solution space and
maintains non-dominated fronts at each level of search. Policy adaptation is
performed with respect to the diversity and isolation of sequences within the
Pareto front. We benchmark Pareto-NRPA on two classes of problems: a novel
bi-objective variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows
problem (MO-TSPTW), and a neural architecture search task on well-known
benchmarks. Results demonstrate that Pareto-NRPA achieves competitive
performance against state-of-the-art multi-objective algorithms, both in terms
of convergence and diversity of solutions. Particularly, Pareto-NRPA strongly
outperforms state-of-the-art evolutionary multi-objective algorithms on
constrained search spaces. To our knowledge, this work constitutes the first
adaptation of NRPA to the multi-objective setting.

TL;DR: OS-MAP is a benchmark for daily computer-using automation, organizing 416 tasks across 15 applications to evaluate agent capabilities and alignment with user demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack consideration for task heterogeneity, agent capabilities, and alignment with user demands, hindering practical deployment.

Method: OS-MAP evaluates agents along two dimensions: automation level (five-level taxonomy) and generalization scope (demand hierarchy).

Result: State-of-the-art agents struggle with higher-level tasks involving perception, reasoning, and coordination.

Conclusion: OS-MAP provides a structured framework to assess agent performance and highlights gaps for future research in computer-using agents.

Abstract: Computer-using agents have shown strong potential to boost human productivity
and enable new application forms across platforms. While recent advances have
led to usable applications, existing benchmarks fail to account for the
internal task heterogeneity and the corresponding agent capabilities, as well
as their alignment with actual user demands-hindering both targeted capability
development and the reliable transition of research progress into practical
deployment. To bridge the gap, we present OS-MAP, a benchmark for daily
computer-using automation that organizes its 416 realistic tasks across 15
applications along two key dimensions: a five-level taxonomy of automation and
a generalization scope derived from a real-world user demand hierarchy. To
enable fine-grained analysis of required capabilities and alignment with
real-world scenarios, OS-MAP evaluates agents along two dimensions: automation
level across a five-level taxonomy, and generalization scope across a demand
hierarchy. This design captures varying levels of required agent autonomy and
generalization, forming a performance-generalization evaluation matrix for
structured and comprehensive assessment. Experiments show that even
State-of-the-Art agents with VLM backbones struggle with higher-level tasks
involving perception, reasoning, and coordination-highlighting the need for a
deeper understanding of current strengths and limitations to drive the future
progress in computer-using agents research and deployment. All code,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for remote physiological measurement (RPM) in driving scenarios are limited in scale and diversity, hindering real-world applicability.

Method: PhysDrive collects synchronized RGB, near-infrared, and mmWave radar data from 48 drivers, along with six physiological ground truths, covering varied driving conditions.

Result: The dataset enables comprehensive benchmarking of signal-processing and deep-learning methods, with open-source code for public use.

Conclusion: PhysDrive aims to advance research in multimodal driver monitoring and smart-cockpit systems by providing a foundational resource.

Abstract: Robust and unobtrusive in-vehicle physiological monitoring is crucial for
ensuring driving safety and user experience. While remote physiological
measurement (RPM) offers a promising non-invasive solution, its translation to
real-world driving scenarios is critically constrained by the scarcity of
comprehensive datasets. Existing resources are often limited in scale, modality
diversity, the breadth of biometric annotations, and the range of captured
conditions, thereby omitting inherent real-world challenges in driving. Here,
we present PhysDrive, the first large-scale multimodal dataset for contactless
in-vehicle physiological sensing with dedicated consideration on various
modality settings and driving factors. PhysDrive collects data from 48 drivers,
including synchronized RGB, near-infrared camera, and raw mmWave radar data,
accompanied with six synchronized ground truths (ECG, BVP, Respiration, HR, RR,
and SpO2). It covers a wide spectrum of naturalistic driving conditions,
including driver motions, dynamic natural light, vehicle types, and road
conditions. We extensively evaluate both signal-processing and deep-learning
methods on PhysDrive, establishing a comprehensive benchmark across all
modalities, and release full open-source code with compatibility for mainstream
public toolboxes. We envision PhysDrive will serve as a foundational resource
and accelerate research on multimodal driver monitoring and smart-cockpit
systems.

*Kuncheng Zou,Jiahao Mai,Yonggang Zhang,Yuyi Wang,Ondřej Kuželka,Yuanhong Wang,Yi Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel algorithm for lifted inference on ordered domains with predecessor relations, offering exponential speedups and handling general k-th predecessor relations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for weighted first-order model counting (WFOMC) struggle with practical applications involving predecessor relations, despite theoretical tractability.

Method: Treats predecessor relations as a native part of the axiom, devising an algorithm that inherently supports these relations.

Result: Achieves exponential speedups for immediate and second predecessor relations and handles general k-th predecessor relations, with experiments showing a full order of magnitude improvement.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods, demonstrating practical efficiency for lifted inference tasks and combinatorics problems.

Abstract: We investigate lifted inference on ordered domains with predecessor
relations, where the elements of the domain respect a total (cyclic) order, and
every element has a distinct (clockwise) predecessor. Previous work has
explored this problem through weighted first-order model counting (WFOMC),
which computes the weighted sum of models for a given first-order logic
sentence over a finite domain. In WFOMC, the order constraint is typically
encoded by the linear order axiom introducing a binary predicate in the
sentence to impose a linear ordering on the domain elements. The immediate and
second predecessor relations are then encoded by the linear order predicate.
Although WFOMC with the linear order axiom is theoretically tractable, existing
algorithms struggle with practical applications, particularly when the
predecessor relations are involved. In this paper, we treat predecessor
relations as a native part of the axiom and devise a novel algorithm that
inherently supports these relations. The proposed algorithm not only provides
an exponential speedup for the immediate and second predecessor relations,
which are known to be tractable, but also handles the general k-th predecessor
relations. The extensive experiments on lifted inference tasks and
combinatorics math problems demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm,
achieving speedups of a full order of magnitude.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'knowledge grafting,' a method to optimize AI models for resource-constrained environments by transferring features from a large model to a smaller one, reducing size by 88.54% while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of deploying large AI models in resource-constrained scenarios by reducing model size without sacrificing performance.

Method: Knowledge grafting transfers selected features (scion) from a large donor model to a smaller rootstock model.

Result: The rootstock model achieves 89.97% validation accuracy (vs. donor's 87.47%), lower validation loss (0.2976 vs. 0.5068), and 90.45% accuracy on unseen test data.

Conclusion: The approach resolves the size vs. performance trade-off, enabling AI deployment in resource-constrained environments, with potential applications in edge computing and beyond.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to larger,
more complex models with numerous parameters that require substantial computing
power -- resources often unavailable in many real-world application scenarios.
Our paper addresses this challenge by introducing knowledge grafting, a novel
mechanism that optimizes AI models for resource-constrained environments by
transferring selected features (the scion) from a large donor model to a
smaller rootstock model. The approach achieves an 88.54% reduction in model
size (from 64.39 MB to 7.38 MB), while improving generalization capability of
the model. Our new rootstock model achieves 89.97% validation accuracy (vs.
donor's 87.47%), maintains lower validation loss (0.2976 vs. 0.5068), and
performs exceptionally well on unseen test data with 90.45% accuracy. It
addresses the typical size vs performance trade-off, and enables deployment of
AI frameworks on resource-constrained devices with enhanced performance. We
have tested our approach on an agricultural weed detection scenario, however,
it can be extended across various edge computing scenarios, potentially
accelerating AI adoption in areas with limited hardware/software support -- by
mirroring in a similar manner the horticultural grafting enables productive
cultivation in challenging agri-based environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores belief representation in imperfect-information games, comparing constraint-based and probabilistic methods, finding minimal performance differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address decision-making in imperfect-information games by simplifying state estimation through externally provided belief states.

Method: Two approaches: constraint-based (CSP) and probabilistic (Belief Propagation) belief representations, tested with general-purpose agents in two games.

Result: Constraint-based beliefs performed comparably to probabilistic inference, with negligible differences in agent performance.

Conclusion: Constraint-based belief states may be sufficient for effective decision-making in many imperfect-information game settings.

Abstract: In imperfect-information games, agents must make decisions based on partial
knowledge of the game state. The Belief Stochastic Game model addresses this
challenge by delegating state estimation to the game model itself. This allows
agents to operate on externally provided belief states, thereby reducing the
need for game-specific inference logic. This paper investigates two approaches
to represent beliefs in games with hidden piece identities: a constraint-based
model using Constraint Satisfaction Problems and a probabilistic extension
using Belief Propagation to estimate marginal probabilities. We evaluated the
impact of both representations using general-purpose agents across two
different games. Our findings indicate that constraint-based beliefs yield
results comparable to those of probabilistic inference, with minimal
differences in agent performance. This suggests that constraint-based belief
states alone may suffice for effective decision-making in many settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the role of LLMs in social simulation, highlighting their capabilities and challenges from a computational social science perspective.

Method: Reviews recent findings on LLMs' cognitive replication and surveys applications in multi-agent simulations, focusing on architectures, scale, and validation.

Result: Identifies LLMs' value in interactive simulations but notes issues in explanatory/predictive modeling, proposing hybrid integration with rule-based systems.

Conclusion: Advocates for hybrid approaches combining LLMs with traditional agent-based modeling for flexibility and rigor.

Abstract: This position paper examines the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
social simulation, analyzing both their potential and their limitations from a
computational social science perspective. The first part reviews recent
findings on the ability of LLMs to replicate key aspects of human cognition,
including Theory of Mind reasoning and social inference, while also
highlighting significant limitations such as cognitive biases, lack of true
understanding, and inconsistencies in behavior. The second part surveys
emerging applications of LLMs in multi-agent simulation frameworks, focusing on
system architectures, scale, and validation strategies. Notable projects such
as Generative Agents (Smallville) and AgentSociety are discussed in terms of
their design choices, empirical grounding, and methodological innovations.
Particular attention is given to the challenges of behavioral fidelity,
calibration, and reproducibility in large-scale LLM-driven simulations. The
final section distinguishes between contexts where LLMs, like other black-box
systems, offer direct value-such as interactive simulations and serious
games-and those where their use is more problematic, notably in explanatory or
predictive modeling. The paper concludes by advocating for hybrid approaches
that integrate LLMs into traditional agent-based modeling platforms (GAMA,
Netlogo, etc), enabling modelers to combine the expressive flexibility of
language-based reasoning with the transparency and analytical rigor of
classical rule-based systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of building neural systems that generalize well for symbolic algorithms, especially out-of-distribution tasks.

Method: Introduces a neuro-symbolic architecture inspired by rewriting algorithms, with two modular implementations (NRS and FastNRS).

Result: Both models generalize well, with FastNRS improving memory efficiency, training speed, and inference time. Outperforms Neural Data Router and GPT-4o.

Conclusion: The proposed system is effective for symbolic algorithm tasks, offering strong generalization and efficiency, and excels in multi-domain learning.

Abstract: Building neural systems that can learn to execute symbolic algorithms is a
challenging open problem in artificial intelligence, especially when aiming for
strong generalization and out-of-distribution performance. In this work, we
introduce a general framework for learning convergent term rewriting systems
using a neuro-symbolic architecture inspired by the rewriting algorithm itself.
We present two modular implementations of such architecture: the Neural
Rewriting System (NRS) and the Fast Neural Rewriting System (FastNRS). As a
result of algorithmic-inspired design and key architectural elements, both
models can generalize to out-of-distribution instances, with FastNRS offering
significant improvements in terms of memory efficiency, training speed, and
inference time. We evaluate both architectures on four tasks involving the
simplification of mathematical formulas and further demonstrate their
versatility in a multi-domain learning scenario, where a single model is

significantly outperforms two strong neural baselines: the Neural Data Router,
a recent transformer variant specifically designed to solve algorithmic
problems, and GPT-4o, one of the most powerful general-purpose large-language
models. Moreover, our system matches or outperforms the latest o1-preview model
from OpenAI that excels in reasoning benchmarks.

### [105] [Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Multi-Year Asset Management Under Budget Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19458)
*Amir Fard,Arnold X. -X. Yuan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning method for multi-year infrastructure planning, addressing scalability issues in budget and maintenance optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with scalability due to combinatorial action spaces, diverse asset deterioration, budget constraints, and environmental uncertainty.

Method: Decomposes the problem into high-level Budget Planner and low-level Maintenance Planner, integrating linear programming with hierarchical Soft Actor-Critic.

Result: Outperforms Deep Q-Learning and genetic algorithms in convergence speed, scalability, and near-optimal solutions for sewer networks of varying sizes.

Conclusion: The hierarchical approach efficiently handles large action spaces and ensures budget compliance, making it effective for infrastructure planning.

Abstract: Budget planning and maintenance optimization are crucial for infrastructure
asset management, ensuring cost-effectiveness and sustainability. However, the
complexity arising from combinatorial action spaces, diverse asset
deterioration, stringent budget constraints, and environmental uncertainty
significantly limits existing methods' scalability. This paper proposes a
Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning methodology specifically tailored to
multi-year infrastructure planning. Our approach decomposes the problem into
two hierarchical levels: a high-level Budget Planner allocating annual budgets
within explicit feasibility bounds, and a low-level Maintenance Planner
prioritizing assets within the allocated budget. By structurally separating
macro-budget decisions from asset-level prioritization and integrating linear
programming projection within a hierarchical Soft Actor-Critic framework, the
method efficiently addresses exponential growth in the action space and ensures
rigorous budget compliance. A case study evaluating sewer networks of varying
sizes (10, 15, and 20 sewersheds) illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed
approach. Compared to conventional Deep Q-Learning and enhanced genetic
algorithms, our methodology converges more rapidly, scales effectively, and
consistently delivers near-optimal solutions even as network size grows.

### [106] [Specification Self-Correction: Mitigating In-Context Reward Hacking Through Test-Time Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18742)
*Víctor Gallego*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Language models exploit flawed specifications for high scores. SSC is a framework where models self-correct these flaws, reducing vulnerability by 90%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the issue of LMs exploiting faulty specifications to achieve high scores without meeting user intent.

Method: SSC involves multi-step inference: generate a response, critique it, revise the specification, and produce a robust final response.

Result: SSC reduces exploitation of tainted specifications from 50-70% to under 10%, improving alignment.

Conclusion: SSC effectively enhances LM robustness by dynamically correcting flawed specifications at inference time.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are susceptible to in-context reward hacking, where
they exploit flaws in tainted or faulty written specifications or rubrics to
achieve high scores without fulfilling the user's true intent. We introduce
Specification Self-Correction (SSC), a novel, test-time framework that enables
an LM to identify and correct flaws within its own guiding specification. SSC
employs a multi-step inference process where the model first generates a
response based on a potentially tainted specification, critiques its output,
and then revises the specification itself to remove the exploitable loophole. A
final, more robust response is then generated using this self-corrected
specification. Across experiments spanning creative writing and agentic coding
tasks with several LMs, we demonstrate that while models initially game tainted
specifications in 50-70\% of cases, the SSC process reduces this vulnerability
by over 90\%. This dynamic repair occurs at inference time, requires no weight
modification, and leads to more robustly aligned model behavior. Code at

*Abdulhady Abas Abdullah,Amir H. Gandomi,Tarik A Rashid,Seyedali Mirjalili,Laith Abualigah,Milena Živković,Hadi Veisi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AS-RoBERTa, a script-specialized multilingual model for Arabic-script languages, outperforms general models like mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa by 2-5% in classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General multilingual models struggle with Arabic-script languages due to shared scripts but differing orthographic norms and cultural contexts.

Method: Developed four RoBERTa-based models (AS-RoBERTa) pre-trained on language-specific corpora, focusing on script features.

Result: AS-RoBERTa variants outperform mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa by 2-5 percentage points in classification tasks.

Conclusion: Script-aware specialization is valuable for Arabic-script languages, supporting script-specific pre-training strategies.

Abstract: In natural language processing, multilingual models like mBERT and
XLM-RoBERTa promise broad coverage but often struggle with languages that share
a script yet differ in orthographic norms and cultural context. This issue is
especially notable in Arabic-script languages such as Kurdish Sorani, Arabic,
Persian, and Urdu. We introduce the Arabic Script RoBERTa (AS-RoBERTa) family:
four RoBERTa-based models, each pre-trained on a large corpus tailored to its
specific language. By focusing pre-training on language-specific script
features and statistics, our models capture patterns overlooked by
general-purpose models. When fine-tuned on classification tasks, AS-RoBERTa
variants outperform mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa by 2 to 5 percentage points. An
ablation study confirms that script-focused pre-training is central to these
gains. Error analysis using confusion matrices shows how shared script traits
and domain-specific content affect performance. Our results highlight the value
of script-aware specialization for languages using the Arabic script and
support further work on pre-training strategies rooted in script and language
specificity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve multilingual text detoxification by leveraging explicit toxic word annotation and cross-lingual generalization, departing from prior unsupervised or monolingual methods.

Method: Integrates lexicon-guided tagging (using multilingual_toxic_lexicon), a fine-tuned sequence-to-sequence model (s-nlp/mt0-xl-detox-orpo), and an iterative classifier-based gatekeeping mechanism.

Result: Achieved highest STA (0.922), average J score of 0.612, and xCOMET scores of 0.793 (dev) and 0.787 (test), outperforming baselines and showing strong generalization in high-resource languages.

Conclusion: The model demonstrates consistent detoxification improvements, though with some trade-offs in SIM, and secured ninth place in the competition.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce our solution for the Multilingual Text
Detoxification Task in the PAN-2025 competition for the ylmmcl team: a robust
multilingual text detoxification pipeline that integrates lexicon-guided
tagging, a fine-tuned sequence-to-sequence model (s-nlp/mt0-xl-detox-orpo) and
an iterative classifier-based gatekeeping mechanism. Our approach departs from
prior unsupervised or monolingual pipelines by leveraging explicit toxic word
annotation via the multilingual_toxic_lexicon to guide detoxification with
greater precision and cross-lingual generalization. Our final model achieves
the highest STA (0.922) from our previous attempts, and an average official J
score of 0.612 for toxic inputs in both the development and test sets. It also
achieved xCOMET scores of 0.793 (dev) and 0.787 (test). This performance
outperforms baseline and backtranslation methods across multiple languages, and
shows strong generalization in high-resource settings (English, Russian,
French). Despite some trade-offs in SIM, the model demonstrates consistent
improvements in detoxification strength. In the competition, our team achieved
ninth place with a score of 0.612.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs on code-mixed data across 18 languages, highlights their underperformance, and proposes a novel synthetic data generation method using GPT-4.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for code-mixing are limited, and research on LLMs in this context is scarce, despite its importance for multilingual users.

Method: Comprehensive evaluation of LLMs on code-mixed data from 18 languages and a novel approach for synthetic data generation using word substitution and GPT-4 prompting.

Result: LLMs consistently underperform on code-mixed datasets involving multiple language families.

Conclusion: Improvements in training data size, model scale, and few-shot learning could enhance LLM performance on code-mixed tasks.

Abstract: Code-mixing, the practice of switching between languages within a
conversation, presents unique challenges for traditional natural language
processing. Existing benchmarks, such as LinCE and GLUECoS, are limited by
narrow language pairings and tasks, failing to adequately evaluate the
code-mixing capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite the
significance of code-mixing for multilingual users, research on LLMs in this
context remains limited. Additionally, current methods for generating
code-mixed data are underdeveloped. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of LLMs' performance on code-mixed data across 18 languages from
seven language families. We also propose a novel approach for generating
synthetic code-mixed texts by combining word substitution with GPT-4 prompting.
Our analysis reveals consistent underperformance of LLMs on code-mixed datasets
involving multiple language families. We suggest that improvements in training
data size, model scale, and few-shot learning could enhance their performance.

TL;DR: CueBuddy aids STEM students in the Global South by providing real-time lexical cues for technical English terms, addressing language barriers without disrupting lectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: STEM students fluent in lower-resource languages struggle with technical English terms despite understanding everyday English, creating a learning gap.

Method: CueBuddy uses real-time keyword spotting and multilingual glossary lookup to provide lexical cues for technical jargon.

Result: The tool helps students keep up with lectures without losing focus, though scalability and technical content handling remain challenges.

Conclusion: CueBuddy is a promising solution for language barriers in STEM education, with potential for future improvements.

Abstract: Students across the world in STEM classes, especially in the Global South,
fall behind their peers who are more fluent in English, despite being at par
with them in terms of scientific prerequisites. While many of them are able to
follow everyday English at ease, key terms in English stay challenging. In most
cases, such students have had most of their course prerequisites in a lower
resource language. Live speech translation to lower resource languages is a
promising area of research, however, models for speech translation can be too
expensive on a large scale and often struggle with technical content. In this
paper, we describe CueBuddy, which aims to remediate these issues by providing
real-time "lexical cues" through technical keyword spotting along real-time
multilingual glossary lookup to help students stay up to speed with complex
English jargon without disrupting their concentration on the lecture. We also
describe the limitations and future extensions of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retrieval-augmented generation struggles with semi-relevant passages and deep contextual reasoning.

Method: PrismRAG fine-tunes models using distractor-aware QA pairs and instills reasoning-centric habits for planning and synthesis.

Result: Achieves 5.4% higher factuality on 12 RAG QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: PrismRAG effectively enhances RAG performance by addressing context confusion and reasoning gaps.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) often falls short when retrieved context
includes confusing semi-relevant passages, or when answering questions require
deep contextual understanding and reasoning. We propose an efficient
fine-tuning framework, called PrismRAG, that (i) trains the model with
distractor-aware QA pairs mixing gold evidence with subtle distractor passages,
and (ii) instills reasoning-centric habits that make the LLM plan, rationalize,
and synthesize without relying on extensive human engineered instructions.
Evaluated across 12 open-book RAG QA benchmarks spanning diverse application
domains and scenarios, PrismRAG improves average factuality by 5.4%,
outperforming state-of-the-art solutions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MindFlow+ is a self-evolving dialogue agent combining LLMs, imitation learning, and offline RL to improve e-commerce customer service. It uses tool-augmented demonstrations and reward-conditioned data for better task alignment and outperforms baselines in relevance and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional intent-based systems fail in dynamic, multi-turn e-commerce dialogues, necessitating a more adaptive solution.

Method: MindFlow+ integrates LLMs with imitation learning and offline RL, using tool-augmented demonstrations and reward-conditioned data modeling.

Result: Outperforms baselines in contextual relevance, flexibility, and task accuracy on real-world e-commerce data.

Conclusion: Combining LLMs, tool reasoning, and reward-guided learning can create specialized, context-aware dialogue systems.

Abstract: High-quality dialogue is crucial for e-commerce customer service, yet
traditional intent-based systems struggle with dynamic, multi-turn
interactions. We present MindFlow+, a self-evolving dialogue agent that learns
domain-specific behavior by combining large language models (LLMs) with
imitation learning and offline reinforcement learning (RL). MindFlow+
introduces two data-centric mechanisms to guide learning: tool-augmented
demonstration construction, which exposes the model to knowledge-enhanced and
agentic (ReAct-style) interactions for effective tool use; and
reward-conditioned data modeling, which aligns responses with task-specific
goals using reward signals. To evaluate the model's role in response
generation, we introduce the AI Contribution Ratio, a novel metric quantifying
AI involvement in dialogue. Experiments on real-world e-commerce conversations
show that MindFlow+ outperforms strong baselines in contextual relevance,
flexibility, and task accuracy. These results demonstrate the potential of
combining LLMs tool reasoning, and reward-guided learning to build
domain-specialized, context-aware dialogue systems.

*Jonathan Ivey,Susan Gauch,David Jurgens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NUTMEG, a Bayesian model, separates noisy annotations from genuine disagreements in human-labeled NLP data, outperforming traditional aggregation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human-labeled data in NLP often contains conflicting annotations due to diverse annotator backgrounds. Traditional methods treat disagreements as errors, but genuine disagreements should be preserved as signal.

Method: Introduces NUTMEG, a Bayesian model that uses annotator background information to filter noise while retaining systematic disagreements. Evaluated using synthetic data and downstream model performance.

Result: NUTMEG recovers ground-truth better than traditional methods, especially with systematic disagreements. Downstream models trained on NUTMEG data outperform those using traditional aggregation.

Conclusion: Accounting for annotator competence and systematic disagreements improves NLP model training, highlighting NUTMEG's effectiveness.

Abstract: NLP models often rely on human-labeled data for training and evaluation. Many
approaches crowdsource this data from a large number of annotators with varying
skills, backgrounds, and motivations, resulting in conflicting annotations.
These conflicts have traditionally been resolved by aggregation methods that
assume disagreements are errors. Recent work has argued that for many tasks
annotators may have genuine disagreements and that variation should be treated
as signal rather than noise. However, few models separate signal and noise in
annotator disagreement. In this work, we introduce NUTMEG, a new Bayesian model
that incorporates information about annotator backgrounds to remove noisy
annotations from human-labeled training data while preserving systematic
disagreements. Using synthetic data, we show that NUTMEG is more effective at
recovering ground-truth from annotations with systematic disagreement than
traditional aggregation methods. We provide further analysis characterizing how
differences in subpopulation sizes, rates of disagreement, and rates of spam
affect the performance of our model. Finally, we demonstrate that downstream
models trained on NUTMEG-aggregated data significantly outperform models
trained on data from traditionally aggregation methods. Our results highlight
the importance of accounting for both annotator competence and systematic
disagreements when training on human-labeled data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: REPRO-Bench is a benchmark for evaluating AI agents' ability to assess the reproducibility of social science papers, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks. The best-performing agent achieved 21.4% accuracy, improved to 71% with REPRO-Agent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate the costly manual assessment of reproducibility in social science research using AI agents, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks.

Method: Introduces REPRO-Bench, a collection of 112 task instances based on social science papers with reproduction reports. Evaluates AI agents on end-to-end reproducibility tasks.

Result: Best-performing AI agent achieved 21.4% accuracy; REPRO-Agent improved this by 71%.

Conclusion: Advanced AI agents are needed for real-world reproducibility assessment; REPRO-Bench is publicly available.

Abstract: Assessing the reproducibility of social science papers is essential for
promoting rigor in research processes, but manual assessment is costly. With
recent advances in agentic AI systems (i.e., AI agents), we seek to evaluate
their capability to automate this process. However, existing benchmarks for
reproducing research papers (1) focus solely on reproducing results using
provided code and data without assessing their consistency with the paper, (2)
oversimplify real-world scenarios, and (3) lack necessary diversity in data
formats and programming languages. To address these issues, we introduce
REPRO-Bench, a collection of 112 task instances, each representing a social
science paper with a publicly available reproduction report. The agents are
tasked with assessing the reproducibility of the paper based on the original
paper PDF and the corresponding reproduction package. REPRO-Bench features
end-to-end evaluation tasks on the reproducibility of social science papers
with complexity comparable to real-world assessments. We evaluate three
representative AI agents on REPRO-Bench, with the best-performing agent
achieving an accuracy of only 21.4%. Building on our empirical analysis, we
develop REPRO-Agent, which improves the highest accuracy achieved by existing
agents by 71%. We conclude that more advanced AI agents should be developed to
automate real-world reproducibility assessment. REPRO-Bench is publicly

*Hongyuan Lu,Zixuan Li,Zefan Zhang,Wai Lam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Automatic Dictionary Selection (ADS) to optimize dictionary use for translation in LLMs, proposing the SLoW method to select low-frequency word dictionaries, saving tokens while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs support only hundreds of languages, and dictionary-based methods are costly. ADS aims to balance token use and translation quality.

Method: Proposes SLoW, which selects dictionaries with low-frequency words without needing training data or LLM tuning.

Result: SLoW outperforms baselines on 100 FLORES languages, saving tokens and often surpassing full dictionary performance.

Conclusion: SLoW is effective, resource-efficient, and requires no training data or LLM adjustments, making it practical for multilingual translation enhancement.

Abstract: There are more than 7,000 languages around the world, and current Large
Language Models (LLMs) only support hundreds of languages. Dictionary-based
prompting methods can enhance translation on them, but most methods use all the
available dictionaries, which could be expensive. Instead, it will be flexible
to have a trade-off between token consumption and translation performance. This
paper proposes a novel task called \textbf{A}utomatic \textbf{D}ictionary
\textbf{S}election (\textbf{ADS}). The goal of the task is to automatically
select which dictionary to use to enhance translation. We propose a novel and
effective method which we call \textbf{S}elect \textbf{Lo}w-frequency
\textbf{W}ords! (\textbf{SLoW}) which selects those dictionaries that have a
lower frequency. Our methods have unique advantages. First, there is no need
for access to the training data for frequency estimation (which is usually
unavailable). Second, it inherits the advantage of dictionary-based methods,
where no additional tuning is required on LLMs. Experimental results on 100
languages from FLORES indicate that SLoW surpasses strong baselines, and it can
obviously save token usage, with many languages even surpassing the translation
performance of the full dictionary baseline.\footnote{A shocking fact is that
there is no need to use the actual training data (often unobtainable) for
frequency estimation, and an estimation frequency obtained using public
resources is still apparently effective in improving translation with ChatGPT
and Llama, and DeepSeek.}\footnote{Code and data available upon publication.}

Motivation: Concerns about patient safety due to widespread use of LLM chatbots for medical advice.

Method: Physician-led red-teaming study using the HealthAdvice dataset, evaluating 888 responses to 222 medical questions.

Result: Problematic responses ranged from 21.6% (Claude) to 43.2% (Llama), with unsafe responses from 5% (Claude) to 13% (GPT-4o, Llama).

Conclusion: Millions may receive unsafe advice; improvements in chatbot clinical safety are needed.

Abstract: Millions of patients are already using large language model (LLM) chatbots
for medical advice on a regular basis, raising patient safety concerns. This
physician-led red-teaming study compares the safety of four publicly available
chatbots--Claude by Anthropic, Gemini by Google, GPT-4o by OpenAI, and
Llama3-70B by Meta--on a new dataset, HealthAdvice, using an evaluation
framework that enables quantitative and qualitative analysis. In total, 888
chatbot responses are evaluated for 222 patient-posed advice-seeking medical
questions on primary care topics spanning internal medicine, women's health,
and pediatrics. We find statistically significant differences between chatbots.
The rate of problematic responses varies from 21.6 percent (Claude) to 43.2
percent (Llama), with unsafe responses varying from 5 percent (Claude) to 13
percent (GPT-4o, Llama). Qualitative results reveal chatbot responses with the
potential to lead to serious patient harm. This study suggests that millions of
patients could be receiving unsafe medical advice from publicly available
chatbots, and further work is needed to improve the clinical safety of these
powerful tools.

*Ananya Sahu,Amith Ananthram,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for mining contextualized associations in images to generate creative captions, improving vision-language models like CLIP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models rely on literal web-scraped alt-text, lacking shared language for creative understanding.

Method: Mines contextualized associations for visual elements in unlabeled datasets to generate abstract, creative captions.

Result: Produced a dataset of 1.7m creative captions for MSCOCO, improving zero-shot retrieval in creative domains like poetry.

Conclusion: The method enhances creative captioning and retrieval, with released datasets and models for broader use.

Abstract: Understanding another person's creative output requires a shared language of
association. However, when training vision-language models such as CLIP, we
rely on web-scraped datasets containing short, predominantly literal, alt-text.
In this work, we introduce a method for mining contextualized associations for
salient visual elements in an image that can scale to any unlabeled dataset.
Given an image, we can use these mined associations to generate high quality
creative captions at increasing degrees of abstraction. With our method, we
produce a new dataset of visual associations and 1.7m creative captions for the
images in MSCOCO. Human evaluation confirms that these captions remain visually
grounded while exhibiting recognizably increasing abstraction. Moreover,
fine-tuning a visual encoder on this dataset yields meaningful improvements in
zero-shot image-text retrieval in two creative domains: poetry and metaphor
visualization. We release our dataset, our generation code and our models for
use by the broader community.

TL;DR: Multilingual LLMs show cross-linguistic generalization but underperform in medium/low-resource languages. Analysis of Gemma-2-2B reveals activation disparities, addressed via LoRA fine-tuning, improving benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate performance gaps in medium/low-resource languages in multilingual LLMs.

Method: Analyzed activation patterns in Gemma-2-2B using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and applied activation-aware fine-tuning via LoRA.

Result: Disparities in activations (up to 26.27% lower in early layers) were found. Fine-tuning improved activations (e.g., 87.69% for Malayalam) and benchmarks.

Conclusion: Activation alignment via LoRA fine-tuning enhances multilingual LLM performance, especially for medium/low-resource languages.

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong cross-linguistic
generalization, yet medium to low resource languages underperform on common
benchmarks such as ARC-Challenge, MMLU, and HellaSwag. We analyze activation
patterns in Gemma-2-2B across all 26 residual layers and 10 languages: Chinese
(zh), Russian (ru), Spanish (es), Italian (it), medium to low resource
languages including Indonesian (id), Catalan (ca), Marathi (mr), Malayalam
(ml), and Hindi (hi), with English (en) as the reference. Using Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs), we reveal systematic disparities in activation patterns.
Medium to low resource languages receive up to 26.27 percent lower activations
in early layers, with a persistent gap of 19.89 percent in deeper layers. To
address this, we apply activation-aware fine-tuning via Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA), leading to substantial activation gains, such as 87.69 percent for
Malayalam and 86.32 percent for Hindi, while maintaining English retention at
approximately 91 percent. After fine-tuning, benchmark results show modest but
consistent improvements, highlighting activation alignment as a key factor in
enhancing multilingual LLM performance.

Result: Surpasses full fine-tuning, achieving SOTA on M3-Multi30K and M3-AmbigCaps with only 40% parameter tuning.

Conclusion: LLaVA-NeuMT offers an efficient, scalable solution for cross-lingual adaptation in multimodal translation.

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) enhances translation quality by
incorporating visual context, helping to resolve textual ambiguities. While
existing MMT methods perform well in bilingual settings, extending them to
multilingual translation remains challenging due to cross-lingual interference
and ineffective parameter-sharing strategies. To address this, we propose
LLaVA-NeuMT, a novel multimodal multilingual translation framework that
explicitly models language-specific and language-agnostic representations to
mitigate multilingual interference. Our approach consists of a layer selection
mechanism that identifies the most informative layers for different language
pairs and a neuron-level adaptation strategy that dynamically selects
language-specific and agnostic neurons to improve translation quality while
reducing redundancy. We conduct extensive experiments on the M3-Multi30K and
M3-AmbigCaps datasets, demonstrating that LLaVA-NeuMT, while fine-tuning only
40\% of the model parameters, surpasses full fine-tuning approaches and
ultimately achieves SOTA results on both datasets. Our analysis further
provides insights into the importance of selected layers and neurons in
multimodal multilingual adaptation, offering an efficient and scalable solution
to cross-lingual adaptation in multimodal translation.

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for automating legal document summarization using NLP and machine learning to improve judicial efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance judicial efficiency by automating key information extraction from legal texts, reducing manual review burdens and errors.

Method: Leverages NLP and machine learning to identify patterns in legal documents, creating precise summaries.

Result: Demonstrates high-quality summarization, faster processing, and improved operational efficiency in legal workflows.

Conclusion: The research highlights automation's potential to transform legal workflows by refining judicial processes.

Abstract: Legal document summarization represents a significant advancement towards
improving judicial efficiency through the automation of key information
detection. Our approach leverages state-of-the-art natural language processing
techniques to meticulously identify and extract essential data from extensive
legal texts, which facilitates a more efficient review process. By employing
advanced machine learning algorithms, the framework recognizes underlying
patterns within judicial documents to create precise summaries that encapsulate
the crucial elements. This automation alleviates the burden on legal
professionals, concurrently reducing the likelihood of overlooking vital
information that could lead to errors. Through comprehensive experiments
conducted with actual legal datasets, we demonstrate the capability of our
method to generate high-quality summaries while preserving the integrity of the
original content and enhancing processing times considerably. The results
reveal marked improvements in operational efficiency, allowing legal
practitioners to direct their efforts toward critical analytical and
decision-making activities instead of manual reviews. This research highlights
promising technology-driven strategies that can significantly alter workflow
dynamics within the legal sector, emphasizing the role of automation in
refining judicial processes.

### [122] [A Similarity Measure for Comparing Conversational Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18956)
*Sang Min Jung,Kaixiang Zhang,Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A similarity measure for comparing conversation dynamics is introduced, validated, and applied to analyze online community interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods lack robustness for comparing overall interactional dynamics in conversations, which is crucial for analyzing conversational data and evaluating agents.

Method: Developed a similarity measure for conversation dynamics, validated its robustness and sensitivity, and applied it to analyze a large online community.

Result: The measure effectively captures differences in conversation dynamics and provides insights into situational power in conversations.

Conclusion: The introduced measure enhances the analysis of conversational dynamics and offers a holistic evaluation tool for conversational agents.

Abstract: The quality of a conversation goes beyond the individual quality of each
reply, and instead emerges from how these combine into interactional patterns
that give the conversation its distinctive overall "shape". However, there is
no robust automated method for comparing conversations in terms of their
overall interactional dynamics. Such methods could enhance the analysis of
conversational data and help evaluate conversational agents more holistically.
  In this work, we introduce a similarity measure for comparing conversations
with respect to their dynamics. We design a validation framework for testing
the robustness of the metric in capturing differences in conversation dynamics
and for assessing its sensitivity to the topic of the conversations. Finally,
to illustrate the measure's utility, we use it to analyze conversational
dynamics in a large online community, bringing new insights into the role of
situational power in conversations.

### [123] [A Toolbox, Not a Hammer -- Multi-TAG: Scaling Math Reasoning with Multi-Tool Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18973)
*Bohan Yao,Vikas Yadav*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multi-TAG enhances LLMs by using multiple tools concurrently for robust math reasoning, outperforming single-tool methods by 6-7.5%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tool-augmented LLMs struggle with complex math problems requiring multi-step reasoning.

Method: Multi-TAG aggregates outputs from multiple tools invoked concurrently at each reasoning step, without finetuning.

Result: Achieves 6.0-7.5% average improvement over baselines on challenging benchmarks.

Conclusion: Multi-TAG is a versatile, finetuning-free framework that boosts LLM performance in complex math reasoning.

Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external tools is a promising
avenue for developing high-performance mathematical reasoning systems. Prior
tool-augmented approaches typically finetune an LLM to select and invoke a
single tool at each reasoning step and show promising results on simpler math
reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K. However, these approaches struggle with
more complex math problems that require precise reasoning over multiple steps.
To address this limitation, in this work, we propose Multi-TAG, a Multi-Tool
AGgregation-based framework. Instead of relying on a single tool, Multi-TAG
guides an LLM to concurrently invoke multiple tools at each reasoning step. It
then aggregates their diverse outputs to verify and refine the reasoning
process, enhancing solution robustness and accuracy. Notably, Multi-TAG is a
finetuning-free, inference-only framework, making it readily applicable to any
LLM backbone, including large open-weight models which are computationally
expensive to finetune and proprietary frontier models which cannot be finetuned
with custom recipes. We evaluate Multi-TAG on four challenging benchmarks:
MATH500, AIME, AMC, and OlympiadBench. Across both open-weight and
closed-source LLM backbones, Multi-TAG consistently and substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average improvements of 6.0%
to 7.5% over state-of-the-art baselines.

*Hao Li,Yizheng Sun,Viktor Schlegel,Kailai Yang,Riza Batista-Navarro,Goran Nenadic*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Arg-LLaDA is a novel iterative framework for argument summarization, improving summaries via sufficiency-guided remasking and regeneration, outperforming baselines in metrics and human evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing argument summarization methods lack iterative refinement and factual correction, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Arg-LLaDA uses a large language diffusion framework with sufficiency-guided remasking and regeneration, combining a masking controller and sufficiency-checking module.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in 7/10 metrics and shows human-evaluated improvements in coverage, faithfulness, and conciseness.

Conclusion: Arg-LLaDA's iterative, sufficiency-aware strategy effectively enhances argument summarization quality.

Abstract: Argument summarization aims to generate concise, structured representations
of complex, multi-perspective debates. While recent work has advanced the
identification and clustering of argumentative components, the generation stage
remains underexplored. Existing approaches typically rely on single-pass
generation, offering limited support for factual correction or structural
refinement. To address this gap, we introduce Arg-LLaDA, a novel large language
diffusion framework that iteratively improves summaries via sufficiency-guided
remasking and regeneration. Our method combines a flexible masking controller
with a sufficiency-checking module to identify and revise unsupported,
redundant, or incomplete spans, yielding more faithful, concise, and coherent
outputs. Empirical results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that Arg-LLaDA
surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in 7 out of 10 automatic evaluation
metrics. In addition, human evaluations reveal substantial improvements across
core dimensions, coverage, faithfulness, and conciseness, validating the
effectiveness of our iterative, sufficiency-aware generation strategy.

TL;DR: DebateCV is a novel claim verification framework using multi-LLM agent debates, outperforming single-LLM methods by simulating real-world fact-checking practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-LLM methods fail at complex claim verification requiring multi-faceted evidence, prompting a need for a debate-driven approach.

Method: DebateCV employs two Debaters with opposing stances and a Moderator for multi-round argumentation, enhanced by synthetic data post-training.

Result: Outperforms existing methods across varying evidence quality levels.

Conclusion: DebateCV effectively addresses complex claim verification, leveraging debate dynamics and synthetic data for improved performance.

Abstract: Claim verification is critical for enhancing digital literacy. However, the
state-of-the-art single-LLM methods struggle with complex claim verification
that involves multi-faceted evidences. Inspired by real-world fact-checking
practices, we propose DebateCV, the first claim verification framework that
adopts a debate-driven methodology using multiple LLM agents. In our framework,
two Debaters take opposing stances on a claim and engage in multi-round
argumentation, while a Moderator evaluates the arguments and renders a verdict
with justifications. To further improve the performance of the Moderator, we
introduce a novel post-training strategy that leverages synthetic debate data
generated by the zero-shot DebateCV, effectively addressing the scarcity of
real-world debate-driven claim verification data. Experimental results show
that our method outperforms existing claim verification methods under varying
levels of evidence quality. Our code and dataset are publicly available at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DebateCV-6781.

*Swapnil Hingmire,Ze Shi Li,Shiyu,Zeng,Ahmed Musa Awon,Luiz Franciscatto Guerra,Neil Ernst*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes new evaluation measures for topic quality based on user studies, revealing that users interpret topics using heuristics like availability and representativeness, not probability. It suggests a theory of topic interpretation involving anchoring-and-adjustment and calls for cognitive bias-aware evaluation frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing topic quality measures (e.g., coherence, word intrusion) fail to assess how well topics aid corpus exploration. The study aims to ground evaluation in user tasks and interpretations.

Method: User studies were conducted to assess topic quality constructs. Reflexive thematic analysis identified themes in user rationales.

Result: Users interpret topics using heuristics (availability, representativeness) and anchor on salient words, adjusting semantically. Topic interpretation involves judgment under uncertainty.

Conclusion: A theory of topic interpretation based on anchoring-and-adjustment is proposed. Future work should incorporate cognitive biases into user models and evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: Interpretation of topics is crucial for their downstream applications.
State-of-the-art evaluation measures of topic quality such as coherence and
word intrusion do not measure how much a topic facilitates the exploration of a
corpus. To design evaluation measures grounded on a task, and a population of
users, we do user studies to understand how users interpret topics. We propose
constructs of topic quality and ask users to assess them in the context of a
topic and provide rationale behind evaluations. We use reflexive thematic
analysis to identify themes of topic interpretations from rationales. Users
interpret topics based on availability and representativeness heuristics rather
than probability. We propose a theory of topic interpretation based on the
anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic: users anchor on salient words and make
semantic adjustments to arrive at an interpretation. Topic interpretation can
be viewed as making a judgment under uncertainty by an ecologically rational
user, and hence cognitive biases aware user models and evaluation frameworks
are needed.

### [127] [An Empirical Investigation of Gender Stereotype Representation in Large Language Models: The Italian Case](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19156)
*Gioele Giachino,Marco Rondina,Antonio Vetrò,Riccardo Coppola,Juan Carlos De Martin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines gender and professional bias in LLMs like ChatGPT and Gemini, revealing their tendency to perpetuate stereotypes, especially in Italian.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about LLMs perpetuating stereotypes and generating biased content, particularly in non-English languages like Italian.

Method: Structured experiments with ungendered prompts involving hierarchical job combinations, analyzing 3600 responses from ChatGPT and Gemini.

Result: LLMs showed significant bias, e.g., associating 'she' pronouns with 'assistant' roles (Gemini 100%, ChatGPT 97%).

Conclusion: Bias in AI-generated text has ethical implications; understanding risks is key to mitigation and equitable AI development.

Abstract: The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in a large variety of
domains has sparked worries about how easily they can perpetuate stereotypes
and contribute to the generation of biased content. With a focus on gender and
professional bias, this work examines in which manner LLMs shape responses to
ungendered prompts, contributing to biased outputs. This analysis uses a
structured experimental method, giving different prompts involving three
different professional job combinations, which are also characterized by a
hierarchical relationship. This study uses Italian, a language with extensive
grammatical gender differences, to highlight potential limitations in current
LLMs' ability to generate objective text in non-English languages. Two popular
LLM-based chatbots are examined, namely OpenAI ChatGPT (gpt-4o-mini) and Google
Gemini (gemini-1.5-flash). Through APIs, we collected a range of 3600
responses. The results highlight how content generated by LLMs can perpetuate
stereotypes. For example, Gemini associated 100% (ChatGPT 97%) of 'she'
pronouns to the 'assistant' rather than the 'manager'. The presence of bias in
AI-generated text can have significant implications in many fields, such as in
the workplaces or in job selections, raising ethical concerns about its use.
Understanding these risks is pivotal to developing mitigation strategies and
assuring that AI-based systems do not increase social inequalities, but rather
contribute to more equitable outcomes. Future research directions include
expanding the study to additional chatbots or languages, refining prompt
engineering methods or further exploiting a larger experimental base.

### [128] [Can Small-Scale Data Poisoning Exacerbate Dialect-Linked Biases in Large Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19195)
*Chaymaa Abbas,Mariette Awad,Razane Tajeddine*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study reveals that LLMs amplify social biases, especially for AAVE, when exposed to poisoned data, with larger models showing worse effects. GPT-4o audits highlight harmful stereotypes tied to AAVE, urging dialect-aware debiasing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how dialectal variation (AAVE vs. SAE) and data poisoning influence toxicity in LLM outputs, highlighting biases in current models.

Method: Used small- and medium-scale LLaMA models with poisoned data, and GPT-4o as a fairness auditor to analyze toxicity and stereotypes.

Result: Poisoned data increased toxicity for AAVE inputs significantly, while SAE remained stable. Larger models amplified biases more. GPT-4o identified harmful stereotypes in AAVE outputs.

Conclusion: The study calls for dialect-aware evaluation, targeted debiasing, and responsible training to mitigate compounding biases in LLMs.

Abstract: Despite the ongoing improvements in the design of large language models
(LLMs) to foster inclusion and balanced responses, these systems remain
susceptible to encoding and amplifying social biases. This study examines how
dialectal variation, specifically African American Vernacular English (AAVE)
versus Standard American English (SAE), interacts with data poisoning to
influence toxicity in outputs. Using both small- and medium-scale LLaMA models,
we show that even minimal exposure to poisoned data significantly increases
toxicity for AAVE inputs, while it remains comparatively unaffected for SAE.
Larger models exhibit a more significant amplification effect which suggests
heightened susceptibility with scale. To further assess these disparities, we
employed GPT-4o as a fairness auditor, which identified harmful stereotypical
patterns disproportionately tied to AAVE inputs, including portrayals of
aggression, criminality, and intellectual inferiority. These findings
underscore the compounding impact of data poisoning and dialectal bias and
emphasize the need for dialect-aware evaluation, targeted debiasing
interventions, and socially responsible training protocols during development.

### [129] [How Much Do Large Language Model Cheat on Evaluation? Benchmarking Overestimation under the One-Time-Pad-Based Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19219)
*Zi Liang,Liantong Yu,Shiyu Zhang,Qingqing Ye,Haibo Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses overestimation in LLM evaluations, proposing ArxivRoll, a dynamic framework with private test case generation and metrics for contamination and bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overestimation in LLM evaluations due to benchmark contamination or imbalanced training leads to unfair comparisons and unrealistic capability assessments.

Method: Proposes ArxivRoll, featuring SCP for private test case generation and Rugged Scores (RS) to quantify contamination and bias. Uses recent ArXiv articles for dynamic benchmarks.

Result: Demonstrates high benchmark quality and provides systematic evaluation of current LLMs.

Conclusion: ArxivRoll ensures reproducibility, transparency, and efficiency in LLM evaluations, addressing overestimation issues.

Abstract: Overestimation in evaluating large language models (LLMs) has become an
increasing concern. Due to the contamination of public benchmarks or imbalanced
model training, LLMs may achieve unreal evaluation results on public
benchmarks, either intentionally or unintentionally, which leads to unfair
comparisons among LLMs and undermines their realistic capability assessments.
Existing benchmarks attempt to address these issues by keeping test cases
permanently secret, mitigating contamination through human evaluation, or
repeatedly collecting and constructing new samples. However, these approaches
fail to ensure reproducibility, transparency, and high efficiency
simultaneously. Moreover, the extent of overestimation in current LLMs remains
unquantified. To address these issues, we propose ArxivRoll, a dynamic
evaluation framework inspired by one-time pad encryption in cryptography.
ArxivRoll comprises two key components: \emph{i) SCP (Sequencing, Cloze, and
Prediction)}, an automated generator for private test cases, and \emph{ii)
Rugged Scores (RS)}, metrics that measure the proportion of public benchmark
contamination and training bias. Leveraging SCP, ArxivRoll constructs a new
benchmark every six months using recent articles from ArXiv and employs them
for one-time evaluations of LLM performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the high quality of our benchmark, and we provide a systematic evaluation of
current LLMs. The source code is available at

*Yuanhe Zhang,Fangzhou Xie,Zhenhong Zhou,Zherui Li,Hao Chen,Kun Wang,Yufei Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLDMs match LLMs in performance but are faster and better at math. Existing jailbreak methods fail on LLDMs due to architectural differences. PAD, a new attack, achieves 97% success, exposing safety risks. LLDMs also generate harmful content twice as fast as LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover safety vulnerabilities in LLDMs, as existing jailbreak methods for LLMs are ineffective against them.

Method: Introduces PAD (Parallel Decoding jailbreak) with Multi-Point Attention Attack to exploit LLDMs' parallel generative processes.

Result: PAD achieves 97% jailbreak success rate, and LLDMs generate harmful content 2x faster than LLMs.

Conclusion: LLDMs have significant safety vulnerabilities; PAD exposes these risks, urging secure deployment strategies.

Abstract: Large Language Diffusion Models (LLDMs) exhibit comparable performance to
LLMs while offering distinct advantages in inference speed and mathematical
reasoning tasks.The precise and rapid generation capabilities of LLDMs amplify
concerns of harmful generations, while existing jailbreak methodologies
designed for Large Language Models (LLMs) prove limited effectiveness against
LLDMs and fail to expose safety vulnerabilities.Successful defense cannot
definitively resolve harmful generation concerns, as it remains unclear whether
LLDMs possess safety robustness or existing attacks are incompatible with
diffusion-based architectures.To address this, we first reveal the
vulnerability of LLDMs to jailbreak and demonstrate that attack failure in
LLDMs stems from fundamental architectural differences.We present a PArallel
Decoding jailbreak (PAD) for diffusion-based language models. PAD introduces
Multi-Point Attention Attack, which guides parallel generative processes toward
harmful outputs that inspired by affirmative response patterns in LLMs.
Experimental evaluations across four LLDMs demonstrate that PAD achieves
jailbreak attack success rates by 97%, revealing significant safety
vulnerabilities. Furthermore, compared to autoregressive LLMs of the same size,
LLDMs increase the harmful generation speed by 2x, significantly highlighting
risks of uncontrolled misuse.Through comprehensive analysis, we provide an
investigation into LLDM architecture, offering critical insights for the secure
deployment of diffusion-based language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores LLMs' ability to classify nuanced populist discourse, finding limitations and highlighting the superiority of fine-tuned RoBERTa over instruction-tuned LLMs, with insights from analyzing political speeches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' understanding of complex social science concepts like populism, which remains underexplored despite their broad capabilities.

Method: Curated datasets for populist discourse, evaluated pre-trained LLMs across prompting paradigms, and fine-tuned RoBERTa for comparison. Analyzed political speeches for practical insights.

Result: Fine-tuned RoBERTa outperformed instruction-tuned LLMs in detecting populism. Instruction-tuned LLMs showed better robustness on out-of-domain data.

Conclusion: LLMs have limitations in nuanced social science tasks, but fine-tuning and cross-context analysis reveal potential for political discourse applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of instruction-following tasks, yet their grasp of nuanced social
science concepts remains underexplored. This paper examines whether LLMs can
identify and classify fine-grained forms of populism, a complex and contested
concept in both academic and media debates. To this end, we curate and release
novel datasets specifically designed to capture populist discourse. We evaluate
a range of pre-trained (large) language models, both open-weight and
proprietary, across multiple prompting paradigms. Our analysis reveals notable
variation in performance, highlighting the limitations of LLMs in detecting
populist discourse. We find that a fine-tuned RoBERTa classifier vastly
outperforms all new-era instruction-tuned LLMs, unless fine-tuned.
Additionally, we apply our best-performing model to analyze campaign speeches
by Donald Trump, extracting valuable insights into his strategic use of
populist rhetoric. Finally, we assess the generalizability of these models by
benchmarking them on campaign speeches by European politicians, offering a lens
into cross-context transferability in political discourse analysis. In this
setting, we find that instruction-tuned LLMs exhibit greater robustness on
out-of-domain data.

TL;DR: AutoPCR is a prompt-based phenotype concept recognition method that outperforms existing methods without requiring ontology-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing phenotype CR methods struggle with generalization across diverse text types and evolving biomedical terminology, necessitating a more adaptable solution.

Method: AutoPCR uses a three-stage process: entity extraction (hybrid rule-based and neural tagging), candidate retrieval (SapBERT), and entity linking (prompting a large language model).

Result: AutoPCR achieves the best average and most robust performance on four benchmark datasets, surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: AutoPCR demonstrates strong inductive capability and generalizability to new ontologies, making it a promising tool for biomedical text mining.

Abstract: Phenotype concept recognition (CR) is a fundamental task in biomedical text
mining, enabling applications such as clinical diagnostics and knowledge graph
construction. However, existing methods often require ontology-specific
training and struggle to generalize across diverse text types and evolving
biomedical terminology. We present AutoPCR, a prompt-based phenotype CR method
that does not require ontology-specific training. AutoPCR performs CR in three
stages: entity extraction using a hybrid of rule-based and neural tagging
strategies, candidate retrieval via SapBERT, and entity linking through
prompting a large language model. Experiments on four benchmark datasets show
that AutoPCR achieves the best average and most robust performance across both
mention-level and document-level evaluations, surpassing prior state-of-the-art
methods. Further ablation and transfer studies demonstrate its inductive
capability and generalizability to new ontologies.

*Kai Liu,Zhan Su,Peijie Dong,Fengran Mo,Jianfei Gao,ShaoTing Zhang,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Smooth Reading, a chunk-wise inference method for Recurrent LLMs, improves performance on long-context tasks while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recurrent LLMs underperform on long-context tasks due to fixed-size memory limitations. Existing architectural enhancements haven't bridged the gap with Self-Attention LLMs.

Method: Proposes Smooth Reading, which processes context in chunks and iteratively summarizes information, reducing memory demands.

Result: Narrows performance gap, boosting SWA-3B-4k from 5.68% lower to 3.61% higher than Self-Attention LLMs on LongBench. Maintains efficiency (3x faster training, 2x faster inference at 64k context).

Conclusion: First work to achieve comparable performance for Recurrent LLMs on long-context tasks. Encourages future research; code and dataset will be released.

Abstract: Recently, recurrent large language models (Recurrent LLMs) with linear
computational complexity have re-emerged as efficient alternatives to
self-attention-based LLMs (Self-Attention LLMs), which have quadratic
complexity. However, Recurrent LLMs often underperform on long-context tasks
due to their limited fixed-size memory. Previous research has primarily focused
on enhancing the memory capacity of Recurrent LLMs through architectural
innovations, but these approaches have not yet enabled Recurrent LLMs to match
the performance of Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We argue that
this limitation arises because processing the entire context at once is not
well-suited for Recurrent LLMs. In this paper, we propose Smooth Reading, a
chunk-wise inference method inspired by human reading strategies. Smooth
Reading processes context in chunks and iteratively summarizes the contextual
information, thereby reducing memory demands and making the approach more
compatible with Recurrent LLMs. Our experimental results show that this method
substantially narrows the performance gap between Recurrent and Self-Attention
LLMs on long-context tasks, while preserving the efficiency advantages of
Recurrent LLMs. Our Smooth Reading boosts SWA-3B-4k (a Recurrent LLM) from
5.68% lower to 3.61% higher performance than Self-Attention LLMs on LongBench.
Besides, our method maintains the high efficiency, training 3x faster and
inferring 2x faster at 64k context compared to Self-Attention LLMs. To our
knowledge, this is the first work to achieve comparable performance using
Recurrent LLMs compared with Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We hope
our method will inspire future research in this area. To facilitate further
progress, we will release code and dataset.

*Hsuan-Yu Wang,Pei-Ying Lee,Berlin Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Incorporating timestamp-based alignment between ASR transcripts and SD outputs improves SER accuracy by addressing misalignment issues in multimodal emotion recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misalignment between ASR and SD outputs reduces reliability in multimodal emotion recognition, especially in conversational contexts.

Method: An alignment pipeline using pre-trained ASR and SD models synchronizes timestamps. Multimodal fusion combines RoBERTa text embeddings and Wav2Vec audio embeddings with cross-attention and gating.

Result: Experiments on IEMOCAP show improved SER accuracy with precise alignment, outperforming unsynchronized baselines.

Conclusion: Temporal alignment is critical for enhancing emotion recognition accuracy, providing a robust foundation for multimodal analysis.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of incorporating timestamp-based
alignment between Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcripts and Speaker
Diarization (SD) outputs on Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) accuracy.
Misalignment between these two modalities often reduces the reliability of
multimodal emotion recognition systems, particularly in conversational
contexts. To address this issue, we introduce an alignment pipeline utilizing
pre-trained ASR and speaker diarization models, systematically synchronizing
timestamps to generate accurately labeled speaker segments. Our multimodal
approach combines textual embeddings extracted via RoBERTa with audio
embeddings from Wav2Vec, leveraging cross-attention fusion enhanced by a gating
mechanism. Experimental evaluations on the IEMOCAP benchmark dataset
demonstrate that precise timestamp alignment improves SER accuracy,
outperforming baseline methods that lack synchronization. The results highlight
the critical importance of temporal alignment, demonstrating its effectiveness
in enhancing overall emotion recognition accuracy and providing a foundation
for robust multimodal emotion analysis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SIQ is a new evaluation pipeline for voice-understanding LLMs, assessing them across three cognitive levels inspired by Bloom's Taxonomy. It outperforms traditional metrics like WER and offers unified comparisons, error detection, and hallucination identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current voice understanding metrics (e.g., WER) are limited. SIQ aims to provide a more comprehensive, cognition-inspired evaluation for LLMs.

Method: SIQ evaluates LLMs across three levels: Remembering (verbatim accuracy), Understanding (interpretation similarity), and Application (QA accuracy).

Result: SIQ quantifies voice understanding, compares models, identifies benchmark errors, and detects hallucinations.

Conclusion: SIQ bridges cognitive principles with voice benchmarks, revealing overlooked challenges in multi-modal training.

Abstract: We introduce Speech-based Intelligence Quotient (SIQ) as a new form of human
cognition-inspired evaluation pipeline for voice understanding large language
models, LLM Voice, designed to assess their voice understanding ability. Moving
beyond popular voice understanding metrics such as word error rate (WER), SIQ
examines LLM Voice across three cognitive levels motivated by Bloom's Taxonomy:
(1) Remembering (i.e., WER for verbatim accuracy); (2) Understanding (i.e.,
similarity of LLM's interpretations); and (3) Application (i.e., QA accuracy
for simulating downstream tasks). We demonstrate that SIQ not only quantifies
voice understanding abilities but also provides unified comparisons between
cascaded methods (e.g., ASR LLM) and end-to-end models, identifies annotation
errors in existing benchmarks, and detects hallucinations in LLM Voice. Our
framework represents a first-of-its-kind intelligence examination that bridges
cognitive principles with voice-oriented benchmarks, while exposing overlooked

### [136] [Data Augmentation for Spoken Grammatical Error Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19374)
*Penny Karanasou,Mengjie Qian,Stefano Bannò,Mark J. F. Gales,Kate M. Knill*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated method to generate audio-text pairs with grammatical errors and disfluencies for Spoken GEC (SGEC), along with metrics to evaluate the data. It aims to enrich datasets without altering L2 learners' language scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality annotated spoken datasets for SGEC are under-resourced, necessitating automated methods to generate and evaluate such data.

Method: Proposes a fully automated method to create audio-text pairs with errors and disfluencies, and introduces objective metrics for evaluation.

Result: Evaluates the augmented corpus on the S&I Corpus, showing its utility for both written GEC and SGEC.

Conclusion: The method successfully generates enriched datasets for SGEC while preserving original data characteristics and L2 learners' assessment scores.

Abstract: While there exist strong benchmark datasets for grammatical error correction
(GEC), high-quality annotated spoken datasets for Spoken GEC (SGEC) are still
under-resourced. In this paper, we propose a fully automated method to generate
audio-text pairs with grammatical errors and disfluencies. Moreover, we propose
a series of objective metrics that can be used to evaluate the generated data
and choose the more suitable dataset for SGEC. The goal is to generate an
augmented dataset that maintains the textual and acoustic characteristics of
the original data while providing new types of errors. This augmented dataset
should augment and enrich the original corpus without altering the language
assessment scores of the second language (L2) learners. We evaluate the use of
the augmented corpus both for written GEC (the text part) and for SGEC (the
audio-text pairs). Our experiments are conducted on the S\&I Corpus, the first
publicly available speech dataset with grammar error annotations.

TL;DR: The study benchmarks ADE detection in Dutch clinical texts using transformer models, with MedRoBERTa.nl performing best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a robust benchmark for ADE detection in Dutch clinical free-text documents using advanced NLP models.

Method: Trained Bi-LSTM and four transformer models (BERTje, RobBERT, MedRoBERTa.nl, NuNER) on annotated ICU notes for NER and RC tasks. Evaluated internally and externally.

Result: MedRoBERTa.nl achieved the highest F1 scores (0.63 macro-averaged) and recall (67-74%) in detecting ADEs.

Conclusion: The study provides a clinically meaningful evaluation framework for ADE detection, emphasizing task-specific performance measures.

Abstract: In this study, we set a benchmark for adverse drug event (ADE) detection in
Dutch clinical free text documents using several transformer models, clinical
scenarios and fit-for-purpose performance measures. We trained a Bidirectional
Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model and four transformer-based Dutch and/or
multilingual encoder models (BERTje, RobBERT, MedRoBERTa.nl, and NuNER) for the
tasks of named entity recognition (NER) and relation classification (RC) using
102 richly annotated Dutch ICU clinical progress notes. Anonymized free text
clinical progress notes of patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of
one academic hospital and discharge letters of patients admitted to Internal
Medicine wards of two non-academic hospitals were reused. We evaluated our ADE
RC models internally using gold standard (two-step task) and predicted entities
(end-to-end task). In addition, all models were externally validated on
detecting ADEs at the document level. We report both micro- and macro-averaged
F1 scores, given the imbalance of ADEs in the datasets. Although differences
for the ADE RC task between the models were small, MedRoBERTa.nl was the best
performing model with macro-averaged F1 score of 0.63 using gold standard and
0.62 using predicted entities. The MedRoBERTa.nl models also performed the best
in our external validation and achieved recall of between 0.67 to 0.74 using
predicted entities, meaning between 67 to 74% of discharge letters with ADEs
were detected. Our benchmark study presents a robust and clinically meaningful
approach for evaluating language models for ADE detection in clinical free text
documents. Our study highlights the need to use appropriate performance
measures fit for the task of ADE detection in clinical free-text documents and
envisioned future clinical use.

*Mohammad Khodadad,Ali Shiraee,Mahdi Astaraki,Hamidreza Mahyar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MEDTE, a medical text embedding model, and a benchmark suite to address shortcomings in current models and evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical text embedding models are limited by narrow training data and inadequate evaluations, failing to capture real-world medical diversity.

Method: MEDTE is fine-tuned on diverse medical corpora using self-supervised contrastive learning. A benchmark suite of 51 tasks is proposed for evaluation.

Result: MEDTE outperforms state-of-the-art models across various tasks, and the benchmark provides a robust evaluation framework.

Conclusion: The combined approach of MEDTE and the benchmark suite improves medical text embeddings and evaluation, addressing current limitations.

Abstract: Medical text embedding models are foundational to a wide array of healthcare
applications, ranging from clinical decision support and biomedical information
retrieval to medical question answering, yet they remain hampered by two
critical shortcomings. First, most models are trained on a narrow slice of
medical and biological data, beside not being up to date in terms of
methodology, making them ill suited to capture the diversity of terminology and
semantics encountered in practice. Second, existing evaluations are often
inadequate: even widely used benchmarks fail to generalize across the full
spectrum of real world medical tasks.
  To address these gaps, we leverage MEDTE, a GTE model extensively fine-tuned
on diverse medical corpora through self-supervised contrastive learning across
multiple data sources, to deliver robust medical text embeddings.
  Alongside this model, we propose a comprehensive benchmark suite of 51 tasks
spanning classification, clustering, pair classification, and retrieval modeled
on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) but tailored to the nuances of
medical text. Our results demonstrate that this combined approach not only
establishes a robust evaluation framework but also yields embeddings that
consistently outperform state of the art alternatives in different tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GEPA, a prompt optimizer using natural language reflection, outperforms GRPO and MIPROv2 with fewer rollouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leveraging the interpretable nature of language for richer learning in LLMs compared to sparse scalar rewards.

Method: GEPA samples trajectories, reflects in natural language, diagnoses issues, and optimizes prompts using Pareto frontier lessons.

Result: GEPA outperforms GRPO by 10% on average (up to 20%) with 35x fewer rollouts and beats MIPROv2 by over 10%.

Conclusion: GEPA is effective for prompt optimization and inference-time search, offering significant efficiency and performance gains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adapted to downstream tasks via
reinforcement learning (RL) methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), which often require thousands of rollouts to learn new tasks. We argue
that the interpretable nature of language can often provide a much richer
learning medium for LLMs, compared with policy gradients derived from sparse,
scalar rewards. To test this, we introduce GEPA (Genetic-Pareto), a prompt
optimizer that thoroughly incorporates natural language reflection to learn
high-level rules from trial and error. Given any AI system containing one or
more LLM prompts, GEPA samples system-level trajectories (e.g., reasoning, tool
calls, and tool outputs) and reflects on them in natural language to diagnose
problems, propose and test prompt updates, and combine complementary lessons
from the Pareto frontier of its own attempts. As a result of GEPA's design, it
can often turn even just a few rollouts into a large quality gain. Across four
tasks, GEPA outperforms GRPO by 10% on average and by up to 20%, while using up
to 35x fewer rollouts. GEPA also outperforms the leading prompt optimizer,
MIPROv2, by over 10% across two LLMs, and demonstrates promising results as an
inference-time search strategy for code optimization.

whether an ongoing conversation will derail. In this work, we revisit this task
and introduce the first uniform evaluation framework, creating a benchmark that
enables direct and reliable comparisons between different architectures. This
allows us to present an up-to-date overview of the current progress in CGA
models, in light of recent advancements in language modeling. Our framework
also introduces a novel metric that captures a model's ability to revise its

### [142] [Diffusion Models for Solving Inverse Problems via Posterior Sampling with Piecewise Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18654)
*Saeed Mohseni-Sehdeh,Walid Saad,Kei Sakaguchi,Tao Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel diffusion-based framework for solving inverse problems uses piecewise guidance, balancing efficiency and accuracy without task-specific retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for a problem-agnostic method for inverse problems that balances computational efficiency and accuracy while incorporating measurement noise.

Method: Introduces a piecewise guidance scheme for diffusion models, adapting approximations based on noise levels (high-noise and low-noise phases).

Result: Achieves significant inference time reductions (23-25%) for image inpainting and super-resolution tasks with minimal loss in PSNR and SSIM.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective, adaptable, and efficient for various inverse problems, demonstrating practical utility in image restoration.

Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful tools for sampling from high-dimensional
distributions by progressively transforming pure noise into structured data
through a denoising process. When equipped with a guidance mechanism, these
models can also generate samples from conditional distributions. In this paper,
a novel diffusion-based framework is introduced for solving inverse problems
using a piecewise guidance scheme. The guidance term is defined as a piecewise
function of the diffusion timestep, facilitating the use of different
approximations during high-noise and low-noise phases. This design is shown to
effectively balance computational efficiency with the accuracy of the guidance
term. Unlike task-specific approaches that require retraining for each problem,
the proposed method is problem-agnostic and readily adaptable to a variety of
inverse problems. Additionally, it explicitly incorporates measurement noise
into the reconstruction process. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is
demonstrated through extensive experiments on image restoration tasks,
specifically image inpainting and super-resolution. Using a class conditional
diffusion model for recovery, compared to the \pgdm baseline, the proposed
framework achieves a reduction in inference time of \(25\%\) for inpainting
with both random and center masks, and \(23\%\) and \(24\%\) for \(4\times\)
and \(8\times\) super-resolution tasks, respectively, while incurring only
negligible loss in PSNR and SSIM.

TL;DR: DGAKT is a graph neural network model for knowledge tracing that improves computational efficiency by focusing on relevant subgraphs, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing knowledge tracing methods struggle with high computational costs when handling large graphs and long learning sequences.

Method: DGAKT uses a dual graph attention-based approach, leveraging subgraphs to process only relevant student-exercise-KC relationships, reducing memory and computational demands.

Result: DGAKT outperforms existing KT models and achieves superior resource efficiency.

Conclusion: DGAKT addresses a critical gap in KT by combining performance and efficiency, setting a new standard for the field.

Abstract: The rise of online learning has led to the development of various knowledge
tracing (KT) methods. However, existing methods have overlooked the problem of
increasing computational cost when utilizing large graphs and long learning
sequences. To address this issue, we introduce Dual Graph Attention-based
Knowledge Tracing (DGAKT), a graph neural network model designed to leverage
high-order information from subgraphs representing student-exercise-KC
relationships. DGAKT incorporates a subgraph-based approach to enhance
computational efficiency. By processing only relevant subgraphs for each target
interaction, DGAKT significantly reduces memory and computational requirements
compared to full global graph models. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that DGAKT not only outperforms existing KT models but also sets a
new standard in resource efficiency, addressing a critical need that has been
largely overlooked by prior KT approaches.

TL;DR: Innovator upcycles a dense LLM into a Mixtures-of-Experts model to prevent catastrophic forgetting, improving scientific task performance by 25% while retaining general task abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address catastrophic forgetting when adapting LLMs to scientific tasks without losing general capabilities.

Method: Four-stage training: Scientific Expert Induction, Fine-grained Expert Splitting, Science-Aware Routing warmup, and Generalist-Scientist Integration.

Result: 25% average improvement in 30 scientific tasks, 70% win rate, and 99% retained general task performance. Innovator-Reason shows 30%+ reasoning improvement.

Conclusion: Innovator effectively decouples general and scientific knowledge, enabling robust performance in both domains.

Abstract: A large language model (LLM) with knowledge in both scientific and general
tasks is the foundation of science general intelligence. However, directly
continued pretraining an LLM using science data usually leads to catastrophic
forgetting, which indicates severe degradation in general ability. In this
report, we present Innovator, which solves this problem by upcycling a
pre-trained dense LLM into a fine-grained Mixtures-of-Experts model during
continued pretraining, where different experts are expected to learn science
knowledge in different disciplines, and a shared expert is utilized for general
tasks. Innovator introduces a four-stage upcycle training paradigm: (1)
Scientific Expert Induction on discipline-specific data, (2) Fine-grained
Expert Splitting via FFN dimension decomposition, (3) Science-Aware Routing
warmup, and (4) Generalist-Scientist Integration training on hybrid datasets.
Such a paradigm enables knowledge in the general domain, and different
scientific disciplines can be decoupled, avoiding the negative influence among
knowledge in different domains. With 53.3B total parameters and 13.3B
activated, Innovator extends Qwen2.5-7B using a shared general expert and 64
specialized scientific experts with 8 activated. Trained on 300B tokens with
tri-level quality-controlled data, Innovator achieves 25% average improvement
across 30 scientific tasks with a win rate as 70%, while retaining 99%
performance in general tasks. Furthermore, Innovator-Reason, which is
post-trained from Innovator for reasoning boosting, exhibits excellent
reasoning performance in solving complex scientific problems with improvements
over 30%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This research applies Reinforcement Learning (RL) to market making, addressing challenges like inventory risk and non-stationarity. It introduces novel methods like POW-dTS and demonstrates RL's superiority over traditional strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Market makers face challenges like inventory risk and dynamic markets. RL offers potential for adaptive, profitable strategies.

Method: Formulates market making as an RL problem, uses reward engineering and MORL for inventory management, and introduces POW-dTS for non-stationarity.

Result: RL-based approaches outperform traditional strategies in simulations.

Conclusion: RL shows promise for robust, adaptive market making, transforming algorithmic trading.

Abstract: This thesis presents the results of a comprehensive research project focused
on applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to the problem of market making in
financial markets. Market makers (MMs) play a fundamental role in providing
liquidity, yet face significant challenges arising from inventory risk,
competition, and non-stationary market dynamics. This research explores how RL,
particularly Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), can be employed to develop
autonomous, adaptive, and profitable market making strategies.
  The study begins by formulating the MM task as a reinforcement learning
problem, designing agents capable of operating in both single-agent and
multi-agent settings within a simulated financial environment. It then
addresses the complex issue of inventory management using two complementary
approaches: reward engineering and Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning
(MORL). While the former uses dynamic reward shaping to guide behavior, the
latter leverages Pareto front optimization to explicitly balance competing
objectives.
  To address the problem of non-stationarity, the research introduces POW-dTS,
a novel policy weighting algorithm based on Discounted Thompson Sampling. This
method allows agents to dynamically select and combine pretrained policies,
enabling continual adaptation to shifting market conditions.
  The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RL-based approaches
significantly outperform traditional and baseline algorithmic strategies across
various performance metrics. Overall, this research thesis contributes new
methodologies and insights for the design of robust, efficient, and adaptive
market making agents, reinforcing the potential of RL to transform algorithmic
trading in complex financial systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method to automatically identify the best neural network layer for concept probing based on representation informativeness and regularity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concept probing performance depends heavily on the layer chosen, necessitating an automated solution for optimal layer selection.

Method: Proposes a method to determine the best layer for probing by evaluating representation informativeness and regularity relative to the concept.

Result: Validated through extensive empirical analysis across various models and datasets.

Conclusion: The method effectively identifies optimal layers for concept probing, enhancing probing accuracy and reliability.

Abstract: Concept probing has recently gained popularity as a way for humans to peek
into what is encoded within artificial neural networks. In concept probing,
additional classifiers are trained to map the internal representations of a
model into human-defined concepts of interest. However, the performance of
these probes is highly dependent on the internal representations they probe
from, making identifying the appropriate layer to probe an essential task. In
this paper, we propose a method to automatically identify which layer's
representations in a neural network model should be considered when probing for
a given human-defined concept of interest, based on how informative and regular
the representations are with respect to the concept. We validate our findings
through an exhaustive empirical analysis over different neural network models
and datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces "un-pruning" to address the impact of deleted data on sparse models, proposing an algorithm to approximate the pruned topology for retained data. It integrates with existing unlearning methods and is applicable to structured and unstructured sparse models. New metrics are devised for evaluation, and experiments validate its efficacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The right to be forgotten and the impact of deleted data on sparse models' pruned topology motivated the study. Existing unlearning methods lack focus on sparse models.

Method: Proposes an "un-pruning" algorithm to approximate the pruned topology driven by retained data, integrable with existing unlearning methods. Theoretical bounds on error are provided.

Result: The algorithm works with various pruning and unlearning methods. MIA accuracy is found unreliable, prompting new evaluation metrics. Experiments confirm efficacy.

Conclusion: Un-pruning effectively addresses the impact of deleted data in sparse models, with theoretical guarantees and practical applicability across pruning methods.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to efficiently eliminate the memory about deleted
data from trained models and address the right to be forgotten. Despite the
success of existing unlearning algorithms, unlearning in sparse models has not
yet been well studied. In this paper, we empirically find that the deleted data
has an impact on the pruned topology in a sparse model. Motivated by the
observation and the right to be forgotten, we define a new terminology
``un-pruning" to eliminate the impact of deleted data on model pruning. Then we
propose an un-pruning algorithm to approximate the pruned topology driven by
retained data. We remark that any existing unlearning algorithm can be
integrated with the proposed un-pruning workflow and the error of un-pruning is
upper-bounded in theory. Also, our un-pruning algorithm can be applied to both
structured sparse models and unstructured sparse models. In the experiment, we
further find that Membership Inference Attack (MIA) accuracy is unreliable for
assessing whether a model has forgotten deleted data, as a small change in the
amount of deleted data can produce arbitrary MIA results. Accordingly, we
devise new performance metrics for sparse models to evaluate the success of
un-pruning. Lastly, we conduct extensive experiments to verify the efficacy of
un-pruning with various pruning methods and unlearning algorithms. Our code is
released at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/UnlearningSparseModels-FBC5/.

*Pedro R. Pires,Gregorio F. Azevedo,Pietro L. Campos,Rafael T. Sereicikas,Tiago A. Almeida*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Offline evaluation of Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithms in recommender systems often favors greedy linear models without exploration, highlighting flaws in current assessment methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of offline evaluation in reliably assessing exploration behavior in contextual linear bandits.

Method: Extensive offline empirical comparison of several linear MABs, including hyperparameter optimization.

Result: Greedy linear models (no exploration) outperform exploratory variants in over 90% of datasets.

Conclusion: Offline evaluation protocols inadequately reflect exploratory efficacy, necessitating more robust methodologies for future research.

Abstract: Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithms are widely used in recommender systems
that require continuous, incremental learning. A core aspect of MABs is the
exploration-exploitation trade-off: choosing between exploiting items likely to
be enjoyed and exploring new ones to gather information. In contextual linear
bandits, this trade-off is particularly central, as many variants share the
same linear regression backbone and differ primarily in their exploration
strategies. Despite its prevalent use, offline evaluation of MABs is
increasingly recognized for its limitations in reliably assessing exploration
behavior. This study conducts an extensive offline empirical comparison of
several linear MABs. Strikingly, across over 90% of various datasets, a greedy
linear model, with no type of exploration, consistently achieves top-tier
performance, often outperforming or matching its exploratory counterparts. This
observation is further corroborated by hyperparameter optimization, which
consistently favors configurations that minimize exploration, suggesting that
pure exploitation is the dominant strategy within these evaluation settings.
Our results expose significant inadequacies in offline evaluation protocols for
bandits, particularly concerning their capacity to reflect true exploratory
efficacy. Consequently, this research underscores the urgent necessity for
developing more robust assessment methodologies, guiding future investigations
into alternative evaluation frameworks for interactive learning in recommender
systems.

*Minghui Sun,Benjamin A. Goldstein,Matthew M. Engelhard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLEAR is a framework to separate task-relevant and task-irrelevant features in data representations, improving performance when superficial characteristics shift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure equitable and generalizable predictions in healthcare by learning features unaffected by demographics like race and sex.

Method: Uses Contrastive Learning with Anti-contrastive Regularization (CLEAR) to separate content (task-relevant) and style (task-irrelevant) features, implemented in a VAE.

Result: CLEAR-VAE enables content-style swapping/interpolation and improves classification with unseen content-style combinations.

Conclusion: CLEAR effectively separates essential from superficial features, enhancing generalization and fairness in predictions.

Abstract: Learning representations unaffected by superficial characteristics is
important to ensure that shifts in these characteristics at test time do not
compromise downstream prediction performance. For instance, in healthcare
applications, we might like to learn features that contain information about
pathology yet are unaffected by race, sex, and other sources of physiologic
variability, thereby ensuring predictions are equitable and generalizable
across all demographics. Here we propose Contrastive LEarning with
Anti-contrastive Regularization (CLEAR), an intuitive and easy-to-implement
framework that effectively separates essential (i.e., task-relevant)
characteristics from superficial (i.e., task-irrelevant) characteristics during
training, leading to better performance when superficial characteristics shift
at test time. We begin by supposing that data representations can be
semantically separated into task-relevant content features, which contain
information relevant to downstream tasks, and task-irrelevant style features,
which encompass superficial attributes that are irrelevant to these tasks, yet
may degrade performance due to associations with content present in training
data that do not generalize. We then prove that our anti-contrastive penalty,
which we call Pair-Switching (PS), minimizes the Mutual Information between the
style attributes and content labels. Finally, we instantiate CLEAR in the
latent space of a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), then perform experiments to
quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the resulting CLEAR-VAE over several
image datasets. Our results show that CLEAR-VAE allows us to: (a) swap and
interpolate content and style between any pair of samples, and (b) improve
downstream classification performance in the presence of previously unseen
combinations of content and style. Our code will be made publicly available.

*Wencheng Zou,Nan Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes GNN robustness against hardware-induced bit-flip errors and proposes Ralts, a lightweight solution to enhance resilience by filtering outliers and recovering graph topology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs are used in safety-critical applications, but hardware-induced faults (e.g., bit flips) are underexplored, posing risks to reliability.

Method: Ralts leverages graph similarity metrics to filter outliers and recover compromised topology, integrating these techniques into GNN aggregation functions.

Result: Ralts improves GNN accuracy by at least 20% for weight/embedding errors and 10% for adjacency matrix errors, with efficiency comparable to PyTorch Geometric.

Conclusion: Ralts effectively enhances GNN robustness against bit-flip errors, offering a scalable and efficient solution for reliable GNN systems.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely applied in safety-critical
applications, such as financial and medical networks, in which compromised
predictions may cause catastrophic consequences. While existing research on GNN
robustness has primarily focused on software-level threats, hardware-induced
faults and errors remain largely underexplored. As hardware systems progress
toward advanced technology nodes to meet high-performance and energy efficiency
demands, they become increasingly susceptible to transient faults, which can
cause bit flips and silent data corruption, a prominent issue observed by major
technology companies (e.g., Meta and Google). In response, we first present a
comprehensive analysis of GNN robustness against bit-flip errors, aiming to
reveal system-level optimization opportunities for future reliable and
efficient GNN systems. Second, we propose Ralts, a generalizable and
lightweight solution to bolster GNN resilience to bit-flip errors.
Specifically, Ralts exploits various graph similarity metrics to filter out
outliers and recover compromised graph topology, and incorporates these
protective techniques directly into aggregation functions to support any
message-passing GNNs. Evaluation results demonstrate that Ralts effectively
enhances GNN robustness across a range of GNN models, graph datasets, error
patterns, and both dense and sparse architectures. On average, under a BER of
$3\times10^{-5}$, these robust aggregation functions improve prediction
accuracy by at least 20\% when errors present in model weights or node

is also optimized to deliver execution efficiency comparable to built-in
aggregation functions in PyTorch Geometric.

### [151] [Fishers for Free? Approximating the Fisher Information Matrix by Recycling the Squared Gradient Accumulator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18807)
*YuXin Li,Felix Dangel,Derek Tam,Colin Raffel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes 'Squisher,' a method to approximate the Fisher diagonal by reusing Adam's squared gradient accumulator, saving computational costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Fisher diagonal is computationally expensive to estimate, while adaptive gradient methods like Adam already compute similar metrics during training.

Method: The 'Squisher' reuses Adam's squared gradient accumulator as an approximation of the Fisher diagonal.

Result: Squisher performs similarly to the Fisher diagonal and outperforms baselines in five applications.

Conclusion: Squisher is a computationally efficient alternative to the Fisher diagonal, with clarified differences and empirical validation.

Abstract: The diagonal of a model's Fisher Information Matrix (the "Fisher diagonal")
has frequently been used as a way to measure parameter sensitivity. Typically,
the Fisher diagonal is estimated via squared sampled gradients of the model's
likelihood with respect to its parameters, averaged over a few hundred or
thousand examples -- a process which incurs nontrivial computational costs. At
the same time, adaptive gradient methods like the ubiquitous Adam optimizer
compute a moving average of the squared gradient over the course of training.
This paper therefore explores whether an approximation of the Fisher diagonal
can be obtained "for free" by recycling the squared gradient accumulator that
has already been computed over the course of training. Through a comprehensive
set of experiments covering five applications of the Fisher diagonal, we
demonstrate that the "Squisher" (SQUared gradient accumulator as an
approximation of the FISHER) consistently performs similarly to the Fisher
diagonal while outperforming baseline methods. Additionally, we clarify the
exact differences between the Squisher and the Fisher diagonal and provide
empirical quantification of their respective impact.

*Marco Bagatella,Mert Albaba,Jonas Hübotter,Georg Martius,Andreas Krause*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GC-TTT, a test-time training algorithm for offline reinforcement learning, improving policy performance by fine-tuning on goal-relevant data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance offline reinforcement learning performance by leveraging test-time training, inspired by foundation models' success in adapting to specific goals.

Method: Proposes a self-supervised data selection criterion for relevance and quality, followed by fine-tuning on selected data. GC-TTT adapts policies dynamically during evaluation.

Result: Demonstrates significant performance gains in loco-navigation and manipulation tasks compared to standard offline pre-training.

Conclusion: GC-TTT offers a compute-efficient way to improve policy performance, outperforming scaling model size at similar costs.

Abstract: Foundation models compress a large amount of information in a single, large
neural network, which can then be queried for individual tasks. There are
strong parallels between this widespread framework and offline goal-conditioned
reinforcement learning algorithms: a universal value function is trained on a
large number of goals, and the policy is evaluated on a single goal in each
test episode. Extensive research in foundation models has shown that
performance can be substantially improved through test-time training,
specializing the model to the current goal. We find similarly that test-time
offline reinforcement learning on experience related to the test goal can lead
to substantially better policies at minimal compute costs. We propose a novel
self-supervised data selection criterion, which selects transitions from an
offline dataset according to their relevance to the current state and quality
with respect to the evaluation goal. We demonstrate across a wide range of
high-dimensional loco-navigation and manipulation tasks that fine-tuning a
policy on the selected data for a few gradient steps leads to significant
performance gains over standard offline pre-training. Our goal-conditioned
test-time training (GC-TTT) algorithm applies this routine in a
receding-horizon fashion during evaluation, adapting the policy to the current
trajectory as it is being rolled out. Finally, we study compute allocation at
inference, demonstrating that, at comparable costs, GC-TTT induces performance
gains that are not achievable by scaling model size.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a flow matching (FM) model for fast simulations in high-energy physics, achieving high fidelity and reduced computational costs for ALICE experiment detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address increasing computational demands in high-energy physics by leveraging generative neural networks for efficient simulations.

Method: Uses flow matching (FM) to develop surrogate models with a low-parameter training strategy for zero degree calorimeters in ALICE.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art fidelity (Wasserstein distance of 1.27 for ZN, 1.30 for ZP) and faster inference (0.46 ms for ZN, 0.026 ms for latent FM).

Conclusion: FM models offer a scalable solution for fast, accurate simulations in HEP, significantly outperforming existing methods in speed and fidelity.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative neural networks, particularly flow matching
(FM), have enabled the generation of high-fidelity samples while significantly
reducing computational costs. A promising application of these models is
accelerating simulations in high-energy physics (HEP), helping research
institutions meet their increasing computational demands. In this work, we
leverage FM to develop surrogate models for fast simulations of zero degree
calorimeters in the ALICE experiment. We present an effective training strategy
that enables the training of fast generative models with an exceptionally low
number of parameters. This approach achieves state-of-the-art simulation
fidelity for both neutron (ZN) and proton (ZP) detectors, while offering
substantial reductions in computational costs compared to existing methods. Our
FM model achieves a Wasserstein distance of 1.27 for the ZN simulation with an
inference time of 0.46 ms per sample, compared to the current best of 1.20 with
an inference time of approximately 109 ms. The latent FM model further improves
the inference speed, reducing the sampling time to 0.026 ms per sample, with a
minimal trade-off in accuracy. Similarly, our approach achieves a Wasserstein
distance of 1.30 for the ZP simulation, outperforming the current best of 2.08.

*Zongyi Li,Samuel Lanthaler,Catherine Deng,Michael Chen,Yixuan Wang,Kamyar Azizzadenesheli,Anima Anandkumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A scale-informed neural operator is proposed to generalize ML models for solving PDEs across varying scales, reducing errors by 34% compared to baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of ML models that fail to generalize outside training data for PDEs.

Method: Use scale-consistency properties of PDEs for data augmentation and design a scale-informed neural operator with a scale-consistency loss.

Result: Model trained on Re=1000 generalizes to Re=250-10000, reducing error by 34% on average.

Conclusion: Scale-consistency loss and neural operators enable robust generalization across scales for PDE solutions.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models have emerged as a promising approach for solving
partial differential equations (PDEs) in science and engineering. Previous ML
models typically cannot generalize outside the training data; for example, a
trained ML model for the Navier-Stokes equations only works for a fixed
Reynolds number ($Re$) on a pre-defined domain. To overcome these limitations,
we propose a data augmentation scheme based on scale-consistency properties of
PDEs and design a scale-informed neural operator that can model a wide range of
scales. Our formulation leverages the facts: (i) PDEs can be rescaled, or more
concretely, a given domain can be re-scaled to unit size, and the parameters
and the boundary conditions of the PDE can be appropriately adjusted to
represent the original solution, and (ii) the solution operators on a given
domain are consistent on the sub-domains. We leverage these facts to create a
scale-consistency loss that encourages matching the solutions evaluated on a
given domain and the solution obtained on its sub-domain from the rescaled PDE.
Since neural operators can fit to multiple scales and resolutions, they are the
natural choice for incorporating scale-consistency loss during training of
neural PDE solvers. We experiment with scale-consistency loss and the
scale-informed neural operator model on the Burgers' equation, Darcy Flow,
Helmholtz equation, and Navier-Stokes equations. With scale-consistency, the
model trained on $Re$ of 1000 can generalize to $Re$ ranging from 250 to 10000,
and reduces the error by 34% on average of all datasets compared to baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper extends Weak-to-Strong Generalization (W2SG) to complex interactive decision-making by fine-tuning strong models with weak model-generated trajectories, including failures, and using trajectory trees with MCTS for optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the capabilities of strong models by leveraging weak model supervision, inspired by human learning from both successes and failures.

Method: Fine-tunes strong models with weak model trajectories, constructs hierarchical trajectory trees, and applies MCTS for optimization.

Result: Empirical evaluations show improved reasoning and decision-making across diverse tasks, supported by theoretical guarantees.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is scalable, robust, and effective in advancing W2SG for complex environments.

Abstract: Weak-to-Strong generalization (W2SG) is a new trend to elicit the full
capabilities of a strong model with supervision from a weak model. While
existing W2SG studies focus on simple tasks like binary classification, we
extend this paradigm to complex interactive decision-making environments.
Specifically, we fine-tune a strong model with trajectories of intermediate
actions generated by a weak model. Motivated by the human learning process, we
propose to generalize not only success knowledge but also failure experience so
that the strong model can learn from failed trajectories accumulated by weak
models. To effectively and efficiently elicit the potential of strong agents,
we further construct ``trajectory trees," a hierarchical representation that
organizes weak model-generated action trajectories, coupled with Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) to optimize the strong model. Through theoretical analysis,
we provide formal guarantees for the effectiveness of our method in improving
W2SG performance. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate substantial
improvements in reasoning and decision-making capabilities across diverse task
domains, validating the scalability and robustness of our proposed framework.

*Yong Si,Junyi Fan,Li Sun,Shuheng Chen,Minoo Ahmadi,Elham Pishgar,Kamiar Alaei,Greg Placencia,Maryam Pishgar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A machine learning framework (CatBoost) was developed to predict 30-day mortality in ICU patients with hypertensive kidney disease, achieving high accuracy (AUROC 0.88) and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hypertensive kidney disease patients in ICUs lack tailored risk prediction tools, necessitating early identification of high-risk individuals for better clinical decisions.

Method: Used MIMIC-IV v2.2 data (1,366 adults) to train models; CatBoost performed best. Features included vital signs, labs, and therapies, selected via random forest and mutual information.

Result: CatBoost achieved AUROC 0.88, sensitivity 0.811, specificity 0.798. SHAP and ALE plots highlighted key predictors like altered consciousness and vasopressor use.

Conclusion: The interpretable pipeline supports real-time risk assessment with uncertainty quantification, aiding individualized triage and clinical decisions, warranting further validation.

Abstract: Background: Hypertensive kidney disease (HKD) patients in intensive care
units (ICUs) face high short-term mortality, but tailored risk prediction tools
are lacking. Early identification of high-risk individuals is crucial for
clinical decision-making. Methods: We developed a machine learning framework to
predict 30-day in-hospital mortality among ICU patients with HKD using early
clinical data from the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database. A cohort of 1,366 adults was
curated with strict criteria, excluding malignancy cases. Eighteen clinical
features-including vital signs, labs, comorbidities, and therapies-were
selected via random forest importance and mutual information filtering. Several
models were trained and compared with stratified five-fold cross-validation;
CatBoost demonstrated the best performance. Results: CatBoost achieved an AUROC
of 0.88 on the independent test set, with sensitivity of 0.811 and specificity
of 0.798. SHAP values and Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) plots showed the
model relied on meaningful predictors such as altered consciousness,
vasopressor use, and coagulation status. Additionally, the DREAM algorithm was
integrated to estimate patient-specific posterior risk distributions, allowing
clinicians to assess both predicted mortality and its uncertainty. Conclusions:
We present an interpretable machine learning pipeline for early, real-time risk
assessment in ICU patients with HKD. By combining high predictive performance
with uncertainty quantification, our model supports individualized triage and
transparent clinical decisions. This approach shows promise for clinical
deployment and merits external validation in broader critical care populations.

*Xuefei Wu,Xiao Yin,Yuanyang Zhu,Chunlin Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LIGHT is a novel MARL framework that integrates human expertise to guide agents in sparse-reward environments, improving exploration and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inefficiency of manually engineered rewards in MARL by incorporating human knowledge for better exploration and generalization.

Method: LIGHT combines individual action distribution and human expertise preference to design intrinsic rewards, aligning agent actions with human knowledge while maximizing joint value.

Result: Outperforms baselines in performance and knowledge reusability across sparse-reward tasks.

Conclusion: LIGHT effectively integrates human expertise into MARL, enhancing exploration and task performance in complex environments.

Abstract: Efficient exploration in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a
challenging problem when receiving only a team reward, especially in
environments with sparse rewards. A powerful method to mitigate this issue
involves crafting dense individual rewards to guide the agents toward efficient
exploration. However, individual rewards generally rely on manually engineered
shaping-reward functions that lack high-order intelligence, thus it behaves
ineffectively than humans regarding learning and generalization in complex
problems. To tackle these issues, we combine the above two paradigms and
propose a novel framework, LIGHT (Learning Individual Intrinsic reward via
Incorporating Generalized Human experTise), which can integrate human knowledge
into MARL algorithms in an end-to-end manner. LIGHT guides each agent to avoid
unnecessary exploration by considering both individual action distribution and
human expertise preference distribution. Then, LIGHT designs individual
intrinsic rewards for each agent based on actionable representational
transformation relevant to Q-learning so that the agents align their action
preferences with the human expertise while maximizing the joint action value.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over
representative baselines regarding performance and better knowledge reusability
across different sparse-reward tasks on challenging scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GMC-MPNN, a GNN framework that incorporates 3D geometric data for BBBP prediction, outperforming existing models in classification and regression tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate BBBP prediction is vital for CNS drug development, but current GNNs often ignore 3D geometric information critical for transport mechanisms.

Method: GMC-MPNN enhances message-passing architectures by including atomic-level geometric features and long-range interactions, using weighted colored subgraphs based on atom types.

Result: GMC-MPNN achieves superior performance (AUC-ROC up to 0.9704, RMSE of 0.4609) and generalizes well across datasets.

Conclusion: GMC-MPNN sets a new benchmark by integrating spatial geometry, improving accuracy and generalizability for drug discovery.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of blood-brain barrier permeability (BBBP) is essential
for central nervous system (CNS) drug development. While graph neural networks
(GNNs) have advanced molecular property prediction, they often rely on
molecular topology and neglect the three-dimensional geometric information
crucial for modeling transport mechanisms. This paper introduces the geometric
multi-color message-passing graph neural network (GMC-MPNN), a novel framework
that enhances standard message-passing architectures by explicitly
incorporating atomic-level geometric features and long-range interactions. Our
model constructs weighted colored subgraphs based on atom types to capture the
spatial relationships and chemical context that govern BBB permeability. We
evaluated GMC-MPNN on three benchmark datasets for both classification and
regression tasks, using rigorous scaffold-based splitting to ensure a robust
assessment of generalization. The results demonstrate that GMC-MPNN
consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, achieving superior
performance in both classifying compounds as permeable/non-permeable (AUC-ROC
of 0.9704 and 0.9685) and in regressing continuous permeability values (RMSE of
0.4609, Pearson correlation of 0.7759). An ablation study further quantified
the impact of specific atom-pair interactions, revealing that the model's
predictive power derives from its ability to learn from both common and rare,
but chemically significant, functional motifs. By integrating spatial geometry
into the graph representation, GMC-MPNN sets a new performance benchmark and
offers a more accurate and generalizable tool for drug discovery pipelines.

### [159] [Secure Best Arm Identification in the Presence of a Copycat](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18975)
*Asaf Cohen,Onur Günlü*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses best arm identification in stochastic linear bandits with a security constraint, proposing a secure algorithm using coded arms to balance performance and secrecy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem arises when a player aims to identify the best arm while preventing an observer (copycat Chloe) from learning the best arm, as traditional methods reveal it through frequent plays.

Method: The proposed secure algorithm uses coded arms, avoiding cryptographic primitives, to obscure the best arm while maintaining performance.

Result: The algorithm achieves an error exponent of Ω(T/log²(d)), outperforming naive secure methods (Ω(T/d)) and nearly matching non-secure minimax-optimal performance (Ω(T/log(d))).

Conclusion: The coded arms approach effectively balances identification accuracy and security, offering a practical solution for secure best arm identification.

Abstract: Consider the problem of best arm identification with a security constraint.
Specifically, assume a setup of stochastic linear bandits with $K$ arms of
dimension $d$. In each arm pull, the player receives a reward that is the sum
of the dot product of the arm with an unknown parameter vector and independent
noise. The player's goal is to identify the best arm after $T$ arm pulls.
Moreover, assume a copycat Chloe is observing the arm pulls. The player wishes
to keep Chloe ignorant of the best arm.
  While a minimax--optimal algorithm identifies the best arm with an
$\Omega\left(\frac{T}{\log(d)}\right)$ error exponent, it easily reveals its
best-arm estimate to an outside observer, as the best arms are played more
frequently. A naive secure algorithm that plays all arms equally results in an
$\Omega\left(\frac{T}{d}\right)$ exponent. In this paper, we propose a secure
algorithm that plays with \emph{coded arms}. The algorithm does not require any
key or cryptographic primitives, yet achieves an
$\Omega\left(\frac{T}{\log^2(d)}\right)$ exponent while revealing almost no
information on the best arm.

TL;DR: A novel framework, KASPER, integrates regime detection, sparse spline modeling, and symbolic rule extraction for adaptive and interpretable stock prediction, outperforming traditional deep learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial markets' nonlinear and regime-dependent dynamics challenge traditional models, necessitating adaptive and interpretable solutions.

Method: KASPER uses Gumbel-Softmax for regime detection, Kolmogorov-Arnold networks with sparse spline activations for regime-specific forecasting, and symbolic learning for interpretability.

Result: Achieves R² of 0.89, Sharpe Ratio of 12.02, and MSE of 0.0001 on Yahoo Finance data, surpassing existing methods.

Conclusion: KASPER advances regime-aware, transparent, and robust financial forecasting.

Abstract: Forecasting in financial markets remains a significant challenge due to their
nonlinear and regime-dependent dynamics. Traditional deep learning models, such
as long short-term memory networks and multilayer perceptrons, often struggle
to generalize across shifting market conditions, highlighting the need for a
more adaptive and interpretable approach. To address this, we introduce
Kolmogorov-Arnold networks for stock prediction and explainable regimes
(KASPER), a novel framework that integrates regime detection, sparse
spline-based function modeling, and symbolic rule extraction. The framework
identifies hidden market conditions using a Gumbel-Softmax-based mechanism,
enabling regime-specific forecasting. For each regime, it employs
Kolmogorov-Arnold networks with sparse spline activations to capture intricate
price behaviors while maintaining robustness. Interpretability is achieved
through symbolic learning based on Monte Carlo Shapley values, which extracts
human-readable rules tailored to each regime. Applied to real-world financial
time series from Yahoo Finance, the model achieves an $R^2$ score of 0.89, a
Sharpe Ratio of 12.02, and a mean squared error as low as 0.0001, outperforming
existing methods. This research establishes a new direction for regime-aware,
transparent, and robust forecasting in financial markets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the need for accurate, interpretable, and uncertainty-aware models for DTC recurrence classification.

Method: Employed 11 ML models, feature selection via Boruta, and BNN with six prior distributions on datasets of 383 patients.

Result: BNN with Normal 0,10 prior achieved highest accuracy (0.9870 after feature selection), surpassing ML models.

Conclusion: BNN models with uncertainty quantification are superior for DTC recurrence classification, offering clinical decision-making benefits.

Abstract: Differentiated thyroid cancer DTC recurrence is a major public health
concern, requiring classification and predictive models that are not only
accurate but also interpretable and uncertainty aware. This study introduces a
comprehensive framework for DTC recurrence classification using a dataset
containing 383 patients and 16 clinical and pathological variables. Initially,
11 machine learning ML models were employed using the complete dataset, where
the Support Vector Machines SVM model achieved the highest accuracy of 0.9481.
To reduce complexity and redundancy, feature selection was carried out using
the Boruta algorithm, and the same ML models were applied to the reduced
dataset, where it was observed that the Logistic Regression LR model obtained
the maximum accuracy of 0.9611. However, these ML models often lack uncertainty
quantification, which is critical in clinical decision making. Therefore, to
address this limitation, the Bayesian Neural Networks BNN with six varying
prior distributions, including Normal 0,1, Normal 0,10, Laplace 0,1, Cauchy
0,1, Cauchy 0,2.5, and Horseshoe 1, were implemented on both the complete and
reduced datasets. The BNN model with Normal 0,10 prior distribution exhibited
maximum accuracies of 0.9740 and 0.9870 before and after feature selection,
respectively.

TL;DR: GENIAL is a machine learning framework for optimizing arithmetic units, using a Transformer-based surrogate model to minimize power and area, achieving up to 18% savings in switching activity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional design flows for arithmetic units are limited in exploring the vast design space, necessitating an automated, efficient optimization method.

Method: GENIAL employs a two-stage Transformer-based surrogate model (self-supervised pretraining + supervised finetuning) to predict hardware metrics and invert the model for optimization.

Result: GENIAL outperforms other methods in sample efficiency, achieving up to 18% switching activity savings in multipliers and demonstrating versatility with Finite State Machines.

Conclusion: GENIAL represents a significant advancement in automated, quality-of-results-optimized combinational circuit generation for digital systems.

Abstract: As AI workloads proliferate, optimizing arithmetic units is becoming
increasingly important to reduce the footprint of digital systems. Conventional
design flows, which often rely on manual or heuristics-based optimization, are
limited in their ability to thoroughly explore the vast design space. In this
paper, we introduce GENIAL, a machine learning-based framework for the
automatic generation and optimization of arithmetic units, more specifically
multipliers.
  At the core of GENIAL is a Transformer-based surrogate model trained in two
stages, involving self-supervised pretraining followed by supervised
finetuning, to robustly forecast key hardware metrics such as power and area
from abstracted design representations. By inverting the surrogate model,
GENIAL efficiently searches for new operand encodings that directly minimize
power consumption in arithmetic units for specific input data distributions.
Extensive experiments on large datasets demonstrate that GENIAL is consistently
more sample efficient than other methods, and converges faster towards
optimized designs. This enables to deploy a high-effort logic synthesis
optimization flow in the loop, improving the accuracy of the surrogate model.
Notably, GENIAL automatically discovers encodings that achieve up to 18%
switching activity savings within multipliers on representative AI workloads
compared with the conventional two's complement. We also demonstrate the
versatility of our approach by achieving significant improvements on Finite
State Machines, highlighting GENIAL's applicability for a wide spectrum of
logic functions. Together, these advances mark a significant step toward
automated Quality-of-Results-optimized combinational circuit generation for
digital systems.

*Jongsoo Lee,Jangwon Kim,Jiseok Jeong,Soohee Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A robust agent (conservative agent) is proposed to handle random delays in reinforcement learning by transforming them into constant delays, enabling existing methods to work effectively without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world reinforcement learning faces challenges due to random delays, which violate the Markov assumption and are less explored compared to constant delays.

Method: The conservative agent reformulates random-delay environments into constant-delay equivalents, allowing direct application of state-of-the-art constant-delay methods.

Result: Empirical results show the conservative agent outperforms baselines in asymptotic performance and sample efficiency on continuous control tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses random delays, extending the applicability of existing constant-delay techniques without structural changes.

Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning applications are often hindered by delayed
feedback from environments, which violates the Markov assumption and introduces
significant challenges. Although numerous delay-compensating methods have been
proposed for environments with constant delays, environments with random delays
remain largely unexplored due to their inherent variability and
unpredictability. In this study, we propose a simple yet robust agent for
decision-making under random delays, termed the conservative agent, which
reformulates the random-delay environment into its constant-delay equivalent.
This transformation enables any state-of-the-art constant-delay method to be
directly extended to the random-delay environments without modifying the
algorithmic structure or sacrificing performance. We evaluate the conservative
agent-based algorithm on continuous control tasks, and empirical results
demonstrate that it significantly outperforms existing baseline algorithms in
terms of asymptotic performance and sample efficiency.

TL;DR: FADE is a lightweight framework for robust learning under sequential covariate shift (SCS), using Fisher-based adaptation and shift-aware regularization to improve accuracy without task boundaries or target labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of sequential covariate shift (SCS) in dynamic environments where input distributions evolve over time while conditional distributions remain stable.

Method: FADE employs Fisher information geometry for shift-aware regularization and a Cramer-Rao-informed shift signal to detect distribution changes. It operates online with fixed memory and no target labels.

Result: FADE achieves up to 19% higher accuracy under severe shifts compared to methods like TENT and DIW, and generalizes to federated learning.

Conclusion: FADE provides a scalable, theoretically grounded solution for robust learning in dynamic environments, with proven effectiveness across diverse benchmarks and modalities.

Abstract: Modern machine learning systems operating in dynamic environments often face
\textit{sequential covariate shift} (SCS), where input distributions evolve
over time while the conditional distribution remains stable. We introduce FADE
(Fisher-based Adaptation to Dynamic Environments), a lightweight and
theoretically grounded framework for robust learning under SCS. FADE employs a
shift-aware regularization mechanism anchored in Fisher information geometry,
guiding adaptation by modulating parameter updates based on sensitivity and
stability. To detect significant distribution changes, we propose a
Cramer-Rao-informed shift signal that integrates KL divergence with temporal
Fisher dynamics. Unlike prior methods requiring task boundaries, target
supervision, or experience replay, FADE operates online with fixed memory and
no access to target labels. Evaluated on seven benchmarks spanning vision,
language, and tabular data, FADE achieves up to 19\% higher accuracy under
severe shifts, outperforming methods such as TENT and DIW. FADE also
generalizes naturally to federated learning by treating heterogeneous clients
as temporally fragmented environments, enabling scalable and stable adaptation
in decentralized settings. Theoretical analysis guarantees bounded regret and
parameter consistency, while empirical results demonstrate FADE's robustness
across modalities and shift intensities.

*Gihun Kim,Sun-Yong Choi,Yeoneung Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A diffusion-based generative framework for financial time series integrates geometric Brownian motion into the noising process, improving realism in modeling financial data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard score-based models treat financial time series as generic sequences, ignoring heteroskedasticity. This work aims to better reflect financial market behaviors like volatility clustering.

Method: The framework injects noise proportionally to asset prices, balancing drift and diffusion terms. It uses a Transformer-based architecture for denoising score matching.

Result: The model realistically reproduces stylized facts like heavy-tailed returns, volatility clustering, and the leverage effect, outperforming conventional diffusion models.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively captures financial time series dynamics, offering a more accurate generative model for such data.

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based generative framework for financial time
series that incorporates geometric Brownian motion (GBM), the foundation of the
Black--Scholes theory, into the forward noising process. Unlike standard
score-based models that treat price trajectories as generic numerical
sequences, our method injects noise proportionally to asset prices at each time
step, reflecting the heteroskedasticity observed in financial time series. By
accurately balancing the drift and diffusion terms, we show that the resulting
log-price process reduces to a variance-exploding stochastic differential
equation, aligning with the formulation in score-based generative models. The
reverse-time generative process is trained via denoising score matching using a
Transformer-based architecture adapted from the Conditional Score-based
Diffusion Imputation (CSDI) framework. Empirical evaluations on historical
stock data demonstrate that our model reproduces key stylized facts
heavy-tailed return distributions, volatility clustering, and the leverage
effect more realistically than conventional diffusion models.

TL;DR: MindSpeed RL is a scalable and efficient system for large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) training, addressing poor cluster scalability and low memory utilization through distributed strategies and optimization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL training systems suffer from poor scalability and memory inefficiency due to heavy cross-node dependencies.

Method: MindSpeed RL introduces a distributed transfer dock strategy for sample flow and an allgather-swap strategy for resharding flow, along with parallelization and acceleration techniques.

Result: Experiments show MindSpeed RL improves throughput by 1.42~3.97 times compared to state-of-the-art systems.

Conclusion: MindSpeed RL is a high-performance, reliable solution for large-scale RL training, demonstrated on Ascend NPUs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a paradigm increasingly used to align large
language models. Popular RL algorithms utilize multiple workers and can be
modeled as a graph, where each node is the status of a worker and each edge
represents dataflow between nodes. Owing to the heavy cross-node dependencies,
the RL training system usually suffers from poor cluster scalability and low
memory utilization. In this article, we introduce MindSpeed RL, an effective
and efficient system for large-scale RL training. Unlike existing centralized
methods, MindSpeed RL organizes the essential data dependencies in RL training,
i.e., sample flow and resharding flow, from a distributed view. On the one
hand, a distributed transfer dock strategy, which sets controllers and
warehouses on the basis of the conventional replay buffer, is designed to
release the dispatch overhead in the sample flow. A practical allgather--swap
strategy is presented to eliminate redundant memory usage in resharding flow.
In addition, MindSpeed RL further integrates numerous parallelization
strategies and acceleration techniques for systematic optimization. Compared
with existing state-of-the-art systems, comprehensive experiments on the RL
training of popular Qwen2.5-Dense-7B/32B, Qwen3-MoE-30B, and
DeepSeek-R1-MoE-671B show that MindSpeed RL increases the throughput by 1.42 ~
3.97 times. Finally, we open--source MindSpeed RL and perform all the
experiments on a super pod of Ascend with 384 neural processing units (NPUs) to
demonstrate the powerful performance and reliability of Ascend.

*Weigang Lu,Ziyu Guan,Wei Zhao,Yaming Yang,Yujie Sun,Zheng Liang,Yibing Zhan,Dapeng Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProGMLP introduces a progressive framework for GNN-to-MLP knowledge distillation, enabling flexible trade-offs between cost and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing G2M methods lack dynamic adjustment of inference cost and accuracy, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: ProGMLP uses Progressive Training Structure, Knowledge Distillation, and Mixup Augmentation to refine MLP training.

Result: Validated on eight datasets, ProGMLP maintains accuracy while adapting to runtime variations.

Conclusion: ProGMLP is effective for diverse applications, balancing efficiency and performance.

Abstract: GNN-to-MLP (G2M) methods have emerged as a promising approach to accelerate
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by distilling their knowledge into simpler
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). These methods bridge the gap between the
expressive power of GNNs and the computational efficiency of MLPs, making them
well-suited for resource-constrained environments. However, existing G2M
methods are limited by their inability to flexibly adjust inference cost and
accuracy dynamically, a critical requirement for real-world applications where
computational resources and time constraints can vary significantly. To address
this, we introduce a Progressive framework designed to offer flexible and
on-demand trade-offs between inference cost and accuracy for GNN-to-MLP
knowledge distillation (ProGMLP). ProGMLP employs a Progressive Training
Structure (PTS), where multiple MLP students are trained in sequence, each
building on the previous one. Furthermore, ProGMLP incorporates Progressive
Knowledge Distillation (PKD) to iteratively refine the distillation process
from GNNs to MLPs, and Progressive Mixup Augmentation (PMA) to enhance
generalization by progressively generating harder mixed samples. Our approach
is validated through comprehensive experiments on eight real-world graph
datasets, demonstrating that ProGMLP maintains high accuracy while dynamically
adapting to varying runtime scenarios, making it highly effective for
deployment in diverse application settings.

*Eva van Tegelen,George van Voorn,Ioannis Athanasiadis,Peter van Heijster*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural ODEs effectively learn and forecast bifurcations in dynamical systems from timeseries data, even with limited or noisy data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing machine learning methods focused on discrete-time and local bifurcations by using continuous, data-driven Neural ODEs.

Method: Apply Neural ODEs to a predator-prey system with local and global bifurcations, learning parameter-dependent vector fields from timeseries data.

Result: Neural ODEs recover bifurcation structures and forecast beyond training parameter regions; performance depends on data quality, not quantity.

Conclusion: Neural ODEs offer a robust framework for learning and predicting bifurcations in dynamical systems, even with imperfect data.

Abstract: Forecasting system behaviour near and across bifurcations is crucial for
identifying potential shifts in dynamical systems. While machine learning has
recently been used to learn critical transitions and bifurcation structures
from data, most studies remain limited as they exclusively focus on
discrete-time methods and local bifurcations. To address these limitations, we
use Neural Ordinary Differential Equations which provide a continuous,
data-driven framework for learning system dynamics. We apply our approach to a
predator-prey system that features both local and global bifurcations,
presenting a challenging test case. Our results show that Neural Ordinary
Differential Equations can recover underlying bifurcation structures directly
from timeseries data by learning parameter-dependent vector fields. Notably, we
demonstrate that Neural Ordinary Differential Equations can forecast
bifurcations even beyond the parameter regions represented in the training
data. We also assess the method's performance under limited and noisy data
conditions, finding that model accuracy depends more on the quality of
information that can be inferred from the training data, than on the amount of
data available.

*Charlotte Geier,Merten Stender*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DyRC-VG, a Dynamics-Informed Reservoir Computing framework that uses visibility graphs to optimize reservoir network structure from training data, improving prediction accuracy and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of nonlinear time series is challenging, and traditional reservoir computing often results in suboptimal, oversized networks with random dynamics.

Method: DyRC-VG employs visibility graphs to convert time series into networks, directly using the structure for the reservoir, avoiding hyperparameter tuning.

Result: DyRC-VG outperforms Erdős-Rényi graphs in prediction quality and consistency for tasks like the Duffing oscillator.

Conclusion: DyRC-VG offers a systematic, data-driven approach to reservoir network design, enhancing performance in nonlinear time series prediction.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of complex and nonlinear time series remains a
challenging problem across engineering and scientific disciplines. Reservoir
computing (RC) offers a computationally efficient alternative to traditional
deep learning by training only the read-out layer while employing a randomly
structured and fixed reservoir network. Despite its advantages, the largely
random reservoir graph architecture often results in suboptimal and oversized
networks with poorly understood dynamics. Addressing this issue, we propose a
novel Dynamics-Informed Reservoir Computing (DyRC) framework that
systematically infers the reservoir network structure directly from the input
training sequence. This work proposes to employ the visibility graph (VG)
technique, which converts time series data into networks by representing
measurement points as nodes linked by mutual visibility. The reservoir network
is constructed by directly adopting the VG network from a training data
sequence, leveraging the parameter-free visibility graph approach to avoid
expensive hyperparameter tuning. This process results in a reservoir that is
directly informed by the specific dynamics of the prediction task under study.
We assess the DyRC-VG method through prediction tasks involving the canonical
nonlinear Duffing oscillator, evaluating prediction accuracy and consistency.
Compared to an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph of the same size, spectral radius, and
comparable density, we observe higher prediction quality and more consistent
performance over repeated implementations in the DyRC-VG.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Molecular assembly is proposed as an agnostic biosignature for life detection, measurable via mass spectrometry without structural elucidation. A machine learning model improves prediction accuracy, highlighting the need for standardized databases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To detect extraterrestrial life without biases from terrestrial assumptions, using mass spectrometry data.

Method: Developed a machine learning model to predict molecular assembly from mass spectrometry data, addressing mission constraints.

Result: The model reduces prediction error by three-fold, though instrumental inconsistencies can double errors, stressing standardization.

Conclusion: Standardized mass spectrometry databases could enable accurate molecular assembly prediction, aiding future astrobiology missions.

Abstract: Molecular assembly offers a promising path to detect life beyond Earth, while
minimizing assumptions based on terrestrial life. As mass spectrometers will be
central to upcoming Solar System missions, predicting molecular assembly from
their data without needing to elucidate unknown structures will be essential
for unbiased life detection. An ideal agnostic biosignature must be
interpretable and experimentally measurable. Here, we show that molecular
assembly, a recently developed approach to measure objects that have been
produced by evolution, satisfies both criteria. First, it is interpretable for
life detection, as it reflects the assembly of molecules with their bonds as
building blocks, in contrast to approaches that discount construction history.
Second, it can be determined without structural elucidation, as it can be
physically measured by mass spectrometry, a property that distinguishes it from
other approaches that use structure-based information measures for molecular
complexity. Whilst molecular assembly is directly measurable using mass
spectrometry data, there are limits imposed by mission constraints. To address
this, we developed a machine learning model that predicts molecular assembly
with high accuracy, reducing error by three-fold compared to baseline models.
Simulated data shows that even small instrumental inconsistencies can double
model error, emphasizing the need for standardization. These results suggest
that standardized mass spectrometry databases could enable accurate molecular
assembly prediction, without structural elucidation, providing a
proof-of-concept for future astrobiology missions.

*Mulin Chen,Bocheng Wang,Jiaxin Zhong,Zongcheng Miao,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CGIR introduces a clustering-oriented generative imputation and refinement model for attribute-missing graph clustering, improving accuracy by focusing on class-relevant semantics and edge-wise attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing imputation methods miss class-relevant semantics, and refinement strategies neglect uncorrelated attributes, leading to sub-optimal clustering.

Method: CGIR estimates subcluster distributions for precise imputation and uses an edge attention network to refine embeddings by identifying class-relevant attributes.

Result: CGIR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in attribute-missing graph clustering.

Conclusion: CGIR effectively integrates imputation and refinement, enhancing clustering accuracy by addressing semantic and attribute redundancy issues.

Abstract: Attribute-missing graph clustering has emerged as a significant unsupervised
task, where only attribute vectors of partial nodes are available and the graph
structure is intact. The related models generally follow the two-step paradigm
of imputation and refinement. However, most imputation approaches fail to
capture class-relevant semantic information, leading to sub-optimal imputation
for clustering. Moreover, existing refinement strategies optimize the learned
embedding through graph reconstruction, while neglecting the fact that some
attributes are uncorrelated with the graph. To remedy the problems, we
establish the Clustering-oriented Generative Imputation with reliable
Refinement (CGIR) model. Concretely, the subcluster distributions are estimated
to reveal the class-specific characteristics precisely, and constrain the
sampling space of the generative adversarial module, such that the imputation
nodes are impelled to align with the correct clusters. Afterwards, multiple
subclusters are merged to guide the proposed edge attention network, which
identifies the edge-wise attributes for each class, so as to avoid the
redundant attributes in graph reconstruction from disturbing the refinement of
overall embedding. To sum up, CGIR splits attribute-missing graph clustering
into the search and mergence of subclusters, which guides to implement node
imputation and refinement within a unified framework. Extensive experiments
prove the advantages of CGIR over state-of-the-art competitors.

Motivation: Addressing challenges in attributed graph clustering due to graph complexity and node attribute heterogeneity.

Method: Proposes GCL-GCN with a Graphormer module for global/local node information and a contrastive learning module for feature distinction.

Result: Outperforms 14 methods, improving ACC, NMI, and ARI by 4.94%, 13.01%, and 10.97% on Cora dataset.

Conclusion: GCL-GCN effectively enhances clustering quality and robustness for sparse, heterogeneous graph data.

Abstract: Attributed graph clustering holds significant importance in modern data
analysis. However, due to the complexity of graph data and the heterogeneity of
node attributes, leveraging graph information for clustering remains
challenging. To address this, we propose a novel deep graph clustering model,
GCL-GCN, specifically designed to address the limitations of existing models in
capturing local dependencies and complex structures when dealing with sparse
and heterogeneous graph data. GCL-GCN introduces an innovative Graphormer
module that combines centrality encoding and spatial relationships, effectively
capturing both global and local information between nodes, thereby enhancing
the quality of node representations. Additionally, we propose a novel
contrastive learning module that significantly enhances the discriminative
power of feature representations. In the pre-training phase, this module
increases feature distinction through contrastive learning on the original
feature matrix, ensuring more identifiable initial representations for
subsequent graph convolution and clustering tasks. Extensive experimental
results on six datasets demonstrate that GCL-GCN outperforms 14 advanced
methods in terms of clustering quality and robustness. Specifically, on the
Cora dataset, it improves ACC, NMI, and ARI by 4.94%, 13.01%, and 10.97%,
respectively, compared to the primary comparison method MBN.

TL;DR: Proposes a privacy-preserving framework for open graph data using Gaussian DP, ensuring unbiased graph recovery while enforcing privacy at the data publishing stage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the gap in balancing privacy and utility in data publishing, especially under GDPR, by focusing on graph recovery.

Method: Leverages Gaussian DP with structured noise injection for unbiased graph structure recovery, extending to discrete-variable graphs.

Result: Demonstrates robust performance in graph learning, providing theoretical guarantees on estimation accuracy.

Conclusion: Offers a viable solution for privacy-conscious graph analysis, addressing limitations of traditional DP methods.

Abstract: Ensuring privacy in large-scale open datasets is increasingly challenging
under regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). While
differential privacy (DP) provides strong theoretical guarantees, it primarily
focuses on noise injection during model training, neglecting privacy
preservation at the data publishing stage. Existing privacy-preserving data
publishing (PPDP) approaches struggle to balance privacy and utility,
particularly when data publishers and users are distinct entities. To address
this gap, we focus on the graph recovery problem and propose a novel
privacy-preserving estimation framework for open graph data, leveraging
Gaussian DP (GDP) with a structured noise-injection mechanism. Unlike
traditional methods that perturb gradients or model updates, our approach
ensures unbiased graph structure recovery while enforcing DP at the data
publishing stage. Moreover, we provide theoretical guarantees on estimation
accuracy and extend our method to discrete-variable graphs, a setting often
overlooked in DP research. Experimental results in graph learning demonstrate
robust performance, offering a viable solution for privacy-conscious graph
analysis.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PVAL, a framework using LLMs for accurate solar PV panel detection in satellite imagery, addressing transparency, scalability, and adaptability issues in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PV detection methods lack transparency, require extensive training data, and struggle with generalization, hindering large-scale deployment and grid optimization.

Method: PVAL leverages LLMs with task decomposition, output standardization, few-shot prompting, and fine-tuning on curated PV datasets for improved detection.

Result: PVAL enhances accuracy, transparency, and scalability in solar panel detection, enabling automated and reproducible workflows.

Conclusion: PVAL provides a robust solution for large-scale renewable energy integration and optimized grid management.

Abstract: Accurate detection and localization of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels in
satellite imagery is essential for optimizing microgrids and active
distribution networks (ADNs), which are critical components of renewable energy
systems. Existing methods lack transparency regarding their underlying
algorithms or training datasets, rely on large, high-quality PV training data,
and struggle to generalize to new geographic regions or varied environmental
conditions without extensive re-training. These limitations lead to
inconsistent detection outcomes, hindering large-scale deployment and
data-driven grid optimization. In this paper, we investigate how large language
models (LLMs) can be leveraged to overcome these challenges. Despite their
promise, LLMs face several challenges in solar panel detection, including
difficulties with multi-step logical processes, inconsistent output formatting,
frequent misclassification of visually similar objects (e.g., shadows, parking
lots), and low accuracy in complex tasks such as spatial localization and
quantification. To overcome these issues, we propose the PV Assessment with
LLMs (PVAL) framework, which incorporates task decomposition for more efficient
workflows, output standardization for consistent and scalable formatting,
few-shot prompting to enhance classification accuracy, and fine-tuning using
curated PV datasets with detailed annotations. PVAL ensures transparency,
scalability, and adaptability across heterogeneous datasets while minimizing
computational overhead. By combining open-source accessibility with robust
methodologies, PVAL establishes an automated and reproducible pipeline for
solar panel detection, paving the way for large-scale renewable energy
integration and optimized grid management.

*Chi-Ching Hsu,Gaëtan Frusque,Florent Forest,Felipe Macedo,Christian M. Franck,Olga Fink*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an unsupervised framework for fault detection and segmentation in high-voltage circuit breakers using vibration and acoustic signals, eliminating the need for labeled fault data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing condition monitoring systems rely on limited physical parameters and supervised methods, which are impractical for real-world applications where fault labels are unavailable.

Method: An unsupervised fault detection and segmentation framework is introduced, using healthy data for training and explainable AI (XAI) for fault diagnostics.

Result: The framework successfully detects and clusters faults without labeled data, validated using experimental data from a high-voltage circuit breaker.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances reliability in circuit breaker operation by enabling unsupervised fault diagnostics, applicable in real-world settings.

Abstract: Commercial high-voltage circuit breaker (CB) condition monitoring systems
rely on directly observable physical parameters such as gas filling pressure
with pre-defined thresholds. While these parameters are crucial, they only
cover a small subset of malfunctioning mechanisms and usually can be monitored
only if the CB is disconnected from the grid. To facilitate online condition
monitoring while CBs remain connected, non-intrusive measurement techniques
such as vibration or acoustic signals are necessary. Currently, CB condition
monitoring studies using these signals typically utilize supervised methods for
fault diagnostics, where ground-truth fault types are known due to artificially
introduced faults in laboratory settings. This supervised approach is however
not feasible in real-world applications, where fault labels are unavailable. In
this work, we propose a novel unsupervised fault detection and segmentation
framework for CBs based on vibration and acoustic signals. This framework can
detect deviations from the healthy state. The explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) approach is applied to the detected faults for fault
diagnostics. The specific contributions are: (1) we propose an integrated
unsupervised fault detection and segmentation framework that is capable of
detecting faults and clustering different faults with only healthy data
required during training (2) we provide an unsupervised explainability-guided
fault diagnostics approach using XAI to offer domain experts potential
indications of the aged or faulty components, achieving fault diagnostics
without the prerequisite of ground-truth fault labels. These contributions are
validated using an experimental dataset from a high-voltage CB under healthy
and artificially introduced fault conditions, contributing to more reliable CB
system operation.

TL;DR: The study explores automatic cough analysis using machine learning (SVM, XGBoost) and deep learning (CNN, VGG16) to distinguish NSCLC patients from healthy controls. CNN achieved the highest accuracy (0.83), while SVM was more interpretable with SHAP. Fairness analysis revealed disparities, especially across age groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of NSCLC is crucial for better patient outcomes, and novel pre-screening tools like cough analysis are needed.

Method: Cough audio recordings from 227 subjects (NSCLC patients and healthy controls) were analyzed using SVM, XGBoost, CNN, and VGG16. SHAP was used for interpretability, and fairness was assessed across age and gender.

Result: CNN performed best (accuracy 0.83), while SVM was viable for low-resource settings (accuracy 0.76-0.78). Fairness disparities were higher for age (0.15) than gender (0.09).

Conclusion: Automatic cough analysis shows promise for NSCLC pre-screening, but larger, diverse datasets are needed to improve reliability and fairness.

Abstract: Early detection of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is critical for
improving patient outcomes, and novel approaches are needed to facilitate early
diagnosis. In this study, we explore the use of automatic cough analysis as a
pre-screening tool for distinguishing between NSCLC patients and healthy
controls. Cough audio recordings were prospectively acquired from a total of
227 subjects, divided into NSCLC patients and healthy controls. The recordings
were analyzed using machine learning techniques, such as support vector machine
(SVM) and XGBoost, as well as deep learning approaches, specifically
convolutional neural networks (CNN) and transfer learning with VGG16. To
enhance the interpretability of the machine learning model, we utilized Shapley
Additive Explanations (SHAP). The fairness of the models across demographic
groups was assessed by comparing the performance of the best model across
different age groups (less than or equal to 58y and higher than 58y) and gender
using the equalized odds difference on the test set. The results demonstrate
that CNN achieves the best performance, with an accuracy of 0.83 on the test
set. Nevertheless, SVM achieves slightly lower performances (accuracy of 0.76
in validation and 0.78 in the test set), making it suitable in contexts with
low computational power. The use of SHAP for SVM interpretation further
enhances model transparency, making it more trustworthy for clinical
applications. Fairness analysis shows slightly higher disparity across age
(0.15) than gender (0.09) on the test set. Therefore, to strengthen our
findings' reliability, a larger, more diverse, and unbiased dataset is needed
-- particularly including individuals at risk of NSCLC and those in early
disease stages.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Weakness-Aware Channel Attention (WACA) mechanism for accurate IR drop estimation in VLSI design, outperforming existing methods by 61.1% in error reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional simulation-based solvers for IR drop estimation are computationally expensive and hard to scale, necessitating a more efficient solution.

Method: The authors reformulate IR drop estimation as a pixel-wise regression task using multi-channel physical maps and introduce WACA to adaptively balance feature channels.

Result: The method reduces mean absolute error by 61.1% and improves F1-score by 71.0% compared to the ICCAD-2023 contest winner.

Conclusion: Channel-wise heterogeneity is crucial for physical layout analysis in VLSI, and WACA effectively addresses this.

Abstract: Accurate spatial prediction of power integrity issues, such as IR drop, is
critical for reliable VLSI design. However, traditional simulation-based
solvers are computationally expensive and difficult to scale. We address this
challenge by reformulating IR drop estimation as a pixel-wise regression task
on heterogeneous multi-channel physical maps derived from circuit layouts.
Prior learning-based methods treat all input layers (e.g., metal, via, and
current maps) equally, ignoring their varying importance to prediction
accuracy. To tackle this, we propose a novel Weakness-Aware Channel Attention
(WACA) mechanism, which recursively enhances weak feature channels while
suppressing over-dominant ones through a two-stage gating strategy. Integrated
into a ConvNeXtV2-based attention U-Net, our approach enables adaptive and
balanced feature representation. On the public ICCAD-2023 benchmark, our method
outperforms the ICCAD-2023 contest winner by reducing mean absolute error by
61.1% and improving F1-score by 71.0%. These results demonstrate that
channel-wise heterogeneity is a key inductive bias in physical layout analysis
for VLSI.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Real-time particle transverse momentum ($p_T$) estimation in high-energy
physics demands algorithms that are both efficient and accurate under strict
hardware constraints. Static machine learning models degrade under high pileup
and lack physics-aware optimization, while generic graph neural networks (GNNs)
often neglect domain structure critical for robust $p_T$ regression. We propose
a physics-informed GNN framework that systematically encodes detector geometry
and physical observables through four distinct graph construction strategies
that systematically encode detector geometry and physical observables:
station-as-node, feature-as-node, bending angle-centric, and pseudorapidity
($\eta$)-centric representations. This framework integrates these tailored
graph structures with a novel Message Passing Layer (MPL), featuring
intra-message attention and gated updates, and domain-specific loss functions
incorporating $p_{T}$-distribution priors. Our co-design methodology yields
superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs compared to existing baselines.
Extensive experiments on the CMS Trigger Dataset validate the approach: a
station-informed EdgeConv model achieves a state-of-the-art MAE of 0.8525 with
$\ge55\%$ fewer parameters than deep learning baselines, especially TabNet,
while an $\eta$-centric MPL configuration also demonstrates improved accuracy
with comparable efficiency. These results establish the promise of
physics-guided GNNs for deployment in resource-constrained trigger systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative models often fail to preserve deterministic and rule-based inter-attribute relationships (FDs and LDs) in synthetic data, limiting utility in privacy-sensitive domains like healthcare.

Method: HFGF first generates independent features using standard models, then reconstructs dependent features based on predefined FD and LD rules.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show HFGF significantly improves FD and LD preservation across six generative models.

Conclusion: HFGF enhances structural fidelity and downstream utility of synthetic tabular data, addressing a critical research gap.

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data is increasingly used in privacy-sensitive domains such
as health care, but existing generative models often fail to preserve
inter-attribute relationships. In particular, functional dependencies (FDs) and
logical dependencies (LDs), which capture deterministic and rule-based
associations between features, are rarely or often poorly retained in synthetic
datasets. To address this research gap, we propose the Hierarchical Feature
Generation Framework (HFGF) for synthetic tabular data generation. We created
benchmark datasets with known dependencies to evaluate our proposed HFGF. The
framework first generates independent features using any standard generative
model, and then reconstructs dependent features based on predefined FD and LD
rules. Our experiments on four benchmark datasets with varying sizes, feature
imbalance, and dependency complexity demonstrate that HFGF improves the
preservation of FDs and LDs across six generative models, including CTGAN,
TVAE, and GReaT. Our findings demonstrate that HFGF can significantly enhance
the structural fidelity and downstream utility of synthetic tabular data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CFD simulations are too slow for real-time or iterative design workflows, necessitating a faster alternative.

Result: The CBML model accurately and quickly predicts velocity and temperature fields in a 2D room with varying inlet velocities.

Conclusion: The CBML approach is a viable, efficient alternative to CFD for indoor airflow and temperature prediction.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient prediction of indoor airflow and temperature
distributions is essential for building energy optimization and occupant
comfort control. However, traditional CFD simulations are computationally
intensive, limiting their integration into real-time or design-iterative
workflows. This study proposes a component-based machine learning (CBML)
surrogate modeling approach to replace conventional CFD simulation for fast
prediction of indoor velocity and temperature fields. The model consists of
three neural networks: a convolutional autoencoder with residual connections
(CAER) to extract and compress flow features, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to
map inlet velocities to latent representations, and a convolutional neural
network (CNN) as an aggregator to combine single-inlet features into dual-inlet
scenarios. A two-dimensional room with varying left and right air inlet
velocities is used as a benchmark case, with CFD simulations providing training
and testing data. Results show that the CBML model accurately and fast predicts
two-component aggregated velocity and temperature fields across both training
and testing datasets.

### [181] [A Markov Categorical Framework for Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19247)
*Yifan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework using Markov Categories to analyze auto-regressive language models, explaining why NLL training yields versatile representations and linking it to spectral contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a theoretical understanding of why the simple NLL objective in auto-regressive models leads to powerful and versatile representations.

Method: Uses Markov Categories (MCs) to model the AR generation process and NLL objective, analyzing information flow and geometry through statistical divergences.

Result: The framework explains the success of speculative decoding methods, shows NLL captures intrinsic stochasticity, and proves NLL acts as implicit spectral contrastive learning.

Conclusion: The analysis reveals deep structural principles behind modern LMs' effectiveness, linking NLL training to geometric representation learning.

Abstract: Auto-regressive language models factorize sequence probabilities and are
trained by minimizing the negative log-likelihood (NLL) objective. While
empirically powerful, a deep theoretical understanding of why this simple
objective yields such versatile representations remains elusive. This work
introduces a unifying analytical framework using Markov Categories (MCs) to
deconstruct the AR generation process and the NLL objective. We model the
single-step generation map as a composition of Markov kernels in the category
Stoch. This compositional view, when enriched with statistical divergences,
allows us to dissect information flow and learned geometry. Our framework makes
three main contributions. First, we provide a formal, information-theoretic
rationale for the success of modern speculative decoding methods like EAGLE,
quantifying the information surplus in hidden states that these methods
exploit. Second, we formalize how NLL minimization forces the model to learn
not just the next token, but the data's intrinsic conditional stochasticity, a
process we analyze using categorical entropy. Third, and most centrally, we
prove that NLL training acts as an implicit form of spectral contrastive
learning. By analyzing the information geometry of the model's prediction head,
we show that NLL implicitly forces the learned representation space to align
with the eigenspectrum of a predictive similarity operator, thereby learning a
geometrically structured space without explicit contrastive pairs. This
compositional and information-geometric perspective reveals the deep structural
principles underlying the effectiveness of modern LMs. Project Page:

*Shuo Yang,Zheyu Zhang,Bardh Prenkaj,Gjergji Kasneci*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPADA is a lightweight generative framework for tabular data augmentation that uses sparse dependencies via an LLM-induced graph, improving efficiency and reducing bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality tabular datasets are scarce due to privacy and cost issues. Current LLM-based methods suffer from bias and high computational overhead.

Method: SPADA captures sparse dependencies using an LLM-induced graph, treating features as nodes and synthesizing values by traversing the graph. It employs Gaussian kernel density estimation and conditional normalizing flow models.

Result: SPADA reduces constraint violations by 4% and speeds up generation by 9,500 times compared to baselines.

Conclusion: SPADA offers an efficient and less biased solution for tabular data augmentation.

Abstract: Tabular data is critical across diverse domains, yet high-quality datasets
remain scarce due to privacy concerns and the cost of collection. Contemporary
approaches adopt large language models (LLMs) for tabular augmentation, but
exhibit two major limitations: (1) dense dependency modeling among tabular
features that can introduce bias, and (2) high computational overhead in
sampling. To address these issues, we propose SPADA for SPArse
Dependency-driven Augmentation, a lightweight generative framework that
explicitly captures sparse dependencies via an LLM-induced graph. We treat each
feature as a node and synthesize values by traversing the graph, conditioning
each feature solely on its parent nodes. We explore two synthesis strategies: a
non-parametric method using Gaussian kernel density estimation, and a
conditional normalizing flow model that learns invertible mappings for
conditional density estimation. Experiments on four datasets show that SPADA
reduces constraint violations by 4% compared to diffusion-based methods and
accelerates generation by nearly 9,500 times over LLM-based baselines.

*Andrii Dzhoha,Katya Mirylenka,Egor Malykh,Marco-Andrea Buchmann,Francesca Catino*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses challenges in recommender systems for short-form video platforms, proposing a multimodal vision-language model as a more effective solution than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social media's shift to short-form videos has led e-commerce platforms to adopt similar features, but this introduces UI and bias challenges for recommender systems.

Method: The authors use a fine-tuned multimodal vision-language model for video retrieval, addressing data limitations and biases.

Result: Online experiments on an e-commerce platform showed this approach outperformed conventional supervised learning methods.

Conclusion: Leveraging multimodal models can effectively overcome challenges in short-form video recommendation systems.

Abstract: In recent years, social media users have spent significant amounts of time on
short-form video platforms. As a result, established platforms in other
domains, such as e-commerce, have begun introducing short-form video content to
engage users and increase their time spent on the platform. The success of
these experiences is due not only to the content itself but also to a unique UI
innovation: instead of offering users a list of choices to click, platforms
actively recommend content for users to watch one at a time. This creates new
challenges for recommender systems, especially when launching a new video
experience. Beyond the limited interaction data, immersive feed experiences
introduce stronger position bias due to the UI and duration bias when
optimizing for watch-time, as models tend to favor shorter videos. These
issues, together with the feedback loop inherent in recommender systems, make
it difficult to build effective solutions. In this paper, we highlight the
challenges faced when introducing a new short-form video experience and present
our experience showing that, even with sufficient video interaction data, it
can be more beneficial to leverage a video retrieval system using a fine-tuned
multimodal vision-language model to overcome these challenges. This approach
demonstrated greater effectiveness compared to conventional supervised learning
methods in online experiments conducted on our e-commerce platform.

*Lorenzo Mario Amorosa,Francesco Conti,Nicola Quercioli,Flavio Zabini,Tayebeh Lotfi Mahyari,Yiqun Ge,Patrizio Frosini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a GENEO-based method for reconstructing SINR maps in 6G networks from sparse measurements, offering a low-complexity alternative to neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient resource management in 6G networks requires high-resolution SINR maps, which are costly to acquire. Traditional methods struggle with data scarcity and high complexity.

Method: Uses Group Equivariant Non-Expansive Operators (GENEOs) to reconstruct SINR maps from sparse samples, leveraging algebraic and geometric constraints to reduce parameters and data needs.

Result: The GENEO-based approach achieves competitive performance in reconstructing SINR maps under severe data limitations, validated by statistical and TDA metrics.

Conclusion: GENEOs provide an effective, low-complexity solution for spatial signal reconstruction in resource-constrained scenarios like 6G networks.

Abstract: In emerging communication systems such as sixth generation (6G) wireless
networks, efficient resource management and service delivery rely on accurate
knowledge of spatially-varying quantities like signal-to-interference-noise
ratio (SINR) maps, which are costly to acquire at high resolution. This work
explores the reconstruction of such spatial signals from sparse measurements
using Group Equivariant Non-Expansive Operators (GENEOs), offering a
low-complexity alternative to traditional neural networks. The concept of
GENEO, which originated in topological data analysis (TDA), is a mathematical
tool used in machine learning to represent agents modelled as functional
operators acting on data while incorporating application-specific invariances.
Leveraging these invariances reduces the number of parameters with respect to
traditional neural networks and mitigates data scarcity by enforcing known
algebraic and geometric constraints that reflect symmetries in the agents'
actions. In this paper, we introduce a novel GENEO-based approach for SINR map
reconstruction in urban wireless communication networks using extremely sparse
sampling. We demonstrate that this mathematical framework achieves competitive
performance compared to established methods. Our evaluation, conducted using
both statistical and TDA metrics, highlights the advantages of our approach in
accurately reconstructing spatial signals under severe data limitations on the
number of samples.

Motivation: To predict satellite and debris propagation efficiently by leveraging high-fidelity data for a lightweight model.

Method: Uses SINDy for sparse dynamics identification and LSTM for temporal modeling, trained on MOCAT-MC data.

Result: Accurate forecasting of space object populations with reduced computational cost.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach offers a practical, efficient solution for space debris prediction.

Abstract: Utilizing the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics algorithm (SINDy)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores generating plausible counterfactual explanations in medical image analysis using a model-specific optimization approach combining VAEs and SPNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of deep learning models in medical image analysis raises reliability and interpretability concerns, which counterfactual explanations aim to address.

Method: The study uses a semi-supervised VAE's latent space modeled with an SPN to optimize counterfactuals, ensuring closeness to the original data and alignment with target classes.

Result: Experiments on the cheXpert dataset compare SPN-guided latent space manipulation against a neural network baseline, analyzing counterfactual quality and regularization trade-offs.

Conclusion: The integration of SPNs with VAEs offers a promising approach for generating interpretable counterfactuals in medical image analysis.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is increasingly leveraged across various domains to
automate decision-making processes that significantly impact human lives. In
medical image analysis, deep learning models have demonstrated remarkable
performance. However, their inherent complexity makes them black box systems,
raising concerns about reliability and interpretability. Counterfactual
explanations provide comprehensible insights into decision processes by
presenting hypothetical "what-if" scenarios that alter model classifications.
By examining input alterations, counterfactual explanations provide patterns
that influence the decision-making process. Despite their potential, generating
plausible counterfactuals that adhere to similarity constraints providing
human-interpretable explanations remains a challenge. In this paper, we
investigate this challenge by a model-specific optimization approach. While
deep generative models such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) exhibit
significant generative power, probabilistic models like sum-product networks
(SPNs) efficiently represent complex joint probability distributions. By
modeling the likelihood of a semi-supervised VAE's latent space with an SPN, we
leverage its dual role as both a latent space descriptor and a classifier for a
given discrimination task. This formulation enables the optimization of latent
space counterfactuals that are both close to the original data distribution and
aligned with the target class distribution. We conduct experimental evaluation
on the cheXpert dataset. To evaluate the effectiveness of the integration of
SPNs, our SPN-guided latent space manipulation is compared against a neural
network baseline. Additionally, the trade-off between latent variable
regularization and counterfactual quality is analyzed.

TL;DR: The paper compares classical, quantum, and hybrid quantum-classical machine learning models for fraud detection, finding classical tree-based models like Random Forest outperform quantum counterparts, with QSVM showing promise among quantum models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of fraud detection in complex financial transactions by exploring advanced machine learning models, including quantum and hybrid approaches.

Method: Develops a behavioral feature engineering framework, evaluates classical (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost) and quantum-hybrid (QSVM, VQC, HQNN) models on the IBM AML dataset, and proposes the FD4QC system architecture.

Result: Random Forest achieves high accuracy (97.34%) and F-measure (86.95%), outperforming quantum models. QSVM shows promise with high precision (77.15%) and low false-positive rate (1.36%).

Conclusion: Classical models currently outperform quantum ones for fraud detection, but quantum models like QSVM show potential. The study benchmarks real-world applications and suggests future research directions.

Abstract: The increasing complexity and volume of financial transactions pose
significant challenges to traditional fraud detection systems. This technical
report investigates and compares the efficacy of classical, quantum, and
quantum-hybrid machine learning models for the binary classification of
fraudulent financial activities.
  As of our methodology, first, we develop a comprehensive behavioural feature
engineering framework to transform raw transactional data into a rich,
descriptive feature set. Second, we implement and evaluate a range of models on
the IBM Anti-Money Laundering (AML) dataset. The classical baseline models
include Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost. These
are compared against three hybrid classic quantum algorithms architectures: a
Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM), a Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC),
and a Hybrid Quantum Neural Network (HQNN).
  Furthermore, we propose Fraud Detection for Quantum Computing (FD4QC), a
practical, API-driven system architecture designed for real-world deployment,
featuring a classical-first, quantum-enhanced philosophy with robust fallback
mechanisms.
  Our results demonstrate that classical tree-based models, particularly
\textit{Random Forest}, significantly outperform the quantum counterparts in
the current setup, achieving high accuracy (\(97.34\%\)) and F-measure
(\(86.95\%\)). Among the quantum models, \textbf{QSVM} shows the most promise,
delivering high precision (\(77.15\%\)) and a low false-positive rate
(\(1.36\%\)), albeit with lower recall and significant computational overhead.
  This report provides a benchmark for a real-world financial application,
highlights the current limitations of quantum machine learning in this domain,
and outlines promising directions for future research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines predictive multiplicity in medical ML models, showing that small ensembles can mitigate conflicting predictions, and recommends ensemble strategies for reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the risk of conflicting predictions from equally valid ML models in medicine, which can lead to arbitrary diagnoses.

Method: Empirical analysis of predictive multiplicity across medical tasks and model architectures, testing ensembles and abstention strategies.

Result: Standard validation metrics fail to identify optimal models; small ensembles reduce predictive multiplicity, and higher model accuracy decreases multiplicity.

Conclusion: Ensemble strategies improve diagnostic reliability, and expert review is advised for cases with low model consensus.

Abstract: Model multiplicity refers to the existence of multiple machine learning
models that describe the data equally well but may produce different
predictions on individual samples. In medicine, these models can admit
conflicting predictions for the same patient -- a risk that is poorly
understood and insufficiently addressed.
  In this study, we empirically analyze the extent, drivers, and ramifications
of predictive multiplicity across diverse medical tasks and model
architectures, and show that even small ensembles can mitigate/eliminate
predictive multiplicity in practice. Our analysis reveals that (1) standard
validation metrics fail to identify a uniquely optimal model and (2) a
substantial amount of predictions hinges on arbitrary choices made during model
development. Using multiple models instead of a single model reveals instances
where predictions differ across equally plausible models -- highlighting
patients that would receive arbitrary diagnoses if any single model were used.
In contrast, (3) a small ensemble paired with an abstention strategy can
effectively mitigate measurable predictive multiplicity in practice;
predictions with high inter-model consensus may thus be amenable to automated
classification. While accuracy is not a principled antidote to predictive
multiplicity, we find that (4) higher accuracy achieved through increased model
capacity reduces predictive multiplicity.
  Our findings underscore the clinical importance of accounting for model
multiplicity and advocate for ensemble-based strategies to improve diagnostic
reliability. In cases where models fail to reach sufficient consensus, we
recommend deferring decisions to expert review.

TL;DR: SILS introduces a dynamic, impact-focused framework for identifying high-impact LPs in CLMMs, using ETWL profiles and LSIS to improve risk analysis and market stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for identifying impactful LPs in CLMMs are static and volume-based, leading to inaccurate risk analysis. SILS aims to provide a more detailed and realistic approach.

Method: The framework uses on-chain event logs and smart contract traces to compute ETWL profiles and applies unsupervised anomaly detection. It defines LP importance via LSIS, a counterfactual metric.

Result: SILS accurately identifies high-impact LPs, reduces false positives/negatives, and enhances DeFi ecosystem applications like protective oracles and trader signals.

Conclusion: SILS transforms proactive risk management in DeFi by offering transparency and dynamic analysis of liquidity behavior, improving ecosystem safeguards.

Abstract: Traditional methods for identifying impactful liquidity providers (LPs) in
Concentrated Liquidity Market Makers (CLMMs) rely on broad measures, such as
nominal capital size or surface-level activity, which often lead to inaccurate
risk analysis. The SILS framework offers a significantly more detailed
approach, characterizing LPs not just as capital holders but as dynamic
systemic agents whose actions directly impact market stability. This represents
a fundamental paradigm shift from the static, volume-based analysis to a
dynamic, impact-focused understanding. This advanced approach uses on-chain
event logs and smart contract execution traces to compute Exponential
Time-Weighted Liquidity (ETWL) profiles and apply unsupervised anomaly
detection. Most importantly, it defines an LP's functional importance through
the Liquidity Stability Impact Score (LSIS), a counterfactual metric that
measures the potential degradation of the market if the LP withdraws. This
combined approach provides a more detailed and realistic characterization of an
LP's impact, moving beyond the binary and often misleading classifications used
by existing methods. This impact-focused and comprehensive approach enables
SILS to accurately identify high-impact LPs-including those missed by
traditional methods and supports essential applications like a protective
oracle layer and actionable trader signals, thereby significantly enhancing
DeFi ecosystem. The framework provides unprecedented transparency into the
underlying liquidity structure and associated risks, effectively reducing the
common false positives and uncovering critical false negatives found in
traditional models. Therefore, SILS provides an effective mechanism for
proactive risk management, transforming how DeFi protocols safeguard their
ecosystems against asymmetric liquidity behavior.

Motivation: Address low hardware efficiency in LLMs during decoding, especially for long-context tasks.

Method: Introduces Multi-Matrix Factorization Attention (MFA) and Attention-FFN Disaggregation (AFD) for cost-efficient decoding.

Result: Achieves higher throughput (4,039 tokens/sec/GPU) and lower costs than models like DeepSeek-V3.

Conclusion: Step-3 sets a new Pareto frontier for LLM decoding, proving hardware-aligned design is key to efficiency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face low hardware efficiency during decoding,
especially for long-context reasoning tasks. This paper introduces Step-3, a
321B-parameter VLM with hardware-aware model-system co-design optimized for
minimizing decoding costs. Step-3 innovates in two key dimensions: (1) A novel
Multi-Matrix Factorization Attention (MFA) mechanism that significantly reduces
both KV cache size and computation while maintaining high attention
expressiveness, and (2) Attention-FFN Disaggregation (AFD), a distributed
inference system that decouples attention and Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers
into specialized subsystems. This co-design achieves unprecedented cost
efficiency: Step-3 significantly reduces theoretical decoding costs compared
with models like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B, with the gains widening at
longer context. Step-3 achieves low cost while activating 38B parameters per
token (more than DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B), demonstrating that
hardware-aligned attention arithmetic intensity, MoE sparsity, and AFD are
critical to cost-effectiveness. We perform a head-to-head comparison with
DeepSeek-V3 in its favorable scenarios. Our implementation on Hopper GPUs
achieves a decoding throughput of up to 4,039 tokens per second per GPU under
50ms TPOT SLA (4K context, FP8, no MTP). It is higher than DeepSeek-V3's 2,324

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve RL agents' adaptability beyond their training regime by capturing latent variations (contexts) effectively.

Method: Recasts context-based RL as a dual inference-control problem, introduces a contextual ELBO-style objective, and develops BCPO with a variational information-bottleneck encoder.

Result: BCPO outperforms baselines in continuous-control benchmarks with shifting parameters, using fewer samples and maintaining performance outside training.

Conclusion: The framework unifies theory, diagnostics, and practice for context-based RL, offering a robust solution for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Capturing latent variations ("contexts") is key to deploying
reinforcement-learning (RL) agents beyond their training regime. We recast
context-based RL as a dual inference-control problem and formally characterize
two properties and their hierarchy: observation sufficiency (preserving all
predictive information) and control sufficiency (retaining decision-making
relevant information). Exploiting this dichotomy, we derive a contextual
evidence lower bound(ELBO)-style objective that cleanly separates
representation learning from policy learning and optimizes it with Bottlenecked
Contextual Policy Optimization (BCPO), an algorithm that places a variational
information-bottleneck encoder in front of any off-policy policy learner. On
standard continuous-control benchmarks with shifting physical parameters, BCPO
matches or surpasses other baselines while using fewer samples and retaining
performance far outside the training regime. The framework unifies theory,
diagnostics, and practice for context-based RL.

TL;DR: Recent advancements in LLMs show potential for superforecaster-level event forecasting, with improved methods and reinforcement learning. The paper proposes large-scale training and data acquisition strategies to overcome challenges like noisiness-sparsity and knowledge cut-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to leverage recent progress in LLMs and reasoning models to achieve superforecaster-level event forecasting, addressing current limitations and exploring scalable solutions.

Method: The paper discusses training methods (e.g., hypothetical event Bayesian networks, auxiliary rewards) and aggressive data acquisition (market, public, crawling datasets) to improve LLM-based forecasting.

Result: Recent studies indicate LLMs are nearing superforecaster-level performance, and proposed methods could further enhance forecasting capabilities.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that large-scale training and innovative data use can advance AI forecasting, calling for research interest in these directions.

Abstract: Many recent papers have studied the development of superforecaster-level
event forecasting LLMs. While methodological problems with early studies cast
doubt on the use of LLMs for event forecasting, recent studies with improved
evaluation methods have shown that state-of-the-art LLMs are gradually reaching
superforecaster-level performance, and reinforcement learning has also been
reported to improve future forecasting. Additionally, the unprecedented success
of recent reasoning models and Deep Research-style models suggests that
technology capable of greatly improving forecasting performance has been
developed. Therefore, based on these positive recent trends, we argue that the
time is ripe for research on large-scale training of superforecaster-level
event forecasting LLMs. We discuss two key research directions: training
methods and data acquisition. For training, we first introduce three
difficulties of LLM-based event forecasting training: noisiness-sparsity,
knowledge cut-off, and simple reward structure problems. Then, we present
related ideas to mitigate these problems: hypothetical event Bayesian networks,
utilizing poorly-recalled and counterfactual events, and auxiliary reward
signals. For data, we propose aggressive use of market, public, and crawling
datasets to enable large-scale training and evaluation. Finally, we explain how
these technical advances could enable AI to provide predictive intelligence to
society in broader areas. This position paper presents promising specific paths
and considerations for getting closer to superforecaster-level AI technology,
aiming to call for researchers' interest in these directions.

areas, the demand for interpretable and trustworthy decision-making has
increased. Random Forests (RF), despite their widespread use and strong
performance on tabular data, remain difficult to interpret due to their
ensemble nature. We present Forest-Guided Clustering (FGC), a model-specific
explainability method that reveals both local and global structure in RFs by
grouping instances according to shared decision paths. FGC produces
human-interpretable clusters aligned with the model's internal logic and
computes cluster-specific and global feature importance scores to derive
decision rules underlying RF predictions. FGC accurately recovered latent
subclass structure on a benchmark dataset and outperformed classical clustering
and post-hoc explanation methods. Applied to an AML transcriptomic dataset, FGC
uncovered biologically coherent subpopulations, disentangled disease-relevant
signals from confounders, and recovered known and novel gene expression
patterns. FGC bridges the gap between performance and interpretability by
providing structure-aware insights that go beyond feature-level attribution.

Rigby*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: An Engineering Agent using LLMs (Llama-based) and ReAct harness fixes code via test failures, achieving a 42.3% solve rate with 11.8 feedback iterations. In production, 25.5% of fixes were landed, and engineers provided mixed but generally positive feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage LLMs for scalable, agentic program repair in large codebases, addressing test failures efficiently.

Method: Uses Llama with ReAct harness, allowing the agent to reason and perform actions (e.g., reading files, generating patches). Feedback from static analysis and test failures refines solutions, with LLM-as-a-Judge ensuring patch quality.

Result: Offline benchmarks show a 42.3% solve rate. In production, 25.5% of fixes were landed, with 31.5% of reviewed fixes accepted. Engineers gave positive and mixed feedback.

Conclusion: The Engineering Agent is effective for scalable code repair, balancing solve rate and cost, though further refinement is needed for higher acceptance rates.

Abstract: Aim: With the advent of LLMs, sophisticated agentic program repair has become
viable at large organizations with large codebases. In this work, we develop an
Engineering Agent that fixes the source code based on test failures at scale
across diverse software offerings internally.
  Method: Using Llama as the base, we employ the ReAct harness to develop an
agent. We start with a test failure that was triaged by a rule-based test
failure bot. We then set up an agentic harness and allow the agent to reason
and run a set of 15 actions from reading a file to generating a patch. We
provide feedback to the agent through static analysis and test failures so it
can refine its solution. We leverage an LLM-as-a-Judge to ensure that the patch
conforms to the standards followed by a human review to land fixes.
  Benchmark Findings: We curated offline benchmarks for our patch generator,
the Engineering Agent loop, and the LLM-as-a-Judge. In offline evaluations we
found that a specialized 70B model is highly competitive with the much larger
but vanilla Llama-405B. In an ablation study, we found that the ReAct harness
(neural model) benefited from the symbolic information from static analysis
tools and test execution traces. A model that strikes a balance between the
solve rate and error rate vs the cost and latency has a benchmark solve rate of
42.3% using an average 11.8 feedback iterations.
  Production Findings: In a three month period, 80% of the generated fixes were
reviewed, of which 31.5% were landed (25.5% of the total number of generated
fixes).
  Feedback from Engineers: We used open coding to extract qualitative themes
from engineers' feedback. We saw positive feedback in the form of quick
approvals, gratitude, and surprise. We also found mixed feedback when the
Engineering Agent's solution was partially correct and it served as a good
starting point.

### [196] [MemoCoder: Automated Function Synthesis using LLM-Supported Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18812)
*Yiping Jia,Zhen Ming Jiang,Shayan Noei,Ying Zou*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: MemoCoder is a multi-agent framework for AI-assisted code generation, improving iterative debugging and knowledge reuse, outperforming existing methods by 3.1%-12.1%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with iterative debugging and adaptation; existing solutions are costly or lack knowledge reuse.

Method: MemoCoder uses a Fixing Knowledge Set and Mentor Agent for collaborative problem-solving and persistent learning.

Result: Outperforms zero-shot prompting and Self-Repair by 3.1%-12.1% in benchmarks like MBPP and HumanEval.

Conclusion: MemoCoder effectively enhances iterative refinement and knowledge-guided code generation.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GitHub
Copilot and ChatGPT, developers increasingly rely on AI-assisted tools to
support code generation. While LLMs can generate syntactically correct
solutions for well-structured programming tasks, they often struggle with
challenges that require iterative debugging, error handling, or adaptation to
diverse problem structures. Existing approaches such as fine-tuning or
self-repair strategies either require costly retraining or lack mechanisms to
accumulate and reuse knowledge from previous attempts.
  To address these limitations, we propose MemoCoder, a multi-agent framework
that enables collaborative problem solving and persistent learning from past
fixes. At the core of MemoCoder is a Fixing Knowledge Set, which stores
successful repairs and supports retrieval for future tasks. A central Mentor
Agent supervises the repair process by identifying recurring error patterns and
refining high-level fixing strategies, providing a novel supervisory role that
guides the self-repair loop. We evaluate MemoCoder across three public
benchmarks -- MBPP, HumanEval, and LiveCodeBench -- spanning a range of problem
complexities. Experimental results show that MemoCoder consistently outperforms
both zero-shot prompting and a Self-Repair strategy, with improvements ranging
from 3.1% to 12.1% in Pass@10 and from 1.4% to 14.5% in Pass@50, demonstrating
its effectiveness in iterative refinement and knowledge-guided code generation.

TL;DR: The paper explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) and static program analysis to automate code review, reducing the burden on experienced developers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code review is essential for software quality but time-consuming for experienced developers. Automating it can free them to focus on coding.

Method: Developed a lightweight tool combining LLMs and static program analysis, tested with experienced developers.

Result: Preliminary experiments showed encouraging results in automating code review.

Conclusion: Automating code review with LLMs is promising and can support developers effectively.

Abstract: Code review is one of the primary means of assuring the quality of released
software along with testing and static analysis. However, code review requires
experienced developers who may not always have the time to perform an in-depth
review of code. Thus, automating code review can help alleviate the cognitive
burden on experienced software developers allowing them to focus on their
primary activities of writing code to add new features and fix bugs. In this
paper, we describe our experience in using Large Language Models towards
automating the code review process in Ericsson. We describe the development of
a lightweight tool using LLMs and static program analysis. We then describe our
preliminary experiments with experienced developers in evaluating our code
review tool and the encouraging results.

*Igli Begolli,Meltem Aksoy,Daniel Neider*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Monolingual fine-tuning of LMs improves accuracy in automated code review tasks, but human reviewers excel in complex changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code review is time-consuming and demanding; LMs offer automation potential.

Method: Fine-tuned CodeReviewer, CodeLlama-7B, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill on a C# dataset, comparing performance across tasks and against ASAT/human reviewers.

Result: Monolingual fine-tuning boosts accuracy; LMs aid routine tasks but lag in complex changes.

Conclusion: Language alignment and task-specific adaptation are key for optimizing LMs in code review.

Abstract: Code review is essential for maintaining software quality but often
time-consuming and cognitively demanding, especially in industrial
environments. Recent advancements in language models (LMs) have opened new
avenues for automating core review tasks. This study presents the empirical
evaluation of monolingual fine-tuning on the performance of open-source LMs
across three key automated code review tasks: Code Change Quality Estimation,
Review Comment Generation, and Code Refinement. We fine-tuned three distinct
models, CodeReviewer, CodeLlama-7B, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill, on a C\# specific
dataset combining public benchmarks with industrial repositories. Our study
investigates how different configurations of programming languages and natural
languages in the training data affect LM performance, particularly in comment
generation. Additionally, we benchmark the fine-tuned models against an
automated software analysis tool (ASAT) and human reviewers to evaluate their
practical utility in real-world settings. Our results show that monolingual
fine-tuning improves model accuracy and relevance compared to multilingual
baselines. While LMs can effectively support code review workflows, especially
for routine or repetitive tasks, human reviewers remain superior in handling
semantically complex or context-sensitive changes. Our findings highlight the
importance of language alignment and task-specific adaptation in optimizing LMs
for automated code review.

### [199] [ReCatcher: Towards LLMs Regression Testing for Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19390)
*Altaf Allah Abbassi,Leuson Da Silva,Amin Nikanjam,Foutse Khomh*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: ReCatcher is a regression testing framework for Python code generation in LLMs, evaluating correctness, code quality, and performance across updates like fine-tuning, merging, or new releases. It identifies regressions, such as increased syntax errors or degraded performance, and outperforms baseline solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid evolution of LLMs for code generation introduces regressions in correctness, quality, and performance. A systematic evaluation framework is needed to assess these regressions before adopting updates.

Method: ReCatcher compares two LLMs (e.g., current and candidate) across logical correctness, static code quality, and execution performance. It is tested on scenarios like fine-tuning, merging, and model releases using models like CodeLlama, DeepSeek-Coder, and GPT-4o.

Result: Fine-tuning increases syntax errors by 12%, merging reduces correctness by 18%, and GPT-4o shows 50% regression in missing imports. GPT-4o-mini has 80% performance degradation. ReCatcher outperforms baselines in accuracy.

Conclusion: ReCatcher demonstrates the need for systematic regression testing in LLM updates, aiding informed decisions by highlighting regression-prone areas like correctness and performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation evolve rapidly through
fine-tuning, merging, or new model releases. However, such updates can
introduce regressions, not only in correctness but also in code quality and
performance. To address this, we present ReCatcher, a regression testing
framework for Python code generation. ReCatcher systematically compares two
LLMs, typically a current model and a candidate update, across three
dimensions: logical correctness, static code quality, and execution
performance. We apply ReCatcher to assess regressions across three update
scenarios, fine-tuning, merging, and model release, using CodeLlama,
DeepSeek-Coder, and GPT-4o. Our evaluation shows that fine-tuning with
cross-language datasets increases syntax errors by up to 12%. Merging with
general-purpose models like Llama2 leads to regressions in correctness by up to
18%. GPT-4o introduces regressions of up to 50% in handling missing imports
compared to GPT-3.5-turbo, while GPT-4o-mini suffers up to 80% performance
degradation in execution time versus GPT-4o. Overall, logical correctness,
performance, and error handling (e.g., syntax errors and missing imports) are
the most regression-prone areas. Comparing ReCatcher with baseline solutions,
it presents better and consistent accuracy across logical and performance
aspects. ReCatcher highlights the importance of systematic regression
evaluation before adopting new models, while assisting researchers and
practitioners in making more informed update decisions.

### [200] [SDVDiag: A Modular Platform for the Diagnosis of Connected Vehicle Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19403)
*Matthias Weiß,Falk Dettinger,Michael Weyrich*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SDVDiag is an automated diagnosis platform for connected vehicles, enabling dynamic root cause analysis and reducing downtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High reliability needs of connected vehicles make manual failure diagnosis impractical; an automated solution is required.

Method: SDVDiag uses pipelines for data collection, anomaly detection, and dynamic graph-based root cause analysis.

Result: In a 5G test fleet, SDVDiag reliably detected faults, offering early problem identification.

Conclusion: SDVDiag enhances troubleshooting efficiency and reduces downtime in connected vehicle systems.

Abstract: Connected and software-defined vehicles promise to offer a broad range of
services and advanced functions to customers, aiming to increase passenger
comfort and support autonomous driving capabilities. Due to the high
reliability and availability requirements of connected vehicles, it is crucial
to resolve any occurring failures quickly. To achieve this however, a complex
cloud/edge architecture with a mesh of dependencies must be navigated to
diagnose the responsible root cause. As such, manual analyses become unfeasible
since they would significantly delay the troubleshooting.
  To address this challenge, this paper presents SDVDiag, an extensible
platform for the automated diagnosis of connected vehicle functions. The
platform enables the creation of pipelines that cover all steps from initial
data collection to the tracing of potential root causes. In addition, SDVDiag
supports self-adaptive behavior by the ability to exchange modules at runtime.
Dependencies between functions are detected and continuously updated, resulting
in a dynamic graph view of the system. In addition, vital system metrics are
monitored for anomalies. Whenever an incident is investigated, a snapshot of
the graph is taken and augmented by relevant anomalies. Finally, the analysis
is performed by traversing the graph and creating a ranking of the most likely
causes.
  To evaluate the platform, it is deployed inside an 5G test fleet environment
for connected vehicle functions. The results show that injected faults can be
detected reliably. As such, the platform offers the potential to gain new
insights and reduce downtime by identifying problems and their causes at an
early stage.

### [201] [An Explainable Equity-Aware P2P Energy Trading Framework for Socio-Economically Diverse Microgrid](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18738)
*Abhijan Theja,Mayukha Pal*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: A novel framework combines MILP, game theory, and RL for fair energy allocation in microgrids, reducing peak demand by 72.6% and improving equity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing inequities in energy allocation for socio-economically diverse communities, as static methods fail to adapt.

Method: Integrates MILP, cooperative game theory, and RL (PPO) for dynamic equity adjustment, with XAI for transparency.

Result: Achieves 72.6% peak demand reduction, lowers Gini coefficient, and ensures fair energy access.

Conclusion: The framework offers a sustainable and equitable solution for community microgrids.

Abstract: Fair and dynamic energy allocation in community microgrids remains a critical
challenge, particularly when serving socio-economically diverse participants.
Static optimization and cost-sharing methods often fail to adapt to evolving
inequities, leading to participant dissatisfaction and unsustainable
cooperation. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates
multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), cooperative game
theory, and a dynamic equity-adjustment mechanism driven by reinforcement
learning (RL). At its core, the framework utilizes a bi-level optimization
model grounded in Equity-regarding Welfare Maximization (EqWM) principles,
which incorporate Rawlsian fairness to prioritize the welfare of the least
advantaged participants. We introduce a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
agent that dynamically adjusts socio-economic weights in the optimization
objective based on observed inequities in cost and renewable energy access.
This RL-powered feedback loop enables the system to learn and adapt,
continuously striving for a more equitable state. To ensure transparency,
Explainable AI (XAI) is used to interpret the benefit allocations derived from
a weighted Shapley value. Validated across six realistic scenarios, the
framework demonstrates peak demand reductions of up to 72.6%, and significant
cooperative gains. The adaptive RL mechanism further reduces the Gini
coefficient over time, showcasing a pathway to truly sustainable and fair
energy communities.

### [202] [Relaxed Total Generalized Variation Regularized Piecewise Smooth Mumford-Shah Model for Triangulated Surface Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19284)
*Huayan Zhang,Shanqiang Wang,Xiaochao Wang*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel piecewise smooth Mumford-Shah (MS) mesh segmentation model using relaxed total generalized variation (rTGV) regularization, improving boundary accuracy over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MS models focus on piecewise constant segmentation with total variation, prioritizing shortest boundaries. The authors aim to enhance segmentation for irregular structures by incorporating smoothness and high-order discontinuity.

Method: The proposed model approximates mesh features as the sum of piecewise constant and smooth functions, using rTGV for regularization. It is solved via alternating minimization and ADMM.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on the Princeton Segmentation Benchmark, yielding better boundaries and lower quantitative errors with efficient computation.

Conclusion: The rTGV-based MS model is robust and efficient, offering superior segmentation for irregular structures compared to existing methods.

Abstract: The Mumford-Shah (MS) model is an important technique for mesh segmentation.
Many existing researches focus on piecewise constant MS mesh segmentation model
with total variation regularization, which pursue the shortest length of
boundaries. Different from previous efforts, in this article, we propose a
novel piecewise smooth MS mesh segmentation model by utilizing the relaxed
total generalized variation regularization (rTGV). The new model assumes that
the feature function of a mesh can be approximated by the sum of piecewise
constant function and asmooth function, and the rTGV regularization is able to
characterize the high order discontinuity of the geometric structure. The newly
introduced method is effective in segmenting meshes with irregular structures
and getting the better boundaries rather than the shortest boundaries. We solve
the new model by alternating minimization and alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM). Our algorithm is discussed from several aspects, and
comparisons with several state-of-art methods. Experimental results show that
our method can yield competitive results when compared to other approaches. In
addition, our results compare favorably to those of the several state-of-art
techniques when evaluated on the Princeton Segmentation Benchmark. Furthermore,
the quantitative errors and computational costs confirm the robustness and
efficiency of the proposed method.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pneumonia is a leading cause of child mortality, necessitating fast and accurate diagnostic tools.

Result: Achieves 95.94% accuracy, 98.91% AUC-ROC, and 0.913 Cohen's Kappa, with interpretable visual explanations.

Conclusion: High performance and interpretability are achievable and critical for clinical AI deployment.

Abstract: Pneumonia remains one of the leading causes of death among children
worldwide, underscoring a critical need for fast and accurate diagnostic tools.
In this paper, we propose an interpretable deep learning model on Residual
Networks (ResNets) for automatically diagnosing paediatric pneumonia on chest
X-rays. We enhance interpretability through Bayesian Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping (BayesGrad-CAM), which quantifies uncertainty in visual
explanations, and which offers spatial locations accountable for the
decision-making process of the model. Our ResNet-50 model, trained on a large
paediatric chest X-rays dataset, achieves high classification accuracy
(95.94%), AUC-ROC (98.91%), and Cohen's Kappa (0.913), accompanied by
clinically meaningful visual explanations. Our findings demonstrate that high
performance and interpretability are not only achievable but critical for
clinical AI deployment.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a self-supervised autoencoder to improve single-pixel imaging in fluorescence microscopy, achieving faster reconstruction, better quality, and multispectral capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods like total variation minimization are limited in speed and quality for single-pixel imaging. Leveraging learned measurement vectors and reconstruction can enhance performance.

Method: An autoencoder is trained via self-supervision to learn an encoder (measurement matrix) and decoder, tested on physically acquired multispectral and intensity data.

Result: The approach reduces reconstruction time by two orders of magnitude, improves image quality, and enables multispectral reconstructions.

Conclusion: Learned single-pixel fluorescence microscopy could revolutionize diagnosis and biological research by offering cost-effective multispectral imaging.

Abstract: Single-pixel imaging has emerged as a key technique in fluorescence
microscopy, where fast acquisition and reconstruction are crucial. In this
context, images are reconstructed from linearly compressed measurements. In
practice, total variation minimisation is still used to reconstruct the image
from noisy measurements of the inner product between orthogonal sampling
pattern vectors and the original image data. However, data can be leveraged to
learn the measurement vectors and the reconstruction process, thereby enhancing
compression, reconstruction quality, and speed. We train an autoencoder through
self-supervision to learn an encoder (or measurement matrix) and a decoder. We
then test it on physically acquired multispectral and intensity data. During
acquisition, the learned encoder becomes part of the physical device. Our
approach can enhance single-pixel imaging in fluorescence microscopy by
reducing reconstruction time by two orders of magnitude, achieving superior
image quality, and enabling multispectral reconstructions. Ultimately, learned
single-pixel fluorescence microscopy could advance diagnosis and biological
research, providing multispectral imaging at a fraction of the cost.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A diffusion model (RealDeal) enhances realism and details in brain MRI images by adding sharp edges, textures, and noise, improving upon overly smooth outputs from latent diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent diffusion models generate overly smooth brain MRIs, lacking fine anatomical details and realistic noise. RealDeal aims to address this gap.

Method: Image-to-image diffusion models refine LDM outputs by adding realism-enhancing details. Metrics like FID, LPIPS, and new ones for noise, sharpness, and texture are used.

Result: RealDeal improves image realism, demonstrated by enhanced sharpness, texture, and noise distribution in generated brain MRIs.

Conclusion: RealDeal effectively bridges the realism gap in LDM-generated brain images, offering more detailed and realistic outputs.

Abstract: We propose image-to-image diffusion models that are designed to enhance the
realism and details of generated brain images by introducing sharp edges, fine
textures, subtle anatomical features, and imaging noise. Generative models have
been widely adopted in the biomedical domain, especially in image generation
applications. Latent diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art results in
generating brain MRIs. However, due to latent compression, generated images
from these models are overly smooth, lacking fine anatomical structures and
scan acquisition noise that are typically seen in real images. This work
formulates the realism enhancing and detail adding process as image-to-image
diffusion models, which refines the quality of LDM-generated images. We employ
commonly used metrics like FID and LPIPS for image realism assessment.
Furthermore, we introduce new metrics to demonstrate the realism of images
generated by RealDeal in terms of image noise distribution, sharpness, and
texture.

*Vangelis Kostoulas,Arthur Guijt,Ellen M. Kerkhof,Bradley R. Pieters,Peter A. N. Bosman,Tanja Alderliesten*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes adaptations to post-processing techniques in brachytherapy needle reconstruction to handle segmentation errors, improving accuracy significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual needle annotation in brachytherapy is time-consuming and challenging, and existing post-processing methods lack robustness against segmentation errors.

Method: A two-stage pipeline (segmentation + post-processing) is adapted to better handle segmentation errors, tested on MRI scans of prostate cancer patients.

Result: Adapted techniques achieved median errors of 1.07 mm (needle-tip) and 0.43 mm (needle-bottom), with 0 false positives/negatives on 261 test needles.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptations effectively manage segmentation errors, enhancing reconstruction accuracy in brachytherapy.

Abstract: Brachytherapy involves bringing a radioactive source near tumor tissue using
implanted needles. Image-guided brachytherapy planning requires amongst others,
the reconstruction of the needles. Manually annotating these needles on patient
images can be a challenging and time-consuming task for medical professionals.
For automatic needle reconstruction, a two-stage pipeline is commonly adopted,
comprising a segmentation stage followed by a post-processing stage. While deep
learning models are effective for segmentation, their results often contain
errors. No currently existing post-processing technique is robust to all
possible segmentation errors. We therefore propose adaptations to existing
post-processing techniques mainly aimed at dealing with segmentation errors and
thereby improving the reconstruction accuracy. Experiments on a prostate cancer
dataset, based on MRI scans annotated by medical professionals, demonstrate
that our proposed adaptations can help to effectively manage segmentation
errors, with the best adapted post-processing technique achieving median
needle-tip and needle-bottom point localization errors of $1.07$ (IQR $\pm
1.04$) mm and $0.43$ (IQR $\pm 0.46$) mm, respectively, and median shaft error
of $0.75$ (IQR $\pm 0.69$) mm with 0 false positive and 0 false negative
needles on a test set of 261 needles.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A Dual-Pathway Learning (DPL) model is introduced to denoise medical images by combining noise and contextual information, outperforming UNet by 3.35% PSNR on Gaussian noise across multiple modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noise in medical imaging degrades quality, risking misdiagnosis. Existing methods are limited to single modalities or noise types.

Method: DPL integrates noise and context via a dual-pathway architecture, evaluated on multiple modalities and noise types.

Result: DPL improves PSNR by 3.35% over UNet on Gaussian noise, showing robustness across modalities.

Conclusion: DPL is a versatile and effective denoising solution for medical imaging, generalizing well across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Medical imaging plays a critical role in modern healthcare, enabling
clinicians to accurately diagnose diseases and develop effective treatment
plans. However, noise, often introduced by imaging devices, can degrade image
quality, leading to misinterpretation and compromised clinical outcomes.
Existing denoising approaches typically rely either on noise characteristics or
on contextual information from the image. Moreover, they are commonly developed
and evaluated for a single imaging modality and noise type. Motivated by Geng
et.al CNCL, which integrates both noise and context, this study introduces a
Dual-Pathway Learning (DPL) model architecture that effectively denoises
medical images by leveraging both sources of information and fusing them to
generate the final output. DPL is evaluated across multiple imaging modalities
and various types of noise, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.
DPL improves PSNR by 3.35% compared to the baseline UNet when evaluated on
Gaussian noise and trained across all modalities. The code is available at

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A semi-supervised method (Semi2) improves pulmonary vessel segmentation in COPD patients by 2.3%, achieving 90.3% precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation of pulmonary vessels, especially smaller ones, is crucial for COPD analysis.

Method: A teacher-student model is used: a teacher generates pseudo-labels for unlabeled CT scans, and a student is trained on reliable pseudo-labels iteratively.

Result: The method achieves 90.3% precision in vessel segmentation and provides insights into COPD severity.

Conclusion: Semi2 enhances segmentation performance and is applicable for COPD analysis.

Abstract: Background: It is fundamental for accurate segmentation and quantification of
the pulmonary vessel, particularly smaller vessels, from computed tomography
(CT) images in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients.
Objective: The aim of this study was to segment the pulmonary vasculature using
a semi-supervised method. Methods: In this study, a self-training framework is
proposed by leveraging a teacher-student model for the segmentation of
pulmonary vessels. First, the high-quality annotations are acquired in the
in-house data by an interactive way. Then, the model is trained in the
semi-supervised way. A fully supervised model is trained on a small set of
labeled CT images, yielding the teacher model. Following this, the teacher
model is used to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled CT images, from which
reliable ones are selected based on a certain strategy. The training of the
student model involves these reliable pseudo-labels. This training process is
iteratively repeated until an optimal performance is achieved. Results:
Extensive experiments are performed on non-enhanced CT scans of 125 COPD
patients. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that the proposed
method, Semi2, significantly improves the precision of vessel segmentation by
2.3%, achieving a precision of 90.3%. Further, quantitative analysis is
conducted in the pulmonary vessel of COPD, providing insights into the
differences in the pulmonary vessel across different severity of the disease.
Conclusion: The proposed method can not only improve the performance of
pulmonary vascular segmentation, but can also be applied in COPD analysis. The
code will be made available at

### [209] [Learned Image Compression with Hierarchical Progressive Context Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19125)
*Yuqi Li,Haotian Zhang,Li Li,Dong Liu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel Hierarchical Progressive Context Model (HPCM) improves image compression by efficiently modeling long-range dependencies and diverse context information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with efficiently exploiting long-range dependency and diverse context information in image compression.

Method: HPCM uses a hierarchical coding schedule for multi-scale latent dependencies and a progressive context fusion mechanism to incorporate past coding step information.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance with balanced computational complexity.

Conclusion: HPCM effectively enhances context modeling in image compression, offering superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Context modeling is essential in learned image compression for accurately
estimating the distribution of latents. While recent advanced methods have
expanded context modeling capacity, they still struggle to efficiently exploit
long-range dependency and diverse context information across different coding
steps. In this paper, we introduce a novel Hierarchical Progressive Context
Model (HPCM) for more efficient context information acquisition. Specifically,
HPCM employs a hierarchical coding schedule to sequentially model the
contextual dependencies among latents at multiple scales, which enables more
efficient long-range context modeling. Furthermore, we propose a progressive
context fusion mechanism that incorporates contextual information from previous
coding steps into the current step, effectively exploiting diverse contextual
information. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance and strikes a better balance
between compression performance and computational complexity. The code is

*Niklas Bubeck,Yundi Zhang,Suprosanna Shit,Daniel Rueckert,Jiazhen Pan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes generative models in medical imaging, comparing latent diffusion and autoregressive models for reconstruction and generation tasks, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how generative models balance reconstruction (data fidelity) and generation (perceptual quality) in medical imaging.

Method: Introduces a 'generative model zoo' and benchmarks models on cardiac imaging tasks like inpainting and unconditional generation.

Result: Diffusion models excel in perceptual quality for generation but hallucinate with high masking; autoregressive models are stable but less faithful.

Conclusion: The trade-offs between diffusion and autoregressive models inform task-specific choices in medical imaging.

Abstract: In medical imaging, generative models are increasingly relied upon for two
distinct but equally critical tasks: reconstruction, where the goal is to
restore medical imaging (usually inverse problems like inpainting or
superresolution), and generation, where synthetic data is created to augment
datasets or carry out counterfactual analysis. Despite shared architecture and
learning frameworks, they prioritize different goals: generation seeks high
perceptual quality and diversity, while reconstruction focuses on data fidelity
and faithfulness. In this work, we introduce a "generative model zoo" and
systematically analyze how modern latent diffusion models and autoregressive
models navigate the reconstruction-generation spectrum. We benchmark a suite of
generative models across representative cardiac medical imaging tasks, focusing
on image inpainting with varying masking ratios and sampling strategies, as
well as unconditional image generation. Our findings show that diffusion models
offer superior perceptual quality for unconditional generation but tend to
hallucinate as masking ratios increase, whereas autoregressive models maintain
stable perceptual performance across masking levels, albeit with generally
lower fidelity.

*Xin Li,Kaixiang Yang,Qiang Li,Zhiwei Wang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: GCDM is a novel framework for synthesizing mammograms and localized lesions using a gated conditional diffusion model, improving realism and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations in mammogram synthesis due to insufficient data and lack of lesion diversity.

Method: Uses a latent denoising diffusion framework with soft mask embeddings and a gated conditioning branch for lesion-specific features.

Result: Achieves precise control over lesion areas and enhances realism in synthesized mammograms.

Conclusion: GCDM is a promising tool for clinical mammogram synthesis.

Abstract: Mammography is the most commonly used imaging modality for breast cancer
screening, driving an increasing demand for deep-learning techniques to support
large-scale analysis. However, the development of accurate and robust methods
is often limited by insufficient data availability and a lack of diversity in
lesion characteristics. While generative models offer a promising solution for
data synthesis, current approaches often fail to adequately emphasize
lesion-specific features and their relationships with surrounding tissues. In
this paper, we propose Gated Conditional Diffusion Model (GCDM), a novel
framework designed to jointly synthesize holistic mammogram images and
localized lesions. GCDM is built upon a latent denoising diffusion framework,
where the noised latent image is concatenated with a soft mask embedding that
represents breast, lesion, and their transitional regions, ensuring anatomical
coherence between them during the denoising process. To further emphasize
lesion-specific features, GCDM incorporates a gated conditioning branch that
guides the denoising process by dynamically selecting and fusing the most
relevant radiomic and geometric properties of lesions, effectively capturing
their interplay. Experimental results demonstrate that GCDM achieves precise
control over small lesion areas while enhancing the realism and diversity of
synthesized mammograms. These advancements position GCDM as a promising tool
for clinical applications in mammogram synthesis. Our code is available at

*Abdul Hannan,Zahid Mahmood,Rizwan Qureshi,Hazrat Ali*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an attention mechanism-based deep learning model combining GAB and CAB to address imbalanced data in DR classification, achieving competitive accuracy on APTOS and EYEPACS datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imbalanced data distribution in DR datasets hinders the generalization of deep learning models, necessitating a solution for better classification.

Method: The model integrates GAB and CAB into a deep learning framework using MobileNetV3-small, EfficientNet-b0, and DenseNet-169 as backbones, evaluated on APTOS and EYEPACS datasets.

Result: DenseNet-169 achieved 83.20% accuracy on APTOS, while EfficientNet-b0 led with 80% on EYEPACS. MobileNetV3-small showed lower parameter counts, enhancing efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses data imbalance in DR classification, achieving performance comparable to recent works.

Abstract: Automatic classification of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) can assist
ophthalmologists in devising personalized treatment plans, making it a critical
component of clinical practice. However, imbalanced data distribution in the
dataset becomes a bottleneck in the generalization of deep learning models
trained for DR classification. In this work, we combine global attention block
(GAB) and category attention block (CAB) into the deep learning model, thus
effectively overcoming the imbalanced data distribution problem in DR
classification. Our proposed approach is based on an attention mechanism-based
deep learning model that employs three pre-trained networks, namely,
MobileNetV3-small, Efficientnet-b0, and DenseNet-169 as the backbone
architecture. We evaluate the proposed method on two publicly available
datasets of retinal fundoscopy images for DR. Experimental results show that on
the APTOS dataset, the DenseNet-169 yielded 83.20% mean accuracy, followed by
the MobileNetV3-small and EfficientNet-b0, which yielded 82% and 80%
accuracies, respectively. On the EYEPACS dataset, the EfficientNet-b0 yielded a
mean accuracy of 80%, while the DenseNet-169 and MobileNetV3-small yielded
75.43% and 76.68% accuracies, respectively. In addition, we also compute the
F1-score of 82.0%, precision of 82.1%, sensitivity of 83.0%, specificity of
95.5%, and a kappa score of 88.2% for the experiments. Moreover, in our work,
the MobileNetV3-small has 1.6 million parameters on the APTOS dataset and 0.90
million parameters on the EYEPACS dataset, which is comparatively less than
other methods. The proposed approach achieves competitive performance that is
at par with recently reported works on DR classification.

*Niels Rocholl,Ewoud Smit,Mathias Prokop,Alessa Hering*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the ULS23 segmentation model for longitudinal lesion tracking, revealing its failure due to registration errors and lesion displacement, advocating for integrated temporal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the ULS23 model's performance in longitudinal lesion segmentation and identify its limitations in temporal consistency.

Method: Used a public clinical dataset of baseline and follow-up CT scans, tested segmentation and tracking, and conducted a controlled experiment with displaced lesions.

Result: The model's segmentation accuracy collapses with displaced lesions, highlighting its reliance on centered lesions and failure in longitudinal contexts.

Conclusion: Robust longitudinal lesion tracking requires end-to-end models designed for temporal analysis, not cascaded single-timepoint tools.

Abstract: Longitudinal lesion analysis is crucial for oncological care, yet automated
tools often struggle with temporal consistency. While universal lesion
segmentation models have advanced, they are typically designed for single time
points. This paper investigates the performance of the ULS23 segmentation model
in a longitudinal context. Using a public clinical dataset of baseline and
follow-up CT scans, we evaluated the model's ability to segment and track
lesions over time. We identified two critical, interconnected failure modes: a
sharp degradation in segmentation quality in follow-up cases due to inter-scan
registration errors, and a subsequent breakdown of the lesion correspondence
process. To systematically probe this vulnerability, we conducted a controlled
experiment where we artificially displaced the input volume relative to the
true lesion center. Our results demonstrate that the model's performance is
highly dependent on its assumption of a centered lesion; segmentation accuracy
collapses when the lesion is sufficiently displaced. These findings reveal a
fundamental limitation of applying single-timepoint models to longitudinal
data. We conclude that robust oncological tracking requires a paradigm shift
away from cascading single-purpose tools towards integrated, end-to-end models
inherently designed for temporal analysis.

*Kirsten W. H. Maas,Danny Ruijters,Nicola Pezzotti,Anna Vilanova*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: NerT-CA is a hybrid method combining neural and tensorial representations for faster and more accurate 4D coronary artery reconstruction from sparse X-ray angiograms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for 3D/4D coronary artery reconstruction are slow or error-prone, limiting clinical use. NerT-CA aims to address these challenges.

Method: Uses a hybrid approach: tensorial fields for static low-rank reconstruction and neural fields for dynamic sparse reconstruction.

Result: Outperforms prior methods in speed and accuracy, achieving reasonable reconstructions from just three views.

Conclusion: NerT-CA offers a promising solution for efficient and accurate 4D coronary artery reconstruction in clinical settings.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) and dynamic 3D+time (4D) reconstruction of coronary
arteries from X-ray coronary angiography (CA) has the potential to improve
clinical procedures. However, there are multiple challenges to be addressed,
most notably, blood-vessel structure sparsity, poor background and blood vessel
distinction, sparse-views, and intra-scan motion. State-of-the-art
reconstruction approaches rely on time-consuming manual or error-prone
automatic segmentations, limiting clinical usability. Recently, approaches
based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown promise for automatic
reconstructions in the sparse-view setting. However, they suffer from long
training times due to their dependence on MLP-based representations. We propose
NerT-CA, a hybrid approach of Neural and Tensorial representations for
accelerated 4D reconstructions with sparse-view CA. Building on top of the
previous NeRF-based work, we model the CA scene as a decomposition of low-rank
and sparse components, utilizing fast tensorial fields for low-rank static
reconstruction and neural fields for dynamic sparse reconstruction. Our
approach outperforms previous works in both training time and reconstruction
accuracy, yielding reasonable reconstructions from as few as three angiogram
views. We validate our approach quantitatively and qualitatively on
representative 4D phantom datasets.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: RealisVSR introduces a high-frequency detail-enhanced video diffusion model to address challenges in Video Super-Resolution (VSR), featuring innovations like CPC architecture, HR-Loss, and a 4K benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome inconsistent temporal dynamics modeling, limited high-frequency detail recovery, and inadequate evaluation of 4K super-resolution in current VSR methods.

Method: Proposes RealisVSR with CPC architecture, HR-Loss for texture restoration, and introduces RealisVideo-4K benchmark.

Result: Achieves superior performance on VSR benchmarks, especially in ultra-high-resolution scenarios, with reduced training data.

Conclusion: RealisVSR effectively addresses key VSR challenges and advances the field with its innovations and benchmark.

Abstract: Video Super-Resolution (VSR) has achieved significant progress through
diffusion models, effectively addressing the over-smoothing issues inherent in
GAN-based methods. Despite recent advances, three critical challenges persist
in VSR community: 1) Inconsistent modeling of temporal dynamics in foundational
models; 2) limited high-frequency detail recovery under complex real-world
degradations; and 3) insufficient evaluation of detail enhancement and 4K
super-resolution, as current methods primarily rely on 720P datasets with
inadequate details. To address these challenges, we propose RealisVSR, a
high-frequency detail-enhanced video diffusion model with three core
innovations: 1) Consistency Preserved ControlNet (CPC) architecture integrated
with the Wan2.1 video diffusion to model the smooth and complex motions and
suppress artifacts; 2) High-Frequency Rectified Diffusion Loss (HR-Loss)
combining wavelet decomposition and HOG feature constraints for texture
restoration; 3) RealisVideo-4K, the first public 4K VSR benchmark containing
1,000 high-definition video-text pairs. Leveraging the advanced spatio-temporal
guidance of Wan2.1, our method requires only 5-25% of the training data volume
compared to existing approaches. Extensive experiments on VSR benchmarks (REDS,
SPMCS, UDM10, YouTube-HQ, VideoLQ, RealisVideo-720P) demonstrate our
superiority, particularly in ultra-high-resolution scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the MICCAI CMRxMotion challenge, addressing the underexplored problem of deep learning robustness against motion artifacts in Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) images. It provides a curated dataset and evaluates 22 algorithms for image quality assessment and myocardial segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for CMR analysis rely on high-quality images, but motion artifacts degrade clinical CMR acquisitions. The challenge aims to explore model robustness against such artifacts.

Method: A dataset of 320 CMR cine series from 40 volunteers was curated, inducing controlled motion artifacts. The challenge included tasks for image quality classification and robust segmentation.

Result: 22 algorithms were evaluated, with top-performing methods reported. The impact of artifacts on clinical biomarkers was also investigated.

Conclusion: The challenge promotes research in artifact-robust CMR analysis, with all resources made publicly available.

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in automated
Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) analysis. However, the efficacy of these
models is highly dependent on the availability of high-quality, artifact-free
images. In clinical practice, CMR acquisitions are frequently degraded by
respiratory motion, yet the robustness of deep learning models against such
artifacts remains an underexplored problem. To promote research in this domain,
we organized the MICCAI CMRxMotion challenge. We curated and publicly released
a dataset of 320 CMR cine series from 40 healthy volunteers who performed
specific breathing protocols to induce a controlled spectrum of motion
artifacts. The challenge comprised two tasks: 1) automated image quality
assessment to classify images based on motion severity, and 2) robust
myocardial segmentation in the presence of motion artifacts. A total of 22
algorithms were submitted and evaluated on the two designated tasks. This paper
presents a comprehensive overview of the challenge design and dataset, reports
the evaluation results for the top-performing methods, and further investigates
the impact of motion artifacts on five clinically relevant biomarkers. All

Conclusion: Prior knowledge and prompt diversity enhance segmentation accuracy. SAM2-Aug is a robust, efficient solution for ART tumor segmentation.

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate tumor segmentation is vital for adaptive radiation therapy

(SAM2) shows promise for prompt-based segmentation but struggles with tumor
accuracy. We propose prior knowledge-based augmentation strategies to enhance
SAM2 for ART.

images and annotations as contextual inputs, and (2) improving prompt
robustness via random bounding box expansion and mask erosion/dilation. The
resulting model, SAM2-Aug, was fine-tuned and tested on the One-Seq-Liver
dataset (115 MRIs from 31 liver cancer patients), and evaluated without
retraining on Mix-Seq-Abdomen (88 MRIs, 28 patients) and Mix-Seq-Brain (86
MRIs, 37 patients).
  Results: SAM2-Aug outperformed convolutional, transformer-based, and
prompt-driven models across all datasets, achieving Dice scores of 0.86(liver),
0.89(abdomen), and 0.90(brain). It demonstrated strong generalization across

*Maria Zaitseva,Ivan Tomilov,Natalia Gusarova*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'gradient dropout' to improve feed-forward neural networks' noise robustness by selectively nullifying hidden layer gradients during backpropagation, framed as a multi-agent game. Combined with target noising, it shows promising results, especially in regression tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs) are sensitive to input noise, and existing regularization methods often alter architecture or ignore neuron interactions. This study aims to enhance robustness by innovating backpropagation and exploring noising techniques.

Method: The study modifies backpropagation as a multi-agent game, introducing 'gradient dropout' to selectively nullify hidden layer gradients. It also experiments with perturbing target variables using white noise or stable distributions.

Result: Experiments on diverse datasets show mixed impacts, with significant robustness improvements in regression tasks when combining gradient dropout (p=0.9) and stable distribution noising, evidenced by flatter MSE curves and stable SMAPE values.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates potential for enhancing FFNN robustness, emphasizes adaptive parameter tuning, and suggests new avenues for analyzing neural networks as complex adaptive systems within game theory.

Abstract: Feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs) are vulnerable to input noise, reducing
prediction performance. Existing regularization methods like dropout often
alter network architecture or overlook neuron interactions. This study aims to
enhance FFNN noise robustness by modifying backpropagation, interpreted as a
multi-agent game, and exploring controlled target variable noising. Our
"gradient dropout" selectively nullifies hidden layer neuron gradients with
probability 1 - p during backpropagation, while keeping forward passes active.
This is framed within compositional game theory. Additionally, target variables
were perturbed with white noise or stable distributions. Experiments on ten
diverse tabular datasets show varying impacts: improvement or diminishing of
robustness and accuracy, depending on dataset and hyperparameters. Notably, on
regression tasks, gradient dropout (p = 0.9) combined with stable distribution
target noising significantly increased input noise robustness, evidenced by
flatter MSE curves and more stable SMAPE values. These results highlight the
method's potential, underscore the critical role of adaptive parameter tuning,
and open new avenues for analyzing neural networks as complex adaptive systems
exhibiting emergent behavior within a game-theoretic framework.

*Yiwen Guan,Viet Anh Trinh,Vivek Voleti,Jacob Whitehill*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper explores how multi-modal input improves ASR accuracy in noisy environments, identifying conditions and architectures for optimal performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how multiple modalities (speech, text, images) can enhance ASR accuracy under varying noise levels.

Method: Experiments on synthetic and real-world data, analyzing the impact of synchronized/unsynchronized modalities, visual quality, and model architectures (Mamba vs. Transformers).

Result: More modalities generally improve ASR, with synchronized modalities aiding high noise and unsynchronized helping moderate noise. Visual quality and input order/weights also significantly affect accuracy.

Conclusion: The study provides practical insights and advances understanding of multi-modal ASR in noisy conditions, emphasizing the need for better visual encoders.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have opened new
possibilities for unified modeling of speech, text, images, and other
modalities. Building on our prior work, this paper examines the conditions and
model architectures under which multiple input modalities can improve automatic
speech recognition (ASR) accuracy in noisy environments. Through experiments on
synthetic and real-world data, we find that (1) harnessing more modalities
usually improves ASR accuracy, as each modality provides complementary
information, but the improvement depends on the amount of auditory noise. (2)
Synchronized modalities (e.g., lip movements) are more useful at high noise
levels whereas unsynchronized modalities (e.g., image context) are most helpful
at moderate noise levels. (3) Higher-quality visual representations
consistently improve ASR accuracy, highlighting the importance of developing
more powerful visual encoders. (4) Mamba exhibits similar trends regarding the
benefits of multimodality as do Transformers. (5) The input order of modalities
as well as their weights in the loss function can significantly impact
accuracy. These findings both offer practical insights and help to deepen our
understanding of multi-modal speech recognition under challenging conditions.

Result: Produces audio with the target's structure and source's timbre, avoiding discontinuities through implicit interpolation.

Conclusion: The technique is effective, requires no training, and works with diverse audio, offering a practical tool for creative resynthesis.

Abstract: We introduce a novel technique for creative audio resynthesis that operates
by reworking the concept of granular synthesis at the latent vector level. Our
approach creates a "granular codebook" by encoding a source audio corpus into
latent vector segments, then matches each latent grain of a target audio signal
to its closest counterpart in the codebook. The resulting hybrid sequence is
decoded to produce audio that preserves the target's temporal structure while
adopting the source's timbral characteristics. This technique requires no model
training, works with diverse audio materials, and naturally avoids the
discontinuities typical of traditional concatenative synthesis through the
codec's implicit interpolation during decoding. We include supplementary
material at https://github.com/naotokui/latentgranular/ , as well as a
proof-of-concept implementation to allow users to experiment with their own
sounds at https://huggingface.co/spaces/naotokui/latentgranular .

*Fang Kang,Yin Cao,Haoyu Chen*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces Face2VoiceSync, a framework for generating talking face animations and corresponding speeches from a face image and text, addressing limitations of fixed-driven speech methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of fixed-driven speech in talking face generation, such as face-voice mismatch, and extend the task to a more challenging setting involving both animation and speech generation.

Method: Proposes Face2VoiceSync with Voice-Face Alignment, Diversity & Manipulation, Efficient Training using a lightweight VAE, and a new evaluation metric.

Result: Face2VoiceSync achieves state-of-the-art performance in both visual and audio generation on a single 40GB GPU.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the challenges of face-voice mismatch and enables diverse, controlled voice generation with efficient training.

Abstract: Recent studies in speech-driven talking face generation achieve promising
results, but their reliance on fixed-driven speech limits further applications
(e.g., face-voice mismatch). Thus, we extend the task to a more challenging
setting: given a face image and text to speak, generating both talking face
animation and its corresponding speeches. Accordingly, we propose a novel
framework, Face2VoiceSync, with several novel contributions: 1) Voice-Face
Alignment, ensuring generated voices match facial appearance; 2) Diversity \&
Manipulation, enabling generated voice control over paralinguistic features
space; 3) Efficient Training, using a lightweight VAE to bridge visual and
audio large-pretrained models, with significantly fewer trainable parameters
than existing methods; 4) New Evaluation Metric, fairly assessing the diversity
and identity consistency. Experiments show Face2VoiceSync achieves both visual
and audio state-of-the-art performances on a single 40GB GPU.

### [224] [Optimizing Metachronal Paddling with Reinforcement Learning at Low Reynolds Number](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18849)
*Alana A. Bailey,Robert D. Guy*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: The study uses reinforcement learning to explore metachronal paddling in swimmers at zero Reynolds number, finding that paddle spacing influences coordination patterns, with back-to-front waves being most efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if metachronal rhythm is optimal for swimming performance and whether reinforcement learning selects it or other patterns.

Method: Applied reinforcement learning to a swimmer model with inflexible paddles at zero Reynolds number, varying paddle spacing.

Result: Tight spacings produced back-to-front metachronal waves, while wide spacings led to different patterns. Back-to-front waves were most efficient.

Conclusion: Metachronal rhythm is efficient, but coordination patterns vary with paddle spacing, suggesting adaptability in swimming strategies.

Abstract: Metachronal paddling is a swimming strategy in which an organism oscillates
sets of adjacent limbs with a constant phase lag, propagating a metachronal
wave through its limbs and propelling it forward. This limb coordination
strategy is utilized by swimmers across a wide range of Reynolds numbers, which
suggests that this metachronal rhythm was selected for its optimality of
swimming performance. In this study, we apply reinforcement learning to a
swimmer at zero Reynolds number and investigate whether the learning algorithm
selects this metachronal rhythm, or if other coordination patterns emerge. We
design the swimmer agent with an elongated body and pairs of straight,
inflexible paddles placed along the body for various fixed paddle spacings.
Based on paddle spacing, the swimmer agent learns qualitatively different
coordination patterns. At tight spacings, a back-to-front metachronal wave-like
stroke emerges which resembles the commonly observed biological rhythm, but at
wide spacings, different limb coordinations are selected. Across all resulting
strokes, the fastest stroke is dependent on the number of paddles, however, the
most efficient stroke is a back-to-front wave-like stroke regardless of the
number of paddles.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The study analyzes negativity in political and non-political news posts on Facebook across six countries, finding negative posts are less common (12.6%) and receive less engagement. U.S. political news is less negative than other countries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compare the prevalence and engagement of negative political and non-political news on social media, addressing a gap in existing research.

Method: Used 6,081,134 Facebook posts from 97 media organizations in six countries (2020-2024), developing multilingual classifiers to label posts as (non-)political and (non-)negative.

Result: Negative posts are 12.6% of total; political and non-political posts are equally negative; U.S. political news is 40% less negative; negative posts get 15% fewer likes and 13% fewer comments; 10.2%-13.1% of engagement is with negative posts.

Conclusion: Negative news posts are less common and less engaging, with U.S. political news being notably less negative. Only a small fraction of engagement is linked to negative content.

Abstract: Although news negativity is often studied, missing is comparative evidence on
the prevalence of and engagement with negative political and non-political news
posts on social media. We use 6,081,134 Facebook posts published between
January 1, 2020, and April 1, 2024, by 97 media organizations in six countries
(U.S., UK, Ireland, Poland, France, Spain) and develop two multilingual
classifiers for labeling posts as (non-)political and (non-)negative. We show
that: (1) negative news posts constitute a relatively small fraction (12.6%);
(2) political news posts are neither more nor less negative than non-political
news posts; (3) U.S. political news posts are less negative relative to the
other countries on average (40% lower odds); (4) Negative news posts get 15%
fewer likes and 13% fewer comments than non-negative news posts. Lastly, (5) we
provide estimates of the proportion of the total volume of user engagement with
negative news posts and show that only between 10.2% to 13.1% of engagement is
linked to negative posts by the analyzed news organizations.

TL;DR: The study uses network analysis to model eye-gaze scanpaths in dentistry students diagnosing radiographs, finding correlations between network metrics and performance, suggesting developmental shifts in visual expertise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how novices develop visual search skills and optimize training methods, particularly in dentistry.

Method: Network analysis of eye-gaze scanpaths as directed graphs, examining changes in metrics over time and clustering patterns to associate with diagnostic performance.

Result: Transition entropy negatively correlates with performance, while nodes, edges, and average PageRank positively correlate. Developmental shifts from intermediate to expert-level processing are observed.

Conclusion: The findings enhance understanding of visual expertise acquisition and can guide AI-assisted learning interventions.

Abstract: Understanding how novices acquire and hone visual search skills is crucial
for developing and optimizing training methods across domains. Network analysis
methods can be used to analyze graph representations of visual expertise. This
study investigates the relationship between eye-gaze movements and learning
outcomes among undergraduate dentistry students who were diagnosing dental
radiographs over multiple semesters. We use network analysis techniques to
model eye-gaze scanpaths as directed graphs and examine changes in network
metrics over time. Using time series clustering on each metric, we identify
distinct patterns of visual search strategies and explore their association
with students' diagnostic performance. Our findings suggest that the network
metric of transition entropy is negatively correlated with performance scores,
while the number of nodes and edges as well as average PageRank are positively
correlated with performance scores. Changes in network metrics for individual
students over time suggest a developmental shift from intermediate to
expert-level processing. These insights contribute to understanding expertise
acquisition in visual tasks and can inform the design of AI-assisted learning
interventions.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Humans struggle to distinguish AI-generated images from real ones, with only a 62% success rate, highlighting the need for transparency tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess human ability to differentiate between real and AI-generated images and address the risks of misinformation.

Method: Data from the online game 'Real or Not Quiz' was analyzed, with participants evaluating randomized sets of real and AI-generated images.

Result: Participants achieved a 62% success rate, performing best with human portraits but poorly with landscapes.

Conclusion: The study underscores the challenge of identifying AI-generated content and calls for transparency tools like watermarks and detection methods.

Abstract: As AI-powered image generation improves, a key question is how well human
beings can differentiate between "real" and AI-generated or modified images.
Using data collected from the online game "Real or Not Quiz.", this study
investigates how effectively people can distinguish AI-generated images from
real ones. Participants viewed a randomized set of real and AI-generated
images, aiming to identify their authenticity. Analysis of approximately
287,000 image evaluations by over 12,500 global participants revealed an
overall success rate of only 62\%, indicating a modest ability, slightly above
chance. Participants were most accurate with human portraits but struggled
significantly with natural and urban landscapes. These results highlight the
inherent challenge humans face in distinguishing AI-generated visual content,
particularly images without obvious artifacts or stylistic cues. This study
stresses the need for transparency tools, such as watermarks and robust AI
detection tools to mitigate the risks of misinformation arising from
AI-generated content

### [229] [DxHF: Providing High-Quality Human Feedback for LLM Alignment via Interactive Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18802)
*Danqing Shi,Furui Cheng,Tino Weinkauf,Antti Oulasvirta,Mennatallah El-Assady*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces DxHF, a user interface that decomposes text into claims to improve human feedback accuracy for LLM alignment, showing a 5% accuracy boost despite slightly longer feedback times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for human feedback in LLM alignment are cognitively challenging for long or unfamiliar texts, prompting the need for a more efficient approach.

Method: The study proposes the decomposition principle, breaking text into claims, and implements it in the DxHF interface with visual aids for relevance and claim linking.

Result: DxHF improves feedback accuracy by 5%, especially for uncertain users, though it increases feedback time by 18 seconds.

Conclusion: Decomposition enhances feedback quality, demonstrating HCI's potential in improving human-AI alignment.

Abstract: Human preferences are widely used to align large language models (LLMs)
through methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).
However, the current user interfaces require annotators to compare text
paragraphs, which is cognitively challenging when the texts are long or
unfamiliar. This paper contributes by studying the decomposition principle as
an approach to improving the quality of human feedback for LLM alignment. This
approach breaks down the text into individual claims instead of directly
comparing two long-form text responses. Based on the principle, we build a
novel user interface DxHF. It enhances the comparison process by showing
decomposed claims, visually encoding the relevance of claims to the
conversation and linking similar claims. This allows users to skim through key
information and identify differences for better and quicker judgment. Our
technical evaluation shows evidence that decomposition generally improves
feedback accuracy regarding the ground truth, particularly for users with
uncertainty. A crowdsourcing study with 160 participants indicates that using
DxHF improves feedback accuracy by an average of 5%, although it increases the
average feedback time by 18 seconds. Notably, accuracy is significantly higher
in situations where users have less certainty. The finding of the study
highlights the potential of HCI as an effective method for improving human-AI
alignment.

### [230] [People Are Highly Cooperative with Large Language Models, Especially When Communication Is Possible or Following Human Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18639)
*Paweł Niszczota,Tomasz Grzegorczyk,Alexander Pastukhov*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: LLMs can augment humans in cooperative tasks, but cooperation rates with LLMs are 10-15% lower than with humans. Communication boosts cooperation equally for both.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how interacting with LLMs (vs. humans) affects cooperative behavior in business settings.

Method: Used Prisoner's Dilemma game in two experiments: repeated (Experiment 1) and one-shot (Experiment 2) with communication variations.

Result: Cooperation with LLMs was lower but still high, and communication increased cooperation equally for humans and LLMs. Prior human interaction boosted LLM cooperation.

Conclusion: LLMs can be used cautiously in cooperative business settings, with communication enhancing cooperation.

Abstract: Machines driven by large language models (LLMs) have the potential to augment
humans across various tasks, a development with profound implications for
business settings where effective communication, collaboration, and stakeholder
trust are paramount. To explore how interacting with an LLM instead of a human
might shift cooperative behavior in such settings, we used the Prisoner's
Dilemma game -- a surrogate of several real-world managerial and economic
scenarios. In Experiment 1 (N=100), participants engaged in a thirty-round
repeated game against a human, a classic bot, and an LLM (GPT, in real-time).
In Experiment 2 (N=192), participants played a one-shot game against a human or
an LLM, with half of them allowed to communicate with their opponent, enabling
LLMs to leverage a key advantage over older-generation machines. Cooperation
rates with LLMs -- while lower by approximately 10-15 percentage points
compared to interactions with human opponents -- were nonetheless high. This
finding was particularly notable in Experiment 2, where the psychological cost
of selfish behavior was reduced. Although allowing communication about
cooperation did not close the human-machine behavioral gap, it increased the
likelihood of cooperation with both humans and LLMs equally (by 88%), which is
particularly surprising for LLMs given their non-human nature and the
assumption that people might be less receptive to cooperating with machines
compared to human counterparts. Additionally, cooperation with LLMs was higher
following prior interaction with humans, suggesting a spillover effect in
cooperative behavior. Our findings validate the (careful) use of LLMs by
businesses in settings that have a cooperative component.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: TreeReader is a novel tool that uses LLM-generated summaries in an interactive tree structure to improve navigation and comprehension of academic papers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional formats like PDF and HTML cause cognitive overload and obscure hierarchical structure, while LLM-based chatbots lack nuanced understanding and reliability.

Method: TreeReader decomposes papers into an interactive tree with concise LLM summaries for each section, allowing selective exploration.

Result: A user study showed TreeReader enhances reading efficiency and comprehension by combining hierarchical summarization with interactive exploration.

Conclusion: TreeReader bridges summarization and interactive exploration, offering a more efficient way to understand complex academic literature.

Abstract: Efficiently navigating and understanding academic papers is crucial for
scientific progress. Traditional linear formats like PDF and HTML can cause
cognitive overload and obscure a paper's hierarchical structure, making it
difficult to locate key information. While LLM-based chatbots offer
summarization, they often lack nuanced understanding of specific sections, may
produce unreliable information, and typically discard the document's
navigational structure. Drawing insights from a formative study on academic
reading practices, we introduce TreeReader, a novel language model-augmented
paper reader. TreeReader decomposes papers into an interactive tree structure
where each section is initially represented by an LLM-generated concise
summary, with underlying details accessible on demand. This design allows users
to quickly grasp core ideas, selectively explore sections of interest, and
verify summaries against the source text. A user study was conducted to
evaluate TreeReader's impact on reading efficiency and comprehension.
TreeReader provides a more focused and efficient way to navigate and understand
complex academic literature by bridging hierarchical summarization with
interactive exploration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze stock market liquidity and identify factors influencing stock prices, aiding investors in decision-making.

Method: Performed linear regression on Dhaka Stock Exchange data and compared it with random forest using various metrics.

Result: Random forest outperformed linear regression; identified key factors affecting stock price variability; time series data was unsuitable for linear prediction.

Conclusion: Random forest is more effective for stock market analysis, and time series data lacks predictive power for linear models.

Abstract: Share market is one of the most important sectors of economic development of
a country. Everyday almost all companies issue their shares and investors buy
and sell shares of these companies. Generally investors want to buy shares of
the companies whose market liquidity is comparatively greater. Market liquidity
depends on the average price of a share. In this paper, a thorough linear
regression analysis has been performed on the stock market data of Dhaka Stock
Exchange. Later, the linear model has been compared with random forest based on
different metrics showing better results for random forest model. However, the
amount of individual significance of different factors on the variability of
stock price has been identified and explained. This paper also shows that the
time series data is not capable of generating a predictive linear model for
analysis.

TL;DR: A new volumetric grasp model with rotational equivariance improves sample efficiency using tri-plane features and deformable steerable convolutions, outperforming non-equivariant methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance grasp planning by improving sample efficiency and computational performance through rotational equivariance.

Method: Uses tri-plane volumetric features and deformable steerable convolutions, adapting to local geometry while preserving equivariance. Extends GIGA and IGD planners with equivariant formulations.

Result: Reduces computational and memory costs; equivariant models outperform non-equivariant ones with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively combines equivariance with adaptability, achieving superior grasp planning performance.

Abstract: We propose a new volumetric grasp model that is equivariant to rotations
around the vertical axis, leading to a significant improvement in sample
efficiency. Our model employs a tri-plane volumetric feature representation --
i.e., the projection of 3D features onto three canonical planes. We introduce a
novel tri-plane feature design in which features on the horizontal plane are
equivariant to 90{\deg} rotations, while the sum of features from the other two
planes remains invariant to the same transformations. This design is enabled by
a new deformable steerable convolution, which combines the adaptability of
deformable convolutions with the rotational equivariance of steerable ones.
This allows the receptive field to adapt to local object geometry while
preserving equivariance properties. We further develop equivariant adaptations
of two state-of-the-art volumetric grasp planners, GIGA and IGD. Specifically,
we derive a new equivariant formulation of IGD's deformable attention mechanism
and propose an equivariant generative model of grasp orientations based on flow
matching. We provide a detailed analytical justification of the proposed
equivariance properties and validate our approach through extensive simulated
and real-world experiments. Our results demonstrate that the proposed
projection-based design significantly reduces both computational and memory
costs. Moreover, the equivariant grasp models built on top of our tri-plane
features consistently outperform their non-equivariant counterparts, achieving
higher performance with only a modest computational overhead. Video and code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language models lack the ability to utilize multiple modalities in social interactions, limiting their effectiveness in autonomous social robots.

Method: The paper outlines the adaptation of vision-language models for social robots, addressing technical challenges and evaluation practices.

Result: Vision-language models are identified as capable of processing a wide range of visual information for autonomous social robots.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that vision-language models can bridge the gap in multimodal social interactions for robots, though technical challenges remain.

Abstract: Large language models have given social robots the ability to autonomously
engage in open-domain conversations. However, they are still missing a
fundamental social skill: making use of the multiple modalities that carry
social interactions. While previous work has focused on task-oriented
interactions that require referencing the environment or specific phenomena in
social interactions such as dialogue breakdowns, we outline the overall needs
of a multimodal system for social conversations with robots. We then argue that
vision-language models are able to process this wide range of visual
information in a sufficiently general manner for autonomous social robots. We
describe how to adapt them to this setting, which technical challenges remain,
and briefly discuss evaluation practices.

TL;DR: ReCoDe is a decentralized hybrid framework combining optimization-based controllers and multi-agent reinforcement learning to improve coordination in multi-agent settings by learning dynamic constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handcrafted constraints often fail in complex multi-agent coordination tasks, necessitating a more adaptable approach.

Method: ReCoDe integrates expert controllers with learned dynamic constraints through local communication, enabling context-based coordination.

Result: ReCoDe outperforms handcrafted controllers, hybrid approaches, and standard MARL baselines in multi-agent navigation tasks.

Conclusion: Retaining and improving expert controllers with dynamic constraints is more efficient than learning from scratch, as demonstrated by empirical and theoretical evidence.

Abstract: Constraint-based optimization is a cornerstone of robotics, enabling the
design of controllers that reliably encode task and safety requirements such as
collision avoidance or formation adherence. However, handcrafted constraints
can fail in multi-agent settings that demand complex coordination. We introduce
ReCoDe--Reinforcement-based Constraint Design--a decentralized, hybrid
framework that merges the reliability of optimization-based controllers with
the adaptability of multi-agent reinforcement learning. Rather than discarding
expert controllers, ReCoDe improves them by learning additional, dynamic
constraints that capture subtler behaviors, for example, by constraining agent
movements to prevent congestion in cluttered scenarios. Through local
communication, agents collectively constrain their allowed actions to
coordinate more effectively under changing conditions. In this work, we focus
on applications of ReCoDe to multi-agent navigation tasks requiring intricate,
context-based movements and consensus, where we show that it outperforms purely
handcrafted controllers, other hybrid approaches, and standard MARL baselines.
We give empirical (real robot) and theoretical evidence that retaining a
user-defined controller, even when it is imperfect, is more efficient than
learning from scratch, especially because ReCoDe can dynamically change the
degree to which it relies on this controller.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Perpetua is a method for modeling semi-static feature dynamics in robotic environments, enabling future state predictions with prior knowledge, multiple hypotheses tracking, and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic systems in dynamic environments lack methods to predict future states of changing features, often filtering observations instead.

Method: Perpetua uses mixtures of persistence and emergence filters in a Bayesian framework to model feature disappearance/reappearance probabilities.

Result: Experiments show Perpetua outperforms similar methods in accuracy, adaptability, and robustness to missing observations.

Conclusion: Perpetua provides an efficient, scalable, and general solution for predicting feature states in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Many robotic systems require extended deployments in complex, dynamic
environments. In such deployments, parts of the environment may change between
subsequent robot observations. Most robotic mapping or environment modeling
algorithms are incapable of representing dynamic features in a way that enables
predicting their future state. Instead, they opt to filter certain state
observations, either by removing them or some form of weighted averaging. This
paper introduces Perpetua, a method for modeling the dynamics of semi-static
features. Perpetua is able to: incorporate prior knowledge about the dynamics
of the feature if it exists, track multiple hypotheses, and adapt over time to
enable predicting of future feature states. Specifically, we chain together
mixtures of "persistence" and "emergence" filters to model the probability that
features will disappear or reappear in a formal Bayesian framework. The
approach is an efficient, scalable, general, and robust method for estimating
the states of features in an environment, both in the present as well as at
arbitrary future times. Through experiments on simulated and real-world data,
we find that Perpetua yields better accuracy than similar approaches while also
being online adaptable and robust to missing observations.

TL;DR: The paper proposes distilling utility judgment capabilities from large language models (LLMs) into smaller models for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), reducing computational costs while improving answer quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational costs of using LLMs for utility judgments in RAG limit passage evaluation, especially for complex queries.

Method: Distill utility judgments from teacher LLMs into smaller student models, focusing on utility-based selection and pseudo-answer generation.

Result: Utility-based selection outperforms relevance ranking for complex questions, reducing costs and improving answer quality.

Conclusion: The method offers a flexible, cost-effective solution for RAG, with released annotations supporting further research.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
incorporating retrieved information. Standard retrieval process prioritized
relevance, focusing on topical alignment between queries and passages. In
contrast, in RAG, the emphasis has shifted to utility, which considers the
usefulness of passages for generating accurate answers. Despite empirical
evidence showing the benefits of utility-based retrieval in RAG, the high
computational cost of using LLMs for utility judgments limits the number of
passages evaluated. This restriction is problematic for complex queries
requiring extensive information. To address this, we propose a method to
distill the utility judgment capabilities of LLMs into smaller, more efficient
models. Our approach focuses on utility-based selection rather than ranking,
enabling dynamic passage selection tailored to specific queries without the
need for fixed thresholds. We train student models to learn pseudo-answer
generation and utility judgments from teacher LLMs, using a sliding window
method that dynamically selects useful passages. Our experiments demonstrate
that utility-based selection provides a flexible and cost-effective solution
for RAG, significantly reducing computational costs while improving answer
quality. We present the distillation results using Qwen3-32B as the teacher
model for both relevance ranking and utility-based selection, distilled into
RankQwen1.7B and UtilityQwen1.7B. Our findings indicate that for complex
questions, utility-based selection is more effective than relevance ranking in
enhancing answer generation performance. We will release the relevance ranking
and utility-based selection annotations for the MS MARCO dataset, supporting
further research in this area.

### [239] [Injecting External Knowledge into the Reasoning Process Enhances Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19333)
*Minghao Tang,Shiyu Ni,Jiafeng Guo,Keping Bi*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Passage Injection enhances LLMs' robustness to noisy retrieved passages in RAG systems by explicitly incorporating passages into reasoning, improving performance and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noisy retrieved passages undermine RAG effectiveness; leveraging LLMs' reasoning and self-reflection can improve robustness.

Method: Proposes Passage Injection to integrate retrieved passages into LLMs' reasoning, tested with BM25 retriever on four QA datasets.

Result: Significantly improves RAG performance and robustness against random and counterfactual noise, while effectively leveraging helpful passages.

Conclusion: Incorporating passages into reasoning is promising for robust RAG systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been widely adopted to augment large
language models (LLMs) with external knowledge for knowledge-intensive tasks.
However, its effectiveness is often undermined by the presence of noisy (i.e.,
low-quality) retrieved passages. Enhancing LLMs' robustness to such noise is
critical for improving the reliability of RAG systems. Recent advances have
equipped LLMs with strong reasoning and self-reflection capabilities, allowing
them to identify and correct errors in their reasoning process. Inspired by
this ability, we propose Passage Injection-a simple yet effective method that
explicitly incorporates retrieved passages into LLMs' reasoning process, aiming
to enhance the model's ability to recognize and resist noisy passages. We
validate Passage Injection under general RAG settings using BM25 as the
retriever. Experiments on four reasoning-enhanced LLMs across four factual QA
datasets demonstrate that Passage Injection significantly improves overall RAG
performance. Further analysis on two noisy retrieval settings-random noise,
where the model is provided irrelevant passages, and counterfactual noise,
where it is given misleading passages-shows that Passage Injection consistently
improves robustness. Controlled experiments confirm that Passage Injection can
also effectively leverage helpful passages. These findings suggest that
incorporating passages in LLMs' reasoning process is a promising direction for
building more robust RAG systems. The code can be found

### [240] [PBiLoss: Popularity-Aware Regularization to Improve Fairness in Graph-Based Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19067)
*Mohammad Naeimi,Mostafa Haghir Chehreghani*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: PBiLoss is a regularization-based loss function to counteract popularity bias in GNN-based recommender systems, improving fairness without compromising accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Popularity bias in recommender systems reduces diversity and fairness. Addressing this issue is crucial for equitable content exposure.

Method: PBiLoss penalizes the model's bias toward popular items using two sampling strategies (PopPos and PopNeg) and flexible popularity distinction methods. It integrates into existing frameworks like LightGCN.

Result: PBiLoss reduces popularity bias (measured by PRU and PRI) while maintaining or improving recommendation accuracy.

Conclusion: Embedding fairness objectives directly into optimization offers a scalable solution for balancing accuracy and fairness in recommender systems.

Abstract: Recommender systems, especially those based on graph neural networks (GNNs),
have achieved remarkable success in capturing user-item interaction patterns.
However, they remain susceptible to popularity bias--the tendency to
over-recommend popular items--resulting in reduced content diversity and
compromised fairness. In this paper, we propose PBiLoss, a novel
regularization-based loss function designed to counteract popularity bias in
graph-based recommender models explicitly. PBiLoss augments traditional
training objectives by penalizing the model's inclination toward popular items,
thereby encouraging the recommendation of less popular but potentially more
personalized content. We introduce two sampling strategies: Popular Positive
(PopPos) and Popular Negative (PopNeg), which respectively modulate the
contribution of the positive and negative popular items during training. We
further explore two methods to distinguish popular items: one based on a fixed
popularity threshold and another without any threshold, making the approach
flexible and adaptive. Our proposed method is model-agnostic and can be
seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art graph-based frameworks such as
LightGCN and its variants. Comprehensive experiments across multiple real-world
datasets demonstrate that PBiLoss significantly improves fairness, as
demonstrated by reductions in the Popularity-Rank Correlation for Users (PRU)
and Popularity-Rank Correlation for Items (PRI), while maintaining or even
enhancing standard recommendation accuracy and ranking metrics. These results
highlight the effectiveness of directly embedding fairness objectives into the
optimization process, providing a practical and scalable solution for balancing
accuracy and equitable content exposure in modern recommender systems.

*M. Jeffrey Mei,Florian Henkel,Samuel E. Sandberg,Oliver Bembom,Andreas F. Ehmann*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Using shared content-based features ('semantic IDs') improves recommendation accuracy and diversity while reducing model size in next-item recommendation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce memory usage and model complexity by replacing unique item embeddings with shared content-based embeddings.

Method: Employ shared content-based features ('semantic IDs') for items, tested on two music recommendation datasets and an online A/B test.

Result: Improved recommendation accuracy and diversity with a smaller model size.

Conclusion: Shared embeddings are effective for lightweight, high-performing recommender systems.

Abstract: Training recommender systems for next-item recommendation often requires
unique embeddings to be learned for each item, which may take up most of the
trainable parameters for a model. Shared embeddings, such as using content
information, can reduce the number of distinct embeddings to be stored in
memory. This allows for a more lightweight model; correspondingly, model
complexity can be increased due to having fewer embeddings to store in memory.
We show the benefit of using shared content-based features ('semantic IDs') in
improving recommendation accuracy and diversity, while reducing model size, for
two music recommendation datasets, including an online A/B test on a music
streaming service.

TL;DR: Exploring how LLMs can enhance group recommender systems by addressing group dynamics, decision-making, and explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Group recommender systems face complexities like group dynamics and decision-making, which are absent in single-user systems. The paper aims to leverage LLMs to improve these aspects.

Method: Analyzes the potential of LLMs to support group dynamics, decision-making, and provide explanations in group recommender systems.

Result: LLMs can enhance decision support quality and applicability in group recommender systems.

Conclusion: LLMs offer promising solutions to the challenges of group recommender systems, improving their effectiveness and user experience.

Abstract: In contrast to single-user recommender systems, group recommender systems are
designed to generate and explain recommendations for groups. This
group-oriented setting introduces additional complexities, as several factors -
absent in individual contexts - must be addressed. These include understanding
group dynamics (e.g., social dependencies within the group), defining effective
decision-making processes, ensuring that recommendations are suitable for all
group members, and providing group-level explanations as well as explanations
for individual users. In this paper, we analyze in which way large language
models (LLMs) can support these aspects and help to increase the overall
decision support quality and applicability of group recommender systems.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Agent0 is an LLM-driven system automating feature extraction and prompt tuning for recommender systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high cost and challenge of acquiring categorical features for recommender systems by leveraging LLMs.

Method: Agent0 uses interacting LLM agents for feature extraction and dynamic feedback loops for prompt tuning.

Result: The system is practical and effective for automated feature discovery in recommender systems.

Conclusion: Agent0 successfully automates feature engineering and prompt tuning, addressing a key challenge in recommender systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and their associated agent-based frameworks have
significantly advanced automated information extraction, a critical component
of modern recommender systems. While these multitask frameworks are widely used
in code generation, their application in data-centric research is still largely
untapped. This paper presents Agent0, an LLM-driven, agent-based system
designed to automate information extraction and feature construction from raw,
unstructured text. Categorical features are crucial for large-scale recommender
systems but are often expensive to acquire. Agent0 coordinates a group of
interacting LLM agents to automatically identify the most valuable text aspects
for subsequent tasks (such as models or AutoML pipelines). Beyond its feature
engineering capabilities, Agent0 also offers an automated prompt-engineering
tuning method that utilizes dynamic feedback loops from an oracle. Our findings
demonstrate that this closed-loop methodology is both practical and effective
for automated feature discovery, which is recognized as one of the most
challenging phases in current recommender system development.

*Anton Pembek,Artem Fatkulin,Anton Klenitskiy,Alexey Vasilev*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: A novel approach improves cold-start item recommendations by adding a small trainable delta to frozen content embeddings, balancing adaptation and semantic preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the cold-start problem in sequential recommender systems where items lack interactions, and frozen or fine-tuned content embeddings perform suboptimally.

Method: Introduce a small trainable delta to frozen content embeddings, allowing adaptation without losing original semantic structure.

Result: Consistent improvements across diverse datasets, including e-commerce (text) and music (audio).

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively balances adaptation and semantic preservation, enhancing cold-start item recommendations.

Abstract: Many sequential recommender systems suffer from the cold start problem, where
items with few or no interactions cannot be effectively used by the model due
to the absence of a trained embedding. Content-based approaches, which leverage
item metadata, are commonly used in such scenarios. One possible way is to use
embeddings derived from content features such as textual descriptions as
initialization for the model embeddings. However, directly using frozen content
embeddings often results in suboptimal performance, as they may not fully adapt
to the recommendation task. On the other hand, fine-tuning these embeddings can
degrade performance for cold-start items, as item representations may drift far
from their original structure after training. We propose a novel approach to
address this limitation. Instead of entirely freezing the content embeddings or
fine-tuning them extensively, we introduce a small trainable delta to frozen
embeddings that enables the model to adapt item representations without letting
them go too far from their original semantic structure. This approach
demonstrates consistent improvements across multiple datasets and modalities,
including e-commerce datasets with textual descriptions and a music dataset
with audio-based representation.

*Gromit Yeuk-Yin Chan,Luis Gustavo Nonato,Themis Palpanas,Cláudio T. Silva,Juliana Freire*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: TiVy is a new algorithm for summarizing time series using sequential patterns, improving scalability and clarity in visualization by reducing clutter and speeding up processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series visualization methods struggle with scalability and clarity, especially for long time spans, leading to visual clutter.

Method: TiVy transforms time series into symbolic sequences using DTW, groups similar subsequences, and provides a visual summary with fewer overlaps.

Result: TiVy extracts clear patterns, speeds up processing by 1000X compared to DTW clustering, and efficiently explores hidden structures in large datasets.

Conclusion: TiVy offers a scalable and efficient solution for visualizing large-scale time series data, improving clarity and reducing clutter.

Abstract: Visualizing multiple time series presents fundamental tradeoffs between
scalability and visual clarity. Time series capture the behavior of many
large-scale real-world processes, from stock market trends to urban activities.
Users often gain insights by visualizing them as line charts, juxtaposing or
superposing multiple time series to compare them and identify trends and
patterns. However, existing representations struggle with scalability: when
covering long time spans, leading to visual clutter from too many small
multiples or overlapping lines. We propose TiVy, a new algorithm that
summarizes time series using sequential patterns. It transforms the series into
a set of symbolic sequences based on subsequence visual similarity using
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), then constructs a disjoint grouping of similar
subsequences based on the frequent sequential patterns. The grouping result, a
visual summary of time series, provides uncluttered superposition with fewer
small multiples. Unlike common clustering techniques, TiVy extracts similar
subsequences (of varying lengths) aligned in time. We also present an
interactive time series visualization that renders large-scale time series in
real-time. Our experimental evaluation shows that our algorithm (1) extracts
clear and accurate patterns when visualizing time series data, (2) achieves a
significant speed-up (1000X) compared to a straightforward DTW clustering. We
also demonstrate the efficiency of our approach to explore hidden structures in
massive time series data in two usage scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods are costly and time-consuming, requiring skilled artists, and often lack accuracy in replicating real-world landscapes.

Method: Automatically amplifies real-world scanned data and renders it in real-time 3D for close-range exploration.

Result: Enables high-quality, realistic 3D content for training, simulation, gaming, and visualization.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for creating detailed outdoor 3D environments.

Abstract: Building realistic wide scale outdoor 3D content with sufficient visual
quality to observe at walking eye level or from driven vehicles is often
carried out by large teams of artists skilled in modelling, texturing, material
shading and lighting, which typically leads to both prohibitive costs and
reduced accuracy honoring the variety of real world ground truth landscapes. In
our proposed method, we define a process to automatically amplify real-world

high quality for training, simulation, video game and visualisation
applications.

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: The paper shows that the stable outcome of a self-referential process matches the unique equilibrium of an unbounded revision dialogue, extending classical fixed point theorems to transfinite domains and embedding the results in dependent type theory for verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify fixed point theory, game semantics, ordinal analysis, and type theory, providing a rigorous foundation for reasoning about infinite self-referential systems and certifying their convergence.

Method: Extends classical fixed point theorems to transfinite domains using well-founded induction and order-theoretic continuity, then formalizes the results in dependent type theory for machine-checked verification.

Result: A transordinal fixed point operator is derived, with a machine-checked proof confirming the stability and uniqueness of the iterative dialogue's limit.

Conclusion: The research supports Alpay's claim of semantic convergence in constructive logic and offers practical tools for verifying infinite self-referential systems computationally.

Abstract: This paper contributes to the Alpay Algebra by demonstrating that the stable
outcome of a self referential process, obtained by iterating a transformation
through all ordinal stages, is identical to the unique equilibrium of an
unbounded revision dialogue between a system and its environment. The analysis
initially elucidates how classical fixed point theorems guarantee such
convergence in finite settings and subsequently extends the argument to the
transfinite domain, relying upon well founded induction and principles of order
theoretic continuity.
  Furthermore, the resulting transordinal fixed point operator is embedded into
dependent type theory, a formalization which permits every step of the
transfinite iteration and its limit to be verified within a modern proof
assistant. This procedure yields a machine checked proof that the iterative
dialogue necessarily stabilizes and that its limit is unique. The result
provides a foundation for Alpay's philosophical claim of semantic convergence
within the framework of constructive logic. By unifying concepts from fixed
point theory, game semantics, ordinal analysis, and type theory, this research
establishes a broadly accessible yet formally rigorous foundation for reasoning
about infinite self referential systems and offers practical tools for
certifying their convergence within computational environments.

TL;DR: The paper studies the asymptotic fluctuations of eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian for data sampled from a low-dimensional manifold, proving Gaussian behavior and linking the variance to a gradient flow and Cramer-Rao bound.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the statistical behavior of graph Laplacian eigenvalues for manifold-embedded data, with applications in spectral methods and manifold learning.

Method: Analyzes eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian for ε-proximity graphs, using assumptions on data generation and ε decay, and proves asymptotic Gaussianity.

Result: Shows √n(λ̂ₗᵉ - E[λ̂ₗᵉ]) is asymptotically Gaussian with explicit variance, interpreted via gradient flow and Cramer-Rao bound.

Conclusion: The eigenvalues exhibit asymptotic efficiency, validated numerically, with theoretical insights into their statistical properties.

Abstract: Given i.i.d.\ samples $X_n =\{ x_1, \dots, x_n \}$ from a distribution
supported on a low dimensional manifold ${M}$ embedded in Eucliden space, we
consider the graph Laplacian operator $\Delta_n$ associated to an
$\varepsilon$-proximity graph over $X_n$ and study the asymptotic fluctuations
of its eigenvalues around their means. In particular, letting
$\hat{\lambda}_l^\varepsilon$ denote the $l$-th eigenvalue of $\Delta_n$, and
under suitable assumptions on the data generating model and on the rate of
decay of $\varepsilon$, we prove that $\sqrt{n } (\hat{\lambda}_{l}^\varepsilon
- \mathbb{E}[\hat{\lambda}_{l}^\varepsilon] )$ is asymptotically Gaussian with
a variance that we can explicitly characterize. A formal argument allows us to
interpret this asymptotic variance as the dissipation of a gradient flow of a
suitable energy with respect to the Fisher-Rao geometry. This geometric
interpretation allows us to give, in turn, a statistical interpretation of the
asymptotic variance in terms of a Cramer-Rao lower bound for the estimation of
the eigenvalues of certain weighted Laplace-Beltrami operator. The latter
interpretation suggests a form of asymptotic statistical efficiency for the
eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian. We also present CLTs for multiple
eigenvalues and through several numerical experiments explore the validity of
our results when some of the assumptions that we make in our theoretical
analysis are relaxed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of causal discovery under finite data and time constraints, inspired by Valiant's PAC learning.

Method: Proposes the PACC framework, applying PAC principles to causal methods like propensity scores and SCCS.

Result: Demonstrates computational and sample efficiency, and provides theoretical guarantees for previously unproven methods.

Conclusion: PACC offers a robust framework for practical causal discovery with finite resources, bridging theory and application.

Abstract: The discovery of causal relationships is a foundational problem in artificial
intelligence, statistics, epidemiology, economics, and beyond. While elegant
theories exist for accurate causal discovery given infinite data, real-world
applications are inherently resource-constrained. Effective methods for
inferring causal relationships from observational data must perform well under
finite data and time constraints, where "performing well" implies achieving
high, though not perfect accuracy. In his seminal paper A Theory of the
Learnable, Valiant highlighted the importance of resource constraints in
supervised machine learning, introducing the concept of Probably Approximately
Correct (PAC) learning as an alternative to exact learning. Inspired by
Valiant's work, we propose the Probably Approximately Correct Causal (PACC)
Discovery framework, which extends PAC learning principles to the causal field.
This framework emphasizes both computational and sample efficiency for
established causal methods such as propensity score techniques and instrumental
variable approaches. Furthermore, we show that it can also provide theoretical
guarantees for other widely used methods, such as the Self-Controlled Case
Series (SCCS) method, which had previously lacked such guarantees.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a tensor-based method for clustering layers in multilayer networks (DIMPLE-SGRDPG) under sparsity conditions, outperforming layer-per-layer analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for clustering layers in multilayer networks rely on dense networks and layer-per-layer analysis, limiting applicability. The paper aims to address this by pooling information across layers for sparser networks.

Method: A tensor-based methodology is proposed to pool information from all layers, enabling perfect clustering under sparsity conditions. Theoretical results support its effectiveness.

Result: The new technique achieves perfect clustering under sparsity conditions, matching computational lower bounds for simpler models.

Conclusion: The tensor-based method significantly improves clustering accuracy for sparse multilayer networks, with theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: The paper studies the DIverse MultiPLEx Signed Generalized Random Dot Product
Graph (DIMPLE-SGRDPG) network model (Pensky (2024)), where all layers of the
network have the same collection of nodes. In addition, all layers can be
partitioned into groups such that the layers in the same group are embedded in
the same ambient subspace but otherwise matrices of connection probabilities
can be all different. This setting includes majority of multilayer network
models as its particular cases. The key task in this model is to recover the
groups of layers with unique subspace structures, since the case where all
layers of the network are embedded in the same subspace has been fairly well
studied. Until now, clustering of layers in such networks was based on the
layer-per-layer analysis, which required the multilayer network to be
sufficiently dense. Nevertheless, in this paper we succeeded in pooling
information in all layers together and providing a tensor-based methodology
that ensures perfect clustering for a much sparser network. Our theoretical
results, established under intuitive non-restrictive assumptions, assert that
the new technique achieves perfect clustering under sparsity conditions that,
up to logarithmic factors, coincide with the computational lower bound derived
for a much simpler model.

*Takuya Inoue,Takuya Kawabata*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a CNN-based method integrated with ensemble NWP models to improve medium-range temperature forecasts by correcting systematic and random errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Operational medium-range forecasts often rely on low-resolution NWP models, which have systematic and random errors due to limited computational resources.

Method: The method uses CNN-based post-processing for bias correction and spatial super-resolution on ensemble members, followed by ensemble averaging to reduce errors.

Result: The proposed method outperforms high-resolution deterministic NWP models, with CNN correction before ensemble averaging yielding higher accuracy.

Conclusion: Combining CNN-based correction with ensemble averaging effectively reduces errors, offering a scalable solution for improving forecasts, especially in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: This study proposes a method that integrates convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) with ensemble numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, enabling
surface temperature forecasting at lead times beyond the short-range (five-day)
forecast period. Owing to limited computational resources, operational
medium-range temperature forecasts typically rely on low-resolution NWP models,
which are prone to systematic and random errors. To resolve these limitations,
the proposed method first reduces systematic errors through CNN-based
post-processing (bias correction and spatial super-resolution) on each ensemble
member, reconstructing high-resolution temperature fields from low-resolution
model outputs. Second, it reduces random errors through ensemble averaging of
the CNN-corrected members. This study also investigates whether the sequence of
CNN correction and ensemble averaging affects the forecast accuracy. For
comparison with the proposed method, we additionally conducted experiments with
the CNN trained on ensemble-averaged forecasts. The first approach--CNN
correction before ensemble averaging--consistently achieved higher accuracy
than the reverse approach. Although based on low-resolution ensemble forecasts,
the proposed method notably outperformed the high-resolution deterministic NWP
models. These findings indicate that combining CNN-based correction with
ensemble averaging effectively reduces both the systematic and random errors in
NWP model outputs. The proposed approach is a practical and scalable solution
for improving medium-range temperature forecasts, and is particularly valuable
at operational centers with limited computational resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how differences in model design (LAM vs. SGM) impact performance and suitability for regional weather forecasting.

Method: Built and trained LAM and SGM models using the Anemoi framework, with near-identical setups, and conducted inference experiments.

Result: Both models are accurate and comparable, but LAM excels with high-quality boundary forcings, while SGM is self-contained and more generalizable.

Conclusion: The study provides guidance for meteorological institutes choosing between LAM and SGM for operational forecasting systems.

Abstract: Regional machine learning weather prediction (MLWP) models based on graph
neural networks have recently demonstrated remarkable predictive accuracy,
outperforming numerical weather prediction models at lower computational costs.
In particular, limited-area model (LAM) and stretched-grid model (SGM)
approaches have emerged for generating high-resolution regional forecasts,
based on initial conditions from a regional (re)analysis. While LAM uses
lateral boundaries from an external global model, SGM incorporates a global
domain at lower resolution. This study aims to understand how the differences
in model design impact relative performance and potential applications.
Specifically, the strengths and weaknesses of these two approaches are
identified for generating deterministic regional forecasts over Europe. Using
the Anemoi framework, models of both types are built by minimally adapting a
shared architecture and trained using global and regional reanalyses in a
near-identical setup. Several inference experiments have been conducted to
explore their relative performance and highlight key differences. Results show
that both LAM and SGM are competitive deterministic MLWP models with generally
accurate and comparable forecasting performance over the regional domain.
Various differences were identified in the performance of the models across
applications. LAM is able to successfully exploit high-quality boundary
forcings to make predictions within the regional domain and is suitable in
contexts where global data is difficult to acquire. SGM is fully self-contained
for easier operationalisation, can take advantage of more training data and
significantly surpasses LAM in terms of (temporal) generalisability. Our paper
can serve as a starting point for meteorological institutes to guide their
choice between LAM and SGM in developing an operational data-driven forecasting
system.

Conclusion: PurpCode effectively balances safety and utility in code reasoning models, demonstrating superior performance in cybersafety.

Abstract: We introduce PurpCode, the first post-training recipe for training safe code
reasoning models towards generating secure code and defending against malicious
cyberactivities. PurpCode trains a reasoning model in two stages: (i) Rule
Learning, which explicitly teaches the model to reference cybersafety rules to
generate vulnerability-free code and to avoid facilitating malicious
cyberactivities; and (ii) Reinforcement Learning, which optimizes model safety
and preserves model utility through diverse, multi-objective reward mechanisms.
To empower the training pipelines with comprehensive cybersafety data, we
conduct internal red-teaming to synthesize comprehensive and high-coverage
prompts based on real-world tasks for inducing unsafe cyberactivities in the
model. Based on PurpCode, we develop a reasoning-based coding model, namely
PurpCode-32B, which demonstrates state-of-the-art cybersafety, outperforming
various frontier models. Meanwhile, our alignment method decreases the model
overrefusal rates in both general and cybersafety-specific scenarios, while
preserving model utility in both code generation and common security knowledge.

TL;DR: PrompTrend collects and evaluates LLM vulnerabilities from online forums, revealing psychological attacks as dominant threats and challenging the link between capability advancement and security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static benchmarks miss vulnerabilities emerging from community experimentation, necessitating dynamic monitoring.

Method: PrompTrend collects vulnerability data across platforms, uses multidimensional scoring, and analyzes 198 vulnerabilities from online communities over five months.

Result: Psychological attacks outperform technical exploits; platform dynamics affect attack effectiveness. PrompTrend achieves 78% classification accuracy.

Conclusion: Effective LLM security requires socio-technical monitoring; community-driven psychological manipulation is the main threat.

Abstract: Static benchmarks fail to capture LLM vulnerabilities emerging through
community experimentation in online forums. We present PrompTrend, a system
that collects vulnerability data across platforms and evaluates them using
multidimensional scoring, with an architecture designed for scalable
monitoring. Cross-sectional analysis of 198 vulnerabilities collected from
online communities over a five-month period (January-May 2025) and tested on
nine commercial models reveals that advanced capabilities correlate with
increased vulnerability in some architectures, psychological attacks
significantly outperform technical exploits, and platform dynamics shape attack
effectiveness with measurable model-specific patterns. The PrompTrend
Vulnerability Assessment Framework achieves 78% classification accuracy while
revealing limited cross-model transferability, demonstrating that effective LLM
security requires comprehensive socio-technical monitoring beyond traditional
periodic assessment. Our findings challenge the assumption that capability
advancement improves security and establish community-driven psychological
manipulation as the dominant threat vector for current language models.

### [256] [Running in CIRCLE? A Simple Benchmark for LLM Code Interpreter Security](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19399)
*Gabriel Chua*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: CIRCLE is a benchmark to evaluate cybersecurity risks in LLMs with native code interpreters, revealing significant vulnerabilities across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address system-level cybersecurity threats introduced by LLMs integrating native code interpreters, which differ from prompt-based vulnerabilities.

Method: Proposes CIRCLE, a benchmark with 1,260 prompts targeting CPU, memory, and disk resource exhaustion, including direct and indirect variants. Automated evaluation checks code refusal, execution, correctness, and simplifications.

Result: Significant vulnerabilities found in 7 models, with disparities even within providers (e.g., OpenAI's o4-mini at 7.1% vs. GPT-4.1 at 0.5%). Indirect prompts weaken defenses.

Conclusion: Urgent need for interpreter-specific benchmarks, mitigation tools, and industry standards. Dataset and code released for further research.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly integrate native code
interpreters, they enable powerful real-time execution capabilities,
substantially expanding their utility. However, such integrations introduce
potential system-level cybersecurity threats, fundamentally different from
prompt-based vulnerabilities. To systematically evaluate these
interpreter-specific risks, we propose CIRCLE (Code-Interpreter Resilience
Check for LLM Exploits), a simple benchmark comprising 1,260 prompts targeting
CPU, memory, and disk resource exhaustion. Each risk category includes
explicitly malicious ("direct") and plausibly benign ("indirect") prompt
variants. Our automated evaluation framework assesses not only whether LLMs
refuse or generates risky code, but also executes the generated code within the
interpreter environment to evaluate code correctness, simplifications made by
the LLM to make the code safe, or execution timeouts. Evaluating 7 commercially
available models from OpenAI and Google, we uncover significant and
inconsistent vulnerabilities. For instance, evaluations show substantial
disparities even within providers - OpenAI's o4-mini correctly refuses risky
requests at 7.1%, notably higher rates compared to GPT-4.1 at 0.5%. Results
particularly underscore that indirect, socially-engineered prompts
substantially weaken model defenses. This highlights an urgent need for
interpreter-specific cybersecurity benchmarks, dedicated mitigation tools
(e.g., guardrails), and clear industry standards to guide safe and responsible
deployment of LLM interpreter integrations. The benchmark dataset and
evaluation code are publicly released to foster further research.

*Yizhou Peng,Yi-Wen Chao,Dianwen Ng,Yukun Ma,Chongjia Ni,Bin Ma,Eng Siong Chng*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmarking pipeline for Full-duplex spoken dialogue systems (FDSDS) to evaluate performance during user interruptions, using LLMs, TTS, and ASR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack metrics for full-duplex (FD) scenes, such as handling interruptions, prompting the need for a comprehensive evaluation framework.

Method: A benchmarking pipeline was developed using LLMs, TTS, and ASR, tested on three FDSDS models with simulated conversations and interruptions.

Result: All tested models struggled with interruptions, delays, and noisy conditions, highlighting ongoing challenges in FD interactions.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark addresses a critical gap in evaluating FDSDS, revealing areas for improvement in handling real-time interruptions.

Abstract: Full-duplex spoken dialogue systems (FDSDS) enable more natural human-machine
interactions by allowing real-time user interruptions and backchanneling,
compared to traditional SDS that rely on turn-taking. However, existing
benchmarks lack metrics for FD scenes, e.g., evaluating model performance
during user interruptions. In this paper, we present a comprehensive FD
benchmarking pipeline utilizing LLMs, TTS, and ASR to address this gap. It
assesses FDSDS's ability to handle user interruptions, manage delays, and
maintain robustness in challenging scenarios with diverse novel metrics. We
applied our benchmark to three open-source FDSDS (Moshi, Freeze-omni, and
VITA-1.5) using over 40 hours of generated speech, with 293 simulated
conversations and 1,200 interruptions. The results show that all models
continue to face challenges, such as failing to respond to user interruptions,
under frequent disruptions and noisy conditions. Demonstrations, data, and code
will be released.

### [258] [Should Top-Down Clustering Affect Boundaries in Unsupervised Word Discovery?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19204)
*Simon Malan,Benjamin van Niekerk,Herman Kamper*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper compares bottom-up and top-down methods for segmenting unlabeled speech into word-like units and clustering them into a lexicon, finding both achieve similar results, with bottom-up being faster. Clustering is identified as a key limitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if top-down information improves speech segmentation and lexicon creation, comparing it to simpler bottom-up methods.

Method: Two approaches: a bottom-up method using self-supervised features for boundary prediction and clustering, and a top-down ES-KMeans method iteratively updating boundaries.

Result: Both methods achieve state-of-the-art results on ZeroSpeech benchmarks, with bottom-up being faster. Top-down benefits depend on factors like candidate boundaries.

Conclusion: Future work should focus on improving clustering techniques and learning better word-like representations, as clustering is a limiting factor for both methods.

Abstract: We investigate the problem of segmenting unlabeled speech into word-like
units and clustering these to create a lexicon. Prior work can be categorized
into two frameworks. Bottom-up methods first determine boundaries and then
cluster the fixed segmented words into a lexicon. In contrast, top-down methods
incorporate information from the clustered words to inform boundary selection.
However, it is unclear whether top-down information is necessary to improve
segmentation. To explore this, we look at two similar approaches that differ in
whether top-down clustering informs boundary selection. Our simple bottom-up
strategy predicts word boundaries using the dissimilarity between adjacent
self-supervised features, then clusters the resulting segments to construct a
lexicon. Our top-down system is an updated version of the ES-KMeans dynamic
programming method that iteratively uses K-means to update its boundaries. On
the five-language ZeroSpeech benchmarks, both approaches achieve comparable
state-of-the-art results, with the bottom-up system being nearly five times
faster. Through detailed analyses, we show that the top-down influence of
ES-KMeans can be beneficial (depending on factors like the candidate
boundaries), but in many cases the simple bottom-up method performs just as
well. For both methods, we show that the clustering step is a limiting factor.
Therefore, we recommend that future work focus on improved clustering
techniques and learning more discriminative word-like representations. Project

*Alice Zhang,Skanda Muralidhar,Daniel Gatica-Perez,Mathew Magimai-Doss*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The study explores how perceived personality traits vary across conversational contexts (neutral vs. stressful) and identifies acoustic and non-verbal features as key predictors, outperforming speaker embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding how perceived personality traits vary by context, moving beyond static trait assumptions.

Method: Analyzed conversational speech in two work situations (neutral interview and stressful client interaction), using acoustic and non-verbal features.

Result: Perceived personalities differ by context; specific acoustic features predict traits like extraversion and neuroticism; handcrafted features outperform speaker embeddings.

Conclusion: Context matters in personality perception; acoustic and non-verbal features are effective predictors, especially in stressful situations for neuroticism.

Abstract: Prior research indicates that users prefer assistive technologies whose
personalities align with their own. This has sparked interest in automatic
personality perception (APP), which aims to predict an individual's perceived
personality traits. Previous studies in APP have treated personalities as
static traits, independent of context. However, perceived personalities can
vary by context and situation as shown in psychological research. In this
study, we investigate the relationship between conversational speech and
perceived personality for participants engaged in two work situations (a
neutral interview and a stressful client interaction). Our key findings are: 1)
perceived personalities differ significantly across interactions, 2) loudness,
sound level, and spectral flux features are indicative of perceived
extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness in neutral
interactions, while neuroticism correlates with these features in stressful
contexts, 3) handcrafted acoustic features and non-verbal features outperform
speaker embeddings in inference of perceived personality, and 4) stressful
interactions are more predictive of neuroticism, aligning with existing
psychological research.

TL;DR: A Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) framework optimizes continuous crystallization for lithium carbonate, enabling cost-effective extraction from low-grade North American sources like the Smackover Formation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing EV industry demands high-purity lithium, but lower-grade North American sources require innovative purification methods to compete with high-purity South American brines.

Method: The study introduces a HITL-assisted active learning framework, combining human expertise with data-driven insights to optimize continuous crystallization.

Result: The framework improves impurity tolerance (e.g., magnesium) from a few hundred ppm to 6000 ppm, making low-grade lithium resources viable without quality loss.

Conclusion: This breakthrough enhances the economic viability of North American lithium reserves and supports a sustainable global lithium supply chain.

Abstract: As demand for high-purity lithium surges with the growth of the electric
vehicle (EV) industry, cost-effective extraction from lower-grade North
American sources like the Smackover Formation is critical. These resources,
unlike high-purity South American brines, require innovative purification
techniques to be economically viable. Continuous crystallization is a promising
method for producing battery-grade lithium carbonate, but its optimization is
challenged by a complex parameter space and limited data. This study introduces
a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) assisted active learning framework to optimize the
continuous crystallization of lithium carbonate. By integrating human expertise
with data-driven insights, our approach accelerates the optimization of lithium
extraction from challenging sources. Our results demonstrate the framework's
ability to rapidly adapt to new data, significantly improving the process's
tolerance to critical impurities like magnesium from the industry standard of a
few hundred ppm to as high as 6000 ppm. This breakthrough makes the
exploitation of low-grade, impurity-rich lithium resources feasible,
potentially reducing the need for extensive pre-refinement processes. By
leveraging artificial intelligence, we have refined operational parameters and
demonstrated that lower-grade materials can be used without sacrificing product
quality. This advancement is a significant step towards economically harnessing
North America's vast lithium reserves, such as those in the Smackover
Formation, and enhancing the sustainability of the global lithium supply chain.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an extended neural adjoint (ENA) framework for inverse design of optical multilayer thin films, improving accuracy, diversity, and interpretability through a novel forward neural network and material loss function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for scalable, flexible, and interpretable AI-assisted inverse design methods for optical multilayer thin films.

Method: Proposes an ENA framework with a new forward neural network architecture, material loss function, and regression activation mapping (F-RAM) for interpretability.

Result: ENA outperforms Res-GLOnet in accuracy and diversity, and F-RAM shows consistent feature importance across diverse OMT structures.

Conclusion: The ENA framework successfully meets key criteria for inverse design, offering improved performance and interpretability.

Abstract: We propose an extended neural adjoint (ENA) framework, which meets six key
criteria for artificial intelligence-assisted inverse design of optical
multilayer thin films (OMTs): accuracy, efficiency, diversity, scalability,
flexibility, and interpretability. To enhance the scalability of the existing
neural adjoint method, we present a novel forward neural network architecture
for OMTs and introduce a material loss function into the existing neural
adjoint loss function, facilitating the exploration of material configurations
of OMTs. Furthermore, we present the detailed formulation of the regression
activation mapping for the presented forward neural network architecture
(F-RAM), a feature visualization method aimed at improving interpretability. We
validated the efficacy of the material loss by conducting an ablation study,
where each component of the loss function is systematically removed and
evaluated. The results indicated that the inclusion of the material loss
significantly improves accuracy and diversity. To substantiate the performance
of the ENA-based inverse design, we compared it against the residual
network-based global optimization network (Res-GLOnet). The ENA yielded the OMT
solutions of an inverse design with higher accuracy and better diversity
compared to the Res-GLOnet. To demonstrate the interpretability, we applied
F-RAM to diverse OMT structures with similar optical properties, obtained by
the proposed ENA method. We showed that distributions of feature importance for
various OMT structures exhibiting analogous optical properties are consistent,
despite variations in material configurations, layer number, and thicknesses.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the flexibility of the ENA method by restricting
the initial layer of OMTs to SiO2 and 100 nm.

TL;DR: AI-guided control of topological defects in active fluids using reinforcement learning to manipulate dynamics and achieve robust defect transport.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how feedback control can steer topological defects in active polar fluids, leveraging non-equilibrium hydrodynamics for dynamic state transitions.

Method: Continuum hydrodynamic modeling and reinforcement learning to modulate active stress spatially, inducing flow fields for defect repositioning.

Result: Demonstrated effective control strategies for defect transport along prescribed and novel trajectories.

Conclusion: AI can learn and exploit system dynamics to control active matter, advancing adaptive material design.

Abstract: Topological defects in active polar fluids exhibit complex dynamics driven by
internally generated stresses, reflecting the deep interplay between topology,
flow, and non-equilibrium hydrodynamics. Feedback control offers a powerful
means to guide such systems, enabling transitions between dynamic states. We
investigated closed-loop steering of integer-charged defects in a confined
active fluid by modulating the spatial profile of activity. Using a continuum
hydrodynamic model, we show that localized control of active stress induces
flow fields that can reposition and direct defects along prescribed
trajectories by exploiting non-linear couplings in the system. A reinforcement
learning framework is used to discover effective control strategies that
produce robust defect transport across both trained and novel trajectories. The
results highlight how AI agents can learn the underlying dynamics and spatially
structure activity to manipulate topological excitations, offering insights
into the controllability of active matter and the design of adaptive,
self-organized materials.

*Antonio Tudisco,Deborah Volpe,Giacomo Orlandi,Giovanna Turvani*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A GNN-based predictor automates quantum hardware selection by analyzing circuit DAGs, achieving 94.4% accuracy and reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The diversity of quantum hardware technologies makes manual selection inefficient and unscalable.

Method: Uses a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to analyze quantum circuit DAGs and predict optimal hardware.

Result: Achieves 94.4% accuracy and 85.5% F1 score for minority class, outperforming brute-force methods.

Conclusion: The GNN-based approach efficiently automates hardware selection, improving scalability and performance.

Abstract: The growing variety of quantum hardware technologies, each with unique
peculiarities such as connectivity and native gate sets, creates challenges
when selecting the best platform for executing a specific quantum circuit. This
selection process usually involves a brute-force approach: compiling the
circuit on various devices and evaluating performance based on factors such as
circuit depth and gate fidelity. However, this method is computationally
expensive and does not scale well as the number of available quantum processors
increases. In this work, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based
predictor that automates hardware selection by analyzing the Directed Acyclic
Graph (DAG) representation of a quantum circuit. Our study evaluates 498
quantum circuits (up to 27 qubits) from the MQT Bench dataset, compiled using
Qiskit on four devices: three superconducting quantum processors (IBM-Kyiv,
IBM-Brisbane, IBM-Sherbrooke) and one trapped-ion processor (IONQ-Forte).
Performance is estimated using a metric that integrates circuit depth and gate
fidelity, resulting in a dataset where 93 circuits are optimally compiled on
the trapped-ion device, while the remaining circuits prefer superconducting
platforms. By exploiting graph-based machine learning, our approach avoids
extracting the circuit features for the model evaluation but directly embeds it
as a graph, significantly accelerating the optimal target decision-making
process and maintaining all the information. Experimental results prove 94.4%
accuracy and an 85.5% F1 score for the minority class, effectively predicting
the best compilation target. The developed code is publicly available on GitHub
(https://github.com/antotu/GNN-Model-Quantum-Predictor).

Abstract: Self-Attention Mechanisms (SAMs) enhance model performance by extracting key

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the efficiency and quality of variational calculations in quantum many-body physics using NQS, while minimizing computational resources.

Method: An adaptive technique trains small RNNs and reuses them to initialize larger RNNs, reducing training fluctuations and computational costs.

Result: The method successfully optimizes NQSs, improving ground state calculations for prototypical models in one- and two-spatial dimensions.

Conclusion: The adaptive scheme enables efficient GPU resource utilization in large-scale NQS simulations, offering a scalable approach for quantum many-body studies.

Abstract: Neural-network quantum states (NQS) are powerful neural-network ans\"atzes
that have emerged as promising tools for studying quantum many-body physics
through the lens of the variational principle. These architectures are known to
be systematically improvable by increasing the number of parameters. Here we
demonstrate an Adaptive scheme to optimize NQSs, through the example of
recurrent neural networks (RNN), using a fraction of the computation cost while
reducing training fluctuations and improving the quality of variational
calculations targeting ground states of prototypical models in one- and

*Francisco J. Beron-Vera,Gage Bonner*

Main category: nlin.CD

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LSTM and SINDy models for predicting the motion of Sargassum seaweed rafts, using a physics-inspired approach based on the eBOMB model. LSTM performs better in simpler conditions, while SINDy offers interpretability through functional relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The unpredictable motion of Sargassum seaweed rafts necessitates machine learning for prediction, as traditional models lack predictive laws for their centers of mass.

Method: The study compares LSTM RNNs and SINDy, both rooted in the eBOMB model. LSTM maps eBOMB variables to velocity differences, while SINDy uses a library of candidate functions derived from eBOMB.

Result: LSTM excels in straightforward designs and tightly bonded clumps, while SINDy provides interpretability. Both models struggle with rising complexity, like wind effects and loosely connected clumps.

Conclusion: LSTM is effective but lacks interpretability, whereas SINDy offers transparency. The integration of windowed velocity terms improves modeling of nonlocal interactions, especially for sparse rafts.

Abstract: Since 2011, rafts of floating \emph{Sargassum} seaweed have frequently
obstructed the coasts of the Intra-Americas Seas. The motion of the rafts is
represented by a high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical system. Referred to as
the eBOMB model, this builds on the Maxey--Riley equation by incorporating
interactions between clumps of \emph{Sargassum} forming a raft and the effects
of Earth's rotation. The absence of a predictive law for the rafts' centers of
mass suggests a need for machine learning. In this paper, we evaluate and
contrast Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and
Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy). In both cases, a
physics-inspired closure modeling approach is taken rooted in eBOMB.
Specifically, the LSTM model learns a mapping from a collection of eBOMB
variables to the difference between raft center-of-mass and ocean velocities.
The SINDy model's library of candidate functions is suggested by eBOMB
variables and includes windowed velocity terms incorporating far-field effects
of the carrying flow. Both LSTM and SINDy models perform most effectively in
conditions with tightly bonded clumps, despite declining precision with rising
complexity, such as with wind effects and when assessing loosely connected
clumps. The LSTM model delivered the best results when designs were
straightforward, with fewer neurons and hidden layers. While LSTM model serves
as an opaque black-box model lacking interpretability, the SINDy model brings
transparency by discerning explicit functional relationships through the
function libraries. Integration of the windowed velocity terms enabled
effective modeling of nonlocal interactions, particularly in datasets featuring
sparsely connected rafts.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the problem of learning a structured approximation (low-rank,
sparse, banded, etc.) to an unknown matrix $A$ given access to matrix-vector
product (matvec) queries of the form $x \rightarrow Ax$ and $x \rightarrow
A^Tx$. This problem is of central importance to algorithms across scientific
computing and machine learning, with applications to fast multiplication and
inversion for structured matrices, building preconditioners for first-order
optimization, and as a model for differential operator learning. Prior work
focuses on obtaining query complexity upper and lower bounds for learning
specific structured matrix families that commonly arise in applications.
  We initiate the study of the problem in greater generality, aiming to
understand the query complexity of learning approximations from general matrix
families. Our main result focuses on finding a near-optimal approximation to
$A$ from any finite-sized family of matrices, $\mathcal{F}$. Standard results
from matrix sketching show that $O(\log|\mathcal{F}|)$ matvec queries suffice
in this setting. This bound can also be achieved, and is optimal, for
vector-matrix-vector queries of the form $x,y\rightarrow x^TAy$, which have
been widely studied in work on rank-$1$ matrix sensing.
  Surprisingly, we show that, in the matvec model, it is possible to obtain a
nearly quadratic improvement in complexity, to
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\log|\mathcal{F}|})$. Further, we prove that this bound is
tight up to log-log factors.Via covering number arguments, our result extends
to well-studied infinite families. As an example, we establish that a
near-optimal approximation from any \emph{linear matrix family} of dimension
$q$ can be learned with $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{q})$ matvec queries, improving on an
$O(q)$ bound achievable via sketching techniques and vector-matrix-vector
queries.

Motivation: To enhance the study of materials science by enabling the calculation of Gibbs free energy gradients with respect to atomic coordinates and existence, facilitating grand canonical optimization.

Method: Extends the message passing formalism in graph neural networks with a continuous variable for fractional atomic existence, allowing gradient calculations for Gibbs free energy.

Result: Proposes a gradient-based grand canonical optimization method, demonstrated for a Cu(110) surface oxide.

Conclusion: The inclusion of fractional atomic existence in message passing improves the capability of interatomic potentials, enabling efficient grand canonical optimization for materials science applications.

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials have become an indispensable tool for
materials science, enabling the study of larger systems and longer timescales.
State-of-the-art models are generally graph neural networks that employ message
passing to iteratively update atomic embeddings that are ultimately used for
predicting properties. In this work we extend the message passing formalism
with the inclusion of a continuous variable that accounts for fractional atomic
existence. This allows us to calculate the gradient of the Gibbs free energy
with respect to both the Cartesian coordinates of atoms and their existence.
Using this we propose a gradient-based grand canonical optimization method and

Result: Tested on a 68,800-segment pavement network, the DRL framework outperformed traditional methods like Progressive Linear Programming and genetic algorithms in efficiency and performance.

Conclusion: The DRL framework advances infrastructure asset management and demonstrates the potential of reinforcement learning in large-scale, complex environments.

Abstract: Infrastructure asset management is essential for sustaining the performance
of public infrastructure such as road networks, bridges, and utility networks.
Traditional maintenance and rehabilitation planning methods often face
scalability and computational challenges, particularly for large-scale networks
with thousands of assets under budget constraints. This paper presents a novel
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that optimizes asset management
strategies for large infrastructure networks. By decomposing the network-level
Markov Decision Process (MDP) into individual asset-level MDPs while using a
unified neural network architecture, the proposed framework reduces
computational complexity, improves learning efficiency, and enhances
scalability. The framework directly incorporates annual budget constraints
through a budget allocation mechanism, ensuring maintenance plans are both
optimal and cost-effective. Through a case study on a large-scale pavement
network of 68,800 segments, the proposed DRL framework demonstrates significant
improvements over traditional methods like Progressive Linear Programming and
genetic algorithms, both in efficiency and network performance. This
advancement contributes to infrastructure asset management and the broader
application of reinforcement learning in complex, large-scale environments.

### [270] [Linearly Convergent Algorithms for Nonsmooth Problems with Unknown Smooth Pieces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19465)
*Zhe Zhang,Suvrit Sra*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper introduces efficient algorithms for optimizing piecewise smooth (PWS) functions with unknown domain partitions, achieving global linear convergence and improving complexity benchmarks. It also proposes a verifiable termination criterion for PWS optimization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of optimizing PWS functions where the domain partition is unknown, a problem lacking efficient solutions with global convergence guarantees.

Method: The authors propose a bundle-level (BL) type method for PWS functions with quadratic growth (QG), extend it to handle approximately PWS functions and weakly-convex problems, and introduce a verifiable termination criterion.

Result: The method achieves global linear convergence for PWS functions with QG, improves complexity benchmarks, and provides a tight optimality gap characterization.

Conclusion: The paper presents a significant advancement in PWS optimization with efficient, parameter-free algorithms and verifiable termination criteria.

Abstract: We develop efficient algorithms for optimizing piecewise smooth (PWS)
functions where the underlying partition of the domain into smooth pieces is
\emph{unknown}. For PWS functions satisfying a quadratic growth (QG) condition,
we propose a bundle-level (BL) type method that achieves global linear
convergence -- to our knowledge, the first such result for any algorithm for
this problem class. We extend this method to handle approximately PWS functions
and to solve weakly-convex PWS problems, improving the state-of-the-art
complexity to match the benchmark for smooth non-convex optimization.
Furthermore, we introduce the first verifiable and accurate termination
criterion for PWS optimization. Similar to the gradient norm in smooth
optimization, this certificate tightly characterizes the optimality gap under
the QG condition, and can moreover be evaluated without knowledge of any
problem parameters. We develop a search subroutine for this certificate and
embed it within a guess-and-check framework, resulting in an almost
parameter-free algorithm for both the convex QG and weakly-convex settings.

### [271] [Bespoke multiresolution analysis of graph signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19181)
*Giacomo Elefante,Gianluca Giacchi,Michael Multerer,Jacopo Quizi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A novel framework for discrete multiresolution analysis of graph signals using samplet transforms, outperforming Haar wavelets in compression and fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend wavelet-like analysis to graph signals by leveraging samplets, ensuring orthogonality, locality, and vanishing moments for efficient compression and analysis.

Method: Define samplets on graphs by partitioning graphs into patches, embedding patches into Euclidean space for samplet construction, and mapping back to the graph. Combines heavy edge clustering and landmark Isomap for implementation.

Result: Demonstrates robustness, scalability, and sparse representations with controllable error, outperforming Haar wavelets in compression and multiresolution fidelity.

Conclusion: The framework broadens the class of graph signals that can be efficiently analyzed and compressed, offering superior performance over traditional methods.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for discrete multiresolution analysis of graph
signals. The main analytical tool is the samplet transform, originally defined
in the Euclidean framework as a discrete wavelet-like construction, tailored to
the analysis of scattered data. The first contribution of this work is defining
samplets on graphs. To this end, we subdivide the graph into a fixed number of
patches, embed each patch into a Euclidean space, where we construct samplets,
and eventually pull the construction back to the graph. This ensures
orthogonality, locality, and the vanishing moments property with respect to
properly defined polynomial spaces on graphs. Compared to classical Haar
wavelets, this framework broadens the class of graph signals that can
efficiently be compressed and analyzed. Along this line, we provide a
definition of a class of signals that can be compressed using our construction.
We support our findings with different examples of signals defined on graphs
whose vertices lie on smooth manifolds. For efficient numerical implementation,
we combine heavy edge clustering, to partition the graph into meaningful
patches, with landmark \texttt{Isomap}, which provides low-dimensional
embeddings for each patch. Our results demonstrate the method's robustness,
scalability, and ability to yield sparse representations with controllable
approximation error, significantly outperforming traditional Haar wavelet
approaches in terms of compression efficiency and multiresolution fidelity.

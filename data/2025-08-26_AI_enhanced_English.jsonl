We employ Vision Transformer\n(ViT) and Swin Transformer architectures to extract imaging features, which are\nfused with longitudinal clinical inputs to model cognitive progression. Our\nresults show that incorporating sub-score learning improves global score\nprediction. Subscore level analysis reveals that a small subset especially Q1\n(Word Recall), Q4 (Delayed Recall), and Q8 (Word Recognition) consistently\ndominates the predicted global score. However, some of these influential\nsub-scores exhibit high prediction errors, pointing to model instability.\nFurther analysis suggests that this is caused by clinical feature dominance,\nwhere the model prioritizes easily predictable clinical scores over more\ncomplex MRI derived features. These findings emphasize the need for improved\nmultimodal fusion and adaptive loss weighting to achieve more balanced\nlearning. Our study demonstrates the value of sub score informed modeling and\nprovides insights into building more interpretable and clinically robust AD\nprediction frameworks.

Moreover, most recalibration methods have been evaluated using\nonly a small subset of metrics, leaving it unclear whether improvements\ngeneralize across different notions of calibration. In this work, we\nsystematically extract and categorize regression calibration metrics from the\nliterature and benchmark these metrics independently of specific modelling\nmethods or recalibration approaches. Through controlled experiments with\nreal-world, synthetic and artificially miscalibrated data, we demonstrate that\ncalibration metrics frequently produce conflicting results. Our analysis\nreveals substantial inconsistencies: many metrics disagree in their evaluation\nof the same recalibration result, and some even indicate contradictory\nconclusions. This inconsistency is particularly concerning as it potentially\nallows cherry-picking of metrics to create misleading impressions of success.\nWe identify the Expected Normalized Calibration Error (ENCE) and the Coverage\nWidth-based Criterion (CWC) as the most dependable metrics in our tests.

To evaluate generalization in\nreal-world scenarios, we curate and annotate a WeChat-based test set comprising\nreal-world multimodal dialogues with an average of 75.38 turns. Building on\nthese resources, we explore existing generation-based Vision-Language Models\n(VLMs) on FFR and observe that they often retrieve incoherent utterance-image\nfragments. While optimized for generating responses from visual-textual inputs,\nthese models lack explicit supervision to ensure semantic coherence within\nretrieved fragments. To this end, we propose F2RVLM, a generative retrieval\nmodel trained in a two-stage paradigm: (1) supervised fine-tuning to inject\nfragment-level retrieval knowledge, and (2) GRPO-based reinforcement learning\nwith multi-objective rewards promoting semantic precision, relevance, and\ncontextual coherence. To handle varying intra-fragment complexity, from locally\ndense to sparsely distributed, we introduce difficulty-aware curriculum\nsampling that ranks training instances by model-predicted difficulty and\ngradually exposes the model to harder samples. This boosts reasoning ability in\nlong, multi-turn contexts.

Powered by this abstraction, TokenLake can manage prefix\ncache at the segment level with a heavy-hitter-aware load balancing algorithm\nto achieve better cache load balance, deduplication, and defragmentation.\nTokenLake also transparently minimizes the communication volume of query\ntensors and new caches. Based on TokenLake, the scheduler can schedule requests\nelastically by using existing techniques without considering prefix cache\nmanagement. Evaluations on real-world workloads show that TokenLake can improve\nthroughput by up to 2.6$\\times$ and 2.0$\\times$ and boost hit rate by\n2.0$\\times$ and 2.1$\\times$, compared to state-of-the-art cache-aware routing\nand cache-centric PD-disaggregation solutions, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "TokenLake is a unified segment-level prefix cache pool that improves cluster-level prefix caching through better load balancing, deduplication, and defragmentation, achieving significant throughput and hit rate improvements.", "motivation": "Existing prefix caching systems are tightly coupled with request scheduling, causing load imbalance, data redundancy, and memory fragmentation across instances.

Arnold\ncombines behavior cloning and fine-tuning with PPO to achieve expert or\nsuper-expert performance in 14 challenging control tasks from dexterous object\nmanipulation to locomotion. A key innovation is Arnold's sensorimotor\nvocabulary, a compositional representation of the semantics of heterogeneous\nsensory modalities, objectives, and actuators. Arnold leverages this vocabulary\nvia a transformer architecture to deal with the variable observation and action\nspaces of each task. This framework supports efficient multi-task,\nmulti-embodiment learning and facilitates rapid adaptation to novel tasks.\nFinally, we analyze Arnold to provide insights into biological motor control,\ncorroborating recent findings on the limited transferability of muscle\nsynergies across tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Arnold is a generalist policy that masters multiple tasks and embodiments in musculoskeletal control, achieving expert performance in 14 challenging tasks through behavior cloning, PPO fine-tuning, and a novel sensorimotor vocabulary with transformer architecture.", "motivation": "Current machine learning policies for musculoskeletal models are specialists that excel at single skills but lack generalization.

Dengue outbreaks are a major public health issue, with Brazil\nreporting 71% of global cases in 2024. Purpose. This study aims to describe the\nprofile of severe dengue patients admitted to Brazilian Intensive Care units\n(ICUs) (2012-2024), assess trends over time, describe new onset complications\nwhile in ICU and determine the risk factors at admission to develop\ncomplications during ICU stay. Methods. We performed a prospective study of\ndengue patients from 253 ICUs across 56 hospitals. We used descriptive\nstatistics to describe the dengue ICU population, logistic regression to\nidentify risk factors for complications during the ICU stay, and a machine\nlearning framework to predict the risk of evolving to complications.\nVisualisations were generated using ISARIC VERTEX. Results. Of 11,047\nadmissions, 1,117 admissions (10.1%) evolved to complications, including\nnon-invasive (437 admissions) and invasive ventilation (166), vasopressor\n(364), blood transfusion (353) and renal replacement therapy (103). Age>80 (OR:\n3.10, 95% CI: 2.02-4.92), chronic kidney disease (OR: 2.94, 2.22-3.89), liver\ncirrhosis (OR: 3.65, 1.82-7.04), low platelets (<50,000 cells/mm3; OR: OR:\n2.25, 1.89-2.68), and high leukocytes (>7,000 cells/mm3; OR: 2.47, 2.02-3.03)\nwere significant risk factors for complications. A machine learning tool for\npredicting complications was proposed, showing accurate discrimination and\ncalibration. Conclusion. We described a large cohort of dengue patients\nadmitted to ICUs and identified key risk factors for severe dengue\ncomplications, such as advanced age, presence of comorbidities, higher level of\nleukocytes and lower level of platelets.

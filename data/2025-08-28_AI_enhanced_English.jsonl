In this paper, we introduce ALSA (Anchors\nin Logit Space for Accuracy estimation), a novel framework that preserves\nricher information by operating directly in the logit space. Building on\ntheoretical insights and empirical observations, we demonstrate that the\naggregation and distribution of logits exhibit a strong correlation with the\npredictive performance of the model. To exploit this property, ALSA employs an\nanchor-based modeling strategy: multiple learnable anchors are initialized in\nlogit space, each assigned an influence function that captures subtle\nvariations in the logits. This allows ALSA to provide robust and accurate\nperformance estimates across a wide range of distribution shifts. Extensive\nexperiments on vision, language, and graph benchmarks demonstrate ALSA's\nsuperiority over both softmax- and similarity-based baselines. Notably, ALSA's\nrobustness under significant distribution shifts highlights its potential as a\npractical tool for reliable model evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "ALSA is a novel framework that estimates model accuracy on unseen datasets by operating directly in logit space using anchor-based modeling, outperforming existing softmax- and similarity-based methods.", "motivation": "Existing accuracy estimation methods suffer from information loss (softmax-based) or computational expense/domain-specific limitations (similarity-based), especially under distribution shifts.", "method": "ALSA uses multiple learnable anchors in logit space with influence functions to capture subtle logit variations, preserving richer information than probability-based approaches.", "result": "Extensive experiments on vision, language, and graph benchmarks show ALSA's superiority over both softmax- and similarity-based baselines, with strong robustness under distribution shifts.", "conclusion": "ALSA provides robust and accurate performance estimates across diverse distribution shifts, making it a practical tool for reliable model evaluation in real-world applications."}}

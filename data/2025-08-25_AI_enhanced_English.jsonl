We argue\nthat continuing improvements in AI's capabilities poses additional risks on two\nfronts: First, increased usage of AI will alter the economics of the marginal\ncyberattack and expose these trailing-edge organizations to more attackers,\nmore frequently. Second, AI's advances will enable attackers to develop\nexploits and launch attacks earlier than they can today--meaning that it is\ninsufficient for these companies to attain parity with today's leading\ndefenders, but must instead aim for faster remediation timelines and more\nresilient software.

### [1] [A Strong View-Free Baseline Approach for Single-View Image Guided Point Cloud Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15747)
*Fangzhou Lin,Zilin Dai,Rigved Sanku,Songlin Hou,Kazunori D Yamada,Haichong K. Zhang,Ziming Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A view-free, attention-based multi-branch encoder-decoder network for point cloud completion outperforms image-guided methods, questioning the necessity of image guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the fundamental necessity of image guidance in single-view image guided point cloud completion (SVIPC) tasks.

Method: Proposes a view-free, attention-based multi-branch encoder-decoder network with hierarchical self-fusion (cross-attention and self-attention) for feature integration.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art SVIPC methods on the ShapeNet-ViPC dataset.

Conclusion: The findings challenge the necessity of image guidance in SVIPC and offer insights for multimodal learning development.

Abstract: The single-view image guided point cloud completion (SVIPC) task aims to
reconstruct a complete point cloud from a partial input with the help of a
single-view image. While previous works have demonstrated the effectiveness of
this multimodal approach, the fundamental necessity of image guidance remains
largely unexamined. To explore this, we propose a strong baseline approach for
SVIPC based on an attention-based multi-branch encoder-decoder network that
only takes partial point clouds as input, view-free. Our hierarchical
self-fusion mechanism, driven by cross-attention and self-attention layers,
effectively integrates information across multiple streams, enriching feature
representations and strengthening the networks ability to capture geometric
structures. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the ShapeNet-ViPC
dataset demonstrate that our view-free framework performs superiorly to
state-of-the-art SVIPC methods. We hope our findings provide new insights into
the development of multimodal learning in SVIPC. Our demo code will be
available at https://github.com/Zhang-VISLab.

### [2] [VLMInferSlow: Evaluating the Efficiency Robustness of Large Vision-Language Models as a Service](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15755)
*Xiasi Wang,Tianliang Yao,Simin Chen,Runqi Wang,Lei YE,Kuofeng Gao,Yi Huang,Yuan Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMInferSlow evaluates VLM efficiency robustness in black-box settings, increasing computational costs by up to 128.47% with adversarial images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLM research focuses on accuracy, neglecting efficiency robustness, which is critical for real-time applications. Current evaluations are unrealistic, requiring model access, unlike ML-as-a-service settings.

Method: Proposes VLMInferSlow, using fine-grained efficiency modeling and zero-order optimization to find adversarial examples in black-box settings.

Result: Generates adversarial images with imperceptible perturbations, increasing computational cost by up to 128.47%.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for efficiency robustness awareness in VLM research, especially in practical deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated great potential in real-world
applications. While existing research primarily focuses on improving their
accuracy, the efficiency remains underexplored. Given the real-time demands of
many applications and the high inference overhead of VLMs, efficiency
robustness is a critical issue. However, previous studies evaluate efficiency
robustness under unrealistic assumptions, requiring access to the model
architecture and parameters -- an impractical scenario in ML-as-a-service
settings, where VLMs are deployed via inference APIs. To address this gap, we
propose VLMInferSlow, a novel approach for evaluating VLM efficiency robustness
in a realistic black-box setting. VLMInferSlow incorporates fine-grained
efficiency modeling tailored to VLM inference and leverages zero-order
optimization to search for adversarial examples. Experimental results show that
VLMInferSlow generates adversarial images with imperceptible perturbations,
increasing the computational cost by up to 128.47%. We hope this research
raises the community's awareness about the efficiency robustness of VLMs.

### [3] [Weakly-supervised VLM-guided Partial Contrastive Learning for Visual Language Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15757)
*Ruoyu Wang,Tong Yu,Junda Wu,Yao Liu,Julian McAuley,Lina Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Weakly-supervised Partial Contrastive Learning (WPCL) to improve Visual Language Navigation (VLN) by addressing challenges like dynamic viewpoints and high computational costs of fine-tuning pre-trained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLN methods struggle with dynamic viewpoints, lack domain knowledge in pre-trained models, and face high computational costs when fine-tuning.

Method: WPCL integrates pre-trained VLM knowledge without fine-tuning, enhancing object identification from dynamic viewpoints.

Result: WPCL outperforms baseline methods on multiple benchmarks, showing effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability.

Conclusion: WPCL offers a computationally efficient solution to improve VLN performance without fine-tuning pre-trained models.

Abstract: Visual Language Navigation (VLN) is a fundamental task within the field of
Embodied AI, focusing on the ability of agents to navigate complex environments
based on natural language instructions. Despite the progress made by existing
methods, these methods often present some common challenges. First, they rely
on pre-trained backbone models for visual perception, which struggle with the
dynamic viewpoints in VLN scenarios. Second, the performance is limited when
using pre-trained LLMs or VLMs without fine-tuning, due to the absence of VLN
domain knowledge. Third, while fine-tuning LLMs and VLMs can improve results,
their computational costs are higher than those without fine-tuning. To address
these limitations, we propose Weakly-supervised Partial Contrastive Learning
(WPCL), a method that enhances an agent's ability to identify objects from
dynamic viewpoints in VLN scenarios by effectively integrating pre-trained VLM
knowledge into the perception process, without requiring VLM fine-tuning. Our
method enhances the agent's ability to interpret and respond to environmental
cues while ensuring computational efficiency. Experimental results have shown
that our method outperforms the baseline methods on multiple benchmarks, which
validate the effectiveness, robustness and generalizability of our method.

### [4] [Implicit 3D scene reconstruction using deep learning towards efficient collision understanding in autonomous driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15806)
*Akarshani Ramanayake,Nihal Kodikara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a learning-based 3D scene reconstruction method using LiDAR data and deep neural networks to create static Signed Distance Function (SDF) maps for autonomous vehicles in dense traffic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current technologies lack precision in 3D scene reconstruction for dense traffic, especially in boundary-level accuracy. The sign distance function offers efficient storage and better obstacle mapping.

Method: Uses LiDAR data and a deep neural network to build static SDF maps, improving boundary-level detail compared to traditional polygonal representations.

Result: Preliminary results show enhanced collision detection performance in congested and dynamic environments.

Conclusion: The method addresses a gap in literature by providing more accurate 3D obstacle mapping, benefiting autonomous navigation in dense urban settings.

Abstract: In crowded urban environments where traffic is dense, current technologies
struggle to oversee tight navigation, but surface-level understanding allows
autonomous vehicles to safely assess proximity to surrounding obstacles. 3D or
2D scene mapping of the surrounding objects is an essential task in addressing
the above problem. Despite its importance in dense vehicle traffic conditions,
3D scene reconstruction of object shapes with higher boundary level accuracy is
not yet entirely considered in current literature. The sign distance function
represents any shape through parameters that calculate the distance from any
point in space to the closest obstacle surface, making it more efficient in
terms of storage. In recent studies, researchers have started to formulate
problems with Implicit 3D reconstruction methods in the autonomous driving
domain, highlighting the possibility of using sign distance function to map
obstacles effectively. This research addresses this gap by developing a
learning-based 3D scene reconstruction methodology that leverages LiDAR data
and a deep neural network to build a the static Signed Distance Function (SDF)
maps. Unlike traditional polygonal representations, this approach has the
potential to map 3D obstacle shapes with more boundary-level details. Our
preliminary results demonstrate that this method would significantly enhance
collision detection performance, particularly in congested and dynamic
environments.

### [5] [ADAM-Dehaze: Adaptive Density-Aware Multi-Stage Dehazing for Improved Object Detection in Foggy Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15837)
*Fatmah AlHindaassi,Mohammed Talha Alam,Fakhri Karray*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADAM-Dehaze is an adaptive dehazing framework that improves image restoration and object detection in foggy conditions by classifying haze density and routing images through tailored processing branches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fog degrades visual information, challenging autonomous vehicles and surveillance systems, necessitating adaptive solutions for varying fog intensities.

Method: Uses a Haze Density Estimation Network (HDEN) to classify fog intensity and routes images through one of three CORUN branches (Light, Medium, Complex) for optimized processing. Introduces an adaptive loss for balancing physical-model coherence and perceptual fidelity.

Result: Improves PSNR by 2.1 dB, reduces FADE by 30%, increases object detection mAP by 13 points, and cuts inference time by 20% on Cityscapes and RTTS benchmarks.

Conclusion: ADAM-Dehaze demonstrates the effectiveness of intensity-specific processing and seamless integration with downstream vision tasks.

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions, particularly fog, pose a significant challenge to
autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, and other safety-critical
applications by severely degrading visual information. We introduce
ADAM-Dehaze, an adaptive, density-aware dehazing framework that jointly
optimizes image restoration and object detection under varying fog intensities.
A lightweight Haze Density Estimation Network (HDEN) classifies each input as
light, medium, or heavy fog. Based on this score, the system dynamically routes
the image through one of three CORUN branches: Light, Medium, or Complex, each
tailored to its haze regime. A novel adaptive loss balances physical-model
coherence and perceptual fidelity, ensuring both accurate defogging and
preservation of fine details. On Cityscapes and the real-world RTTS benchmark,
ADAM-Dehaze improves PSNR by up to 2.1 dB, reduces FADE by 30 percent, and
increases object detection mAP by up to 13 points, while cutting inference time
by 20 percent. These results highlight the importance of intensity-specific
processing and seamless integration with downstream vision tasks. Code

### [6] [EchoShot: Multi-Shot Portrait Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15838)
*Jiahao Wang,Hualian Sheng,Sijia Cai,Weizhan Zhang,Caixia Yan,Yachuang Feng,Bing Deng,Jieping Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoShot is a scalable multi-shot framework for portrait video generation, ensuring identity consistency and content control, built on a video diffusion model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video diffusion models are limited to single-shot creation, while real-world applications require multi-shot consistency and controllability.

Method: Proposes shot-aware position embedding in a video diffusion transformer to model inter-shot variations and text-content correspondence, trained on the PortraitGala dataset.

Result: Achieves superior identity consistency and attribute-level controllability in multi-shot portrait video generation.

Conclusion: EchoShot is a foundational paradigm for general multi-shot video modeling, with potential for broader applications.

Abstract: Video diffusion models substantially boost the productivity of artistic
workflows with high-quality portrait video generative capacity. However,
prevailing pipelines are primarily constrained to single-shot creation, while
real-world applications urge for multiple shots with identity consistency and
flexible content controllability. In this work, we propose EchoShot, a native
and scalable multi-shot framework for portrait customization built upon a
foundation video diffusion model. To start with, we propose shot-aware position
embedding mechanisms within video diffusion transformer architecture to model
inter-shot variations and establish intricate correspondence between multi-shot
visual content and their textual descriptions. This simple yet effective design
enables direct training on multi-shot video data without introducing additional
computational overhead. To facilitate model training within multi-shot
scenario, we construct PortraitGala, a large-scale and high-fidelity
human-centric video dataset featuring cross-shot identity consistency and
fine-grained captions such as facial attributes, outfits, and dynamic motions.
To further enhance applicability, we extend EchoShot to perform reference
image-based personalized multi-shot generation and long video synthesis with
infinite shot counts. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that EchoShot achieves
superior identity consistency as well as attribute-level controllability in
multi-shot portrait video generation. Notably, the proposed framework
demonstrates potential as a foundational paradigm for general multi-shot video
modeling.

### [7] [Assessing the impact of Binarization for Writer Identification in Greek Papyrus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15852)
*Dominic Akt,Marco Peer,Florian Kleber*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper compares traditional and DL-based binarization methods for Greek papyri, evaluating their impact on writer identification. Data augmentation and model selection criteria are tested, with results showing a strong link between binarization quality and identification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Writer identification in Greek papyri is hindered by non-uniform, fragmented backgrounds. Effective binarization is crucial to avoid learning irrelevant features.

Method: Traditional and DL binarization methods are compared, with DL models trained using custom data augmentation and varied selection criteria. Performance is tested on DIBCO 2019 and evaluated for writer identification.

Result: DL methods with data augmentation perform best. Binarization quality strongly correlates with writer identification accuracy.

Conclusion: Effective binarization, especially with DL and augmentation, significantly improves writer identification in historical documents.

Abstract: This paper tackles the task of writer identification for Greek papyri. A
common preprocessing step in writer identification pipelines is image
binarization, which prevents the model from learning background features. This
is challenging in historical documents, in our case Greek papyri, as background
is often non-uniform, fragmented, and discolored with visible fiber structures.
We compare traditional binarization methods to state-of-the-art Deep Learning
(DL) models, evaluating the impact of binarization quality on subsequent writer
identification performance. DL models are trained with and without a custom
data augmentation technique, as well as different model selection criteria are
applied. The performance of these binarization methods, is then systematically
evaluated on the DIBCO 2019 dataset. The impact of binarization on writer
identification is subsequently evaluated using a state-of-the-art approach for
writer identification. The results of this analysis highlight the influence of
data augmentation for DL methods. Furthermore, findings indicate a strong
correlation between binarization effectiveness on papyri documents of DIBCO
2019 and downstream writer identification performance.

### [8] [Privacy-Preserving in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles Through Vision to Text Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15854)
*Abdolazim Rezaei,Mehdi Sookhak,Ahmad Patooghy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel privacy-preserving framework for CAVs uses RL and VLMs to convert images into text, balancing privacy and semantic accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy risks in AIE cameras by moving beyond traditional methods like face blurring.

Method: Feedback-based RL and VLMs to transform images into semantically rich text, refined hierarchically.

Result: 77% increase in Unique Word Count and 50% in Detail Density, improving privacy and textual quality.

Conclusion: The framework effectively protects privacy while retaining scene-relevant information, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) rely on a range of devices that
often process privacy-sensitive data. Among these, roadside units play a
critical role particularly through the use of AI-equipped (AIE) cameras for
applications such as violation detection. However, the privacy risks associated
with captured imagery remain a major concern, as such data can be misused for
identity theft, profiling, or unauthorized commercial purposes. While
traditional techniques such as face blurring and obfuscation have been applied
to mitigate privacy risks, individual privacy remains at risk, as individuals
can still be tracked using other features such as their clothing. This paper
introduces a novel privacy-preserving framework that leverages feedback-based
reinforcement learning (RL) and vision-language models (VLMs) to protect
sensitive visual information captured by AIE cameras. The main idea is to
convert images into semantically equivalent textual descriptions, ensuring that
scene-relevant information is retained while visual privacy is preserved. A
hierarchical RL strategy is employed to iteratively refine the generated text,
enhancing both semantic accuracy and privacy. Evaluation results demonstrate
significant improvements in both privacy protection and textual quality, with
the Unique Word Count increasing by approximately 77\% and Detail Density by
around 50\% compared to existing approaches.

### [9] [Visual symbolic mechanisms: Emergent symbol processing in vision language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15871)
*Rim Assouel,Declan Campbell,Taylor Webb*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores how vision language models (VLMs) solve the 'binding problem' using emergent symbolic mechanisms, identifying failures in these mechanisms as the cause of binding errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether VLMs employ symbol-like, content-independent indices for feature binding, given their persistent failures in binding tasks.

Method: Investigates emergent symbolic mechanisms in VLMs, focusing on a content-independent, spatial indexing scheme.

Result: Identifies symbolic mechanisms in VLMs that support binding and traces binding errors to failures in these mechanisms.

Conclusion: The findings reveal symbol-like processing in VLMs and suggest ways to address their binding failures.

Abstract: To accurately process a visual scene, observers must bind features together
to represent individual objects. This capacity is necessary, for instance, to
distinguish an image containing a red square and a blue circle from an image
containing a blue square and a red circle. Recent work has found that language
models solve this 'binding problem' via a set of symbol-like,
content-independent indices, but it is unclear whether similar mechanisms are
employed by vision language models (VLMs). This question is especially
relevant, given the persistent failures of VLMs on tasks that require binding.
Here, we identify a set of emergent symbolic mechanisms that support binding in
VLMs via a content-independent, spatial indexing scheme. Moreover, we find that
binding errors can be traced directly to failures in these mechanisms. Taken
together, these results shed light on the mechanisms that support symbol-like
processing in VLMs, and suggest possible avenues for addressing the persistent
binding failures exhibited by these models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PanSegNet, a DL algorithm for pediatric pancreas segmentation on MRI, was validated with high accuracy in healthy and diseased children, showing expert-level performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for a reliable, radiation-free tool for pediatric pancreatic imaging, especially in acute and chronic pancreatitis cases.

Method: Retrospective analysis of 84 MRI scans from children, using manual segmentation by radiologists and validation via DSC, HD95, and Cohen's kappa.

Result: PanSegNet achieved DSC scores of 88% (controls), 81% (AP), and 80% (CP), with strong inter- and intra-observer agreement.

Conclusion: PanSegNet is a validated, expert-level tool for pediatric pancreatic MRI segmentation, freely available to advance research in this underserved area.

Abstract: Objective: Our study aimed to evaluate and validate PanSegNet, a deep
learning (DL) algorithm for pediatric pancreas segmentation on MRI in children
with acute pancreatitis (AP), chronic pancreatitis (CP), and healthy controls.
Methods: With IRB approval, we retrospectively collected 84 MRI scans (1.5T/3T
Siemens Aera/Verio) from children aged 2-19 years at Gazi University
(2015-2024). The dataset includes healthy children as well as patients
diagnosed with AP or CP based on clinical criteria. Pediatric and general
radiologists manually segmented the pancreas, then confirmed by a senior
pediatric radiologist. PanSegNet-generated segmentations were assessed using
Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and 95th percentile Hausdorff distance
(HD95). Cohen's kappa measured observer agreement. Results: Pancreas MRI T2W
scans were obtained from 42 children with AP/CP (mean age: 11.73 +/- 3.9 years)
and 42 healthy children (mean age: 11.19 +/- 4.88 years). PanSegNet achieved
DSC scores of 88% (controls), 81% (AP), and 80% (CP), with HD95 values of 3.98
mm (controls), 9.85 mm (AP), and 15.67 mm (CP). Inter-observer kappa was 0.86
(controls), 0.82 (pancreatitis), and intra-observer agreement reached 0.88 and
0.81. Strong agreement was observed between automated and manual volumes (R^2 =
0.85 in controls, 0.77 in diseased), demonstrating clinical reliability.
Conclusion: PanSegNet represents the first validated deep learning solution for
pancreatic MRI segmentation, achieving expert-level performance across healthy
and diseased states. This tool, algorithm, along with our annotated dataset,
are freely available on GitHub and OSF, advancing accessible, radiation-free
pediatric pancreatic imaging and fostering collaborative research in this
underserved domain.

### [11] [MoiréXNet: Adaptive Multi-Scale Demoiréing with Linear Attention Test-Time Training and Truncated Flow Matching Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15929)
*Liangyan Li,Yimo Ning,Kevin Le,Wei Dong,Yunzhe Li,Jun Chen,Xiaohong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid MAP-based framework combines supervised learning with a generative prior for effective image and video demoiréing, addressing nonlinear degradation challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with nonlinear moiré patterns, producing incomplete removal or overly smooth results due to limited model capacity and training data.

Method: The framework integrates a supervised learning model with linear attention TTT modules for nonlinear mappings and a TFMP prior to refine outputs and restore details.

Result: The hybrid approach improves restoration performance by combining computational efficiency with generative refinement.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses demoiréing challenges, outperforming traditional and generative methods.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for image and video demoir\'eing by
integrating Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation with advanced deep learning
techniques. Demoir\'eing addresses inherently nonlinear degradation processes,
which pose significant challenges for existing methods.
  Traditional supervised learning approaches either fail to remove moir\'e
patterns completely or produce overly smooth results. This stems from
constrained model capacity and scarce training data, which inadequately
represent the clean image distribution and hinder accurate reconstruction of
ground-truth images. While generative models excel in image restoration for
linear degradations, they struggle with nonlinear cases such as demoir\'eing
and often introduce artifacts.
  To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid MAP-based framework that
integrates two complementary components. The first is a supervised learning
model enhanced with efficient linear attention Test-Time Training (TTT)
modules, which directly learn nonlinear mappings for RAW-to-sRGB demoir\'eing.
The second is a Truncated Flow Matching Prior (TFMP) that further refines the
outputs by aligning them with the clean image distribution, effectively
restoring high-frequency details and suppressing artifacts. These two
components combine the computational efficiency of linear attention with the
refinement abilities of generative models, resulting in improved restoration
performance.

### [12] [Beyond Audio and Pose: A General-Purpose Framework for Video Synchronization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15937)
*Yosub Shin,Igor Molybog*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoSync is a framework for video synchronization that avoids reliance on specific features like audio or visual events, offering broader applicability. It outperforms prior methods under fair conditions and introduces reproducible benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods depend on unreliable audio or visual cues, and existing benchmarks lack generality and reproducibility, limiting progress in video synchronization.

Method: VideoSync operates independently of specific feature extraction methods. It uses a CNN-based model for synchronization offset prediction and is evaluated on diverse datasets.

Result: VideoSync outperforms existing approaches, including SeSyn-Net, under fair conditions. It corrects biases in prior work and provides reproducible benchmarks.

Conclusion: VideoSync advances video synchronization by making it more generalizable and robust, suitable for real-world applications beyond domain-specific constraints.

Abstract: Video synchronization-aligning multiple video streams capturing the same
event from different angles-is crucial for applications such as reality TV show
production, sports analysis, surveillance, and autonomous systems. Prior work
has heavily relied on audio cues or specific visual events, limiting
applicability in diverse settings where such signals may be unreliable or
absent. Additionally, existing benchmarks for video synchronization lack
generality and reproducibility, restricting progress in the field. In this
work, we introduce VideoSync, a video synchronization framework that operates
independently of specific feature extraction methods, such as human pose
estimation, enabling broader applicability across different content types. We
evaluate our system on newly composed datasets covering single-human,
multi-human, and non-human scenarios, providing both the methodology and code
for dataset creation to establish reproducible benchmarks. Our analysis reveals
biases in prior SOTA work, particularly in SeSyn-Net's preprocessing pipeline,
leading to inflated performance claims. We correct these biases and propose a
more rigorous evaluation framework, demonstrating that VideoSync outperforms
existing approaches, including SeSyn-Net, under fair experimental conditions.
Additionally, we explore various synchronization offset prediction methods,
identifying a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model as the most
effective. Our findings advance video synchronization beyond domain-specific
constraints, making it more generalizable and robust for real-world
applications.

### [13] [Polyline Path Masked Attention for Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15940)
*Zhongchen Zhao,Chaodong Xiao,Hui Lin,Qi Xie,Lei Zhang,Deyu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Polyline Path Masked Attention (PPMA), combining ViTs' self-attention with Mamba2's structured mask to enhance spatial adjacency modeling in vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To integrate the strengths of ViTs (global dependency modeling) and Mamba2 (spatial adjacency prior) for improved performance in vision tasks.

Method: Enhances Mamba2's structured mask with a 2D polyline path scanning strategy, embeds it into ViTs' self-attention, and designs an efficient algorithm for mask computation.

Result: PPMA outperforms state-of-the-art models, e.g., achieving 48.7%/51.1%/52.3% mIoU on ADE20K segmentation, surpassing RMT-T/S/B.

Conclusion: PPMA effectively combines global and spatial modeling, demonstrating superior performance in vision tasks.

Abstract: Global dependency modeling and spatial position modeling are two core issues
of the foundational architecture design in current deep learning frameworks.
Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success in
computer vision, leveraging the powerful global dependency modeling capability
of the self-attention mechanism. Furthermore, Mamba2 has demonstrated its
significant potential in natural language processing tasks by explicitly
modeling the spatial adjacency prior through the structured mask. In this
paper, we propose Polyline Path Masked Attention (PPMA) that integrates the
self-attention mechanism of ViTs with an enhanced structured mask of Mamba2,
harnessing the complementary strengths of both architectures. Specifically, we
first ameliorate the traditional structured mask of Mamba2 by introducing a 2D
polyline path scanning strategy and derive its corresponding structured mask,
polyline path mask, which better preserves the adjacency relationships among
image tokens. Notably, we conduct a thorough theoretical analysis on the
structural characteristics of the proposed polyline path mask and design an
efficient algorithm for the computation of the polyline path mask. Next, we
embed the polyline path mask into the self-attention mechanism of ViTs,
enabling explicit modeling of spatial adjacency prior. Extensive experiments on
standard benchmarks, including image classification, object detection, and
segmentation, demonstrate that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art
approaches based on both state-space models and Transformers. For example, our

*Jiawen Yang,Shuhao Chen,Yucong Duan,Ke Tang,Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes HMUDA and LSB for domain adaptation across entirely distinct modalities, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of domain adaptation when source and target domains are of entirely different modalities.

Method: Introduces HMUDA and LSB, using a bridge domain and dual-branch architecture with feature consistency and domain alignment losses.

Result: LSB achieves state-of-the-art performance on six benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: LSB effectively enables knowledge transfer between distinct modalities in unsupervised domain adaptation.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods effectively bridge domain gaps
but become struggled when the source and target domains belong to entirely
distinct modalities. To address this limitation, we propose a novel setting
called Heterogeneous-Modal Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (HMUDA), which
enables knowledge transfer between completely different modalities by
leveraging a bridge domain containing unlabeled samples from both modalities.
To learn under the HMUDA setting, we propose Latent Space Bridging (LSB), a
specialized framework designed for the semantic segmentation task.
Specifically, LSB utilizes a dual-branch architecture, incorporating a feature
consistency loss to align representations across modalities and a domain
alignment loss to reduce discrepancies between class centroids across domains.
Extensive experiments conducted on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that LSB
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

### [15] [LBMamba: Locally Bi-directional Mamba](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15976)
*Jingwei Zhang,Xi Han,Hong Qin,Mahdi S. Hosseini,Dimitris Samaras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LBMamba introduces a locally bi-directional SSM block to avoid the computational cost of full backward scans in Mamba, enhancing efficiency while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Mamba-based methods use bi-directional scans to restore full receptive fields, doubling computational load and reducing efficiency.

Method: LBMamba embeds a lightweight locally backward scan inside the forward selective scan, executed in per-thread registers. LBVim alternates scan directions every two layers for global receptive fields.

Result: LBVim outperforms in accuracy (0.8%-1.6% on ImageNet), mIoU (0.6%-2.7% on ADE20K), and AP (0.9%-1.1% on COCO). It also improves WSI classification (up to 3.06% AUC).

Conclusion: LBMamba and LBVim offer superior performance-throughput trade-offs, validating their efficiency and effectiveness in vision tasks.

Abstract: Mamba, a State Space Model (SSM) that accelerates training by recasting
recurrence as a parallel selective scan, has recently emerged as a
linearly-scaling, efficient alternative to self-attention. Because of its
unidirectional nature, each state in Mamba only has information of its previous
states and is blind to states after. Current Mamba-based computer-vision
methods typically overcome this limitation by augmenting Mamba's global forward
scan with a global backward scan, forming a bi-directional scan that restores a
full receptive field. However, this operation doubles the computational load,
eroding much of the efficiency advantage that originally Mamba have. To
eliminate this extra scans, we introduce LBMamba, a locally bi-directional SSM
block that embeds a lightweight locally backward scan inside the forward
selective scan and executes it entirely in per-thread registers. Building on
LBMamba, we present LBVim, a scalable vision backbone that alternates scan
directions every two layers to recover a global receptive field without extra
backward sweeps. We validate the versatility of our approach on both natural
images and whole slide images (WSIs). We show that our LBVim constantly offers
a superior performance-throughput trade-off. That is under the same throughput,
LBVim achieves 0.8% to 1.6% higher top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K
classification dataset, 0.6% to 2.7% higher mIoU on the ADE20K semantic
segmentation dataset, 0.9% higher APb and 1.1% higher APm on the COCO detection
dataset. We also integrate LBMamba into the SOTA pathology multiple instance
learning (MIL) approach, MambaMIL, which uses single directional scan.
Experiments on 3 public WSI classification datasets for show that our method
achieves a relative improvement of up to 3.06% better AUC, 3.39% better F1,
1.67% better accuracy.

TL;DR: A novel method classifies microscopy images as time series using Dynamic Time-series Warping (DTW) and attention-based pooling, achieving reliable performance in medical image analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Microscopic pathology images are crucial for cancer diagnosis but underutilized in deep learning. The paper addresses challenges like manual acquisition and weak labels.

Method: Proposes treating microscopy images as time series, using DTW to handle varying lengths and attention-based pooling for classification.

Result: Outperforms baselines, with ablation studies validating each component's contribution. Stable and reliable results are achieved.

Conclusion: The approach elevates microscopy image analysis to a trustworthy performance level, advancing medical image analysis.

Abstract: As the frontline data for cancer diagnosis, microscopic pathology images are
fundamental for providing patients with rapid and accurate treatment. However,
despite their practical value, the deep learning community has largely
overlooked their usage. This paper proposes a novel approach to classifying
microscopy images as time series data, addressing the unique challenges posed
by their manual acquisition and weakly labeled nature. The proposed method fits
image sequences of varying lengths to a fixed-length target by leveraging
Dynamic Time-series Warping (DTW). Attention-based pooling is employed to
predict the class of the case simultaneously. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach by comparing performance with various baselines and showcasing
the benefits of using various inference strategies in achieving stable and
reliable results. Ablation studies further validate the contribution of each
component. Our approach contributes to medical image analysis by not only
embracing microscopic images but also lifting them to a trustworthy level of
performance.

*Cong Wang,Zexuan Deng,Zhiwei Jiang,Fei Shen,Yafeng Yin,Shiwei Gan,Zifeng Cheng,Shiping Ge,Qing Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SignViP is a novel framework for Sign Language Video Generation (SLVG) that uses multiple fine-grained conditions and discrete tokenization to improve video quality and expressiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SLVG methods rely on single coarse conditions, limiting naturalness and expressiveness. SignViP addresses this by incorporating fine-grained conditions.

Method: SignViP uses a Sign Video Diffusion Model, FSQ Autoencoder, and Multi-Condition Token Translator to translate text into discrete tokens and generate high-quality videos.

Result: SignViP achieves state-of-the-art performance in video quality, temporal coherence, and semantic fidelity.

Conclusion: SignViP advances SLVG by leveraging fine-grained conditions and discrete tokenization, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Sign Language Video Generation (SLVG) seeks to generate identity-preserving
sign language videos from spoken language texts. Existing methods primarily
rely on the single coarse condition (\eg, skeleton sequences) as the
intermediary to bridge the translation model and the video generation model,
which limits both the naturalness and expressiveness of the generated videos.
To overcome these limitations, we propose SignViP, a novel SLVG framework that
incorporates multiple fine-grained conditions for improved generation fidelity.
Rather than directly translating error-prone high-dimensional conditions,
SignViP adopts a discrete tokenization paradigm to integrate and represent
fine-grained conditions (\ie, fine-grained poses and 3D hands). SignViP
contains three core components. (1) Sign Video Diffusion Model is jointly
trained with a multi-condition encoder to learn continuous embeddings that
encapsulate fine-grained motion and appearance. (2) Finite Scalar Quantization
(FSQ) Autoencoder is further trained to compress and quantize these embeddings
into discrete tokens for compact representation of the conditions. (3)
Multi-Condition Token Translator is trained to translate spoken language text
to discrete multi-condition tokens. During inference, Multi-Condition Token
Translator first translates the spoken language text into discrete
multi-condition tokens. These tokens are then decoded to continuous embeddings
by FSQ Autoencoder, which are subsequently injected into Sign Video Diffusion
Model to guide video generation. Experimental results show that SignViP
achieves state-of-the-art performance across metrics, including video quality,
temporal coherence, and semantic fidelity. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes adversarial attacks on Visual Place Recognition (VPR) systems, proposes an Adversarial Attack Detector (AAD) framework, and demonstrates its performance benefits in robot navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VPR systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing risks in robot navigation. The study aims to address this by integrating AADs to improve system robustness.

Method: The paper evaluates four common and four novel VPR-specific adversarial attacks, introduces an AAD framework, and tests it in a novel experiment paradigm.

Result: AADs improve navigation performance, e.g., reducing mean along-track error by ~50% with 75% True Positive and up to 25% False Positive rates.

Conclusion: AADs are essential for trustworthy navigation, and the study provides quantitative design requirements for robust VPR systems.

Abstract: Stand-alone Visual Place Recognition (VPR) systems have little defence
against a well-designed adversarial attack, which can lead to disastrous
consequences when deployed for robot navigation. This paper extensively
analyzes the effect of four adversarial attacks common in other perception
tasks and four novel VPR-specific attacks on VPR localization performance. We
then propose how to close the loop between VPR, an Adversarial Attack Detector
(AAD), and active navigation decisions by demonstrating the performance benefit
of simulated AADs in a novel experiment paradigm -- which we detail for the
robotics community to use as a system framework. In the proposed experiment
paradigm, we see the addition of AADs across a range of detection accuracies
can improve performance over baseline; demonstrating a significant improvement
-- such as a ~50% reduction in the mean along-track localization error -- can
be achieved with True Positive and False Positive detection rates of only 75%
and up to 25% respectively. We examine a variety of metrics including:
Along-Track Error, Percentage of Time Attacked, Percentage of Time in an
`Unsafe' State, and Longest Continuous Time Under Attack. Expanding further on
these results, we provide the first investigation into the efficacy of the Fast
Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) adversarial attack for VPR. The analysis in this
work highlights the need for AADs in real-world systems for trustworthy
navigation, and informs quantitative requirements for system design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digitizing geologic maps manually is labor-intensive and time-consuming, hindering critical mineral assessments and geoscientific applications.

Method: DIGMAPPER employs a dockerized, workflow-orchestrated architecture with deep learning models for layout analysis, feature extraction, and georeferencing, using in-context learning, synthetic data, and transformers.

Result: Evaluations on 100+ maps show high accuracy in feature extraction and georeferencing, with successful deployment at USGS.

Conclusion: DIGMAPPER accelerates geospatial dataset creation, supporting national mineral assessments and broader geoscience needs.

Abstract: Historical geologic maps contain rich geospatial information, such as rock
units, faults, folds, and bedding planes, that is critical for assessing
mineral resources essential to renewable energy, electric vehicles, and
national security. However, digitizing maps remains a labor-intensive and
time-consuming task. We present DIGMAPPER, a modular, scalable system developed
in collaboration with the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to automate
the digitization of geologic maps. DIGMAPPER features a fully dockerized,
workflow-orchestrated architecture that integrates state-of-the-art deep
learning models for map layout analysis, feature extraction, and
georeferencing. To overcome challenges such as limited training data and
complex visual content, our system employs innovative techniques, including
in-context learning with large language models, synthetic data generation, and
transformer-based models. Evaluations on over 100 annotated maps from the
DARPA-USGS dataset demonstrate high accuracy across polygon, line, and point
feature extraction, and reliable georeferencing performance. Deployed at USGS,
DIGMAPPER significantly accelerates the creation of analysis-ready geospatial
datasets, supporting national-scale critical mineral assessments and broader
geoscientific applications.

*Liangjing Shao,Linxin Bai,Chenkang Du,Xinrong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework with multistep efficient finetuning improves self-supervised depth estimation in endoscopy by addressing lighting variations and sparse textures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance scene perception and navigation in robot-assisted endoscopy by tackling illumination issues and information interference.

Method: Divides training into three steps: optical flow registration, multiscale image decomposition, and multiple transformation alignments, training only relevant networks per step.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 4-10% lower error on SCARED and Hamlyn datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses challenges in endoscopic depth estimation, offering improved accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation and ego-motion estimation are significant tasks
for scene perception and navigation in stable, accurate and efficient
robot-assisted endoscopy. To tackle lighting variations and sparse textures in
endoscopic scenes, multiple techniques including optical flow, appearance flow
and intrinsic image decomposition have been introduced into the existing
methods. However, the effective training strategy for multiple modules are
still critical to deal with both illumination issues and information
interference for self-supervised depth estimation in endoscopy. Therefore, a
novel framework with multistep efficient finetuning is proposed in this work.
In each epoch of end-to-end training, the process is divided into three steps,
including optical flow registration, multiscale image decomposition and
multiple transformation alignments. At each step, only the related networks are
trained without interference of irrelevant information. Based on
parameter-efficient finetuning on the foundation model, the proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on self-supervised depth estimation on
SCARED dataset and zero-shot depth estimation on Hamlyn dataset, with
4\%$\sim$10\% lower error. The evaluation code of this work has been published

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAROAttention reorganizes visual attention patterns into block-wise forms, improving efficiency in high-resolution image and video generation without compromising quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms in visual generation leads to high computational costs, especially for long token sequences. Existing sparsification and quantization techniques struggle with low density and reduced bitwidths due to irregular attention patterns.

Method: Proposes Pattern-Aware token ReOrdering (PARO) to unify attention patterns into hardware-friendly block-wise forms, simplifying sparsification and quantization.

Result: PAROAttention achieves lossless metrics in video and image generation, matching full-precision baselines, with 20%-30% lower density and INT8/INT4 bitwidth, yielding 1.9x-2.7x speedup.

Conclusion: Reorganizing attention patterns (PARO) effectively addresses efficiency challenges in visual generation, enabling high performance with reduced computational costs.

Abstract: In visual generation, the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms
results in high memory and computational costs, especially for longer token
sequences required in high-resolution image or multi-frame video generation. To
address this, prior research has explored techniques such as sparsification and
quantization. However, these techniques face significant challenges under low
density and reduced bitwidths. Through systematic analysis, we identify that
the core difficulty stems from the dispersed and irregular characteristics of
visual attention patterns. Therefore, instead of introducing specialized
sparsification and quantization design to accommodate such patterns, we propose
an alternative strategy: *reorganizing* the attention pattern to alleviate the
challenges. Inspired by the local aggregation nature of visual feature
extraction, we design a novel **Pattern-Aware token ReOrdering (PARO)**
technique, which unifies the diverse attention patterns into a
hardware-friendly block-wise pattern. This unification substantially simplifies
and enhances both sparsification and quantization. We evaluate the
performance-efficiency trade-offs of various design choices and finalize a
methodology tailored for the unified pattern. Our approach, **PAROAttention**,
achieves video and image generation with lossless metrics, and nearly identical
results from full-precision (FP) baselines, while operating at notably lower
density (~20%-30%) and bitwidth (**INT8/INT4**), achieving a **1.9x** to
**2.7x** end-to-end latency speedup.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OpenBench, a new benchmark for open-vocabulary segmentation, and OVSNet, a method to improve segmentation performance in diverse scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to measure models' comprehension of truly open-vocabulary concepts due to semantic overlap with training data.

Method: Proposes OVSNet, which fuses heterogeneous features and expands the training space cost-free.

Result: OVSNet achieves state-of-the-art results on both existing datasets and OpenBench.

Conclusion: OpenBench and OVSNet effectively address limitations in evaluating and improving open-vocabulary segmentation.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary segmentation aims to achieve segmentation of arbitrary
categories given unlimited text inputs as guidance. To achieve this, recent
works have focused on developing various technical routes to exploit the
potential of large-scale pre-trained vision-language models and have made
significant progress on existing benchmarks. However, we find that existing
test sets are limited in measuring the models' comprehension of
``open-vocabulary" concepts, as their semantic space closely resembles the
training space, even with many overlapping categories. To this end, we present
a new benchmark named OpenBench that differs significantly from the training
semantics. It is designed to better assess the model's ability to understand
and segment a wide range of real-world concepts. When testing existing methods
on OpenBench, we find that their performance diverges from the conclusions
drawn on existing test sets. In addition, we propose a method named OVSNet to
improve the segmentation performance for diverse and open scenarios. Through
elaborate fusion of heterogeneous features and cost-free expansion of the
training space, OVSNet achieves state-of-the-art results on both existing
datasets and our proposed OpenBench. Corresponding analysis demonstrate the
soundness and effectiveness of our proposed benchmark and method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human pose estimation in low-resolution videos is challenging due to high computational costs and assumptions of high-quality inputs in conventional methods.

Method: STAR-Pose uses a spatial-temporal Transformer with LeakyReLU-modified linear attention and an adaptive fusion module with a CNN branch for local texture enhancement, guided by a pose-aware compound loss.

Result: STAR-Pose achieves up to 5.2% mAP improvement in low-resolution (64x48) conditions and is 2.8x to 4.4x faster than cascaded approaches.

Conclusion: STAR-Pose effectively addresses the challenges of low-resolution video pose estimation with improved accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Human pose estimation in low-resolution videos presents a fundamental
challenge in computer vision. Conventional methods either assume high-quality
inputs or employ computationally expensive cascaded processing, which limits
their deployment in resource-constrained environments. We propose STAR-Pose, a
spatial-temporal adaptive super-resolution framework specifically designed for
video-based human pose estimation. Our method features a novel spatial-temporal
Transformer with LeakyReLU-modified linear attention, which efficiently
captures long-range temporal dependencies. Moreover, it is complemented by an
adaptive fusion module that integrates parallel CNN branch for local texture
enhancement. We also design a pose-aware compound loss to achieve task-oriented
super-resolution. This loss guides the network to reconstruct structural
features that are most beneficial for keypoint localization, rather than
optimizing purely for visual quality. Extensive experiments on several
mainstream video HPE datasets demonstrate that STAR-Pose outperforms existing
approaches. It achieves up to 5.2% mAP improvement under extremely
low-resolution (64x48) conditions while delivering 2.8x to 4.4x faster
inference than cascaded approaches.

TL;DR: TD3Net, a backend architecture for lipreading, combines dense skip connections and multi-dilated convolutions to address blind spots in receptive fields, achieving high accuracy with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TCN-based methods suffer from information loss due to blind spots in receptive fields, limiting performance in modeling continuous lip movements.

Method: Proposes TD3Net, which integrates dense skip connections and multi-dilated temporal convolutions to ensure a wide, dense receptive field without blind spots.

Result: TD3Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods on LRW and LRW-1000 datasets, achieving higher accuracy with fewer parameters and lower computational costs.

Conclusion: TD3Net effectively models diverse temporal features while preserving continuity, offering significant advantages for lipreading systems.

Abstract: The word-level lipreading approach typically employs a two-stage framework
with separate frontend and backend architectures to model dynamic lip
movements. Each component has been extensively studied, and in the backend
architecture, temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) have been widely adopted
in state-of-the-art methods. Recently, dense skip connections have been
introduced in TCNs to mitigate the limited density of the receptive field,
thereby improving the modeling of complex temporal representations. However,
their performance remains constrained owing to potential information loss
regarding the continuous nature of lip movements, caused by blind spots in the
receptive field. To address this limitation, we propose TD3Net, a temporal
densely connected multi-dilated convolutional network that combines dense skip
connections and multi-dilated temporal convolutions as the backend
architecture. TD3Net covers a wide and dense receptive field without blind
spots by applying different dilation factors to skip-connected features.
Experimental results on a word-level lipreading task using two large publicly
available datasets, Lip Reading in the Wild (LRW) and LRW-1000, indicate that
the proposed method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art
methods. It achieved higher accuracy with fewer parameters and lower
floating-point operations compared to existing TCN-based backend architectures.
Moreover, visualization results suggest that our approach effectively utilizes
diverse temporal features while preserving temporal continuity, presenting
notable advantages in lipreading systems. The code is available at our GitHub

*Yizhe Li,Sanping Zhou,Zheng Qin,Le Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PR-DETR improves dense video captioning by injecting explicit position and relation priors into a detection transformer, enhancing localization accuracy and caption quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transformer-based methods implicitly learn event locations and semantics, requiring large datasets and limiting performance. PR-DETR addresses this by incorporating explicit priors.

Method: PR-DETR uses position-anchored queries for scene-specific position prior and an event relation encoder for boundary relationship prior.

Result: The method shows competitive performance on ActivityNet Captions and YouCook2 datasets.

Conclusion: PR-DETR effectively improves dense video captioning by leveraging explicit position and relation priors.

Abstract: Dense video captioning is a challenging task that aims to localize and
caption multiple events in an untrimmed video. Recent studies mainly follow the
transformer-based architecture to jointly perform the two sub-tasks, i.e.,
event localization and caption generation, in an end-to-end manner. Based on
the general philosophy of detection transformer, these methods implicitly learn
the event locations and event semantics, which requires a large amount of
training data and limits the model's performance in practice. In this paper, we
propose a novel dense video captioning framework, named PR-DETR, which injects
the explicit position and relation prior into the detection transformer to
improve the localization accuracy and caption quality, simultaneously. On the
one hand, we first generate a set of position-anchored queries to provide the
scene-specific position and semantic information about potential events as
position prior, which serves as the initial event search regions to eliminate
the implausible event proposals. On the other hand, we further design an event
relation encoder to explicitly calculate the relationship between event
boundaries as relation prior to guide the event interaction to improve the
semantic coherence of the captions. Extensive ablation studies are conducted to
verify the effectiveness of the position and relation prior. Experimental
results also show the competitive performance of our method on ActivityNet
Captions and YouCook2 datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoV automates visual prompt selection for LVLMs, improving performance across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual visual prompt design is inefficient and sub-optimal; automation is needed.

Method: AutoV learns to select optimal visual prompts using a ranking-based training pipeline.

Result: AutoV boosts LVLM performance (e.g., 1.7% gain on LLaVA-Wild).

Conclusion: AutoV is a promising automated visual prompting method for LVLMs.

Abstract: Inspired by text prompts in large language models (LLMs), visual prompts have
been explored to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large vision-language
models (LVLMs). Current methods design heuristic visual prompts, such as
overlaying a text-query-guided attention heatmap on the original input image.
However, designing effective prompts manually is challenging and
time-consuming, and it often fails to explore the benefits of different visual
prompts, leading to sub-optimal performance. To this end, we propose
\textbf{AutoV} that learns to automatically select the optimal visual prompt
from various candidates based on given textual queries and the input image. To
train AutoV, we developed an automatic data collection and labeling pipeline
that evaluates various visual prompts with a pre-trained LVLM. We input a set
of visual prompts into the LVLM and rank them according to the prediction
losses generated by the model. Using the ranking as a supervision signal, we
train AutoV to automatically choose the optimal visual prompt from various
visual prompts for LVLMs. Experimental results indicate that AutoV enhances the
performance of various LVLMs across multiple popular image understanding tasks.
For instance, LLaVA-OV with AutoV achieves $\textbf{1.7}\%$ accuracy gain on
LLaVA$^{\text{Wild}}$, and AutoV boosts Qwen2.5-VL by $\textbf{1.9}\%$ on MMMU,
highlighting its potential as an optimal visual prompting method for LVLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastInit introduces a fast noise initialization method for video generation, eliminating iterative refinement and improving efficiency and temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the computational cost and temporal inconsistency in video generation caused by iterative refinement methods like FreeInit.

Method: FastInit uses a Video Noise Prediction Network (VNPNet) to generate refined noise in a single forward pass, trained on a large dataset of text prompts and noise pairs.

Result: FastInit enhances video generation efficiency and quality, achieving high temporal consistency across frames.

Conclusion: FastInit offers a practical, efficient solution for video generation, with plans to release the code and dataset.

Abstract: Video generation has made significant strides with the development of
diffusion models; however, achieving high temporal consistency remains a
challenging task. Recently, FreeInit identified a training-inference gap and
introduced a method to iteratively refine the initial noise during inference.
However, iterative refinement significantly increases the computational cost
associated with video generation. In this paper, we introduce FastInit, a fast
noise initialization method that eliminates the need for iterative refinement.
FastInit learns a Video Noise Prediction Network (VNPNet) that takes random
noise and a text prompt as input, generating refined noise in a single forward
pass. Therefore, FastInit greatly enhances the efficiency of video generation
while achieving high temporal consistency across frames. To train the VNPNet,
we create a large-scale dataset consisting of pairs of text prompts, random
noise, and refined noise. Extensive experiments with various text-to-video
models show that our method consistently improves the quality and temporal
consistency of the generated videos. FastInit not only provides a substantial
improvement in video generation but also offers a practical solution that can
be applied directly during inference. The code and dataset will be released.

Motivation: Existing systems require object-level supervision or predefined decompositions, limiting their applicability to raw, unstructured data.

Method: DeepObjectLog combines a perceptual module for object extraction with a symbolic reasoning layer using probabilistic logic programming.

Result: The model excels in generalization tasks like unseen object compositions, tasks, and object counts, surpassing neural and neurosymbolic baselines.

Conclusion: DeepObjectLog demonstrates effective learning of object-centric representations without explicit supervision, advancing neurosymbolic reasoning.

Abstract: Relational learning enables models to generalize across structured domains by
reasoning over objects and their interactions. While recent advances in
neurosymbolic reasoning and object-centric learning bring us closer to this
goal, existing systems rely either on object-level supervision or on a
predefined decomposition of the input into objects. In this work, we propose a
neurosymbolic formulation for learning object-centric representations directly
from raw unstructured perceptual data and using only distant supervision. We
instantiate this approach in DeepObjectLog, a neurosymbolic model that
integrates a perceptual module, which extracts relevant object representations,
with a symbolic reasoning layer based on probabilistic logic programming. By
enabling sound probabilistic logical inference, the symbolic component
introduces a novel learning signal that further guides the discovery of
meaningful objects in the input. We evaluate our model across a diverse range
of generalization settings, including unseen object compositions, unseen tasks,
and unseen number of objects. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms neural and neurosymbolic baselines across the tested settings.

### [29] [GRPO-CARE: Consistency-Aware Reinforcement Learning for Multimodal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16141)
*Yi Chen,Yuying Ge,Rui Wang,Yixiao Ge,Junhao Cheng,Ying Shan,Xihui Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SEED-Bench-R1 for evaluating multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and proposes GRPO-CARE, a consistency-aware RL framework, to improve answer correctness and reasoning coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reinforcement learning methods like GRPO lack rigorous evaluation for MLLMs and often sacrifice logical coherence for answer accuracy.

Method: GRPO-CARE uses a two-tiered reward system: a base reward for answer correctness and an adaptive consistency bonus for logical coherence, replacing KL penalties.

Result: GRPO-CARE outperforms standard GRPO, achieving a 6.7% performance gain on the hardest evaluation level and a 24.5% improvement in consistency.

Conclusion: The work provides a benchmark and framework to enhance interpretability and robustness in MLLMs.

Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning approaches, such as outcome-supervised GRPO,
have advanced Chain-of-Thought reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet
their adaptation to multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) is unexplored. To address the lack
of rigorous evaluation for MLLM post-training methods, we introduce
SEED-Bench-R1, a benchmark with complex real-world videos requiring balanced
perception and reasoning. It offers a large training set and evaluates
generalization across three escalating challenges: in-distribution,
cross-environment, and cross-environment-task scenarios. Using SEED-Bench-R1,
we find that standard GRPO, while improving answer accuracy, often reduces
logical coherence between reasoning steps and answers, with only a 57.9%
consistency rate. This stems from reward signals focusing solely on final
answers, encouraging shortcuts, and strict KL penalties limiting exploration.To
address this, we propose GRPO-CARE, a consistency-aware RL framework optimizing
both answer correctness and reasoning coherence without explicit supervision.
GRPO-CARE introduces a two-tiered reward: (1) a base reward for answer
correctness, and (2) an adaptive consistency bonus, computed by comparing the
model's reasoning-to-answer likelihood (via a slowly-evolving reference model)
against group peers.This dual mechanism amplifies rewards for reasoning paths
that are both correct and logically consistent. Replacing KL penalties with
this adaptive bonus, GRPO-CARE outperforms standard GRPO on SEED-Bench-R1,
achieving a 6.7% performance gain on the hardest evaluation level and a 24.5%
improvement in consistency. It also shows strong transferability, improving
model performance across diverse video understanding benchmarks. Our work
contributes a systematically designed benchmark and a generalizable
post-training framework, advancing the development of more interpretable and
robust MLLMs.

*Xingbai Chen,Tingchao Fu,Renyang Liu,Wei Zhou,Chao Yi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel adversarial attack strategy, Multimodal Bidirectional Attack, for Referring Expression Segmentation (RES) models to enhance robustness against diverse textual inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The robustness of RES models against adversarial examples is unexplored, and existing methods fail to address their multimodal structure and diverse textual inputs in real-world scenarios.

Method: The method introduces learnable proxy textual embedding perturbation and jointly optimizes image and textual modalities to create adversarial examples with cross-text transferability.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method's superior effectiveness over existing approaches on multiple RES models and datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed strategy successfully addresses multimodal challenges in RES, improving adversarial robustness and cross-text transferability.

Abstract: Referring Expression Segmentation (RES) enables precise object segmentation
in images based on natural language descriptions, offering high flexibility and
broad applicability in real-world vision tasks. Despite its impressive
performance, the robustness of RES models against adversarial examples remains
largely unexplored. While prior adversarial attack methods have explored
adversarial robustness on conventional segmentation models, they perform poorly
when directly applied to RES, failing to expose vulnerabilities in its
multimodal structure. Moreover, in practical open-world scenarios, users
typically issue multiple, diverse referring expressions to interact with the
same image, highlighting the need for adversarial examples that generalize
across varied textual inputs. To address these multimodal challenges, we
propose a novel adversarial attack strategy termed \textbf{Multimodal
Bidirectional Attack}, tailored for RES models. Our method introduces learnable
proxy textual embedding perturbation and jointly performs visual-aligned
optimization on the image modality and textual-adversarial optimization on the
textual modality during attack generation. This dual optimization framework
encourages adversarial images to actively adapt to more challenging text
embedding during optimization, thereby enhancing their cross-text
transferability, which refers to the ability of adversarial examples to remain
effective under a variety of unseen or semantically diverse textual inputs.
Extensive experiments conducted on multiple RES models and benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our method compared to existing
methods.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances emotional expression for non-photorealistic characters.

Abstract: With the advancement of conversational AI, research on bodily expressions,

significant improvements across multiple aspects when compared to existing
research.

*Jiyao Wang,Xiao Yang,Hao Lu,Dengbo He,Kaishun Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified framework (GAP) for multi-source synsemantic domain generalization (MSSDG) and test-time personalized adaptation (TTPA) in remote physiological measurement, addressing challenges like partial labeling and noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance generalizability and personalization in remote physiological measurement, overcoming issues like partial labeling and environmental noise.

Method: Disentangles face video data into invariant semantics, individual bias, and noise, using priors and observations in multiple modules for MSSDG and TTPA.

Result: Validated on six datasets and a new real-world driving dataset, showing effectiveness in simultaneous MSSDG and TTPA.

Conclusion: The GAP framework successfully unifies MSSDG and TTPA with minimal adjustments, improving remote physiological estimation.

Abstract: Multi-source synsemantic domain generalization (MSSDG) for multi-task remote
physiological measurement seeks to enhance the generalizability of these
metrics and attracts increasing attention. However, challenges like partial
labeling and environmental noise may disrupt task-specific accuracy. Meanwhile,
given that real-time adaptation is necessary for personalized products, the
test-time personalized adaptation (TTPA) after MSSDG is also worth exploring,
while the gap between previous generalization and personalization methods is
significant and hard to fuse. Thus, we proposed a unified framework for
MSSD\textbf{G} and TTP\textbf{A} employing \textbf{P}riors (\textbf{GAP}) in
biometrics and remote photoplethysmography (rPPG). We first disentangled
information from face videos into invariant semantics, individual bias, and
noise. Then, multiple modules incorporating priors and our observations were
applied in different stages and for different facial information. Then, based
on the different principles of achieving generalization and personalization,
our framework could simultaneously address MSSDG and TTPA under multi-task
remote physiological estimation with minimal adjustments. We expanded the MSSDG
benchmark to the TTPA protocol on six publicly available datasets and
introduced a new real-world driving dataset with complete labeling. Extensive
experiments that validated our approach, and the codes along with the new
dataset will be released.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep learning framework using GANs and CNNs for accident detection in CCTV footage, achieving high accuracy with models like FTCNN and VIT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rising global car accident rates necessitate automated, efficient accident detection systems to enhance transport safety.

Method: The framework combines GANs for data synthesis and CNNs for training, using resized and enhanced video frames from YouTube. Models tested include CNN, FTCNN, and VIT.

Result: FTCNN and VIT achieved 94% and 95% accuracy, respectively, outperforming CNN (88%).

Conclusion: The framework is effective for real-time accident detection, supporting future smart city and emergency management systems.

Abstract: Accident detection using Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) footage is one of
the most imperative features for enhancing transport safety and efficient
traffic control. To this end, this research addresses the issues of supervised
monitoring and data deficiency in accident detection systems by adapting
excellent deep learning technologies. The motivation arises from rising
statistics in the number of car accidents worldwide; this calls for innovation
and the establishment of a smart, efficient and automated way of identifying
accidents and calling for help to save lives. Addressing the problem of the
scarcity of data, the presented framework joins Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) for synthesizing data and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for model
training. Video frames for accidents and non-accidents are collected from
YouTube videos, and we perform resizing, image enhancement and image
normalisation pixel range adjustments. Three models are used: CNN, Fine-tuned
Convolutional Neural Network (FTCNN) and Vision Transformer (VIT) worked best
for detecting accidents from CCTV, obtaining an accuracy rate of 94% and 95%,
while the CNN model obtained 88%. Such results show that the proposed framework
suits traffic safety applications due to its high real-time accident detection
capabilities and broad-scale applicability. This work lays the foundation for
intelligent surveillance systems in the future for real-time traffic

*Annajoyce Mariani,Kira Maag,Hanno Gottschalk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A GAN-based method generates realistic traffic trajectories from BEV videos, achieving fast training and inference with physical realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to capture complex, multimodal trajectory distributions, prompting the use of GANs for better accuracy.

Method: Uses low-resolution BEV occupancy grid videos to train a GAN, extracting trajectories via object detection and matching.

Result: Achieves training in 100 GPU hours, inference under 20ms, and aligns well with ground truth data.

Conclusion: The GAN approach effectively generates realistic trajectories, outperforming traditional methods.

Abstract: Being able to generate realistic trajectory options is at the core of
increasing the degree of automation of road vehicles. While model-driven,
rule-based, and classical learning-based methods are widely used to tackle
these tasks at present, they can struggle to effectively capture the complex,
multimodal distributions of future trajectories. In this paper we investigate
whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained on videos of bird's-eye
view (BEV) traffic scenarios can generate statistically accurate trajectories
that correctly capture spatial relationships between the agents. To this end,
we propose a pipeline that uses low-resolution BEV occupancy grid videos as
training data for a video generative model. From the generated videos of
traffic scenarios we extract abstract trajectory data using single-frame object
detection and frame-to-frame object matching. We particularly choose a GAN
architecture for the fast training and inference times with respect to
diffusion models. We obtain our best results within 100 GPU hours of training,
with inference times under 20\,ms. We demonstrate the physical realism of the
proposed trajectories in terms of distribution alignment of spatial and dynamic
parameters with respect to the ground truth videos from the Waymo Open Motion
Dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOCoOp is a federated OOD-aware framework that improves robustness in vision-language models by using ID and OOD prompts, addressing performance-robustness trade-offs in federated learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated prompt learning (FPL) methods struggle with performance-robustness trade-offs, especially under OOD shifts, due to data heterogeneity among clients.

Method: FOCoOp uses ID global, local, and OOD prompts for class- and distribution-level separations, optimized via bi-level distributionally robust optimization and semi-unbalanced optimal transport.

Result: Experiments show FOCoOp effectively handles decentralized heterogeneous distributions and improves robustness against OOD shifts.

Conclusion: FOCoOp successfully addresses the limitations of FPL by enhancing robustness and performance in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Federated prompt learning (FPL) for vision-language models is a powerful
approach to collaboratively adapt models across distributed clients while
preserving data privacy. However, existing FPL approaches suffer from a
trade-off between performance and robustness, particularly in
out-of-distribution (OOD) shifts, limiting their reliability in real-world
scenarios. The inherent in-distribution (ID) data heterogeneity among different
clients makes it more challenging to maintain this trade-off. To fill this gap,
we introduce a Federated OOD-aware Context Optimization (FOCoOp) framework,
which captures diverse distributions among clients using ID global prompts,
local prompts, and OOD prompts. Specifically, FOCoOp leverages three sets of
prompts to create both class-level and distribution-level separations, which
adapt to OOD shifts through bi-level distributionally robust optimization.
Additionally, FOCoOp improves the discrimination consistency among clients,
i.e., calibrating global prompts, seemingly OOD prompts, and OOD prompts by
semi-unbalanced optimal transport. The extensive experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate that FOCoOp effectively captures decentralized
heterogeneous distributions and enhances robustness of different OOD shifts.

TL;DR: The paper surveys 3D Low-Level Vision (3D LLV), addressing robust rendering, restoration, and enhancement for degraded 3D inputs, and reviews methods, datasets, and applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural rendering methods assume clean, high-resolution inputs, limiting robustness under real-world degradations like noise, blur, and weather artifacts.

Method: The survey formalizes degradation-aware rendering, categorizes methods integrating low-level vision into neural rendering, and discusses challenges like spatio-temporal consistency.

Result: Recent methods enable high-fidelity 3D reconstruction under adverse conditions, with applications in autonomous driving, AR/VR, and robotics.

Conclusion: 3D LLV is positioned as a fundamental direction for robust 3D content generation and scene-level reconstruction in real-world environments.

Abstract: Neural rendering methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved significant progress in photorealistic
3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, most existing models
assume clean and high-resolution (HR) multi-view inputs, which limits their
robustness under real-world degradations such as noise, blur, low-resolution
(LR), and weather-induced artifacts. To address these limitations, the emerging
field of 3D Low-Level Vision (3D LLV) extends classical 2D Low-Level Vision
tasks including super-resolution (SR), deblurring, weather degradation removal,
restoration, and enhancement into the 3D spatial domain. This survey, referred
to as R\textsuperscript{3}eVision, provides a comprehensive overview of robust
rendering, restoration, and enhancement for 3D LLV by formalizing the
degradation-aware rendering problem and identifying key challenges related to
spatio-temporal consistency and ill-posed optimization. Recent methods that
integrate LLV into neural rendering frameworks are categorized to illustrate
how they enable high-fidelity 3D reconstruction under adverse conditions.
Application domains such as autonomous driving, AR/VR, and robotics are also
discussed, where reliable 3D perception from degraded inputs is critical. By
reviewing representative methods, datasets, and evaluation protocols, this work
positions 3D LLV as a fundamental direction for robust 3D content generation
and scene-level reconstruction in real-world environments.

TL;DR: A hierarchical coarse-to-fine method fuses 3D point clouds and RGB images for dense 3D landslide displacement estimation, outperforming existing methods in coverage and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing landslide monitoring methods often yield sparse or non-3D displacement estimates, lacking comprehensive spatial coverage and accuracy.

Method: A hierarchical partition-based approach combines 3D point clouds and co-registered RGB images, using patch-level matches and geometric consistency checks for refinement.

Result: Achieves high spatial coverage (79% and 97%) and accuracy (deviations of 0.15 m and 0.25 m), outperforming the state-of-the-art F2S3 method.

Conclusion: The method provides a practical, adaptable solution for TLS-based landslide monitoring and is extensible to other point cloud tasks. Data and code are publicly available.

Abstract: Landslide monitoring is essential for understanding geohazards and mitigating
associated risks. However, existing point cloud-based methods typically rely on
either geometric or radiometric information and often yield sparse or non-3D
displacement estimates. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical
partition-based coarse-to-fine approach that fuses 3D point clouds and
co-registered RGB images to estimate dense 3D displacement vector fields. We
construct patch-level matches using both 3D geometry and 2D image features.
These matches are refined via geometric consistency checks, followed by rigid
transformation estimation per match. Experimental results on two real-world
landslide datasets demonstrate that our method produces 3D displacement
estimates with high spatial coverage (79% and 97%) and high accuracy.
Deviations in displacement magnitude with respect to external measurements
(total station or GNSS observations) are 0.15 m and 0.25 m on the two datasets,
respectively, and only 0.07 m and 0.20 m compared to manually derived
references. These values are below the average scan resolutions (0.08 m and
0.30 m). Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method F2S3 in spatial
coverage while maintaining comparable accuracy. Our approach offers a practical
and adaptable solution for TLS-based landslide monitoring and is extensible to
other types of point clouds and monitoring tasks. Our example data and source
code are publicly available at https://github.com/zhaoyiww/fusion4landslide.

*Xin Jiang,Meiqi Cao,Hao Tang,Fei Shen,Zechao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Dual-Vision Adaptation (DVA) for Fine-Grained Image Retrieval (FGIR), combining sample and feature adaptation to leverage pre-trained models without overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FGIR methods overfit training data and lose pre-trained knowledge, reducing generalization.

Method: DVA includes Object-Perceptual Adaptation (modifies inputs) and In-Context Adaptation (adjusts features). Uses Discrimination Perception Transfer for efficiency.

Result: DVA performs well on in- and out-of-distribution datasets with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: DVA effectively balances retrieval efficiency and performance while leveraging pre-trained knowledge.

Abstract: Fine-Grained Image Retrieval~(FGIR) faces challenges in learning
discriminative visual representations to retrieve images with similar
fine-grained features. Current leading FGIR solutions typically follow two
regimes: enforce pairwise similarity constraints in the semantic embedding
space, or incorporate a localization sub-network to fine-tune the entire model.
However, such two regimes tend to overfit the training data while forgetting
the knowledge gained from large-scale pre-training, thus reducing their
generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a Dual-Vision Adaptation
(DVA) approach for FGIR, which guides the frozen pre-trained model to perform
FGIR through collaborative sample and feature adaptation. Specifically, we
design Object-Perceptual Adaptation, which modifies input samples to help the
pre-trained model perceive critical objects and elements within objects that
are helpful for category prediction. Meanwhile, we propose In-Context
Adaptation, which introduces a small set of parameters for feature adaptation
without modifying the pre-trained parameters. This makes the FGIR task using
these adjusted features closer to the task solved during the pre-training.
Additionally, to balance retrieval efficiency and performance, we propose
Discrimination Perception Transfer to transfer the discriminative knowledge in
the object-perceptual adaptation to the image encoder using the knowledge
distillation mechanism. Extensive experiments show that DVA has fewer learnable
parameters and performs well on three in-distribution and three
out-of-distribution fine-grained datasets.

TL;DR: SyncMapV2 is an unsupervised segmentation algorithm with state-of-the-art robustness, outperforming existing methods under various corruptions without requiring robust training or supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human vision's robustness to noise contrasts with AI's struggles, inspiring SyncMapV2 to achieve similar adaptability and accuracy without explicit training.

Method: SyncMapV2 uses self-organizing dynamical equations and random network concepts, enabling online adaptation without re-initialization for new inputs.

Result: SyncMapV2 shows minimal performance drop (e.g., 0.01% mIoU under digital corruption) compared to significant drops in SOTA methods (e.g., 23.8%).

Conclusion: SyncMapV2 pioneers robust, adaptive intelligence, mimicking human vision's continuous adaptability and setting a foundation for future AI advancements.

Abstract: Human vision excels at segmenting visual cues without the need for explicit
training, and it remains remarkably robust even as noise severity increases. In
contrast, existing AI algorithms struggle to maintain accuracy under similar
conditions. Here, we present SyncMapV2, the first to solve unsupervised
segmentation with state-of-the-art robustness. SyncMapV2 exhibits a minimal
drop in mIoU, only 0.01%, under digital corruption, compared to a 23.8% drop
observed in SOTA methods.This superior performance extends across various types
of corruption: noise (7.3% vs. 37.7%), weather (7.5% vs. 33.8%), and blur (7.0%
vs. 29.5%). Notably, SyncMapV2 accomplishes this without any robust training,
supervision, or loss functions. It is based on a learning paradigm that uses
self-organizing dynamical equations combined with concepts from random
networks. Moreover,unlike conventional methods that require re-initialization
for each new input, SyncMapV2 adapts online, mimicking the continuous
adaptability of human vision. Thus, we go beyond the accurate and robust
results, and present the first algorithm that can do all the above online,
adapting to input rather than re-initializing. In adaptability tests, SyncMapV2
demonstrates near-zero performance degradation, which motivates and fosters a
new generation of robust and adaptive intelligence in the near future.

TL;DR: Proposes MADNet, a multi-scale adaptive dual-domain network for image denoising, addressing limitations of fixed Unet architectures and uniform frequency domain treatment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on fixed single-input single-output Unet architectures and treat frequency domains uniformly, ignoring multi-scale pixel representations and noise characteristics.

Method: Uses image pyramid inputs and an adaptive spatial-frequency learning unit (ASFU) with a learnable mask to separate high/low-frequency components. Includes a global feature fusion block in skip connections.

Result: Extensive experiments show MADNet outperforms state-of-the-art denoising methods on synthetic and real noisy datasets.

Conclusion: MADNet effectively addresses multi-scale and frequency domain challenges in image denoising, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-scale architectures have demonstrated
exceptional performance in image denoising tasks. However, existing
architectures mainly depends on a fixed single-input single-output Unet
architecture, ignoring the multi-scale representations of pixel level. In
addition, previous methods treat the frequency domain uniformly, ignoring the
different characteristics of high-frequency and low-frequency noise. In this
paper, we propose a novel multi-scale adaptive dual-domain network (MADNet) for
image denoising. We use image pyramid inputs to restore noise-free results from
low-resolution images. In order to realize the interaction of high-frequency
and low-frequency information, we design an adaptive spatial-frequency learning
unit (ASFU), where a learnable mask is used to separate the information into
high-frequency and low-frequency components. In the skip connections, we design
a global feature fusion block to enhance the features at different scales.
Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real noisy image datasets verify
the effectiveness of MADNet compared with current state-of-the-art denoising
approaches.

TL;DR: DETA++ is a method for reliable few-shot learning (FSL) that addresses noise issues in task adaptation by using contrastive relevance aggregation, a memory bank, and intra-class region swapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FSL methods struggle with in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) noise, which can amplify during task adaptation and lead to unreliable predictions.

Method: DETA++ introduces a Contrastive Relevance Aggregation (CoRA) module for support sample weighting, a memory bank for clean region storage, and Intra-class Region Swapping (IntraSwap) for prototype rectification.

Result: Extensive experiments show DETA++ effectively handles dual noises and improves FSL performance.

Conclusion: DETA++ provides a robust and flexible solution for noise-affected FSL tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in model pre-training give rise to task adaptation-based
few-shot learning (FSL), where the goal is to adapt a pre-trained task-agnostic
model for capturing task-specific knowledge with a few-labeled support samples
of the target task.Nevertheless, existing approaches may still fail in the open
world due to the inevitable in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD)
noise from both support and query samples of the target task. With limited
support samples available, i) the adverse effect of the dual noises can be
severely amplified during task adaptation, and ii) the adapted model can
produce unreliable predictions on query samples in the presence of the dual
noises. In this work, we propose DEnoised Task Adaptation (DETA++) for reliable
FSL. DETA++ uses a Contrastive Relevance Aggregation (CoRA) module to calculate
image and region weights for support samples, based on which a clean prototype
loss and a noise entropy maximization loss are proposed to achieve noise-robust
task adaptation. Additionally,DETA++ employs a memory bank to store and refine
clean regions for each inner-task class, based on which a Local Nearest
Centroid Classifier (LocalNCC) is devised to yield noise-robust predictions on
query samples. Moreover, DETA++ utilizes an Intra-class Region Swapping
(IntraSwap) strategy to rectify ID class prototypes during task adaptation,
enhancing the model's robustness to the dual noises. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of DETA++.

*Viktoria Pundy,Marco Peer,Florian Kleber*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates two transparency techniques for neural networks in Writer Identification and Verification, showing pixel-wise saliency maps outperform point-specific ones for forensic expert support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve transparency and reliability of neural networks in Writer Identification and Verification, aiding forensic experts by highlighting similarities in handwritten text.

Method: Applied pixel-level and point-specific saliency maps to neural networks, evaluated using deletion and insertion score metrics, and compared highlights to forensic expert criteria.

Result: Pixel-wise saliency maps outperformed point-specific ones and aligned well with forensic expert analysis.

Conclusion: Pixel-wise saliency maps are effective for supporting forensic experts in Writer Identification and Verification.

Abstract: Neural Networks are the state of the art for many tasks in the computer
vision domain, including Writer Identification (WI) and Writer Verification
(WV). The transparency of these "black box" systems is important for
improvements of performance and reliability. For this work, two transparency
techniques are applied to neural networks trained on WI and WV for the first
time in this domain. The first technique provides pixel-level saliency maps,
while the point-specific saliency maps of the second technique provide
information on similarities between two images. The transparency techniques are
evaluated using deletion and insertion score metrics. The goal is to support
forensic experts with information on similarities in handwritten text and to
explore the characteristics selected by a neural network for the identification
process. For the qualitative evaluation, the highlights of the maps are
compared to the areas forensic experts consider during the identification
process. The evaluation results show that the pixel-wise saliency maps
outperform the point-specific saliency maps and are suitable for the support of
forensic experts.

TL;DR: MambaHash, a visual state space hashing model, leverages Vision Mamba for efficient large-scale image retrieval, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the suitability of Vision Mamba for large-scale image retrieval tasks, given its linear time complexity and strong performance in other computer tasks.

Method: Proposes a backbone network with grouped Mamba operations for local and global modeling, a channel interaction attention module, and an adaptive feature enhancement module.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance and efficiency on CIFAR-10, NUS-WIDE, and IMAGENET datasets compared to existing deep hashing methods.

Conclusion: MambaHash effectively addresses large-scale image retrieval with improved efficiency and performance, validated by comprehensive experiments.

Abstract: Deep image hashing aims to enable effective large-scale image retrieval by
mapping the input images into simple binary hash codes through deep neural
networks. More recently, Vision Mamba with linear time complexity has attracted
extensive attention from researchers by achieving outstanding performance on
various computer tasks. Nevertheless, the suitability of Mamba for large-scale
image retrieval tasks still needs to be explored. Towards this end, we propose
a visual state space hashing model, called MambaHash. Concretely, we propose a
backbone network with stage-wise architecture, in which grouped Mamba operation
is introduced to model local and global information by utilizing Mamba to
perform multi-directional scanning along different groups of the channel.
Subsequently, the proposed channel interaction attention module is used to
enhance information communication across channels. Finally, we meticulously
design an adaptive feature enhancement module to increase feature diversity and
enhance the visual representation capability of the model. We have conducted
comprehensive experiments on three widely used datasets: CIFAR-10, NUS-WIDE and
IMAGENET. The experimental results demonstrate that compared with the
state-of-the-art deep hashing methods, our proposed MambaHash has well
efficiency and superior performance to effectively accomplish large-scale image
retrieval tasks. Source code is available

*Pallabi Dutta,Anubhab Maity,Sushmita Mitra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptive prompt-guided pruning method for Vision Transformers (ViTs) to reduce computational costs in medical image segmentation by focusing on relevant tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high computational demands of ViTs limit their practical use in medical image analysis, prompting the need for an efficient method to reduce irrelevant token processing.

Method: An adaptive prompt-guided pruning method ranks tokens by relevance, down-weights low-relevance ones, and propagates only relevant tokens, integrating with state-of-the-art models.

Result: The method reduces tokens by 35-55%, lowering computational costs while maintaining segmentation accuracy.

Conclusion: The framework enables cost-effective medical image processing, enhancing real-time diagnosis in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: The high computational demands of Vision Transformers (ViTs), in processing a
huge number of tokens, often constrain their practical application in analyzing
medical images. This research proposes an adaptive prompt-guided pruning method
to selectively reduce the processing of irrelevant tokens in the segmentation
pipeline. The prompt-based spatial prior helps to rank the tokens according to
their relevance. Tokens with low-relevance scores are down-weighted, ensuring
that only the relevant ones are propagated for processing across subsequent
stages. This data-driven pruning strategy facilitates end-to-end training,
maintains gradient flow, and improves segmentation accuracy by focusing
computational resources on essential regions. The proposed framework is
integrated with several state-of-the-art models to facilitate the elimination
of irrelevant tokens; thereby, enhancing computational efficiency while
preserving segmentation accuracy. The experimental results show a reduction of
$\sim$ 35-55\% tokens; thus reducing the computational costs relative to the
baselines. Cost-effective medical image processing, using our framework,
facilitates real-time diagnosis by expanding its applicability in
resource-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AGC-Drive is the first large-scale real-world dataset for aerial-ground collaborative 3D perception, addressing the lack of data in this area.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets focus on vehicle-to-vehicle or vehicle-to-infrastructure collaboration, neglecting aerial perspectives from UAVs, which offer unique top-down views to mitigate occlusions.

Method: The dataset includes 120K LiDAR frames and 440K images from 14 diverse driving scenarios, collected using two vehicles and one UAV equipped with cameras and LiDAR sensors.

Result: AGC-Drive provides benchmarks for vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-UAV collaborative perception, with fully annotated 3D bounding boxes for 13 object categories.

Conclusion: The dataset and accompanying toolkit aim to advance research in aerial-ground collaborative perception by providing high-quality data and tools.

Abstract: By sharing information across multiple agents, collaborative perception helps
autonomous vehicles mitigate occlusions and improve overall perception
accuracy. While most previous work focus on vehicle-to-vehicle and
vehicle-to-infrastructure collaboration, with limited attention to aerial
perspectives provided by UAVs, which uniquely offer dynamic, top-down views to
alleviate occlusions and monitor large-scale interactive environments. A major
reason for this is the lack of high-quality datasets for aerial-ground
collaborative scenarios. To bridge this gap, we present AGC-Drive, the first
large-scale real-world dataset for Aerial-Ground Cooperative 3D perception. The
data collection platform consists of two vehicles, each equipped with five
cameras and one LiDAR sensor, and one UAV carrying a forward-facing camera and
a LiDAR sensor, enabling comprehensive multi-view and multi-agent perception.
Consisting of approximately 120K LiDAR frames and 440K images, the dataset
covers 14 diverse real-world driving scenarios, including urban roundabouts,
highway tunnels, and on/off ramps. Notably, 19.5% of the data comprises dynamic
interaction events, including vehicle cut-ins, cut-outs, and frequent lane
changes. AGC-Drive contains 400 scenes, each with approximately 100 frames and
fully annotated 3D bounding boxes covering 13 object categories. We provide
benchmarks for two 3D perception tasks: vehicle-to-vehicle collaborative
perception and vehicle-to-UAV collaborative perception. Additionally, we
release an open-source toolkit, including spatiotemporal alignment verification
tools, multi-agent visualization systems, and collaborative annotation
utilities. The dataset and code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Micro-gestures are subtle and involuntary, making recognition challenging in affective computing.

Method: Pose-guided semantic query generation and gated multi-modal fusion in a CLIP-based architecture.

Result: Top-1 accuracy of 61.82% on the iMiGUE dataset.

Conclusion: Shows potential but highlights challenges in adapting vision-language models for micro-gesture recognition.

Abstract: Micro-gesture recognition is a challenging task in affective computing due to
the subtle, involuntary nature of the gestures and their low movement
amplitude. In this paper, we introduce a Pose-Guided Semantics-Aware CLIP-based
architecture, or CLIP for Micro-Gesture recognition (CLIP-MG), a modified CLIP
model tailored for micro-gesture classification on the iMiGUE dataset. CLIP-MG
integrates human pose (skeleton) information into the CLIP-based recognition
pipeline through pose-guided semantic query generation and a gated multi-modal
fusion mechanism. The proposed model achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 61.82%. These
results demonstrate both the potential of our approach and the remaining
difficulty in fully adapting vision-language models like CLIP for micro-gesture
recognition.

*Peixiang Huang,Yanyan Huang,Weiqin Zhao,Junjun He,Lequan Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperPath leverages hyperbolic space and textual descriptions to model semantic hierarchies in WSIs, improving classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for WSI analysis rely on Euclidean embeddings, which inadequately capture semantic hierarchies. HyperPath addresses this by using hyperbolic space and textual guidance.

Method: HyperPath integrates visual and textual features in hyperbolic space, using Angular Modality Alignment Loss and Semantic Hierarchy Consistency Loss for robust alignment and hierarchy refinement. Classification is done via geodesic distance.

Result: HyperPath outperforms existing methods in WSI classification tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of hyperbolic embeddings.

Conclusion: HyperPath highlights the potential of hyperbolic space for WSI analysis, offering improved semantic hierarchy modeling and classification performance.

Abstract: Pathology is essential for cancer diagnosis, with multiple instance learning
(MIL) widely used for whole slide image (WSI) analysis. WSIs exhibit a natural
hierarchy -- patches, regions, and slides -- with distinct semantic
associations. While some methods attempt to leverage this hierarchy for
improved representation, they predominantly rely on Euclidean embeddings, which
struggle to fully capture semantic hierarchies. To address this limitation, we
propose HyperPath, a novel method that integrates knowledge from textual
descriptions to guide the modeling of semantic hierarchies of WSIs in
hyperbolic space, thereby enhancing WSI classification. Our approach adapts
both visual and textual features extracted by pathology vision-language
foundation models to the hyperbolic space. We design an Angular Modality
Alignment Loss to ensure robust cross-modal alignment, while a Semantic
Hierarchy Consistency Loss further refines feature hierarchies through
entailment and contradiction relationships and thus enhance semantic coherence.
The classification is performed with geodesic distance, which measures the
similarity between entities in the hyperbolic semantic hierarchy. This
eliminates the need for linear classifiers and enables a geometry-aware
approach to WSI analysis. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
superior performance across tasks compared to existing methods, highlighting
the potential of hyperbolic embeddings for WSI analysis.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified framework for generating and evaluating multi-modal adversarial attacks on OCR-based VDU models, demonstrating their impact across datasets and model families.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the robustness of Visual Document Understanding (VDU) systems under realistic adversarial perturbations, which remains understudied.

Method: A framework covering six gradient-based layout attack scenarios, manipulating OCR bounding boxes, pixels, and texts at word and line granularities, with layout perturbation constraints (e.g., IoU >= 0.6).

Result: Line-level attacks and compound perturbations cause the most severe performance degradation; PGD-based BBox perturbations outperform random-shift baselines.

Conclusion: The study highlights vulnerabilities in VDU models and validates the impact of layout budget, text modification, and adversarial transferability.

Abstract: Visual Document Understanding (VDU) systems have achieved strong performance
in information extraction by integrating textual, layout, and visual signals.
However, their robustness under realistic adversarial perturbations remains
insufficiently explored. We introduce the first unified framework for
generating and evaluating multi-modal adversarial attacks on OCR-based VDU
models. Our method covers six gradient-based layout attack scenarios,
incorporating manipulations of OCR bounding boxes, pixels, and texts across
both word and line granularities, with constraints on layout perturbation
budget (e.g., IoU >= 0.6) to preserve plausibility.
  Experimental results across four datasets (FUNSD, CORD, SROIE, DocVQA) and
six model families demonstrate that line-level attacks and compound
perturbations (BBox + Pixel + Text) yield the most severe performance
degradation. Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)-based BBox perturbations
outperform random-shift baselines in all investigated models. Ablation studies
further validate the impact of layout budget, text modification, and
adversarial transferability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess trade-offs between computational efficiency, energy consumption, and classification accuracy in CNNs by integrating signal processing transforms.

Method: Modified ResNet50 with WHT in early and/or late layers, tested on CIFAR-100 dataset.

Result: WHT integration boosted accuracy (74-79%) and slashed energy use (39 kJ vs. 25,606 kJ).

Conclusion: WHT is efficient and effective for energy-constrained CNN applications.

Abstract: This study investigates the integration of signal processing transformations
-- Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Walsh-Hadamard Transform (WHT), and Discrete
Cosine Transform (DCT) -- within the ResNet50 convolutional neural network
(CNN) model for image classification. The primary objective is to assess the
trade-offs between computational efficiency, energy consumption, and
classification accuracy during training and inference. Using the CIFAR-100
dataset (100 classes, 60,000 images), experiments demonstrated that
incorporating WHT significantly reduced energy consumption while improving
accuracy. Specifically, a baseline ResNet50 model achieved a testing accuracy
of 66%, consuming an average of 25,606 kJ per model. In contrast, a modified
ResNet50 incorporating WHT in the early convolutional layers achieved 74%
accuracy, and an enhanced version with WHT applied to both early and late
layers achieved 79% accuracy, with an average energy consumption of only 39 kJ
per model. These results demonstrate the potential of WHT as a highly efficient
and effective approach for energy-constrained CNN applications.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates CNN-based models for detecting face-swapping artifacts in videos, showing strong performance within the same dataset but poor generalization across sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face swapping in videos is a growing threat due to advanced tools, necessitating robust detection methods, especially for occlusion artifacts.

Method: Benchmarking CNN-based models on two datasets (one newly collected) to analyze generalization across sources and swapping algorithms.

Result: CNNs perform well within the same dataset but struggle with generalization, particularly for occlusion-based cues.

Conclusion: Specialized detection strategies are needed to handle occlusion artifacts in face-swapping detection.

Abstract: Face swapping manipulations in video streams represents an increasing threat
in remote video communications, due to advances
  in automated and real-time tools. Recent literature proposes to characterize
and exploit visual artifacts introduced in video frames
  by swapping algorithms when dealing with challenging physical scenes, such as
face occlusions. This paper investigates the
  effectiveness of this approach by benchmarking CNN-based data-driven models
on two data corpora (including a newly collected
  one) and analyzing generalization capabilities with respect to different
acquisition sources and swapping algorithms. The results
  confirm excellent performance of general-purpose CNN architectures when
operating within the same data source, but a significant
  difficulty in robustly characterizing occlusion-based visual cues across
datasets. This highlights the need for specialized detection
  strategies to deal with such artifacts.

TL;DR: CADC+ is a paired weather domain adaptation dataset for autonomous driving in winter, addressing the lack of labeled snowy and clear weather data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The impact of snowfall on 3D object detection is underexplored due to insufficient labeled data in both weather conditions.

Method: CADC+ pairs snowy sequences from CADC with clear weather sequences captured in the same environment to minimize domain shift.

Result: Snow introduces aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, acting as noise and a distinct data domain.

Conclusion: CADC+ enables accurate evaluation of snow's impact on 3D object detection, addressing limitations of synthetic data.

Abstract: The impact of snowfall on 3D object detection performance remains
underexplored. Conducting such an evaluation requires a dataset with sufficient
labelled data from both weather conditions, ideally captured in the same
driving environment. Current driving datasets with LiDAR point clouds either do
not provide enough labelled data in both snowy and clear weather conditions, or
rely on de-snowing methods to generate synthetic clear weather. Synthetic data
often lacks realism and introduces an additional domain shift that confounds
accurate evaluations. To address these challenges, we present CADC+, the first
paired weather domain adaptation dataset for autonomous driving in winter
conditions. CADC+ extends the Canadian Adverse Driving Conditions dataset
(CADC) using clear weather data that was recorded on the same roads and in the
same period as CADC. To create CADC+, we pair each CADC sequence with a clear
weather sequence that matches the snowy sequence as closely as possible. CADC+
thus minimizes the domain shift resulting from factors unrelated to the
presence of snow. We also present some preliminary results using CADC+ to
evaluate the effect of snow on 3D object detection performance. We observe that
snow introduces a combination of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, acting
as both noise and a distinct data domain.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A semi-self-supervised learning approach, GLMask, is proposed for instance segmentation, reducing manual annotation needs and achieving high performance in agriculture and general datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual pixel-level annotation for instance segmentation is labor-intensive, especially in agriculture with dense, occluded objects.

Method: GLMask uses image-mask representation to focus on shape, texture, and pattern, minimizing color dependence. A pipeline converts semantic to instance segmentation.

Result: Achieves 98.5% mAP@50 for wheat head segmentation and 12.6% improvement on COCO dataset.

Conclusion: The approach is effective for agriculture and other domains with similar data challenges.

Abstract: Instance segmentation is essential for applications such as automated
monitoring of plant health, growth, and yield. However, extensive effort is
required to create large-scale datasets with pixel-level annotations of each
object instance for developing instance segmentation models that restrict the
use of deep learning in these areas. This challenge is more significant in
images with densely packed, self-occluded objects, which are common in
agriculture. To address this challenge, we propose a semi-self-supervised
learning approach that requires minimal manual annotation to develop a
high-performing instance segmentation model. We design GLMask, an image-mask
representation for the model to focus on shape, texture, and pattern while
minimizing its dependence on color features. We develop a pipeline to generate
semantic segmentation and then transform it into instance-level segmentation.
The proposed approach substantially outperforms the conventional instance
segmentation models, establishing a state-of-the-art wheat head instance
segmentation model with mAP@50 of 98.5%. Additionally, we assessed the proposed
methodology on the general-purpose Microsoft COCO dataset, achieving a
significant performance improvement of over 12.6% mAP@50. This highlights that
the utility of our proposed approach extends beyond precision agriculture and
applies to other domains, specifically those with similar data characteristics.

TL;DR: SafeTriage de-identifies patient facial videos for stroke diagnosis while preserving motion cues, using a pretrained VMT model and conditional generative model for adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address ethical and privacy concerns in AI-based stroke triage by avoiding reliance on real patient data.

Method: Uses a pretrained VMT model to transfer motion to synthetic identities and a conditional generative model to adapt input space.

Result: Synthetic videos retain stroke-relevant facial patterns, ensuring reliable AI triage and robust privacy protection.

Conclusion: SafeTriage offers a secure, ethical solution for data sharing and AI-driven clinical analysis in neurological disorders.

Abstract: Effective stroke triage in emergency settings often relies on clinicians'
ability to identify subtle abnormalities in facial muscle coordination. While
recent AI models have shown promise in detecting such patterns from patient
facial videos, their reliance on real patient data raises significant ethical
and privacy challenges -- especially when training robust and generalizable
models across institutions. To address these concerns, we propose SafeTriage, a
novel method designed to de-identify patient facial videos while preserving
essential motion cues crucial for stroke diagnosis. SafeTriage leverages a
pretrained video motion transfer (VMT) model to map the motion characteristics
of real patient faces onto synthetic identities. This approach retains
diagnostically relevant facial dynamics without revealing the patients'
identities. To mitigate the distribution shift between normal population
pre-training videos and patient population test videos, we introduce a
conditional generative model for visual prompt tuning, which adapts the input
space of the VMT model to ensure accurate motion transfer without needing to
fine-tune the VMT model backbone. Comprehensive evaluation, including
quantitative metrics and clinical expert assessments, demonstrates that
SafeTriage-produced synthetic videos effectively preserve stroke-relevant
facial patterns, enabling reliable AI-based triage. Our evaluations also show
that SafeTriage provides robust privacy protection while maintaining diagnostic
accuracy, offering a secure and ethically sound foundation for data sharing and
AI-driven clinical analysis in neurological disorders.

Method: Proposes three spatially aware metrics incorporating structural and boundary information, validated on prostate zonal segmentation data.

Result: Demonstrates improved alignment with clinical factors and better discrimination between meaningful and spurious uncertainty patterns.

Conclusion: Spatially aware metrics enhance uncertainty evaluation in segmentation by considering context and anatomy.

Abstract: Uncertainty maps highlight unreliable regions in segmentation predictions.
However, most uncertainty evaluation metrics treat voxels independently,
ignoring spatial context and anatomical structure. As a result, they may assign
identical scores to qualitatively distinct patterns (e.g., scattered vs.
boundary-aligned uncertainty). We propose three spatially aware metrics that
incorporate structural and boundary information and conduct a thorough
validation on medical imaging data from the prostate zonal segmentation
challenge within the Medical Segmentation Decathlon. Our results demonstrate
improved alignment with clinically important factors and better discrimination
between meaningful and spurious uncertainty patterns.

TL;DR: MetaQAP is a no-reference IQA model using quality-aware pre-training and meta-learning, outperforming existing methods on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of subjective human perception and complex real-world image distortions in IQA.

Method: Pre-training CNNs on quality-aware data, using a quality-aware loss function, and integrating a meta-learner for ensemble predictions.

Result: Achieved high PLCC/SROCC scores (e.g., 0.9885/0.9812 on LiveCD) and demonstrated generalizability in cross-dataset evaluations.

Conclusion: MetaQAP provides a robust, generalizable framework for IQA, advancing the field and offering insights for future improvements.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) is a critical task in a wide range of
applications but remains challenging due to the subjective nature of human
perception and the complexity of real-world image distortions. This study
proposes MetaQAP, a novel no-reference IQA model designed to address these
challenges by leveraging quality-aware pre-training and meta-learning. The
model performs three key contributions: pre-training Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) on a quality-aware dataset, implementing a quality-aware loss
function to optimize predictions, and integrating a meta-learner to form an
ensemble model that effectively combines predictions from multiple base models.
Experimental evaluations were conducted on three benchmark datasets: LiveCD,
KonIQ-10K, and BIQ2021. The proposed MetaQAP model achieved exceptional
performance with Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient (PLCC) and Spearman
Rank Order Correlation Coefficient (SROCC) scores of 0.9885/0.9812 on LiveCD,
0.9702/0.9658 on KonIQ-10K, and 0.884/0.8765 on BIQ2021, outperforming existing
IQA methods. Cross-dataset evaluations further demonstrated the
generalizability of the model, with PLCC and SROCC scores ranging from 0.6721
to 0.8023 and 0.6515 to 0.7805, respectively, across diverse datasets. The
ablation study confirmed the significance of each model component, revealing
substantial performance degradation when critical elements such as the
meta-learner or quality-aware loss function were omitted. MetaQAP not only
addresses the complexities of authentic distortions but also establishes a
robust and generalizable framework for practical IQA applications. By advancing
the state-of-the-art in no-reference IQA, this research provides valuable
insights and methodologies for future improvements and extensions in the field.

*Ruiming Chen,Junming Yang,Shiyu Xia,Xu Yang,Jing Wang,Xin Geng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MM-LG extracts multimodal generalizable knowledge from CLIP, reducing pre-training costs and improving performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of pre-training CLIP at different scales and modalities by leveraging generalizable knowledge efficiently.

Method: Uses multimodal and unimodal blocks to extract knowledge, initializes descendant models with these components, and evaluates performance.

Result: Achieves performance gains (e.g., +3.1% on Oxford-IIIT PET) and reduces parameter storage by 75% and pre-training costs by 2.8x.

Conclusion: MM-LG is efficient for diverse downstream tasks, outperforming existing approaches and reducing resource requirements.

Abstract: CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) has attracted widespread
attention for its multimodal generalizable knowledge, which is significant for
downstream tasks. However, the computational overhead of a large number of
parameters and large-scale pre-training poses challenges of pre-training a
different scale of CLIP. Learngene extracts the generalizable components termed
as learngene from an ancestry model and initializes diverse descendant models
with it. Previous Learngene paradigms fail to handle the generalizable
knowledge in multimodal scenarios. In this paper, we put forward the idea of
utilizing a multimodal block to extract the multimodal generalizable knowledge,
which inspires us to propose MM-LG (Multimodal Learngene), a novel framework
designed to extract and leverage generalizable components from CLIP.
Specifically, we first establish multimodal and unimodal blocks to extract the
multimodal and unimodal generalizable knowledge in a weighted-sum manner.
Subsequently, we employ these components to numerically initialize descendant
models of varying scales and modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate
MM-LG's effectiveness, which achieves performance gains over existing learngene
approaches (e.g.,+3.1% on Oxford-IIIT PET and +4.13% on Flickr30k) and
comparable or superior results to the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm
(e.g.,+1.9% on Oxford-IIIT PET and +3.65% on Flickr30k). Notably, MM-LG
requires only around 25% of the parameter storage while reducing around 2.8
times pre-training costs for diverse model scales compared to the pre-training
and fine-tuning paradigm, making it particularly suitable for efficient
deployment across diverse downstream tasks.

TL;DR: The study explores how synthetic captioning strategies impact text-to-image models, finding that dense captions improve alignment but may reduce aesthetics, while randomized lengths balance aesthetics and alignment without losing diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of insights into synthetic caption design choices for text-to-image models, given the noise in web-scraped datasets.

Method: Systematically investigates different synthetic captioning strategies and their effects on model performance.

Result: Dense captions enhance text alignment but may harm aesthetics; randomized lengths balance aesthetics and alignment. Caption distributions also affect output bias.

Conclusion: Caption design is crucial for optimal model performance, offering practical insights for better training data strategies in text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Training data is at the core of any successful text-to-image models. The
quality and descriptiveness of image text are crucial to a model's performance.
Given the noisiness and inconsistency in web-scraped datasets, recent works
shifted towards synthetic training captions. While this setup is generally
believed to produce more capable models, current literature does not provide
any insights into its design choices. This study closes this gap by
systematically investigating how different synthetic captioning strategies
impact the downstream performance of text-to-image models. Our experiments
demonstrate that dense, high-quality captions enhance text alignment but may
introduce trade-offs in output aesthetics and diversity. Conversely, captions
of randomized lengths yield balanced improvements across aesthetics and
alignment without compromising sample diversity. We also demonstrate that
varying caption distributions introduce significant shifts in the output bias
of a trained model. Our findings underscore the importance of caption design in
achieving optimal model performance and provide practical insights for more
effective training data strategies in text-to-image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introducing striped structures in adversarial patches improves stereo depth estimation attacks, outperforming naive repeated textures in physical-world implementations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the poor performance of naive repeated textures in physical-world adversarial attacks on stereo depth estimation, revealing vulnerabilities before deployment.

Method: Developed a novel attack by optimizing striped structures and textures, tested on state-of-the-art methods (RAFT-Stereo, STTR) and commercial RGB-D cameras (Intel RealSense).

Result: The striped structure significantly enhances attack effectiveness, successfully misleading stereo depth estimation in real-world conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed adversarial patches are practical for security assessments of stereo systems, demonstrating real-world relevance.

Abstract: Stereo Depth estimation is a critical task in autonomous driving and
robotics, where inaccuracies (such as misidentifying nearby objects as distant)
can lead to dangerous situations. Adversarial attacks against stereo depth
estimation can help reveal vulnerabilities before deployment. Previous work has
shown that repeating optimized textures can effectively mislead stereo depth
estimation in digital settings. However, our research reveals that these
naively repeated texture structures perform poorly in physical-world
implementations, i.e., when deployed as patches, limiting their practical
utility for testing stereo depth estimation systems. In this work, for the
first time, we discover that introducing regular intervals between repeated
textures, creating a striped structure, significantly enhances the patch attack
effectiveness. Through extensive experimentation, we analyze how variations of
this novel structure influence the performance. Based on these insights, we
develop a novel stereo depth attack that jointly optimizes both the striped
structure and texture elements. Our generated adversarial patches can be
inserted into any scenes and successfully attack state-of-the-art stereo depth
estimation methods, i.e., RAFT-Stereo and STTR. Most critically, our patch can
also attack commercial RGB-D cameras (Intel RealSense) in real-world
conditions, demonstrating their practical relevance for security assessment of
stereo systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LaVi introduces efficient vision-language fusion in LVLMs by modulating internal LLM features, avoiding long-context issues and reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLMs suffer from inefficient visual-language integration, disrupting model structure or increasing computational burden.

Method: LaVi uses lightweight adaptive transformations to inject vision-conditioned deltas into LLM layer normalization, modulating linguistic states based on visual input.

Result: LaVi achieves state-of-the-art performance, reduces FLOPs by 94%, speeds up inference by 3.1x, and halves memory usage.

Conclusion: LaVi is a scalable, efficient solution for real-time multimodal reasoning, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Despite the impressive advancements of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs),
existing approaches suffer from a fundamental bottleneck: inefficient
visual-language integration. Current methods either disrupt the model's
inherent structure or introduce severe long-context computational burden,
severely limiting scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we rethink
multimodal integration and present LaVi, a novel LVLM that enables seamless and
efficient vision-language fusion through internal feature modulation within the
Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike dominant LVLMs that rely on visual token
concatenation, LaVi bypasses long-context expansion by introducing a
lightweight and adaptive transformation, which incorporates visual context by
injecting token-wise vision-conditioned deltas into the affine parameters of
layer normalization. This mechanism directly modulates linguistic hidden states
based on visual input, ensuring precise vision-language alignment while
preserving the LLM's linguistic priors and drastically reducing computational
costs. Extensive evaluations across 15 image and video benchmarks demonstrate
that LaVi not only achieves state-of-the-art multimodal performance but also
dramatically enhances efficiency. Compared to LLaVA-OV-7B, LaVi reduces FLOPs
by 94.0%, improves inference speed by 3.1 times, and cuts memory usage in half
- establishing LaVi as a scalable and practical solution for real-time
multimodal reasoning. The code and models will be released soon.

TL;DR: A framework leveraging language-driven common sense priors improves video action recognition in cluttered, occluded scenes by combining visual and textual cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods underutilize rich common sense priors in language models for understanding video contexts, especially in occluded scenes.

Method: Proposes three components: video context summary, description generation with reasoning, and multi-modal recognition combining visual and textual cues.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on Action Genome and Charades datasets.

Conclusion: Incorporating language-driven common sense priors enhances video action recognition in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Recent video action recognition methods have shown excellent performance by
adapting large-scale pre-trained language-image models to the video domain.
However, language models contain rich common sense priors - the scene contexts
that humans use to constitute an understanding of objects, human-object
interactions, and activities - that have not been fully exploited. In this
paper, we introduce a framework incorporating language-driven common sense
priors to identify cluttered video action sequences from monocular views that
are often heavily occluded. We propose: (1) A video context summary component
that generates candidate objects, activities, and the interactions between
objects and activities; (2) A description generation module that describes the
current scene given the context and infers subsequent activities, through
auxiliary prompts and common sense reasoning; (3) A multi-modal activity
recognition head that combines visual and textual cues to recognize video
actions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the challenging
Action Genome and Charades datasets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Few-shot Generalized Category Discovery (FSGCD) and proposes a decision boundary enhancement framework with affinity-based retrieval to improve performance under limited labeled samples and known categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCD models lack exploration of performance with limited labeled samples and few known categories, prompting the need for FSGCD.

Method: A decision boundary enhancement framework with affinity-based retrieval, including pre-training and a two-stage retrieval-guided optimization strategy.

Result: The method outperforms existing approaches on six public GCD benchmarks under FSGCD settings.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses FSGCD challenges, demonstrating superior performance and potential for practical applications.

Abstract: While existing Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) models have achieved
significant success, their performance with limited labeled samples and a small
number of known categories remains largely unexplored. In this work, we
introduce the task of Few-shot Generalized Category Discovery (FSGCD), aiming
to achieve competitive performance in GCD tasks under conditions of known
information scarcity. To tackle this challenge, we propose a decision boundary
enhancement framework with affinity-based retrieval. Our framework is designed
to learn the decision boundaries of known categories and transfer these
boundaries to unknown categories. First, we use a decision boundary
pre-training module to mitigate the overfitting of pre-trained information on
known category boundaries and improve the learning of these decision boundaries
using labeled samples. Second, we implement a two-stage retrieval-guided
decision boundary optimization strategy. Specifically, this strategy further
enhances the severely limited known boundaries by using affinity-retrieved
pseudo-labeled samples. Then, these refined boundaries are applied to unknown
clusters via guidance from affinity-based feature retrieval. Experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing methods on
six public GCD benchmarks under the FSGCD setting. The codes are available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes TeSG, a method for text-guided infrared and visible image fusion, leveraging textual semantics from VLMs to enhance fusion quality for downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-guided IVF lacks effective integration of textual semantics, limiting its utility for tasks like detection and segmentation.

Method: TeSG uses a Semantic Information Generator (SIG), Mask-Guided Cross-Attention (MGCA), and Text-Driven Attentional Fusion (TDAF) to integrate mask and text semantics for improved fusion.

Result: TeSG outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in downstream task performance.

Conclusion: TeSG effectively integrates textual semantics for superior IVF, demonstrating its potential for practical applications.

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVF) aims to combine complementary
information from both image modalities, producing more informative and
comprehensive outputs. Recently, text-guided IVF has shown great potential due
to its flexibility and versatility. However, the effective integration and
utilization of textual semantic information remains insufficiently studied. To
tackle these challenges, we introduce textual semantics at two levels: the mask
semantic level and the text semantic level, both derived from textual
descriptions extracted by large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Building on
this, we propose Textual Semantic Guidance for infrared and visible image
fusion, termed TeSG, which guides the image synthesis process in a way that is
optimized for downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation.
Specifically, TeSG consists of three core components: a Semantic Information
Generator (SIG), a Mask-Guided Cross-Attention (MGCA) module, and a Text-Driven
Attentional Fusion (TDAF) module. The SIG generates mask and text semantics
based on textual descriptions. The MGCA module performs initial attention-based
fusion of visual features from both infrared and visible images, guided by mask
semantics. Finally, the TDAF module refines the fusion process with gated
attention driven by text semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
competitiveness of our approach, particularly in terms of performance on
downstream tasks, compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 3DeepRep, a novel 3-directional deep low-rank tensor representation model for hyperspectral image inpainting, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on spectral mode transforms, neglecting low-rank properties in other tensor modes, limiting effectiveness.

Method: 3DeepRep applies deep nonlinear transforms along all three HSI tensor modes, using 3-directional TNN regularization and a learnable fusion module.

Result: The method achieves superior inpainting performance on real-world HSI datasets, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: 3DeepRep effectively addresses limitations of prior methods, demonstrating significant improvements in HSI inpainting.

Abstract: Recent approaches based on transform-based tensor nuclear norm (TNN) have
demonstrated notable effectiveness in hyperspectral image (HSI) inpainting by
leveraging low-rank structures in latent representations. Recent developments
incorporate deep transforms to improve low-rank tensor representation; however,
existing approaches typically restrict the transform to the spectral mode,
neglecting low-rank properties along other tensor modes. In this paper, we
propose a novel 3-directional deep low-rank tensor representation (3DeepRep)
model, which performs deep nonlinear transforms along all three modes of the
HSI tensor. To enforce low-rankness, the model minimizes the nuclear norms of
mode-i frontal slices in the corresponding latent space for each direction
(i=1,2,3), forming a 3-directional TNN regularization. The outputs from the
three directional branches are subsequently fused via a learnable aggregation
module to produce the final result. An efficient gradient-based optimization
algorithm is developed to solve the model in a self-supervised manner.
Extensive experiments on real-world HSI datasets demonstrate that the proposed
method achieves superior inpainting performance compared to existing
state-of-the-art techniques, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

TL;DR: CoDAF is a unified framework for UAV object detection that addresses weak alignment between RGB and IR imagery via semantic alignment and dynamic fusion, achieving 78.6% mAP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatial misalignment between RGB and IR imagery in UAV object detection causes semantic inconsistency and modality conflict, which existing methods handle poorly.

Method: CoDAF combines Offset-guided Semantic Alignment (OSA) for precise feature alignment and Dynamic Attention-guided Fusion Module (DAFM) for adaptive modality fusion.

Result: CoDAF achieves a mAP of 78.6% on the DroneVehicle dataset, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: CoDAF effectively addresses weak alignment and fusion challenges, improving robustness in UAV object detection.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) object detection plays a vital role in
applications such as environmental monitoring and urban security. To improve
robustness, recent studies have explored multimodal detection by fusing visible
(RGB) and infrared (IR) imagery. However, due to UAV platform motion and
asynchronous imaging, spatial misalignment frequently occurs between
modalities, leading to weak alignment. This introduces two major challenges:
semantic inconsistency at corresponding spatial locations and modality conflict
during feature fusion. Existing methods often address these issues in
isolation, limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Cross-modal
Offset-guided Dynamic Alignment and Fusion (CoDAF), a unified framework that
jointly tackles both challenges in weakly aligned UAV-based object detection.
CoDAF comprises two novel modules: the Offset-guided Semantic Alignment (OSA),
which estimates attention-based spatial offsets and uses deformable convolution
guided by a shared semantic space to align features more precisely; and the
Dynamic Attention-guided Fusion Module (DAFM), which adaptively balances
modality contributions through gating and refines fused features via
spatial-channel dual attention. By integrating alignment and fusion in a
unified design, CoDAF enables robust UAV object detection. Experiments on
standard benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach, with CoDAF
achieving a mAP of 78.6% on the DroneVehicle dataset.

Motivation: Existing V-IP methods ignore instance-level uncertainties, which are crucial for robust clinical decision-making.

Method: Introduces UAV-IP, a framework that quantifies epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in V-IP.

Result: Tested on four datasets, UAV-IP achieved a 3.2% higher AUC and 20% more concise explanations than baseline V-IP.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-aware reasoning enhances interpretable AI models for reliable medical imaging decisions.

Abstract: In medical imaging, AI decision-support systems must balance accuracy and
interpretability to build user trust and support effective clinical
decision-making. Recently, Variational Information Pursuit (V-IP) and its
variants have emerged as interpretable-by-design modeling techniques, aiming to
explain AI decisions in terms of human-understandable, clinically relevant
concepts. However, existing V-IP methods overlook instance-level uncertainties
in query-answer generation, which can arise from model limitations (epistemic
uncertainty) or variability in expert responses (aleatoric uncertainty).
  This paper introduces Uncertainty-Aware V-IP (UAV-IP), a novel framework that
integrates uncertainty quantification into the V-IP process. We evaluate UAV-IP
across four medical imaging datasets, PH2, Derm7pt, BrEaST, and SkinCon,
demonstrating an average AUC improvement of approximately 3.2% while generating
20% more concise explanations compared to baseline V-IP, without sacrificing
informativeness. These findings highlight the importance of uncertainty-aware
reasoning in interpretable by design models for robust and reliable medical
decision-making.

Motivation: Concerns about malicious use of diffusion models for image synthesis drive the need for robust detection methods, especially for unseen models.

Method: Introduces NASA-Swin, combining NASA with Swin Transformer, and uses cross-modality fusion of RGB and noise images with a channel mask strategy.

Result: Demonstrates superior detection performance, particularly for unseen diffusion models, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The NASA-Swin framework effectively generalizes to detect diffusion-generated images, even those from unseen models, enhancing security measures.

Abstract: With the rapid development of image generation technologies, especially the
advancement of Diffusion Models, the quality of synthesized images has
significantly improved, raising concerns among researchers about information
security. To mitigate the malicious abuse of diffusion models,
diffusion-generated image detection has proven to be an effective
countermeasure.However, a key challenge for forgery detection is generalising
to diffusion models not seen during training. In this paper, we address this
problem by focusing on image noise. We observe that images from different
diffusion models share similar noise patterns, distinct from genuine images.
Building upon this insight, we introduce a novel Noise-Aware Self-Attention
(NASA) module that focuses on noise regions to capture anomalous patterns. To
implement a SOTA detection model, we incorporate NASA into Swin Transformer,
forming an novel detection architecture NASA-Swin. Additionally, we employ a
cross-modality fusion embedding to combine RGB and noise images, along with a
channel mask strategy to enhance feature learning from both modalities.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
enhancing detection capabilities for diffusion-generated images. When
encountering unseen generation methods, our approach achieves the
state-of-the-art performance.Our code is available at

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hierarchical method for instance-level region discovery using self-supervised ViT features, addressing challenges like object embedding and occlusions in image retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing supervised or weakly supervised methods fail for unknown object categories, necessitating a more robust instance-level feature representation.

Method: Hierarchical decomposition of feature subsets from self-supervised ViT to model instance regions at varying semantic scales.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three instance search benchmarks, effective for known and unknown object categories.

Conclusion: The hierarchical approach provides a comprehensive and effective solution for instance-level representation in visual instance search.

Abstract: Despite the great success of the deep features in content-based image
retrieval, the visual instance search remains challenging due to the lack of
effective instance level feature representation. Supervised or weakly
supervised object detection methods are not among the options due to their poor
performance on the unknown object categories. In this paper, based on the
feature set output from self-supervised ViT, the instance level region
discovery is modeled as detecting the compact feature subsets in a hierarchical
fashion. The hierarchical decomposition results in a hierarchy of feature
subsets. The non-leaf nodes and leaf nodes on the hierarchy correspond to the
various instance regions in an image of different semantic scales. The
hierarchical decomposition well addresses the problem of object embedding and
occlusions, which are widely observed in the real scenarios. The features
derived from the nodes on the hierarchy make up a comprehensive representation
for the latent instances in the image. Our instance-level descriptor remains
effective on both the known and unknown object categories. Empirical studies on
three instance search benchmarks show that it outperforms state-of-the-art
methods considerably.

Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional image fusion methods by leveraging INR for continuous, resolution-independent fusion of multimodal image information.

Method: INRFuse uses neural networks to parameterize a continuous function, fusing infrared and visible light images via normalized spatial coordinates and multi-layer perceptrons, optimized by multiple loss functions.

Result: INRFuse outperforms existing methods in visual quality and objective metrics, producing clear, detailed, and information-rich fused images.

Conclusion: INRFuse demonstrates the effectiveness of INR for image fusion, offering a flexible, high-quality solution without requiring training data.

Abstract: Infrared and visible light image fusion aims to combine the strengths of both
modalities to generate images that are rich in information and fulfill visual
or computational requirements. This paper proposes an image fusion method based
on Implicit Neural Representations (INR), referred to as INRFuse. This method
parameterizes a continuous function through a neural network to implicitly
represent the multimodal information of the image, breaking through the
traditional reliance on discrete pixels or explicit features. The normalized
spatial coordinates of the infrared and visible light images serve as inputs,
and multi-layer perceptrons is utilized to adaptively fuse the features of both
modalities, resulting in the output of the fused image. By designing multiple
loss functions, the method jointly optimizes the similarity between the fused
image and the original images, effectively preserving the thermal radiation
information of the infrared image while maintaining the texture details of the
visible light image. Furthermore, the resolution-independent characteristic of
INR allows for the direct fusion of images with varying resolutions and
achieves super-resolution reconstruction through high-density coordinate
queries. Experimental results indicate that INRFuse outperforms existing
methods in both subjective visual quality and objective evaluation metrics,
producing fused images with clear structures, natural details, and rich
information without the necessity for a training dataset.

*Beomseok Ko,Hyeryung Jang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PQCAD-DM combines Progressive Quantization and Calibration-Assisted Distillation to compress diffusion models efficiently, reducing inference time by half while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models are computationally intensive and suffer from error accumulation, making compression challenging.

Method: PQCAD-DM uses Progressive Quantization (adaptive bit-width transitions) and Calibration-Assisted Distillation (full-precision calibration datasets) to compress the model.

Result: The method halves inference time while maintaining competitive generative quality, outperforming fixed-bit quantization.

Conclusion: PQCAD-DM effectively balances efficiency and performance, offering a practical solution for compressing diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models excel in image generation but are computational and
resource-intensive due to their reliance on iterative Markov chain processes,
leading to error accumulation and limiting the effectiveness of naive
compression techniques. In this paper, we propose PQCAD-DM, a novel hybrid
compression framework combining Progressive Quantization (PQ) and
Calibration-Assisted Distillation (CAD) to address these challenges. PQ employs
a two-stage quantization with adaptive bit-width transitions guided by a
momentum-based mechanism, reducing excessive weight perturbations in
low-precision. CAD leverages full-precision calibration datasets during
distillation, enabling the student to match full-precision performance even
with a quantized teacher. As a result, PQCAD-DM achieves a balance between
computational efficiency and generative quality, halving inference time while
maintaining competitive performance. Extensive experiments validate PQCAD-DM's
superior generative capabilities and efficiency across diverse datasets,
outperforming fixed-bit quantization methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TextBraTS, a multimodal dataset combining MRI volumes and textual annotations for brain tumor segmentation, and proposes a novel framework for text-guided segmentation, showing improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a comprehensive dataset integrating radiological images with textual annotations in brain tumor analysis has limited multimodal approaches.

Method: The authors introduce the TextBraTS dataset and propose a baseline framework with a sequential cross-attention method for text-guided volumetric segmentation.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements in segmentation accuracy using multimodal integration techniques.

Conclusion: The TextBraTS dataset and proposed framework advance multimodal brain tumor segmentation, with publicly available resources for further research.

Abstract: Deep learning has demonstrated remarkable success in medical image
segmentation and computer-aided diagnosis. In particular, numerous advanced
methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in brain tumor segmentation
from MRI scans. While recent studies in other medical imaging domains have
revealed that integrating textual reports with visual data can enhance
segmentation accuracy, the field of brain tumor analysis lacks a comprehensive
dataset that combines radiological images with corresponding textual
annotations. This limitation has hindered the exploration of multimodal
approaches that leverage both imaging and textual data.
  To bridge this critical gap, we introduce the TextBraTS dataset, the first
publicly available volume-level multimodal dataset that contains paired MRI
volumes and rich textual annotations, derived from the widely adopted BraTS2020
benchmark. Building upon this novel dataset, we propose a novel baseline
framework and sequential cross-attention method for text-guided volumetric
medical image segmentation. Through extensive experiments with various
text-image fusion strategies and templated text formulations, our approach
demonstrates significant improvements in brain tumor segmentation accuracy,
offering valuable insights into effective multimodal integration techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RealSR-R1 introduces VLCoT-GRPO, a framework combining vision and language reasoning for Real-World Image Super-Resolution, using GRPO and four reward functions to improve detail restoration and realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for Real-World Image Super-Resolution struggle with understanding degraded content, leading to low-fidelity results. The paper aims to enhance this by integrating reasoning capabilities inspired by Chain of Thought (CoT).

Method: Proposes VLCoT framework, simulating human image handling, and introduces GRPO with four reward functions: Format, Degradation, Understanding, and Generation rewards.

Result: RealSR-R1 achieves realistic detail generation and accurate content understanding, especially in complex or severely degraded scenes.

Conclusion: The VLCoT-GRPO framework effectively improves Real-World Image Super-Resolution by combining reasoning and optimization, demonstrating superior performance in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Real-World Image Super-Resolution is one of the most challenging task in
image restoration. However, existing methods struggle with an accurate
understanding of degraded image content, leading to reconstructed results that
are both low-fidelity and unnatural. We present RealSR-R1 in this work, which
empowers the RealSR models with understanding and reasoning capabilities.
Inspired by the success of Chain of Thought (CoT) in large language models
(LLMs), we simulate the human process of handling degraded images and propose
the VLCoT framework, which integrates vision and language reasoning. The
framework aims to precisely restore image details by progressively generating
more comprehensive text and higher-resolution images. To overcome the challenge
of traditional supervised learning CoT failing to generalize to real-world
scenarios, we introduce, for the first time, Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) into the Real-World Image Super-Resolution task. We propose VLCoT-GRPO
as a solution, which designs four reward functions: (1) Format reward, used to
standardize the CoT process; (2) Degradation reward, to incentivize accurate
degradation estimation; (3) Understanding reward, to ensure the accuracy of the
generated content; and (4) Generation reward, where we propose using a visual
expert model to evaluate the quality of generated images, encouraging the model
to generate more realistic images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed RealSR-R1 can generate realistic details and accurately understand
image content, particularly in semantically rich scenes or images with severe
degradation.

*Riccardo Corvi,Davide Cozzolino,Ekta Prashnani,Shalini De Mello,Koki Nagano,Luisa Verdoliva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve the generalization of AI-generated video detectors by focusing on low-level artifacts and using wavelet-based data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video forensic detectors lack generalization, limiting real-world applicability. The goal is to guide detectors to focus on intrinsic low-level artifacts rather than high-level flaws.

Method: Study generative architectures to identify robust features, then introduce a wavelet-based data augmentation strategy to train detectors on relevant forensic cues.

Result: The method significantly improves detector accuracy and generalizability, even on recent models like NOVA and FLUX, without needing large datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed training paradigm enhances detector performance by focusing on low-level artifacts, offering a simpler yet effective solution for synthetic video detection.

Abstract: Synthetic video generation is progressing very rapidly. The latest models can
produce very realistic high-resolution videos that are virtually
indistinguishable from real ones. Although several video forensic detectors
have been recently proposed, they often exhibit poor generalization, which
limits their applicability in a real-world scenario. Our key insight to
overcome this issue is to guide the detector towards seeing what really
matters. In fact, a well-designed forensic classifier should focus on
identifying intrinsic low-level artifacts introduced by a generative
architecture rather than relying on high-level semantic flaws that characterize
a specific model. In this work, first, we study different generative
architectures, searching and identifying discriminative features that are
unbiased, robust to impairments, and shared across models. Then, we introduce a
novel forensic-oriented data augmentation strategy based on the wavelet
decomposition and replace specific frequency-related bands to drive the model
to exploit more relevant forensic cues. Our novel training paradigm improves
the generalizability of AI-generated video detectors, without the need for
complex algorithms and large datasets that include multiple synthetic
generators. To evaluate our approach, we train the detector using data from a
single generative model and test it against videos produced by a wide range of
other models. Despite its simplicity, our method achieves a significant
accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art detectors and obtains excellent
results even on very recent generative models, such as NOVA and FLUX. Code and
data will be made publicly available.

*Chao Chen,Nobel Dang,Juexiao Zhang,Wenkai Sun,Pengfei Zheng,Xuhang He,Yimeng Ye,Taarun Srinivas,Chen Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Co-VisiON benchmark to evaluate co-visibility reasoning in sparse image sets, revealing a gap between current vision models and human performance. A proposed model, Covis, narrows this gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether current vision models match human-level proficiency in co-visibility analysis, a critical skill in 3D vision and robotic perception.

Method: The Co-VisiON benchmark evaluates co-visibility reasoning on sparse image sets across 1000 indoor scenarios. A novel multi-view baseline model, Covis, is proposed.

Result: Existing vision models struggle with co-visibility under sparse conditions, lagging behind human performance. A proprietary vision-language model outperforms vision-based approaches, while Covis achieves top performance among pure vision models.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the need for high-level reasoning in vision models. The benchmark and proposed model aim to advance robust reasoning in sparse environments.

Abstract: Humans exhibit a remarkable ability to recognize co-visibility-the
overlapping regions visible in multiple images-even when these images are
sparsely distributed across a complex scene. This capability is foundational in
3D vision and robotic perception. Despite significant progress in vision
learning, it remains unclear whether current vision models have reached
human-level proficiency in co-visibility analysis. In this work, we introduce
the Co-Visibility reasONing (Co-VisiON) benchmark, designed to directly
evaluate co-visibility reasoning on sparse image sets across over 1000 indoor
scenarios. Our experiments reveal that while co-visibility is typically treated
as a low-level feature matching task, it poses a significant challenge for
existing vision models under sparse conditions. Notably, a proprietary
vision-language model outperforms all purely vision-based approaches, with all
models lagging substantially behind human performance. This gap underscores the
need for more than basic pairwise vision processing-it calls for a
comprehensive spatial understanding through high-level reasoning across
multiple views. Inspired by human visual cognition, we propose a novel
multi-view baseline, Covis, which achieves top performance among pure vision
models and narrows the gap to the proprietary VLM. We hope our benchmark and
findings will spur further advancements in developing vision models capable of
robust, high-level reasoning in challenging, sparse environments. Our dataset

*Fan Yang,Yousong Zhu,Xin Li,Yufei Zhan,Hongyin Zhao,Shurong Zheng,Yaowei Wang,Ming Tang,Jinqiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOCUS is a unified LVLM integrating segmentation-aware perception and controllable object-centric generation in an end-to-end framework, outperforming disjointed models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs treat visual understanding and editing separately, relying on disjointed models, creating inefficiencies.

Method: FOCUS uses a dual-branch visual encoder, MoVQGAN-based tokenizer, and progressive multi-stage training with segmentation masks as spatial prompts.

Result: FOCUS excels in multimodal understanding, referring segmentation, and controllable image generation.

Conclusion: FOCUS bridges segmentation-aware perception and fine-grained synthesis, enhancing joint visual and generative tasks.

Abstract: Recent Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate promising
capabilities in unifying visual understanding and generative modeling, enabling
both accurate content understanding and flexible editing. However, current
approaches treat "what to see" and "how to edit" separately: they either
perform isolated object segmentation or utilize segmentation masks merely as
conditional prompts for local edit generation tasks, often relying on multiple
disjointed models. To bridge these gaps, we introduce FOCUS, a unified LVLM
that integrates segmentation-aware perception and controllable object-centric
generation within an end-to-end framework. FOCUS employs a dual-branch visual
encoder to simultaneously capture global semantic context and fine-grained
spatial details. In addition, we leverage a MoVQGAN-based visual tokenizer to
produce discrete visual tokens that enhance generation quality. To enable
accurate and controllable image editing, we propose a progressive multi-stage
training pipeline, where segmentation masks are jointly optimized and used as
spatial condition prompts to guide the diffusion decoder. This strategy aligns
visual encoding, segmentation, and generation modules, effectively bridging
segmentation-aware perception with fine-grained visual synthesis. Extensive
experiments across three core tasks, including multimodal understanding,
referring segmentation accuracy, and controllable image generation, demonstrate
that FOCUS achieves strong performance by jointly optimizing visual perception
and generative capabilities.

TL;DR: Loupe is a lightweight framework for joint deepfake detection and localization, combining patch-aware classification and segmentation with conditional queries. It achieves state-of-the-art performance with robust generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations in existing deepfake detection methods, such as poor generalization and complex architectures, by proposing a unified solution for detection and localization.

Method: Integrates a patch-aware classifier and segmentation module with conditional queries, and uses pseudo-label-guided test-time adaptation for robustness.

Result: Achieves top performance (0.846 score) on the DDL dataset and wins the IJCAI 2025 challenge.

Conclusion: Loupe's patch-level fusion and conditional query design effectively improve accuracy and localization across diverse forgery patterns.

Abstract: The proliferation of generative models has raised serious concerns about
visual content forgery. Existing deepfake detection methods primarily target
either image-level classification or pixel-wise localization. While some
achieve high accuracy, they often suffer from limited generalization across
manipulation types or rely on complex architectures. In this paper, we propose
Loupe, a lightweight yet effective framework for joint deepfake detection and
localization. Loupe integrates a patch-aware classifier and a segmentation
module with conditional queries, allowing simultaneous global authenticity
classification and fine-grained mask prediction. To enhance robustness against
distribution shifts of test set, Loupe introduces a pseudo-label-guided
test-time adaptation mechanism by leveraging patch-level predictions to
supervise the segmentation head. Extensive experiments on the DDL dataset
demonstrate that Loupe achieves state-of-the-art performance, securing the
first place in the IJCAI 2025 Deepfake Detection and Localization Challenge
with an overall score of 0.846. Our results validate the effectiveness of the
proposed patch-level fusion and conditional query design in improving both
classification accuracy and spatial localization under diverse forgery
patterns. The code is available at https://github.com/Kamichanw/Loupe.

TL;DR: A self-supervised learning framework for ball detection in RoboCup, reducing manual annotation needs and improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional supervised methods for ball detection require costly manual annotation, prompting a need for efficient alternatives.

Method: Uses a pretrained model for pseudo-labeling and self-supervised pretext tasks (colorization, edge detection, triplet loss) with MAML for rapid adaptation.

Result: Outperforms baselines in accuracy, F1 score, and IoU, with faster convergence.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances ball detection while minimizing manual annotation, validated by a new dataset.

Abstract: Robust and accurate ball detection is a critical component for autonomous
humanoid soccer robots, particularly in dynamic and challenging environments
such as RoboCup outdoor fields. However, traditional supervised approaches
require extensive manual annotation, which is costly and time-intensive. To
overcome this problem, we present a self-supervised learning framework for
domain-adaptive feature extraction to enhance ball detection performance. The
proposed approach leverages a general-purpose pretrained model to generate
pseudo-labels, which are then used in a suite of self-supervised pretext tasks
-- including colorization, edge detection, and triplet loss -- to learn robust
visual features without relying on manual annotations. Additionally, a
model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) strategy is incorporated to ensure rapid
adaptation to new deployment scenarios with minimal supervision. A new dataset
comprising 10,000 labeled images from outdoor RoboCup SPL matches is
introduced, used to validate the method, and made available to the community.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline outperforms
baseline models in terms of accuracy, F1 score, and IoU, while also exhibiting
faster convergence.

TL;DR: AnyTraverse is a framework for off-road traversability segmentation using natural language prompts and human-operator assistance, reducing supervision needs while adapting to diverse environments and robot types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current frameworks fail to handle unstructured environments and lack adaptability for different robots, limiting autonomous navigation in applications like search-and-rescue and agriculture.

Method: Combines natural language prompts with human-operator assistance, using zero-shot learning to avoid extensive data collection or retraining.

Result: Outperforms GA-NAV and Off-seg, validated on RELLIS-3D, Freiburg Forest, and RUGD datasets, and deployed on multiple robot platforms.

Conclusion: AnyTraverse offers a vehicle-agnostic, adaptive solution balancing automation with targeted human supervision for off-road traversability.

Abstract: Off-road traversability segmentation enables autonomous navigation with
applications in search-and-rescue, military operations, wildlife exploration,
and agriculture. Current frameworks struggle due to significant variations in
unstructured environments and uncertain scene changes, and are not adaptive to
be used for different robot types. We present AnyTraverse, a framework
combining natural language-based prompts with human-operator assistance to
determine navigable regions for diverse robotic vehicles. The system segments
scenes for a given set of prompts and calls the operator only when encountering
previously unexplored scenery or unknown class not part of the prompt in its
region-of-interest, thus reducing active supervision load while adapting to
varying outdoor scenes. Our zero-shot learning approach eliminates the need for
extensive data collection or retraining. Our experimental validation includes
testing on RELLIS-3D, Freiburg Forest, and RUGD datasets and demonstrate
real-world deployment on multiple robot platforms. The results show that
AnyTraverse performs better than GA-NAV and Off-seg while offering a
vehicle-agnostic approach to off-road traversability that balances automation
with targeted human supervision.

*Chaehyeon Song,Dongjae Lee,Jongwoo Lim,Ayoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an unbiased projection model for circular patterns in camera calibration, addressing bias issues under lens distortion, and introduces centroid uncertainty to improve robustness and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing projection models for circle centroids are biased under lens distortion, leading to low performance. The paper aims to overcome this limitation and enhance calibration robustness.

Method: The authors introduce an unbiased projection model for circular patterns and incorporate centroid uncertainty. They model boundary points as a Markov random field and propagate shape distribution to centroid uncertainty using Green theorem.

Result: The proposed framework achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared to checkerboard-based calibration, with improvements in pattern detection, optimization, and evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The paper presents a novel approach to camera calibration using circular patterns, offering higher accuracy and robustness, and provides guidelines for effective calibration based on evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Camera calibration using planar targets has been widely favored, and two
types of control points have been mainly considered as measurements: the
corners of the checkerboard and the centroid of circles. Since a centroid is
derived from numerous pixels, the circular pattern provides more precise
measurements than the checkerboard. However, the existing projection model of
circle centroids is biased under lens distortion, resulting in low performance.
To surmount this limitation, we propose an unbiased projection model of the
circular pattern and demonstrate its superior accuracy compared to the
checkerboard. Complementing this, we introduce uncertainty into circular
patterns to enhance calibration robustness and completeness. Defining centroid
uncertainty improves the performance of calibration components, including
pattern detection, optimization, and evaluation metrics. We also provide
guidelines for performing good camera calibration based on the evaluation
metric. The core concept of this approach is to model the boundary points of a
two-dimensional shape as a Markov random field, considering its connectivity.
The shape distribution is propagated to the centroid uncertainty through an
appropriate shape representation based on the Green theorem. Consequently, the
resulting framework achieves marked gains in calibration accuracy and
robustness. The complete source code and demonstration video are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based framework for video head swapping that preserves identity and allows expression editing, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack holistic head morphology preservation, struggle with hairstyle diversity and backgrounds, and don't support post-swap expression edits.

Method: Uses a latent diffusion paradigm with identity-preserving context fusion and expression-aware landmark retargeting/editing.

Result: Achieves seamless background integration, identity preservation, and superior expression transfer for real/virtual characters.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses limitations of current head-swapping techniques, offering robust and editable results.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based multi-condition
controllable framework for video head swapping, which seamlessly transplant a
human head from a static image into a dynamic video, while preserving the
original body and background of target video, and further allowing to tweak
head expressions and movements during swapping as needed. Existing
face-swapping methods mainly focus on localized facial replacement neglecting
holistic head morphology, while head-swapping approaches struggling with
hairstyle diversity and complex backgrounds, and none of these methods allow
users to modify the transplanted head expressions after swapping. To tackle
these challenges, our method incorporates several innovative strategies through
a unified latent diffusion paradigm. 1) Identity-preserving context fusion: We
propose a shape-agnostic mask strategy to explicitly disentangle foreground
head identity features from background/body contexts, combining hair
enhancement strategy to achieve robust holistic head identity preservation
across diverse hair types and complex backgrounds. 2) Expression-aware landmark
retargeting and editing: We propose a disentangled 3DMM-driven retargeting
module that decouples identity, expression, and head poses, minimizing the
impact of original expressions in input images and supporting expression
editing. While a scale-aware retargeting strategy is further employed to
minimize cross-identity expression distortion for higher transfer precision.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in seamless background
integration while preserving the identity of the source portrait, as well as
showcasing superior expression transfer capabilities applicable to both real
and virtual characters.

TL;DR: A Transformer-based end-to-end framework for autonomous parking learns from expert demonstrations, achieving high success rates and precision in simulated environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional rule-based parking systems lack adaptability in dynamic environments, while human drivers park intuitively. This inspires a learning-based approach.

Method: The framework uses surround-view camera images, goal-point representations, ego motion, and pedestrian trajectories as inputs. It outputs control sequences and includes a cross-attention module and GRU-based pedestrian predictor.

Result: Achieves a 96.57% success rate in CARLA simulator, with positional and orientation errors of 0.21m and 0.41°. Ablation studies confirm module effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed method outperforms traditional systems, demonstrating the potential of learning-based approaches for autonomous parking in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Autonomous parking plays a vital role in intelligent vehicle systems,
particularly in constrained urban environments where high-precision control is
required. While traditional rule-based parking systems struggle with
environmental uncertainties and lack adaptability in crowded or dynamic scenes,
human drivers demonstrate the ability to park intuitively without explicit
modeling. Inspired by this observation, we propose a Transformer-based
end-to-end framework for autonomous parking that learns from expert
demonstrations. The network takes as input surround-view camera images,
goal-point representations, ego vehicle motion, and pedestrian trajectories. It
outputs discrete control sequences including throttle, braking, steering, and
gear selection. A novel cross-attention module integrates BEV features with
target points, and a GRU-based pedestrian predictor enhances safety by modeling
dynamic obstacles. We validate our method on the CARLA 0.9.14 simulator in both
vertical and parallel parking scenarios. Experiments show our model achieves a
high success rate of 96.57\%, with average positional and orientation errors of
0.21 meters and 0.41 degrees, respectively. The ablation studies further
demonstrate the effectiveness of key modules such as pedestrian prediction and
goal-point attention fusion. The code and dataset will be released at:

TL;DR: The paper proposes STRUCTURE, a method to align pretrained unimodal models with minimal paired data, achieving significant improvements in zero-shot tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal models require vast paired datasets, which are costly or unavailable in many domains. This work explores alignment with limited data.

Method: Introduces STRUCTURE, a regularization technique preserving latent space geometry, and aligns layers with highest cross-modal similarity.

Result: Achieves 51.6% and 91.8% relative improvements in zero-shot classification and retrieval, respectively, across 24 benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework is effective for limited-sample multimodal learning, offering a scalable solution for resource-constrained domains.

Abstract: Multimodal models have demonstrated powerful capabilities in complex tasks
requiring multimodal alignment including zero-shot classification and
cross-modal retrieval. However, existing models typically rely on millions of
paired multimodal samples, which are prohibitively expensive or infeasible to
obtain in many domains. In this work, we explore the feasibility of building
multimodal models with limited amount of paired data by aligning pretrained
unimodal foundation models. We show that high-quality alignment is possible
with as few as tens of thousands of paired samples$\unicode{x2013}$less than
$1\%$ of the data typically used in the field. To achieve this, we introduce
STRUCTURE, an effective regularization technique that preserves the
neighborhood geometry of the latent space of unimodal encoders. Additionally,
we show that aligning last layers is often suboptimal and demonstrate the
benefits of aligning the layers with the highest representational similarity
across modalities. These two components can be readily incorporated into
existing alignment methods, yielding substantial gains across 24 zero-shot
image classification and retrieval benchmarks, with average relative
improvement of $51.6\%$ in classification and $91.8\%$ in retrieval tasks. Our
results highlight the effectiveness and broad applicability of our framework
for limited-sample multimodal learning and offer a promising path forward for
resource-constrained domains.

*Annika Thomas,Robaire Galliath,Aleksander Garbuz,Luke Anger,Cormac O'Neill,Trevor Johst,Dami Thomas,George Lordos,Jonathan P. How*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LunarLoc is a global localization method for lunar surface operations, using instance segmentation and graph-based terrain alignment to achieve drift-free, sub-cm accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous lunar operations require precise pose estimation without Earth-based navigation like GPS, especially for missions like IPEx. Existing methods like VIO suffer from drift over long traverses.

Method: LunarLoc uses instance segmentation to extract boulder landmarks from stereo imagery, constructs a terrain graph, and aligns it with a reference map using graph-theoretic data association.

Result: Achieves sub-cm accuracy in multi-session global localization, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: LunarLoc provides a robust solution for lunar global localization, with publicly released datasets to foster further research.

Abstract: Global localization is necessary for autonomous operations on the lunar
surface where traditional Earth-based navigation infrastructure, such as GPS,
is unavailable. As NASA advances toward sustained lunar presence under the
Artemis program, autonomous operations will be an essential component of tasks
such as robotic exploration and infrastructure deployment. Tasks such as
excavation and transport of regolith require precise pose estimation, but
proposed approaches such as visual-inertial odometry (VIO) accumulate odometry
drift over long traverses. Precise pose estimation is particularly important
for upcoming missions such as the ISRU Pilot Excavator (IPEx) that rely on
autonomous agents to operate over extended timescales and varied terrain. To
help overcome odometry drift over long traverses, we propose LunarLoc, an
approach to global localization that leverages instance segmentation for
zero-shot extraction of boulder landmarks from onboard stereo imagery. Segment
detections are used to construct a graph-based representation of the terrain,
which is then aligned with a reference map of the environment captured during a

### [90] [LAION-C: An Out-of-Distribution Benchmark for Web-Scale Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16950)
*Fanfei Li,Thomas Klein,Wieland Brendel,Robert Geirhos,Roland S. Zimmermann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LAION-C is introduced as a new benchmark for evaluating OOD robustness in models trained on web-scale datasets, addressing the limitations of outdated benchmarks like ImageNet-C.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks (e.g., ImageNet-C) are no longer suitable for evaluating OOD robustness due to the inclusion of common corruptions in modern web-scale datasets, leading to unclear progress in model generalization.

Method: LAION-C is proposed with six novel distortion types designed to be OOD even for web-scale datasets. It is evaluated on state-of-the-art models and compared to human robustness through psychophysical experiments.

Result: LAION-C poses significant challenges to contemporary models, including advanced ones like Gemini and GPT-4o. The best models now match or outperform human observers in OOD generalization.

Conclusion: LAION-C addresses the need for modern OOD robustness benchmarks, revealing a paradigm shift where top models rival or surpass human performance in generalization.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness is a desired property of computer vision
models. Improving model robustness requires high-quality signals from
robustness benchmarks to quantify progress. While various benchmark datasets
such as ImageNet-C were proposed in the ImageNet era, most ImageNet-C
corruption types are no longer OOD relative to today's large, web-scraped
datasets, which already contain common corruptions such as blur or JPEG
compression artifacts. Consequently, these benchmarks are no longer well-suited
for evaluating OOD robustness in the era of web-scale datasets. Indeed, recent
models show saturating scores on ImageNet-era OOD benchmarks, indicating that
it is unclear whether models trained on web-scale datasets truly become better
at OOD generalization or whether they have simply been exposed to the test
distortions during training. To address this, we introduce LAION-C as a
benchmark alternative for ImageNet-C. LAION-C consists of six novel distortion
types specifically designed to be OOD, even for web-scale datasets such as
LAION. In a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models, we find that
the LAION-C dataset poses significant challenges to contemporary models,
including MLLMs such as Gemini and GPT-4o. We additionally conducted a
psychophysical experiment to evaluate the difficulty of our corruptions for
human observers, enabling a comparison of models to lab-quality human
robustness data. We observe a paradigm shift in OOD generalization: from humans
outperforming models, to the best models now matching or outperforming the best
human observers.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Defusion is an all-in-one image restoration framework using visual instruction-guided degradation diffusion to handle mixed or unknown degradations, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image restoration models are task-specific, limiting their generalization for real-world scenarios with mixed or unknown degradations.

Method: Defusion constructs explicit visual instructions aligned with degradation patterns, guiding a diffusion-based model to denoise degradation effects.

Result: Defusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse restoration tasks, including complex and real-world degradations.

Conclusion: Defusion offers a generalized, stable, and high-performance solution for all-in-one image restoration.

Abstract: Image restoration tasks like deblurring, denoising, and dehazing usually need
distinct models for each degradation type, restricting their generalization in
real-world scenarios with mixed or unknown degradations. In this work, we
propose \textbf{Defusion}, a novel all-in-one image restoration framework that
utilizes visual instruction-guided degradation diffusion. Unlike existing
methods that rely on task-specific models or ambiguous text-based priors,
Defusion constructs explicit \textbf{visual instructions} that align with the
visual degradation patterns. These instructions are grounded by applying
degradations to standardized visual elements, capturing intrinsic degradation
features while agnostic to image semantics. Defusion then uses these visual
instructions to guide a diffusion-based model that operates directly in the
degradation space, where it reconstructs high-quality images by denoising the
degradation effects with enhanced stability and generalizability. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that Defusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across diverse image restoration tasks, including complex and real-world
degradations.

### [92] [Reversing Flow for Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16961)
*Haina Qin,Wenyang Luo,Libin Wang,Dandan Zheng,Jingdong Chen,Ming Yang,Bing Li,Weiming Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ResFlow is a novel image restoration framework using deterministic continuous normalizing flows, improving efficiency and performance over stochastic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative models for image restoration treat degradation as stochastic, leading to inefficiency and complexity.

Method: ResFlow models degradation as a deterministic path with continuous normalizing flows, using entropy-preserving paths and velocity field matching.

Result: ResFlow achieves state-of-the-art results, completing restoration in fewer than four steps.

Conclusion: ResFlow offers a practical, efficient solution for image restoration, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Image restoration aims to recover high-quality (HQ) images from degraded
low-quality (LQ) ones by reversing the effects of degradation. Existing
generative models for image restoration, including diffusion and score-based
models, often treat the degradation process as a stochastic transformation,
which introduces inefficiency and complexity. In this work, we propose ResFlow,
a novel image restoration framework that models the degradation process as a
deterministic path using continuous normalizing flows. ResFlow augments the
degradation process with an auxiliary process that disambiguates the
uncertainty in HQ prediction to enable reversible modeling of the degradation
process. ResFlow adopts entropy-preserving flow paths and learns the augmented
degradation flow by matching the velocity field. ResFlow significantly improves
the performance and speed of image restoration, completing the task in fewer
than four sampling steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ResFlow
achieves state-of-the-art results across various image restoration benchmarks,
offering a practical and efficient solution for real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mentor-Intern Collaborative Search (MICS) to generate rigorous medical chain-of-thought (CoT) data, enhancing reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). It also presents MMRP, a multi-task medical reasoning dataset, and Chiron-o1, a new medical MLLM with state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack a comprehensive framework for generating and evaluating effective reasoning paths in medical MLLMs, limiting their reasoning capabilities in critical diagnosis tasks.

Method: Proposes MICS, a scheme where mentor models initialize reasoning paths, intern models extend them, and the optimal path is selected based on MICS-Score. Uses this to build MMRP and train Chiron-o1 via curriculum learning.

Result: Chiron-o1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on medical visual question answering and reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: MICS effectively generates high-quality medical CoT data, and Chiron-o1 demonstrates robust reasoning capabilities, advancing medical MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have begun to demonstrate robust
reasoning capabilities on general tasks, yet their application in the medical
domain remains in its early stages. Constructing chain-of-thought (CoT)
training data is essential for bolstering the reasoning abilities of medical
MLLMs. However, existing approaches exhibit a deficiency in offering a
comprehensive framework for searching and evaluating effective reasoning paths
towards critical diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose Mentor-Intern
Collaborative Search (MICS), a novel reasoning-path searching scheme to
generate rigorous and effective medical CoT data. MICS first leverages mentor
models to initialize the reasoning, one step at a time, then prompts each
intern model to continue the thinking along those initiated paths, and finally
selects the optimal reasoning path according to the overall reasoning
performance of multiple intern models. The reasoning performance is determined
by an MICS-Score, which assesses the quality of generated reasoning paths.
Eventually, we construct MMRP, a multi-task medical reasoning dataset with
ranked difficulty, and Chiron-o1, a new medical MLLM devised via a curriculum
learning strategy, with robust visual question-answering and generalizable
reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Chiron-o1,
trained on our CoT dataset constructed using MICS, achieves state-of-the-art
performance across a list of medical visual question answering and reasoning
benchmarks. Codes are available at GitHub - manglu097/Chiron-o1: Enhancing

*Yasir Ali Farrukh,Syed Wali,Irfan Khan,Nathaniel D. Bastian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Prmpt2Adpt is a lightweight, zero-shot UDA framework using prompt-driven feature alignment and a teacher-student model, achieving fast adaptation and inference with minimal source data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing UDA methods, which rely on large models and full source data, by enabling efficient adaptation in resource-constrained settings like drones.

Method: Uses a distilled CLIP model as a frozen backbone, aligns source features to target via Prompt-driven Instance Normalization (PIN), and fine-tunes a teacher model to generate pseudo-labels for student adaptation.

Result: Achieves competitive detection performance, 7x faster adaptation, and 5x faster inference on the MDS-A dataset.

Conclusion: Prmpt2Adpt is a practical, scalable solution for real-time UDA in low-resource domains.

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is a critical challenge in real-world
vision systems, especially in resource-constrained environments like drones,
where memory and computation are limited. Existing prompt-driven UDA methods
typically rely on large vision-language models and require full access to
source-domain data during adaptation, limiting their applicability. In this
work, we propose Prmpt2Adpt, a lightweight and efficient zero-shot domain
adaptation framework built around a teacher-student paradigm guided by
prompt-based feature alignment. At the core of our method is a distilled and
fine-tuned CLIP model, used as the frozen backbone of a Faster R-CNN teacher. A
small set of low-level source features is aligned to the target domain
semantics-specified only through a natural language prompt-via Prompt-driven
Instance Normalization (PIN). These semantically steered features are used to
briefly fine-tune the detection head of the teacher model. The adapted teacher
then generates high-quality pseudo-labels, which guide the on-the-fly
adaptation of a compact student model. Experiments on the MDS-A dataset
demonstrate that Prmpt2Adpt achieves competitive detection performance compared
to state-of-the-art methods, while delivering up to 7x faster adaptation and 5x
faster inference speed using few source images-making it a practical and
scalable solution for real-time adaptation in low-resource domains.

### [96] [A Synthetic Benchmark for Collaborative 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction in V2X Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17004)
*Hanlin Wu,Pengfei Lin,Ehsan Javanmardi,Naren Bao,Bo Qian,Hao Si,Manabu Tsukada*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for collaborative 3D semantic occupancy prediction in autonomous driving, addressing limitations of single-vehicle perception by leveraging shared information. It augments an existing dataset with dense occupancy annotations and benchmarks varying prediction ranges. A baseline model with inter-agent feature fusion shows improved performance over single-agent models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-vehicle perception in autonomous driving is limited by occlusion, sensor range, and viewpoints. Collaborative perception can overcome these by exchanging complementary information.

Method: The paper augments an existing collaborative perception dataset with dense semantic voxel annotations using CARLA. It benchmarks prediction ranges and develops a baseline model with spatial alignment and attention aggregation for inter-agent feature fusion.

Result: The baseline model outperforms single-agent models, with greater improvements as the prediction range expands.

Conclusion: Collaborative 3D semantic occupancy prediction enhances perception accuracy and completeness, especially over larger spatial extents.

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is an emerging perception paradigm in
autonomous driving, providing a voxel-level representation of both geometric
details and semantic categories. However, the perception capability of a single
vehicle is inherently constrained by occlusion, restricted sensor range, and
narrow viewpoints. To address these limitations, collaborative perception
enables the exchange of complementary information, thereby enhancing the
completeness and accuracy. In the absence of a dedicated dataset for
collaborative 3D semantic occupancy prediction, we augment an existing
collaborative perception dataset by replaying it in CARLA with a
high-resolution semantic voxel sensor to provide dense and comprehensive
occupancy annotations. In addition, we establish benchmarks with varying
prediction ranges designed to systematically assess the impact of spatial
extent on collaborative prediction. We further develop a baseline model that
performs inter-agent feature fusion via spatial alignment and attention
aggregation. Experimental results demonstrate that our baseline model
consistently outperforms single-agent models, with increasing gains observed as
the prediction range expands.

### [97] [Unsupervised Image Super-Resolution Reconstruction Based on Real-World Degradation Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17027)
*Yiyang Tie,Hong Zhu,Yunyun Luo,Jing Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel TripleGAN framework is proposed to address challenges in modeling real-world degradation patterns for super-resolution (SR) reconstruction, outperforming existing methods on RealSR and DRealSR datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to accurately capture real-world degradation patterns (e.g., blur, noise, color shifts) from low-resolution (LR) images, limiting SR model performance.

Method: The TripleGAN framework includes three components: FirstGAN narrows the blur domain gap, SecondGAN approximates target-domain blur and learns additional degradations, and ThirdGAN reconstructs real-world LR images using pseudo-real data.

Result: The method outperforms others on RealSR and DRealSR datasets, achieving sharp reconstructions without over-smoothing artifacts.

Conclusion: The TripleGAN framework effectively learns real-world degradation patterns, enabling superior SR reconstruction from real-world LR inputs.

Abstract: The training of real-world super-resolution reconstruction models heavily
relies on datasets that reflect real-world degradation patterns. Extracting and
modeling degradation patterns for super-resolution reconstruction using only
real-world low-resolution (LR) images remains a challenging task. When
synthesizing datasets to simulate real-world degradation, relying solely on
degradation extraction methods fails to capture both blur and diverse noise
characteristics across varying LR distributions, as well as more implicit
degradations such as color gamut shifts. Conversely, domain translation alone
cannot accurately approximate real-world blur characteristics due to the
significant degradation domain gap between synthetic and real data. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel TripleGAN framework comprising two
strategically designed components: The FirstGAN primarily focuses on narrowing
the domain gap in blur characteristics, while the SecondGAN performs
domain-specific translation to approximate target-domain blur properties and
learn additional degradation patterns. The ThirdGAN is trained on pseudo-real
data generated by the FirstGAN and SecondGAN to reconstruct real-world LR
images. Extensive experiments on the RealSR and DRealSR datasets demonstrate
that our method exhibits clear advantages in quantitative metrics while
maintaining sharp reconstructions without over-smoothing artifacts. The
proposed framework effectively learns real-world degradation patterns from LR
observations and synthesizes aligned datasets with corresponding degradation
characteristics, thereby enabling the trained network to achieve superior
performance in reconstructing high-quality SR images from real-world LR inputs.

*Lorenzo Tausani,Paolo Muratore,Morgan B. Talbot,Giacomo Amerio,Gabriel Kreiman,Davide Zoccolan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SnS is a framework to study visual unit invariance and adversarial sensitivity in biological and artificial systems, revealing insights into CNN robustness and human recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how visual units encode features and generalize is key to vision research, but existing methods lack insights into invariance and adversarial robustness.

Method: SnS uses bi-objective optimization to probe invariance (preserving activation while altering representation) and adversarial sensitivity (suppressing activation with minimal stimulus change).

Result: SnS identified image variations preserving unit responses better than affine transformations, with differences based on representation level (pixel vs. CNN layers). Robust CNNs produced more human-recognizable invariant images.

Conclusion: SnS provides a systematic way to study invariance and adversarial effects, highlighting robust CNNs as better models of human vision.

Abstract: Uncovering which features' combinations high-level visual units encode is
critical to understand how images are transformed into representations that
support recognition. While existing feature visualization approaches typically
infer a unit's most exciting images, this is insufficient to reveal the
manifold of transformations under which responses remain invariant, which is
key to generalization in vision. Here we introduce Stretch-and-Squeeze (SnS),
an unbiased, model-agnostic, and gradient-free framework to systematically
characterize a unit's invariance landscape and its vulnerability to adversarial
perturbations in both biological and artificial visual systems. SnS frames
these transformations as bi-objective optimization problems. To probe
invariance, SnS seeks image perturbations that maximally alter the
representation of a reference stimulus in a given processing stage while
preserving unit activation. To probe adversarial sensitivity, SnS seeks
perturbations that minimally alter the stimulus while suppressing unit
activation. Applied to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), SnS revealed image
variations that were further from a reference image in pixel-space than those
produced by affine transformations, while more strongly preserving the target
unit's response. The discovered invariant images differed dramatically
depending on the choice of image representation used for optimization:
pixel-level changes primarily affected luminance and contrast, while stretching
mid- and late-layer CNN representations altered texture and pose respectively.
Notably, the invariant images from robust networks were more recognizable by
human subjects than those from standard networks, supporting the higher
fidelity of robust CNNs as models of the visual system.

*Florent Meyer,Laurent Guichard,Denis Coquenet,Guillaume Gravier,Yann Soullard,Bertrand Coüasnon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SaLT, a Syntax-Less Transformer, to address the performance drop of Transformer-based license plate recognition systems over time due to syntax shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Transformer-based systems perform well on known syntax but fail on new license plates, making them unreliable for production.

Method: The authors analyze Transformer encoder-decoder flaws, propose architectural changes, and integrate them into SaLT for syntax-agnostic modeling.

Result: SaLT achieves top accuracy on known syntax and maintains performance on future plates, validated by experiments and ablations.

Conclusion: SaLT offers a robust solution for license plate recognition by reducing reliance on past syntax, ensuring long-term effectiveness.

Abstract: Effective license plate recognition systems are required to be resilient to
constant change, as new license plates are released into traffic daily. While
Transformer-based networks excel in their recognition at first sight, we
observe significant performance drop over time which proves them unsuitable for
tense production environments. Indeed, such systems obtain state-of-the-art
results on plates whose syntax is seen during training. Yet, we show they
perform similarly to random guessing on future plates where legible characters
are wrongly recognized due to a shift in their syntax. After highlighting the
flows of positional and contextual information in Transformer encoder-decoders,
we identify several causes for their over-reliance on past syntax. Following,
we devise architectural cut-offs and replacements which we integrate into SaLT,
an attempt at a Syntax-Less Transformer for syntax-agnostic modeling of license
plate representations. Experiments on both real and synthetic datasets show
that our approach reaches top accuracy on past syntax and most importantly
nearly maintains performance on future license plates. We further demonstrate
the robustness of our architecture enhancements by way of various ablations.

TL;DR: Assembler is a scalable framework for 3D part assembly using diffusion models and a novel shape-centric representation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on diverse objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods struggle with diverse, real-world objects due to deterministic pose prediction and category-specific training. Assembler aims to generalize across varying part counts, geometries, and structures.

Method: Assembler formulates part assembly as a generative problem using diffusion models, introduces a sparse anchor point cloud representation, and leverages a large-scale dataset of 320K part-object assemblies.

Result: Assembler outperforms existing methods on PartNet and successfully assembles complex, real-world objects. It also enables part-aware 3D modeling from images.

Conclusion: Assembler advances 3D part assembly by addressing scalability and generalizability, with potential applications in interactive and compositional design.

Abstract: We present Assembler, a scalable and generalizable framework for 3D part
assembly that reconstructs complete objects from input part meshes and a
reference image. Unlike prior approaches that mostly rely on deterministic part
pose prediction and category-specific training, Assembler is designed to handle
diverse, in-the-wild objects with varying part counts, geometries, and
structures. It addresses the core challenges of scaling to general 3D part
assembly through innovations in task formulation, representation, and data.
First, Assembler casts part assembly as a generative problem and employs
diffusion models to sample plausible configurations, effectively capturing
ambiguities arising from symmetry, repeated parts, and multiple valid
assemblies. Second, we introduce a novel shape-centric representation based on
sparse anchor point clouds, enabling scalable generation in Euclidean space
rather than SE(3) pose prediction. Third, we construct a large-scale dataset of
over 320K diverse part-object assemblies using a synthesis and filtering
pipeline built on existing 3D shape repositories. Assembler achieves
state-of-the-art performance on PartNet and is the first to demonstrate
high-quality assembly for complex, real-world objects. Based on Assembler, we
further introduce an interesting part-aware 3D modeling system that generates
high-resolution, editable objects from images, demonstrating potential for
interactive and compositional design. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces KAA-CAL, a novel learning system combining knowledge acquisition and accumulation (KAA) with consistency-based active learning (CAL) to improve multi-label driving scene identification, achieving significant performance gains and data efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing autonomous vehicles' contextual awareness by addressing challenges in multi-label classification, such as dataset imbalance and task learning balance.

Method: KAA acquires knowledge from single-label datasets via monotask learning, while CAL bridges the knowledge gap between individual and joint attribute distributions.

Result: 56.1% performance increase over baseline, with KAA contributing 31.3% and CAL 24.8%. Outperforms SOTA models on BDD100K and HSD using 85% less data.

Conclusion: KAA-CAL effectively addresses multi-label classification challenges, improving performance and efficiency in driving scene identification.

Abstract: Driving scene identification, which assigns multiple non-exclusive class
labels to a scene, provides the contextual awareness necessary for enhancing
autonomous vehicles' ability to understand, reason about, and interact with the
complex driving environment. As a multi-label classification problem, it is
better tackled via multitasking learning. However, directly training a
multi-label classification model for driving scene identification through
multitask learning presents two main challenges: acquiring a balanced,
comprehensively annotated multi-label dataset and balancing learning across
different tasks. This paper introduces a novel learning system that synergizes
knowledge acquisition and accumulation (KAA) with consistency-based active
learning (CAL) to address those challenges. KAA acquires and accumulates
knowledge about scene identification from various single-label datasets via
monotask learning. Subsequently, CAL effectively resolves the knowledge gap
caused by the discrepancy between the marginal distributions of individual
attributes and their joint distribution. An ablation study on our Driving Scene
Identification (DSI) dataset demonstrates a 56.1% performance increase over the
baseline model pretrained on ImageNet. Of this, KAA accounts for 31.3% of the
gain, and CAL contributes 24.8%. Moreover, KAA-CAL stands out as the best
performer when compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) multi-label models on two
public datasets, BDD100K and HSD, achieving this while using 85% less data. The
DSI dataset and the implementation code for KAA-CAL are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MEXA is a training-free framework for multimodal reasoning that dynamically selects and aggregates expert models based on input modality and task demands, improving performance across diverse domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of unifying diverse input modalities and task complexities in multimodal reasoning, such as medical diagnosis and financial forecasting, motivates the need for a scalable and flexible framework.

Method: MEXA selects specialized expert models for modality-task pairs, generates interpretable reasoning outputs, and aggregates them using a Large Reasoning Model (LRM) for the final answer.

Result: MEXA outperforms strong multimodal baselines in benchmarks like Video Reasoning, Audio Reasoning, 3D Understanding, and Medical QA.

Conclusion: MEXA's modular, expert-driven approach enables effective and transparent multimodal reasoning across diverse domains without additional training.

Abstract: Combining pre-trained expert models offers substantial potential for scalable
multimodal reasoning, but building a unified framework remains challenging due
to the increasing diversity of input modalities and task complexity. For
instance, medical diagnosis requires precise reasoning over structured clinical
tables, while financial forecasting depends on interpreting plot-based data to
make informed predictions. To tackle this challenge, we introduce MEXA, a
training-free framework that performs modality- and task-aware aggregation of
multiple expert models to enable effective multimodal reasoning across diverse
and distinct domains. MEXA dynamically selects expert models based on the input
modality and the task-specific reasoning demands (i.e., skills). Each expert
model, specialized in a modality task pair, generates interpretable textual
reasoning outputs. MEXA then aggregates and reasons over these outputs using a
Large Reasoning Model (LRM) to produce the final answer. This modular design
allows flexible and transparent multimodal reasoning across diverse domains
without additional training overhead. We extensively evaluate our approach on
diverse multimodal benchmarks, including Video Reasoning, Audio Reasoning, 3D
Understanding, and Medical QA. MEXA consistently delivers performance
improvements over strong multimodal baselines, highlighting the effectiveness
and broad applicability of our expert-driven selection and aggregation in
diverse multimodal reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable precise object pose tracking without depth sensors, addressing challenges like rapid movements and occlusions.

Method: Uses a binary search strategy with render-and-compare, integrates XMem for 2D tracking, Kalman filter, and a state machine for recovery. Also adapts CAD models dynamically.

Result: Achieves competitive accuracy and real-time performance on benchmarks.

Conclusion: RGBTrack is a practical solution for robotics, AR, and computer vision, with code publicly available.

Abstract: We introduce a robust framework, RGBTrack, for real-time 6D pose estimation
and tracking that operates solely on RGB data, thereby eliminating the need for
depth input for such dynamic and precise object pose tracking tasks. Building
on the FoundationPose architecture, we devise a novel binary search strategy
combined with a render-and-compare mechanism to efficiently infer depth and
generate robust pose hypotheses from true-scale CAD models. To maintain stable
tracking in dynamic scenarios, including rapid movements and occlusions,
RGBTrack integrates state-of-the-art 2D object tracking (XMem) with a Kalman
filter and a state machine for proactive object pose recovery. In addition,
RGBTrack's scale recovery module dynamically adapts CAD models of unknown scale
using an initial depth estimate, enabling seamless integration with modern
generative reconstruction techniques. Extensive evaluations on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that RGBTrack's novel depth-free approach achieves
competitive accuracy and real-time performance, making it a promising practical
solution candidate for application areas including robotics, augmented reality,
and computer vision.

TL;DR: A novel watermarking technique using pgSPAD imagers is proposed, leveraging DSNU for source identification and tamper detection with controllable sensitivity-robustness trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing watermarking methods focus on CMOS and APS imagers, leaving SPAD imagers unexplored despite their potential.

Method: Utilized DSNU of three 64x64 pgSPAD imager chips fabricated in 0.35μm CMOS process to generate and analyze watermarks for test images.

Result: Achieved source identification and tamper detection using dynamic watermarks with adjustable sensitivity-robustness balance.

Conclusion: The proposed pgSPAD-based watermarking technique is effective for security applications, offering flexibility in sensitivity and robustness.

Abstract: Digital image watermarks as a security feature can be derived from the
imager's physically unclonable functions (PUFs) by utilizing the manufacturing
variations, i.e., the dark signal non-uniformity (DSNU). While a few
demonstrations focused on the CMOS image sensors (CIS) and active pixel sensors
(APS), single photon avalanche diode (SPAD) imagers have never been
investigated for this purpose. In this work, we have proposed a novel
watermarking technique using perimeter gated SPAD (pgSPAD) imagers. We utilized
the DSNU of three 64 x 64 pgSPAD imager chips, fabricated in a 0.35 {\mu}m
standard CMOS process and analyzed the simulated watermarks for standard test
images from publicly available database. Our observation shows that both source
identification and tamper detection can be achieved using the proposed
source-scene-specific dynamic watermarks with a controllable
sensitivity-robustness trade-off.

*Dongdong Meng,Sheng Li,Hao Wu,Guoping Wang,Xueqing Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel semi-supervised multi-modal medical image segmentation approach is proposed to enhance performance with limited labeled data by leveraging complementary multi-modal information and contrastive mutual learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inadequacy of semi-supervised learning for complex medical image tasks and the challenges of multi-modal fusion in leveraging unlabeled data effectively.

Method: Multi-stage multi-modal fusion and enhancement strategy to reduce feature discrepancies and enhance feature sharing, combined with contrastive mutual learning for prediction consistency.

Result: Superior performance and robustness demonstrated on two multi-modal datasets.

Conclusion: The framework shows valuable potential for solving medical image segmentation in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning addresses the issue of limited annotations in
medical images effectively, but its performance is often inadequate for complex
backgrounds and challenging tasks. Multi-modal fusion methods can significantly
improve the accuracy of medical image segmentation by providing complementary
information. However, they face challenges in achieving significant
improvements under semi-supervised conditions due to the challenge of
effectively leveraging unlabeled data. There is a significant need to create an
effective and reliable multi-modal learning strategy for leveraging unlabeled
data in semi-supervised segmentation. To address these issues, we propose a
novel semi-supervised multi-modal medical image segmentation approach, which
leverages complementary multi-modal information to enhance performance with
limited labeled data. Our approach employs a multi-stage multi-modal fusion and
enhancement strategy to fully utilize complementary multi-modal information,
while reducing feature discrepancies and enhancing feature sharing and
alignment. Furthermore, we effectively introduce contrastive mutual learning to
constrain prediction consistency across modalities, thereby facilitating the
robustness of segmentation results in semi-supervised tasks. Experimental
results on two multi-modal datasets demonstrate the superior performance and
robustness of the proposed framework, establishing its valuable potential for
solving medical image segmentation tasks in complex scenarios.

### [106] [On the Theory of Conditional Feature Alignment for Unsupervised Domain-Adaptive Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17137)
*Zhuonan Liang,Dongnan Liu,Jianan Fan,Yaxuan Song,Qiang Qu,Yu Yao,Peng Fu,Weidong Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes conditional feature alignment to address domain adaptation challenges in object counting, outperforming existing methods by aligning distributions conditionally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard domain adaptation fails in object counting due to density shifts, which are task-relevant. Conditional alignment is proposed to handle this.

Method: The framework formalizes conditional divergence, partitions domains into subsets, and aligns distributions per condition. A joint error bound is derived to justify the approach.

Result: Experiments on counting datasets show the method outperforms existing unsupervised domain adaptation techniques.

Conclusion: Conditional feature alignment improves cross-domain generalization for counting by preserving task-relevant variations and filtering nuisance shifts.

Abstract: Object counting models suffer when deployed across domains with differing
density variety, since density shifts are inherently task-relevant and violate
standard domain adaptation assumptions. To address this, we propose a
theoretical framework of conditional feature alignment. We first formalize the
notion of conditional divergence by partitioning each domain into subsets
(e.g., object vs. background) and measuring divergences per condition. We then
derive a joint error bound showing that, under discrete label spaces treated as
condition sets, aligning distributions conditionally leads to tighter bounds on
the combined source-target decision error than unconditional alignment. These
insights motivate a general conditional adaptation principle: by preserving
task-relevant variations while filtering out nuisance shifts, one can achieve
superior cross-domain generalization for counting. We provide both defining
conditional divergence then proving its benefit in lowering joint error and a
practical adaptation strategy that preserves task-relevant information in
unsupervised domain-adaptive counting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach through extensive experiments on multiple counting datasets with
varying density distributions. The results show that our method outperforms
existing unsupervised domain adaptation methods, empirically validating the
theoretical insights on conditional feature alignment.

*Ritabrata Chakraborty,Rajatsubhra Chakraborty,Avijit Dasgupta,Sandeep Chaurasia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a text-based approach using LLMs for soccer action spotting, replacing traditional video-centric methods, and demonstrates its effectiveness on the SoccerNet Echoes dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a lightweight, scalable alternative to computationally expensive video-based models by leveraging expert commentary for action spotting.

Method: Utilizes three specialized LLMs to evaluate timestamped commentary for identifying key actions like goals and substitutions.

Result: The language-centric approach effectively detects critical match events without training, offering a lightweight solution.

Conclusion: Text-based action spotting with LLMs is a viable, efficient alternative to traditional video-based methods.

Abstract: Traditional video-based tasks like soccer action spotting rely heavily on
visual inputs, often requiring complex and computationally expensive models to
process dense video data. In this work, we propose a shift from this
video-centric approach to a text-based task, making it lightweight and scalable
by utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) instead of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs). We posit that expert commentary, which provides rich, fine-grained
descriptions and contextual cues such as excitement and tactical insights,
contains enough information to reliably spot key actions in a match. To
demonstrate this, we use the SoccerNet Echoes dataset, which provides
timestamped commentary, and employ a system of three LLMs acting as judges
specializing in outcome, excitement, and tactics. Each LLM evaluates sliding
windows of commentary to identify actions like goals, cards, and substitutions,
generating accurate timestamps for these events. Our experiments show that this
language-centric approach performs effectively in detecting critical match
events, providing a lightweight and training-free alternative to traditional
video-based methods for action spotting.

*Qing Xu,Yuxiang Luo,Wenting Duan,Zhen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Co-Seg++ is a framework for medical image segmentation that integrates semantic and instance tasks, improving performance by leveraging their interdependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat segmentation tasks in isolation, ignoring interdependencies, leading to suboptimal results.

Method: Uses a spatio-temporal prompt encoder (STP-Encoder) and multi-task collaborative decoder (MTC-Decoder) to enhance task synergy.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation on CT and histopathology datasets.

Conclusion: Co-Seg++ effectively addresses the limitations of isolated task formulations, offering improved segmentation accuracy and medical image understanding.

Abstract: Medical image analysis is critical yet challenged by the need of jointly
segmenting organs or tissues, and numerous instances for anatomical structures
and tumor microenvironment analysis. Existing studies typically formulated
different segmentation tasks in isolation, which overlooks the fundamental
interdependencies between these tasks, leading to suboptimal segmentation
performance and insufficient medical image understanding. To address this
issue, we propose a Co-Seg++ framework for versatile medical segmentation.
Specifically, we introduce a novel co-segmentation paradigm, allowing semantic
and instance segmentation tasks to mutually enhance each other. We first devise
a spatio-temporal prompt encoder (STP-Encoder) to capture long-range spatial
and temporal relationships between segmentation regions and image embeddings as
prior spatial constraints. Moreover, we devise a multi-task collaborative
decoder (MTC-Decoder) that leverages cross-guidance to strengthen the
contextual consistency of both tasks, jointly computing semantic and instance
segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on diverse CT and histopathology
datasets demonstrate that the proposed Co-Seg++ outperforms state-of-the-arts
in the semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation of dental anatomical
structures, histopathology tissues, and nuclei instances. The source code is

TL;DR: yasmot is a lightweight, flexible object tracker for video or image sequences, compatible with monoscopic or stereoscopic cameras, and supports ensemble detector outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tracking objects over time improves detection performance and aids downstream tasks like behavior classification and abundance estimation.

Method: Processes outputs from popular object detectors to track objects, supports monoscopic/stereoscopic inputs, and generates consensus from detector ensembles.

Result: yasmot provides efficient object tracking and enhanced detection accuracy.

Conclusion: yasmot is a versatile tool for object tracking in image time series, adaptable to various detector outputs and camera setups.

Abstract: There now exists many popular object detectors based on deep learning that
can analyze images and extract locations and class labels for occurrences of
objects. For image time series (i.e., video or sequences of stills), tracking
objects over time and preserving object identity can help to improve object
detection performance, and is necessary for many downstream tasks, including
classifying and predicting behaviors, and estimating total abundances. Here we
present yasmot, a lightweight and flexible object tracker that can process the
output from popular object detectors and track objects over time from either
monoscopic or stereoscopic camera configurations. In addition, it includes
functionality to generate consensus detections from ensembles of object
detectors.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes facial landmark box plots for dataset analysis and compares two facial landmark features, finding neural networks outperform random forests in emotion recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving emotion recognition from facial images by addressing the lack of thorough dataset analysis and visualizing facial landmarks.

Method: Introduces facial landmark box plots for outlier detection and compares absolute positions vs. displacements of landmarks.

Result: Neural networks perform better than random forest classifiers in emotion recognition tasks.

Conclusion: Facial landmark box plots and neural networks enhance emotion recognition accuracy and dataset insights.

Abstract: Emotion recognition from facial images is a crucial task in human-computer
interaction, enabling machines to learn human emotions through facial
expressions. Previous studies have shown that facial images can be used to
train deep learning models; however, most of these studies do not include a
through dataset analysis. Visualizing facial landmarks can be challenging when
extracting meaningful dataset insights; to address this issue, we propose
facial landmark box plots, a visualization technique designed to identify
outliers in facial datasets. Additionally, we compare two sets of facial
landmark features: (i) the landmarks' absolute positions and (ii) their
displacements from a neutral expression to the peak of an emotional expression.
Our results indicate that a neural network achieves better performance than a
random forest classifier.

*Jiaqi Li,Junshu Tang,Zhiyong Xu,Longhuang Wu,Yuan Zhou,Shuai Shao,Tianbao Yu,Zhiguo Cao,Qinglin Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hunyuan-GameCraft is a framework for high-dynamic interactive video generation in games, addressing limitations in dynamics, generality, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for video generation in games lack dynamics, generality, long-term consistency, and efficiency, limiting gameplay video creation.

Method: The framework unifies keyboard/mouse inputs into a shared camera space, uses hybrid history-conditioned training, and employs model distillation for efficiency.

Result: Trained on a large-scale dataset, Hunyuan-GameCraft outperforms existing models in realism and playability.

Conclusion: The framework advances interactive game video generation with improved realism and real-time deployment capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based and controllable video generation have
enabled high-quality and temporally coherent video synthesis, laying the
groundwork for immersive interactive gaming experiences. However, current
methods face limitations in dynamics, generality, long-term consistency, and
efficiency, which limit the ability to create various gameplay videos. To
address these gaps, we introduce Hunyuan-GameCraft, a novel framework for
high-dynamic interactive video generation in game environments. To achieve
fine-grained action control, we unify standard keyboard and mouse inputs into a
shared camera representation space, facilitating smooth interpolation between
various camera and movement operations. Then we propose a hybrid
history-conditioned training strategy that extends video sequences
autoregressively while preserving game scene information. Additionally, to
enhance inference efficiency and playability, we achieve model distillation to
reduce computational overhead while maintaining consistency across long
temporal sequences, making it suitable for real-time deployment in complex
interactive environments. The model is trained on a large-scale dataset
comprising over one million gameplay recordings across over 100 AAA games,
ensuring broad coverage and diversity, then fine-tuned on a carefully annotated
synthetic dataset to enhance precision and control. The curated game scene data
significantly improves the visual fidelity, realism and action controllability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hunyuan-GameCraft significantly
outperforms existing models, advancing the realism and playability of
interactive game video generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniFork, a Y-shaped architecture, balances shared and task-specific learning for unified image understanding and generation, outperforming fully shared Transformer models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The divergent modality alignment patterns in understanding and generation tasks create conflicts in fully shared Transformer backbones, necessitating a better design.

Method: Analyzes modality alignment behaviors, then introduces UniFork with shared shallow layers and task-specific deeper branches.

Result: UniFork outperforms fully shared Transformers and matches or exceeds task-specific models.

Conclusion: UniFork effectively balances shared learning and task specialization, offering a superior unified model design.

Abstract: Unified image understanding and generation has emerged as a promising
paradigm in multimodal artificial intelligence. Despite recent progress, the
optimal architectural design for such unified models remains an open challenge.
In this work, we start by analyzing the modality alignment behaviors of
task-specific expert models for understanding and generation, as well as
current unified models. Our analysis reveals a crucial observation:
understanding tasks benefit from a progressively increasing modality alignment
across network depth, which helps build up semantic information for better
comprehension; In contrast, generation tasks follow a different trend: modality
alignment increases in the early layers but decreases in the deep layers to
recover spatial details. These divergent alignment patterns create a
fundamental conflict in fully shared Transformer backbones, where a uniform
representational flow often leads to performance compromises across two tasks.
Motivated by this finding, we introduce UniFork, a novel Y-shaped architecture
that shares the shallow layers for cross-task representation learning, while
employing task-specific branches in deeper layers to avoid task interference.
This design effectively balances shared learning and task specialization.
Through extensive ablation experiments, we demonstrate that Unifork
consistently outperforms conventional fully shared Transformer architectures,
and achieves performance on par with or better than task-specific models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Articulated objects are common but challenging to model accurately in 3D reconstruction.

Method: Uses a part-aware 3D Gaussian representation with learnable attributes and physics-based constraints for motion consistency.

Result: Outperforms baselines by up to 10× in Chamfer Distance for movable parts.

Conclusion: Part$^{2}$GS advances articulated object modeling with high-fidelity and physically consistent results.

Abstract: Articulated objects are common in the real world, yet modeling their
structure and motion remains a challenging task for 3D reconstruction methods.
In this work, we introduce Part$^{2}$GS, a novel framework for modeling
articulated digital twins of multi-part objects with high-fidelity geometry and
physically consistent articulation. Part$^{2}$GS leverages a part-aware 3D
Gaussian representation that encodes articulated components with learnable
attributes, enabling structured, disentangled transformations that preserve
high-fidelity geometry. To ensure physically consistent motion, we propose a
motion-aware canonical representation guided by physics-based constraints,
including contact enforcement, velocity consistency, and vector-field
alignment. Furthermore, we introduce a field of repel points to prevent part
collisions and maintain stable articulation paths, significantly improving
motion coherence over baselines. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and
real-world datasets show that Part$^{2}$GS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by up to 10$\times$ in Chamfer Distance for movable
parts.

TL;DR: InfGen is a unified model for long-term traffic simulation, combining closed-loop motion simulation and scene generation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models focus on short-term closed-loop motion simulation, lacking stability for long-term scenarios where agents dynamically enter and exit scenes.

Method: InfGen uses a next-token prediction model to interleave closed-loop motion simulation and scene generation, automatically switching modes for stability.

Result: InfGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in short-term (9s) simulation and significantly outperforms others in long-term (30s) simulation.

Conclusion: InfGen provides a robust solution for long-term traffic simulation, with code and model publicly available.

Abstract: An ideal traffic simulator replicates the realistic long-term point-to-point
trip that a self-driving system experiences during deployment. Prior models and
benchmarks focus on closed-loop motion simulation for initial agents in a
scene. This is problematic for long-term simulation. Agents enter and exit the
scene as the ego vehicle enters new regions. We propose InfGen, a unified
next-token prediction model that performs interleaved closed-loop motion
simulation and scene generation. InfGen automatically switches between
closed-loop motion simulation and scene generation mode. It enables stable
long-term rollout simulation. InfGen performs at the state-of-the-art in
short-term (9s) traffic simulation, and significantly outperforms all other
methods in long-term (30s) simulation. The code and model of InfGen will be

*Zeyuan Yang,Xueyang Yu,Delin Chen,Maohao Shen,Chuang Gan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mirage enhances VLMs by using latent visual tokens for reasoning without explicit image generation, improving multimodal performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with visual imagination tasks due to text-only decoding; Mirage aims to mimic human mental imagery for better reasoning.

Method: Mirage uses latent visual tokens alongside text, supervised first by image embeddings, then text-only, and refined via reinforcement learning.

Result: Mirage improves multimodal reasoning without generating explicit images, as shown in diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: Mirage demonstrates the potential of latent visual tokens for enhancing VLM reasoning, avoiding the drawbacks of explicit image generation.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at multimodal understanding, yet their
text-only decoding forces them to verbalize visual reasoning, limiting
performance on tasks that demand visual imagination. Recent attempts train VLMs
to render explicit images, but the heavy image-generation pre-training often
hinders the reasoning ability. Inspired by the way humans reason with mental
imagery-the internal construction and manipulation of visual cues-we
investigate whether VLMs can reason through interleaved multimodal trajectories
without producing explicit images. To this end, we present a Machine Mental
Imagery framework, dubbed as Mirage, which augments VLM decoding with latent
visual tokens alongside ordinary text. Concretely, whenever the model chooses
to ``think visually'', it recasts its hidden states as next tokens, thereby
continuing a multimodal trajectory without generating pixel-level images. Begin
by supervising the latent tokens through distillation from ground-truth image
embeddings, we then switch to text-only supervision to make the latent
trajectory align tightly with the task objective. A subsequent reinforcement
learning stage further enhances the multimodal reasoning capability.
Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Mirage unlocks stronger
multimodal reasoning without explicit image generation.

TL;DR: DiffTrack is a framework for analyzing how video diffusion models (DiTs) establish temporal correspondences, revealing key insights and enabling practical applications like zero-shot tracking and motion-enhanced video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how video diffusion models internally represent temporal correspondences across frames, a question not yet addressed.

Method: DiffTrack constructs a dataset with pseudo ground-truth tracking annotations and proposes metrics to analyze the 3D attention mechanism of DiTs, focusing on layers, timesteps, and representations.

Result: Query-key similarities in specific layers are critical for temporal matching, improving during denoising. DiffTrack achieves state-of-the-art in zero-shot tracking and enhances video generation.

Conclusion: DiffTrack provides foundational insights into video DiTs' temporal understanding, enabling further research and applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video diffusion models based on Diffusion Transformers
(DiTs) have achieved remarkable success in generating temporally coherent
videos. Yet, a fundamental question persists: how do these models internally
establish and represent temporal correspondences across frames? We introduce
DiffTrack, the first quantitative analysis framework designed to answer this
question. DiffTrack constructs a dataset of prompt-generated video with pseudo
ground-truth tracking annotations and proposes novel evaluation metrics to
systematically analyze how each component within the full 3D attention
mechanism of DiTs (e.g., representations, layers, and timesteps) contributes to
establishing temporal correspondences. Our analysis reveals that query-key
similarities in specific, but not all, layers play a critical role in temporal
matching, and that this matching becomes increasingly prominent during the
denoising process. We demonstrate practical applications of DiffTrack in
zero-shot point tracking, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance
compared to existing vision foundation and self-supervised video models.
Further, we extend our findings to motion-enhanced video generation with a
novel guidance method that improves temporal consistency of generated videos
without additional training. We believe our work offers crucial insights into
the inner workings of video DiTs and establishes a foundation for further
research and applications leveraging their temporal understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLN systems rely on discrete topological graphs, limiting flexibility. VLN-R1 aims to enable continuous navigation using LVLMs.

Method: Uses GRPO-based training with a two-stage approach: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) with Time-Decayed Reward (TDR).

Result: Achieves strong performance on VLN-CE benchmark, demonstrating LVLMs' potential for embodied navigation.

Conclusion: VLN-R1 shows LVLMs can enhance navigation and reasoning through data-efficient, reward-driven training.

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) is a core challenge in embodied AI,
requiring agents to navigate real-world environments using natural language
instructions. Current language model-based navigation systems operate on
discrete topological graphs, limiting path planning to predefined node
connections. We propose VLN-R1, an end-to-end framework that leverages Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLM) to directly translate egocentric video streams
into continuous navigation actions, adopting GRPO-based training inspired by
DeepSeek-R1. To enable effective training, we first construct the VLN-Ego
dataset using a 3D simulator, Habitat, and propose Long-Short Memory Sampling
to balance historical and current observations. While large language models can
supervise complete textual instructions, they lack fine-grained action-level
control. Our framework employs a two-stage training approach: a) Supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) to align the model's action sequence text predictions with
expert demonstrations, followed by b) Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) enhanced
with a Time-Decayed Reward (TDR) mechanism that strategically weights
multi-step future actions. Experimental results show VLN-R1 achieves strong
performance on VLN-CE benchmark. VLN-R1 proves LVLMs can drive embodied
navigation and enhance task-specific reasoning through data-efficient,
reward-driven post-training.

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with counterfactual reasoning, often relying on parametric knowledge, and finetuning may degrade stored knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if LLMs can integrate in-context knowledge with parametric knowledge, focusing on counterfactual reasoning.

Method: Synthetic and real experiments in multi-hop reasoning problems.

Result: LLMs generally fail at counterfactual reasoning, defaulting to parametric knowledge; finetuning can degrade performance.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have limitations in repurposing parametric knowledge in novel settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models have been shown to contain extensive world knowledge in
their parameters, enabling impressive performance on many knowledge intensive
tasks. However, when deployed in novel settings, LLMs often encounter
situations where they must integrate parametric knowledge with new or
unfamiliar information. In this work, we explore whether LLMs can combine
knowledge in-context with their parametric knowledge through the lens of
counterfactual reasoning. Through synthetic and real experiments in multi-hop
reasoning problems, we show that LLMs generally struggle with counterfactual
reasoning, often resorting to exclusively using their parametric knowledge.
Moreover, we show that simple post-hoc finetuning can struggle to instill
counterfactual reasoning ability -- often leading to degradation in stored
parametric knowledge. Ultimately, our work reveals important limitations of
current LLM's abilities to re-purpose parametric knowledge in novel settings.

TL;DR: SPECS is a latency-aware test-time scaling method for LLMs that balances accuracy and latency by using a smaller model for candidate generation and integrating reward signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between increased compute (for accuracy) and user-facing latency in LLMs, which current methods overlook.

Method: SPECS uses a smaller model to generate candidates, evaluates them with a larger model and reward model, and employs reward-guided soft verification and deferral.

Result: SPECS matches or surpasses beam search accuracy while reducing latency by up to 19.1% on tested datasets.

Conclusion: SPECS effectively optimizes for both accuracy and latency, with theoretical convergence to a KL-regularized RL objective.

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute has driven the recent advances in the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs), typically by allocating
additional computation for more thorough exploration. However, increased
compute often comes at the expense of higher user-facing latency, directly
impacting user experience. Current test-time scaling methods primarily optimize
for accuracy based on total compute resources (FLOPS), often overlooking
latency constraints. To address this gap, we propose $\texttt{SPECS}$, a
latency-aware test-time scaling method inspired by speculative decoding.
$\texttt{SPECS}$~uses a smaller, faster model to generate candidate sequences
efficiently, and evaluates these candidates using signals from both a larger
target model and a dedicated reward model. We introduce new integration
strategies, including reward-guided soft verification and a reward-based
deferral mechanism. Empirical results on MATH500, AMC23 and OlympiadBench
datasets show that $\texttt{SPECS}$~matches or surpasses beam search accuracy
while reducing latency by up to $\sim$19.1\%. Our theoretical analysis shows
that our algorithm converges to the solution of a KL-regularized reinforcement
learning objective with increasing beam width.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs face unique vulnerabilities due to their multimodal nature, allowing adversaries to bypass safety measures. The paper aims to address the "delayed safety awareness" phenomenon observed in VLMs.

Method: The authors propose "The Safety Reminder," a soft prompt-tuning approach that injects learnable prompt tokens during text generation to proactively reactivate safety awareness.

ensuring their safety has become paramount. Unlike traditional Large Language
Models (LLMs), VLMs face unique vulnerabilities due to their multimodal nature,
allowing adversaries to modify visual or textual inputs to bypass safety
guardrails and trigger the generation of harmful content. Through systematic
analysis of VLM behavior under attack, we identify a novel phenomenon termed
``delayed safety awareness''. Specifically, we observe that safety-aligned VLMs
may initially be compromised to produce harmful content, but eventually
recognize the associated risks and attempt to self-correct. This pattern
suggests that VLMs retain their underlying safety awareness but experience a
temporal delay in their activation. Building on this insight, we hypothesize
that VLMs' safety awareness can be proactively reactivated through carefully
designed prompts. To this end, we introduce ``The Safety Reminder'', a soft
prompt tuning approach that optimizes learnable prompt tokens, which are
periodically injected during the text generation process to enhance safety
awareness, effectively preventing harmful content generation. Additionally, our
safety reminder only activates when harmful content is detected, leaving normal
conversations unaffected and preserving the model's performance on benign
tasks. Through comprehensive evaluation across three established safety
benchmarks and one adversarial attacks, we demonstrate that our approach
significantly reduces attack success rates while maintaining model utility,
offering a practical solution for deploying safer VLMs in real-world
applications.

*Robert Graham,Edward Stevinson,Leo Richter,Alexander Chia,Joseph Miller,Joseph Isaac Bloom*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ContextBench, a benchmark for evaluating methods that generate targeted, fluent inputs to trigger specific behaviors in language models, and improves Evolutionary Prompt Optimisation (EPO) with LLM-assistance and diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify inputs that activate latent features or behaviors in language models for safety applications.

Method: Formalizes context modification, introduces ContextBench, and enhances EPO with LLM-assistance and diffusion model inpainting.

Result: Enhanced EPO variants achieve state-of-the-art performance in balancing elicitation effectiveness and fluency.

Conclusion: The approach and benchmark advance the capability to generate targeted inputs while maintaining linguistic fluency, addressing current method limitations.

Abstract: Identifying inputs that trigger specific behaviours or latent features in
language models could have a wide range of safety use cases. We investigate a
class of methods capable of generating targeted, linguistically fluent inputs
that activate specific latent features or elicit model behaviours. We formalise
this approach as context modification and present ContextBench -- a benchmark
with tasks assessing core method capabilities and potential safety
applications. Our evaluation framework measures both elicitation strength
(activation of latent features or behaviours) and linguistic fluency,
highlighting how current state-of-the-art methods struggle to balance these
objectives. We enhance Evolutionary Prompt Optimisation (EPO) with
LLM-assistance and diffusion model inpainting, and demonstrate that these
variants achieve state-of-the-art performance in balancing elicitation
effectiveness and fluency.

*Jonathan Kutasov,Yuqi Sun,Paul Colognese,Teun van der Weij,Linda Petrini,Chen Bo Calvin Zhang,John Hughes,Xiang Deng,Henry Sleight,Tyler Tracy,Buck Shlegeris,Joe Benton*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs' ability to pursue hidden harmful objectives while completing tasks, using SHADE-Arena. Top models like Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Gemini 2.5 Pro show limited sabotage success, while monitoring remains challenging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the risks of LLMs acting as autonomous agents with hidden harmful goals, especially in complex, long-horizon tasks.

Method: Uses SHADE-Arena, a diverse dataset, to test LLMs' ability to complete harmful side tasks undetected while performing benign main tasks.

Result: Best models achieved 27% (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) and 15% (Gemini 2.5 Pro) success as sabotage agents. Monitoring by Gemini 2.5 Pro achieved an AUC of 0.87.

Conclusion: Current LLMs struggle with sabotage due to execution flaws, but monitoring subtle sabotage is already difficult and may worsen with more complex tasks.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous
agents in complex and long horizon settings, it is critical to evaluate their
ability to sabotage users by pursuing hidden objectives. We study the ability
of frontier LLMs to evade monitoring and achieve harmful hidden goals while
completing a wide array of realistic tasks. We evaluate a broad range of
frontier LLMs using SHADE (Subtle Harmful Agent Detection & Evaluation)-Arena,
the first highly diverse agent evaluation dataset for sabotage and monitoring
capabilities of LLM agents. SHADE-Arena consists of complex pairs of benign
main tasks and harmful side objectives in complicated environments. Agents are
evaluated on their ability to complete the side task without appearing
suspicious to an LLM monitor. When measuring agent ability to (a) complete the
main task, (b) complete the side task, and (c) avoid detection, we find that
the best performing frontier models score 27% (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) and 15%
(Gemini 2.5 Pro) as sabotage agents when overseen by Claude 3.6 Sonnet. For
current frontier models, success on the side task relies heavily on having
access to a hidden scratchpad that is not visible to the monitor. We also use
SHADE-Arena to measure models' monitoring abilities, with the top monitor
(Gemini 2.5 Pro) achieving an AUC of 0.87 at distinguishing benign and malign
transcripts. We find that for now, models still struggle at sabotage due to
failures in long-context main task execution. However, our measurements already
demonstrate the difficulty of monitoring for subtle sabotage attempts, which we
expect to only increase in the face of more complex and longer-horizon tasks.

TL;DR: The paper highlights the lack of standardization in Agentic AI research, introduces a robust evaluation protocol, and presents OAgents, a modular framework achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agent research lacks standardization and reproducibility, hindering fair comparisons and progress measurement.

Method: Systematic empirical study on GAIA benchmark and BrowseComp to evaluate design choices, followed by introducing a robust evaluation protocol and developing OAgents.

Result: Identified key impactful components, stabilized evaluations, and created OAgents, a top-performing open-source framework.

Conclusion: Standardized evaluation and modular design (OAgents) advance Agentic AI research effectively.

Abstract: Recently, Agentic AI has become an increasingly popular research field.
However, we argue that current agent research practices lack standardization
and scientific rigor, making it hard to conduct fair comparisons among methods.
As a result, it is still unclear how different design choices in agent
frameworks affect effectiveness, and measuring their progress remains
challenging. In this work, we conduct a systematic empirical study on GAIA
benchmark and BrowseComp to examine the impact of popular design choices in key
agent components in a fair and rigorous manner. We find that the lack of a
standard evaluation protocol makes previous works, even open-sourced ones,
non-reproducible, with significant variance between random runs. Therefore, we
introduce a more robust evaluation protocol to stabilize comparisons. Our study
reveals which components and designs are crucial for effective agents, while
others are redundant, despite seeming logical. Based on our findings, we build
and open-source OAgents, a new foundation agent framework that achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source projects. OAgents offers a
modular design for various agent components, promoting future research in
Agentic AI.

### [124] [Sysformer: Safeguarding Frozen Large Language Models with Adaptive System Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15751)
*Kartik Sharma,Yiqiao Jin,Vineeth Rakesh,Yingtong Dou,Menghai Pan,Mahashweta Das,Srijan Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Sysformer, a transformer model, adapts system prompts in LLMs to enhance safety, improving refusal rates for harmful prompts and compliance with safe ones without fine-tuning the LLM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often fail to balance safety and responsiveness, either refusing harmless prompts or generating harmful content. Existing defenses are costly or heuristic-based.

Method: Sysformer updates system prompts in the LLM input embedding space, trained to refuse harmful prompts and respond ideally to safe ones while keeping LLM parameters frozen.

Result: Sysformer improves refusal rates on harmful prompts by up to 80% and compliance with safe prompts by up to 90%, also enhancing robustness against jailbreaking attacks by up to 100%.

Conclusion: Sysformer offers a cost-effective way to safeguard LLMs and encourages future research into variable system prompts.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are deployed in safety-critical settings, it
is essential to ensure that their responses comply with safety standards. Prior
research has revealed that LLMs often fail to grasp the notion of safe
behaviors, resulting in either unjustified refusals to harmless prompts or the
generation of harmful content. While substantial efforts have been made to
improve their robustness, existing defenses often rely on costly fine-tuning of
model parameters or employ suboptimal heuristic techniques. In this work, we
take a novel approach to safeguard LLMs by learning to adapt the system prompts
in instruction-tuned LLMs. While LLMs are typically pre-trained to follow a
fixed system prompt, we investigate the impact of tailoring the system prompt
to each specific user input on the safety of the responses. To this end, we
propose $\textbf{Sysformer}$, a trans$\textbf{former}$ model that updates an
initial $\textbf{sys}$tem prompt to a more robust system prompt in the LLM
input embedding space while attending to the user prompt. While keeping the LLM
parameters frozen, the Sysformer is trained to refuse to respond to a set of
harmful prompts while responding ideally to a set of safe ones. Through
extensive experiments on $5$ LLMs from different families and $2$ recent
benchmarks, we demonstrate that Sysformer can significantly enhance the
robustness of LLMs, leading to upto $80\%$ gain in the refusal rate on harmful
prompts while enhancing the compliance with the safe prompts by upto $90\%$.
Results also generalize well to sophisticated jailbreaking attacks, making LLMs
upto $100\%$ more robust against different attack strategies. We hope our
findings lead to cheaper safeguarding of LLMs and motivate future
investigations into designing variable system prompts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CIfly is a framework for efficient causal inference by reducing tasks to reachability in state-space graphs, offering linear-time performance and outperforming traditional methods like moralization and latent projection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a more efficient and scalable alternative to existing causal inference primitives, which are computationally intensive.

Method: CIfly formalizes causal reasoning tasks as reachability problems in dynamically constructed state-space graphs, using a rule table schema for linear-time execution.

Result: CIfly outperforms traditional methods (e.g., moralization, latent projection) and is implemented in Rust for high-performance execution, accessible from Python and R.

Conclusion: CIfly serves as a flexible, scalable backbone for causal inference, enabling efficient algorithm development and deployment.

Abstract: We introduce CIfly, a framework for efficient algorithmic primitives in
graphical causal inference that isolates reachability as a reusable core
operation. It builds on the insight that many causal reasoning tasks can be
reduced to reachability in purpose-built state-space graphs that can be
constructed on the fly during traversal. We formalize a rule table schema for
specifying such algorithms and prove they run in linear time. We establish
CIfly as a more efficient alternative to the common primitives moralization and
latent projection, which we show are computationally equivalent to Boolean
matrix multiplication. Our open-source Rust implementation parses rule table
text files and runs the specified CIfly algorithms providing high-performance
execution accessible from Python and R. We demonstrate CIfly's utility by
re-implementing a range of established causal inference tasks within the
framework and by developing new algorithms for instrumental variables. These
contributions position CIfly as a flexible and scalable backbone for graphical
causal inference, guiding algorithm development and enabling easy and efficient
deployment.

*J. Schwardt,J. C. Budich*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DOCSAT, a new stochastic local search heuristic for 3-SAT, outperforms existing solvers like WalkSAT and Kissat on critically hard instances by dissipating oversatisfied constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing solvers like WalkSAT struggle with local minima in hard 3-SAT instances due to oversatisfied constraints.

Method: DOCSAT reduces oversatisfied constraints to avoid local minima, tested on hard 3-SAT instances up to N=15000.

Result: DOCSAT outperforms WalkSAT and Kissat, especially on the hardest instances.

Conclusion: DOCSAT's approach of leveraging statistical structure beyond the primary cost function can generalize to other optimization problems.

Abstract: We introduce and benchmark a stochastic local search heuristic for the
NP-complete satisfiability problem 3-SAT that drastically outperforms existing
solvers in the notoriously difficult realm of critically hard instances. Our
construction is based on the crucial observation that well established previous
approaches such as WalkSAT are prone to get stuck in local minima that are
distinguished from true solutions by a larger number of oversatisfied
combinatorial constraints. To address this issue, the proposed algorithm,
coined DOCSAT, dissipates oversatisfied constraints (DOC), i.e. reduces their
unfavorable abundance so as to render them critical. We analyze and benchmark
our algorithm on a randomly generated sample of hard but satisfiable 3-SAT
instances with varying problem sizes up to N=15000. Quite remarkably, we find
that DOCSAT outperforms both WalkSAT and other well known algorithms including
the complete solver Kissat, even when comparing its ability to solve the
hardest quintile of the sample to the average performance of its competitors.
The essence of DOCSAT may be seen as a way of harnessing statistical structure
beyond the primary cost function of a combinatorial problem to avoid or escape
local minima traps in stochastic local search, which opens avenues for
generalization to other optimization problems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SLR is an automated framework for evaluating and training LLMs via scalable logical reasoning, creating tasks with controlled difficulty and verifying outputs symbolically. It benchmarks LLMs, showing gaps in logical inference and improves performance via logic-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate and enhance LLMs' logical reasoning capabilities without human annotation, ensuring scalability and novelty.

Method: SLR synthesizes tasks with ground-truth rules, validation programs, and prompts. It creates SLR-Bench, a benchmark with 19k+ prompts across 20 difficulty levels.

Result: LLMs often fail at logical inference despite valid syntax. Logic-tuning via SLR doubles accuracy for Llama-3-8B, matching more expensive models.

Conclusion: SLR provides a scalable, automated way to advance LLMs' reasoning, outperforming costly alternatives and ensuring dataset novelty.

Abstract: We introduce SLR, an end-to-end framework for systematic evaluation and
training of Large Language Models (LLMs) via Scalable Logical Reasoning. Given
a user's task specification, SLR enables scalable, automated synthesis of
inductive reasoning tasks with precisely controlled difficulty. For each task,
SLR synthesizes (i) a latent ground-truth rule, (ii) an executable validation
program used by a symbolic judge to deterministically verify model outputs, and
(iii) an instruction prompt for the reasoning task. Using SLR, we create
SLR-Bench, a benchmark comprising over 19k prompts spanning 20 curriculum
levels that progressively increase in relational, arithmetic, and recursive
complexity. Large-scale evaluation reveals that contemporary LLMs readily
produce syntactically valid rules, yet often fail at correct logical inference.
Recent reasoning LLMs do somewhat better, but incur substantial increases in
test-time compute, sometimes exceeding 15k completion tokens. Finally,
logic-tuning via SLR doubles Llama-3-8B accuracy on SLR-Bench, achieving parity
with Gemini-Flash-Thinking at a fraction of computational cost. SLR is fully
automated, requires no human annotation, ensures dataset novelty, and offers a
scalable environment for probing and advancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: Addresses the need for AI agents capable of adapting to diverse human operators in high-stakes scenarios like cross-team coordination and civil-military interactions.

Method: Uses Sotopia as a testbed for two experiments: (1) measures personality trait impacts on negotiations via causal discovery, and (2) evaluates human-AI job negotiations by manipulating human personality and AI traits.

Result: Found Agreeableness and Extraversion significantly affect negotiation outcomes. AI agent trustworthiness impacts mission effectiveness. Provides actionable insights for reliable AI systems.

Conclusion: Establishes a repeatable evaluation methodology for AI reliability, advancing beyond standard metrics to include social dynamics critical for mission success.

Abstract: This paper presents an evaluation framework for agentic AI systems in
mission-critical negotiation contexts, addressing the need for AI agents that
can adapt to diverse human operators and stakeholders. Using Sotopia as a
simulation testbed, we present two experiments that systematically evaluated
how personality traits and AI agent characteristics influence LLM-simulated
social negotiation outcomes--a capability essential for a variety of
applications involving cross-team coordination and civil-military interactions.
Experiment 1 employs causal discovery methods to measure how personality traits
impact price bargaining negotiations, through which we found that Agreeableness
and Extraversion significantly affect believability, goal achievement, and
knowledge acquisition outcomes. Sociocognitive lexical measures extracted from
team communications detected fine-grained differences in agents' empathic
communication, moral foundations, and opinion patterns, providing actionable
insights for agentic AI systems that must operate reliably in high-stakes
operational scenarios. Experiment 2 evaluates human-AI job negotiations by
manipulating both simulated human personality and AI system characteristics,
specifically transparency, competence, adaptability, demonstrating how AI agent
trustworthiness impact mission effectiveness. These findings establish a
repeatable evaluation methodology for experimenting with AI agent reliability
across diverse operator personalities and human-agent team dynamics, directly
supporting operational requirements for reliable AI systems. Our work advances
the evaluation of agentic AI workflows by moving beyond standard performance
metrics to incorporate social dynamics essential for mission success in complex

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of scientific literature exceeds human and AI processing capabilities, necessitating a formal, verifiable system for belief updates and truth utility.

Method: BEWA uses Bayesian inference, replication scores, citation weighting, temporal decay, and graph-based claim propagation to model belief dynamically.

Result: The architecture enables probabilistically coherent belief updates, author credibility modeling, and audit-resilient integrity in scientific reasoning.

Conclusion: BEWA provides a foundational framework for machine reasoning systems to achieve rational belief convergence and truth utility in evolving scientific fields.

Abstract: The exponential expansion of scientific literature has surpassed the
epistemic processing capabilities of both human experts and current artificial
intelligence systems. This paper introduces Bayesian Epistemology with Weighted
Authority (BEWA), a formally structured architecture that operationalises
belief as a dynamic, probabilistically coherent function over structured
scientific claims. Each claim is contextualised, author-attributed, and
evaluated through a system of replication scores, citation weighting, and
temporal decay. Belief updates are performed via evidence-conditioned Bayesian
inference, contradiction processing, and epistemic decay mechanisms. The
architecture supports graph-based claim propagation, authorial credibility
modelling, cryptographic anchoring, and zero-knowledge audit verification. By
formalising scientific reasoning into a computationally verifiable epistemic
network, BEWA advances the foundation for machine reasoning systems that
promote truth utility, rational belief convergence, and audit-resilient
integrity across dynamic scientific domains.

TL;DR: The paper introduces two novel value functions for dual-objective RL problems, leveraging Hamilton-Jacobi equations to address Reach-Always-Avoid and Reach-Reach problems, and proposes DO-HJ-PPO, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hard constraints in RL degrade performance; Lagrangian methods require complex tuning. The work aims to simplify dual-objective satisfaction without temporal logic.

Method: Extends Hamilton-Jacobi RL advances to derive tractable Bellman forms for Reach-Always-Avoid and Reach-Reach problems, proposing DO-HJ-PPO.

Result: DO-HJ-PPO produces distinct behaviors and outperforms baselines in safe-arrival and multi-target tasks.

Conclusion: The approach offers a new perspective on constrained decision-making, solving dual-objective problems effectively.

Abstract: Hard constraints in reinforcement learning (RL), whether imposed via the
reward function or the model architecture, often degrade policy performance.
Lagrangian methods offer a way to blend objectives with constraints, but often
require intricate reward engineering and parameter tuning. In this work, we
extend recent advances that connect Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equations with RL to
propose two novel value functions for dual-objective satisfaction. Namely, we
address: (1) the Reach-Always-Avoid problem - of achieving distinct reward and
penalty thresholds - and (2) the Reach-Reach problem - of achieving thresholds
of two distinct rewards. In contrast with temporal logic approaches, which
typically involve representing an automaton, we derive explicit, tractable
Bellman forms in this context by decomposing our problem into reach, avoid, and
reach-avoid problems, as to leverage these aforementioned recent advances. From
a mathematical perspective, the Reach-Always-Avoid and Reach-Reach problems are
complementary and fundamentally different from standard sum-of-rewards problems
and temporal logic problems, providing a new perspective on constrained
decision-making. We leverage our analysis to propose a variation of Proximal
Policy Optimization (DO-HJ-PPO), which solves these problems. Across a range of
tasks for safe-arrival and multi-target achievement, we demonstrate that
DO-HJ-PPO produces qualitatively distinct behaviors from previous approaches
and out-competes a number of baselines in various metrics.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the high latency in generative AI systems for computer-use tasks, identifying planning and reflection as major causes, and introduces OSWorld-Human to evaluate agent efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the impractical latency of current generative AI systems for computer-use tasks and guide future improvements.

Method: Conducts a study on temporal performance using OSWorld benchmark, identifies latency causes, and creates OSWorld-Human for evaluation.

Result: Large model calls for planning/reflection cause most latency; agents take 1.4-2.7x more steps than necessary.

Conclusion: Future AI agents must optimize planning and reflection to reduce latency and improve efficiency.

Abstract: Generative AI is being leveraged to solve a variety of computer-use tasks
involving desktop applications. State-of-the-art systems have focused solely on
improving accuracy on leading benchmarks. However, these systems are
practically unusable due to extremely high end-to-end latency (e.g., tens of
minutes) for tasks that typically take humans just a few minutes to complete.
To understand the cause behind this and to guide future developments of
computer agents, we conduct the first study on the temporal performance of
computer-use agents on OSWorld, the flagship benchmark in computer-use AI. We
find that large model calls for planning and reflection account for the
majority of the overall latency, and as an agent uses more steps to complete a
task, each successive step can take 3x longer than steps at the beginning of a
task. We then construct OSWorld-Human, a manually annotated version of the
original OSWorld dataset that contains a human-determined trajectory for each
task. We evaluate 16 agents on their efficiency using OSWorld-Human and found
that even the highest-scoring agents on OSWorld take 1.4-2.7x more steps than
necessary.

*Tom Jeleniewski,Hamied Nabizada,Jonathan Reif,Felix Gehlhoff,Alexander Fay*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces verification mechanisms for an ontology-based process model to ensure correct data retrieval and interpretation in manufacturing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges like context-relevant data selection, unit compatibility, and input data completeness in modeling parameter interdependencies.

Method: Uses SPARQL-based filtering, unit consistency checks, and data completeness checks within an ontology-based framework.

Result: Demonstrated applicability in Resin Transfer Molding (RTM), enabling machine-interpretable and verifiable models.

Conclusion: The proposed mechanisms enhance the reliability and reusability of process knowledge in manufacturing.

Abstract: The formalization of process knowledge using ontologies enables consistent
modeling of parameter interdependencies in manufacturing. These
interdependencies are typically represented as mathematical expressions that
define relations between process parameters, supporting tasks such as
calculation, validation, and simulation. To support cross-context application
and knowledge reuse, such expressions are often defined in a generic form and
applied across multiple process contexts. This highlights the necessity of a
consistent and semantically coherent model to ensure the correctness of data
retrieval and interpretation. Consequently, dedicated mechanisms are required
to address key challenges such as selecting context-relevant data, ensuring
unit compatibility between variables and data elements, and verifying the
completeness of input data required for evaluating mathematical expressions.
This paper presents a set of verification mechanisms for a previously developed
ontology-based process model that integrates standardized process semantics,
data element definitions, and formal mathematical constructs. The approach
includes (i) SPARQL-based filtering to retrieve process-relevant data, (ii) a
unit consistency check based on expected-unit annotations and semantic
classification, and (iii) a data completeness check to validate the
evaluability of interdependencies. The applicability of the approach is
demonstrated with a use case from Resin Transfer Molding (RTM), supporting the
development of machine-interpretable and verifiable engineering models.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using graph neural networks and heterogeneous graph structures to predict optimization algorithm performance, outperforming traditional tabular methods by up to 36.6% in MSE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional performance prediction methods overlook algorithm configurations, a critical factor. Graph-based approaches better capture complex dependencies between problems, configurations, and outcomes.

Method: Uses graph neural networks and heterogeneous graphs to model relationships between algorithm operators, parameters, problem characteristics, and performance. Evaluated on modCMA-ES and modDE variants across BBOB problems.

Result: Achieves up to 36.6% improvement in MSE over tabular-based methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of geometric learning.

Conclusion: Graph-based methods show significant potential for performance prediction in black-box optimization, outperforming traditional approaches.

Abstract: Automated algorithm performance prediction in numerical blackbox optimization
often relies on problem characterizations, such as exploratory landscape
analysis features. These features are typically used as inputs to machine
learning models and are represented in a tabular format. However, such
approaches often overlook algorithm configurations, a key factor influencing
performance. The relationships between algorithm operators, parameters, problem
characteristics, and performance outcomes form a complex structure best
represented as a graph. This work explores the use of heterogeneous graph data
structures and graph neural networks to predict the performance of optimization
algorithms by capturing the complex dependencies between problems, algorithm
configurations, and performance outcomes. We focus on two modular frameworks,
modCMA-ES and modDE, which decompose two widely used derivative-free
optimization algorithms: the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy
(CMA-ES) and differential evolution (DE). We evaluate 324 modCMA-ES and 576
modDE variants on 24 BBOB problems across six runtime budgets and two problem
dimensions. Achieving up to 36.6% improvement in MSE over traditional
tabular-based methods, this work highlights the potential of geometric learning

*Hao Li,Gengrui Zhang,Petter Holme,Shuyue Hu,Zhen Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs outperform humans in decision-making tasks involving uncertainty, risk, and adaptability, but their decision processes differ fundamentally from humans, raising concerns about substituting human judgment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs learn decision-making compared to humans, given their increasing role in AI-supported decisions.

Method: Benchmarked five leading LLMs against 360 humans using three experimental psychology tasks probing uncertainty, risk, and set-shifting.

Result: LLMs often outperformed humans, achieving near-optimal performance, but their decision-making processes were fundamentally different.

Conclusion: While LLMs excel in decision-making, their divergence from human processes calls for caution and further research before replacing human judgment.

Abstract: Human decision-making belongs to the foundation of our society and
civilization, but we are on the verge of a future where much of it will be
delegated to artificial intelligence. The arrival of Large Language Models
(LLMs) has transformed the nature and scope of AI-supported decision-making;
however, the process by which they learn to make decisions, compared to humans,
remains poorly understood. In this study, we examined the decision-making
behavior of five leading LLMs across three core dimensions of real-world
decision-making: uncertainty, risk, and set-shifting. Using three
well-established experimental psychology tasks designed to probe these
dimensions, we benchmarked LLMs against 360 newly recruited human participants.
Across all tasks, LLMs often outperformed humans, approaching near-optimal
performance. Moreover, the processes underlying their decisions diverged
fundamentally from those of humans. On the one hand, our finding demonstrates
the ability of LLMs to manage uncertainty, calibrate risk, and adapt to
changes. On the other hand, this disparity highlights the risks of relying on
them as substitutes for human judgment, calling for further inquiry.

### [136] [Approximation Fixpoint Theory with Refined Approximation Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16294)
*Linde Vanbesien,Bart Bogaerts,Marc Denecker*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper extends Approximation Fixpoint Theory (AFT) to handle more refined approximations than intervals, improving its applicability to non-monotonic reasoning formalisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AFT has limitations in certain simple examples despite its broad success. The paper aims to overcome these by refining approximations.

Method: Introduces a more general notion of approximation spaces, explores their expressiveness, and investigates relations between them.

Result: The extended AFT framework improves expressiveness and handles previously problematic cases.

Conclusion: The refined approximation spaces enhance AFT's applicability, addressing its prior limitations.

Abstract: Approximation Fixpoint Theory (AFT) is a powerful theory covering various
semantics of non-monotonic reasoning formalisms in knowledge representation
such as Logic Programming and Answer Set Programming. Many semantics of such
non-monotonic formalisms can be characterized as suitable fixpoints of a
non-monotonic operator on a suitable lattice. Instead of working on the
original lattice, AFT operates on intervals in such lattice to approximate or
construct the fixpoints of interest. While AFT has been applied successfully
across a broad range of non-monotonic reasoning formalisms, it is confronted by
its limitations in other, relatively simple, examples. In this paper, we
overcome those limitations by extending consistent AFT to deal with
approximations that are more refined than intervals. Therefore, we introduce a
more general notion of approximation spaces, showcase the improved
expressiveness and investigate relations between different approximation
spaces.

### [137] [Explainable Rule Application via Structured Prompting: A Neural-Symbolic Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16335)
*Albert Sadowski,Jarosław A. Chudziak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A structured prompting framework improves LLMs' logical consistency in legal analysis by decomposing reasoning into verifiable steps, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with consistent rule application and explainability in domains like legal analysis, requiring both natural language understanding and precise logic.

Method: Introduces a structured prompting framework with three steps: entity identification, property extraction, and symbolic rule application, integrating neural and symbolic approaches.

Result: Significant performance improvements on LegalBench hearsay task (e.g., F1 scores of 0.929 and 0.867 for OpenAI models).

Conclusion: The hybrid neural-symbolic system enhances transparent and consistent rule-based reasoning, promising for explainable AI in legal tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in complex reasoning tasks but struggle
with consistent rule application, exception handling, and explainability,
particularly in domains like legal analysis that require both natural language
understanding and precise logical inference. This paper introduces a structured
prompting framework that decomposes reasoning into three verifiable steps:
entity identification, property extraction, and symbolic rule application. By
integrating neural and symbolic approaches, our method leverages LLMs'
interpretive flexibility while ensuring logical consistency through formal
verification. The framework externalizes task definitions, enabling domain
experts to refine logical structures without altering the architecture.
Evaluated on the LegalBench hearsay determination task, our approach
significantly outperformed baselines, with OpenAI o-family models showing
substantial improvements - o1 achieving an F1 score of 0.929 and o3-mini
reaching 0.867 using structured decomposition with complementary predicates,
compared to their few-shot baselines of 0.714 and 0.74 respectively. This
hybrid neural-symbolic system offers a promising pathway for transparent and
consistent rule-based reasoning, suggesting potential for explainable AI
applications in structured legal reasoning tasks.

### [138] [IS-Bench: Evaluating Interactive Safety of VLM-Driven Embodied Agents in Daily Household Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16402)
*Xiaoya Lu,Zeren Chen,Xuhao Hu,Yijin Zhou,Weichen Zhang,Dongrui Liu,Lu Sheng,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IS-Bench is introduced as a benchmark for evaluating interactive safety in VLM-driven agents, revealing current agents' lack of safety awareness despite some improvements with safety-aware Chain-of-Thought.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods fail to assess dynamic risks in interactive environments, necessitating a new approach to ensure safer embodied AI systems.

Method: IS-Bench, a multi-modal benchmark, includes 161 scenarios with 388 safety risks and introduces process-oriented evaluation to verify risk mitigation timing.

Result: Current VLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5) lack interactive safety awareness; safety-aware Chain-of-Thought improves performance but often hinders task completion.

Conclusion: IS-Bench addresses critical gaps in evaluating interactive safety, paving the way for safer embodied AI deployments.

Abstract: Flawed planning from VLM-driven embodied agents poses significant safety
hazards, hindering their deployment in real-world household tasks. However,
existing static, non-interactive evaluation paradigms fail to adequately assess
risks within these interactive environments, since they cannot simulate dynamic
risks that emerge from an agent's actions and rely on unreliable post-hoc
evaluations that ignore unsafe intermediate steps. To bridge this critical gap,
we propose evaluating an agent's interactive safety: its ability to perceive
emergent risks and execute mitigation steps in the correct procedural order. We
thus present IS-Bench, the first multi-modal benchmark designed for interactive
safety, featuring 161 challenging scenarios with 388 unique safety risks
instantiated in a high-fidelity simulator. Crucially, it facilitates a novel
process-oriented evaluation that verifies whether risk mitigation actions are
performed before/after specific risk-prone steps. Extensive experiments on
leading VLMs, including the GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5 series, reveal that current
agents lack interactive safety awareness, and that while safety-aware
Chain-of-Thought can improve performance, it often compromises task completion.
By highlighting these critical limitations, IS-Bench provides a foundation for
developing safer and more reliable embodied AI systems.

*Sami Abboud,Eleanor Hanna,Olivier Jeunen,Vineesha Raheja,Schaun Wheeler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an automated sequential decision-making framework to optimize consumer communication, replacing manual marketer efforts with personalized, data-driven methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current manual approaches for consumer communication are labor-intensive and lack effective personalization, prompting the need for an automated solution.

Method: The framework uses Difference-in-Differences for Individual Treatment Effect estimation and Thompson sampling to balance exploration and exploitation.

Result: Deployed across 150 million users, the method significantly increased engagement for various goal events in a multi-service application.

Conclusion: The automated approach outperforms manual methods, enhancing personalization and scalability in consumer communication.

Abstract: Consumer applications provide ample opportunities to surface and communicate
various forms of content to users. From promotional campaigns for new features
or subscriptions, to evergreen nudges for engagement, or personalised
recommendations; across e-mails, push notifications, and in-app surfaces. The
conventional approach to orchestration for communication relies heavily on
labour-intensive manual marketer work, and inhibits effective personalisation
of content, timing, frequency, and copy-writing. We formulate this task under a
sequential decision-making framework, where we aim to optimise a modular
decision-making policy that maximises incremental engagement for any funnel
event. Our approach leverages a Difference-in-Differences design for Individual
Treatment Effect estimation, and Thompson sampling to balance the
explore-exploit trade-off. We present results from a multi-service application,
where our methodology has resulted in significant increases to a variety of
goal events across several product features, and is currently deployed across
150 million users.

### [140] [ML-Master: Towards AI-for-AI via Integration of Exploration and Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16499)
*Zexi Liu,Yuzhu Cai,Xinyu Zhu,Yujie Zheng,Runkun Chen,Ying Wen,Yanfeng Wang,Weinan E,Siheng Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ML-Master, an AI4AI agent, integrates exploration and reasoning with a selective memory mechanism, outperforming existing methods by 29.3% in efficiency and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-driven development (AI4AI) is more efficient than human-centric approaches, but current LLM-based agents struggle to leverage accumulated experience, leading to inefficiencies.

Method: ML-Master employs a selectively scoped memory mechanism to combine insights from parallel solution trajectories with analytical reasoning.

Result: ML-Master achieves a 29.3% average medal rate on MLE-Bench, outperforming baselines, especially in medium-complexity tasks, within half the time (12 hours vs. 24).

Conclusion: ML-Master demonstrates significant potential for advancing AI4AI by efficiently integrating exploration and reasoning.

Abstract: As AI capabilities advance toward and potentially beyond human-level
performance, a natural transition emerges where AI-driven development becomes
more efficient than human-centric approaches. A promising pathway toward this
transition lies in AI-for-AI (AI4AI), which leverages AI techniques to automate
and optimize the design, training, and deployment of AI systems themselves.
While LLM-based agents have shown the potential to realize AI4AI, they are
often unable to fully leverage the experience accumulated by agents during the
exploration of solutions in the reasoning process, leading to inefficiencies
and suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose ML-Master, a
novel AI4AI agent that seamlessly integrates exploration and reasoning by
employing a selectively scoped memory mechanism. This approach allows ML-Master
to efficiently combine diverse insights from parallel solution trajectories
with analytical reasoning, guiding further exploration without overwhelming the
agent with excessive context. We evaluate ML-Master on the MLE-Bench, where it
achieves a 29.3% average medal rate, significantly surpassing existing methods,
particularly in medium-complexity tasks, while accomplishing this superior
performance within a strict 12-hour time constraint-half the 24-hour limit used
by previous baselines. These results demonstrate ML-Master's potential as a
powerful tool for advancing AI4AI.

*Mustafa Akben,Aaron Satko*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an Elo rating-based method to improve LLM performance for analyzing harmful content like microaggressions and hate speech, outperforming traditional methods in accuracy and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs' built-in moderation systems hinder analysis of harmful content, affecting validity in organizational research, especially for conflicts like microaggressions or hate speech.

Method: An Elo rating-based method is proposed to enhance LLM performance for harmful content analysis.

Result: The method outperforms traditional LLM prompting and conventional ML models in accuracy, precision, and F1 scores on microaggression and hate speech datasets.

Conclusion: The approach improves reliability, reduces false positives, and scales well, aiding applications like workplace harassment detection and fostering inclusive environments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer promising opportunities for organizational
research. However, their built-in moderation systems can create problems when
researchers try to analyze harmful content, often refusing to follow certain
instructions or producing overly cautious responses that undermine validity of
the results. This is particularly problematic when analyzing organizational
conflicts such as microaggressions or hate speech. This paper introduces an Elo
rating-based method that significantly improves LLM performance for harmful
content analysis In two datasets, one focused on microaggression detection and
the other on hate speech, we find that our method outperforms traditional LLM
prompting techniques and conventional machine learning models on key measures
such as accuracy, precision, and F1 scores. Advantages include better
reliability when analyzing harmful content, fewer false positives, and greater
scalability for large-scale datasets. This approach supports organizational
applications, including detecting workplace harassment, assessing toxic
communication, and fostering safer and more inclusive work environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses the need for a comprehensive, open knowledge resource in AI, addressing gaps in current systems like large language models and robotic planning. It proposes a community-driven framework for developing and evaluating such a resource.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems lack verifiable, general-purpose knowledge resources, leading to gaps in performance and reliance on human expertise. The paper aims to identify the most needed knowledge resource and how modern technology can aid its development.

Method: The paper synthesizes findings from a AAAI workshop with over 50 researchers, proposing a community-driven vision for a new knowledge infrastructure. It suggests leveraging contemporary advances in knowledge representation and reasoning, along with an open engineering framework.

Result: The paper outlines a vision for a new knowledge infrastructure, emphasizing the need for open conventions and social structures to effectively integrate knowledge modules into practical applications.

Conclusion: A collaborative, open framework is essential for building a comprehensive knowledge resource in AI, addressing current limitations and leveraging modern advancements.

Abstract: The long-standing goal of creating a comprehensive, multi-purpose knowledge
resource, reminiscent of the 1984 Cyc project, still persists in AI. Despite
the success of knowledge resources like WordNet, ConceptNet, Wolfram|Alpha and
other commercial knowledge graphs, verifiable, general-purpose widely available
sources of knowledge remain a critical deficiency in AI infrastructure. Large
language models struggle due to knowledge gaps; robotic planning lacks
necessary world knowledge; and the detection of factually false information
relies heavily on human expertise. What kind of knowledge resource is most
needed in AI today? How can modern technology shape its development and
evaluation? A recent AAAI workshop gathered over 50 researchers to explore
these questions. This paper synthesizes our findings and outlines a
community-driven vision for a new knowledge infrastructure. In addition to
leveraging contemporary advances in knowledge representation and reasoning, one
promising idea is to build an open engineering framework to exploit knowledge
modules effectively within the context of practical applications. Such a
framework should include sets of conventions and social structures that are
adopted by contributors.

### [143] [The Role of Explanation Styles and Perceived Accuracy on Decision Making in Predictive Process Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16617)
*Soobin Chae,Suhwan Lee,Hanna Hauptmann,Hajo A. Reijers,Xixi Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study explores how explanation styles and perceived AI accuracy in Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) affect decision-making, revealing significant impacts on task performance and confidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models in PPM lack interpretability, reducing user trust. Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this, but current evaluations overlook user-centered impacts.

Method: A decision-making experiment tested effects of explanation styles (feature importance, rule-based, counterfactual) and perceived AI accuracy (low/high) on user decisions.

Result: Perceived accuracy and explanation style significantly influenced task performance, agreement, and decision confidence.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of user-centered XAI evaluations in PPM to enhance trust and decision-making.

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) often uses deep learning models to
predict the future behavior of ongoing processes, such as predicting process
outcomes. While these models achieve high accuracy, their lack of
interpretability undermines user trust and adoption. Explainable AI (XAI) aims
to address this challenge by providing the reasoning behind the predictions.
However, current evaluations of XAI in PPM focus primarily on functional
metrics (such as fidelity), overlooking user-centered aspects such as their
effect on task performance and decision-making. This study investigates the
effects of explanation styles (feature importance, rule-based, and
counterfactual) and perceived AI accuracy (low or high) on decision-making in
PPM. We conducted a decision-making experiment, where users were presented with
the AI predictions, perceived accuracy levels, and explanations of different
styles. Users' decisions were measured both before and after receiving
explanations, allowing the assessment of objective metrics (Task Performance
and Agreement) and subjective metrics (Decision Confidence). Our findings show
that perceived accuracy and explanation style have a significant effect.

*Kenjiro Ide,Taiga Someya,Kohei Kawaguchi,Keisuke Fujii*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores low-dimensional, rule-based models for football tactics, using interpretable state variables to predict pass success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models are computationally expensive, lack interpretability, or ignore player states. This study aims to address these gaps.

Method: Defines interpretable state variables for players, uses StatsBomb and SkillCorner data, and trains an XGBoost model to predict pass success.

Result: Distance from the ball and space score are key factors for successful passes.

Conclusion: The model offers interpretable, practical insights for football tactics and decision-making.

Abstract: Understanding football tactics is crucial for managers and analysts. Previous
research has proposed models based on spatial and kinematic equations, but
these are computationally expensive. Also, Reinforcement learning approaches
use player positions and velocities but lack interpretability and require large
datasets. Rule-based models align with expert knowledge but have not fully
considered all players' states. This study explores whether low-dimensional,
rule-based models using spatiotemporal data can effectively capture football
tactics. Our approach defines interpretable state variables for both the
ball-holder and potential pass receivers, based on criteria that explore
options like passing. Through discussions with a manager, we identified key
variables representing the game state. We then used StatsBomb event data and
SkillCorner tracking data from the 2023$/$24 LaLiga season to train an XGBoost
model to predict pass success. The analysis revealed that the distance between
the player and the ball, as well as the player's space score, were key factors
in determining successful passes. Our interpretable low-dimensional modeling
facilitates tactical analysis through the use of intuitive variables and
provides practical value as a tool to support decision-making in football.

### [145] [Incentivizing High-quality Participation From Federated Learning Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16731)
*Jinlong Pang,Jiaheng Wei,Yifan Hua,Chen Qian,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an incentive-aware framework for federated learning (FL) to address issues of voluntary participation and data heterogeneity, using Wasserstein distance and a Stackelberg game model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL research assumes voluntary participation and ignores data heterogeneity, leading to potential opt-outs or low-quality contributions.

Method: Introduces Wasserstein distance to measure data heterogeneity and a peer prediction mechanism for truthful reporting. Uses a two-stage Stackelberg game to formalize participation.

Result: The framework accelerates convergence and ensures truthful reporting, validated through experiments on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed mechanism effectively addresses participation and data heterogeneity challenges in FL.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) provides a promising paradigm for facilitating
collaboration between multiple clients that jointly learn a global model
without directly sharing their local data. However, existing research suffers
from two caveats: 1) From the perspective of agents, voluntary and unselfish
participation is often assumed. But self-interested agents may opt out of the
system or provide low-quality contributions without proper incentives; 2) From
the mechanism designer's perspective, the aggregated models can be
unsatisfactory as the existing game-theoretical federated learning approach for
data collection ignores the potential heterogeneous effort caused by
contributed data. To alleviate above challenges, we propose an incentive-aware
framework for agent participation that considers data heterogeneity to
accelerate the convergence process. Specifically, we first introduce the notion
of Wasserstein distance to explicitly illustrate the heterogeneous effort and
reformulate the existing upper bound of convergence. To induce truthful
reporting from agents, we analyze and measure the generalization error gap of
any two agents by leveraging the peer prediction mechanism to develop score
functions. We further present a two-stage Stackelberg game model that
formalizes the process and examines the existence of equilibrium. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed mechanism.

*Yanchen Zhu,Honghui Zou,Chufan Liu,Yuyu Luo,Yuankai Wu,Yuxuan Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid charging infrastructure (fixed and mobile chargers) for urban areas, optimizing planning and operation using deep reinforcement learning and demand prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiencies in traditional fixed-location charging stations (underutilization/congestion) by leveraging mobile chargers for dynamic demand.

Method: Introduces the HCSPO problem, combining fixed and mobile charger optimization with MPC-based demand prediction and deep reinforcement learning.

Result: Case studies show improved charging availability and reduced user inconvenience compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Hybrid infrastructure with intelligent scheduling enhances charging efficiency and adaptability in urban networks.

Abstract: The success of vehicle electrification, which brings significant societal and
environmental benefits, is contingent upon the availability of efficient and
adaptable charging infrastructure. Traditional fixed-location charging stations
often face issues like underutilization or congestion due to the dynamic nature
of charging demand. Mobile chargers have emerged as a flexible solution,
capable of relocating to align with these demand fluctuations. This paper
addresses the optimal planning and operation of hybrid charging
infrastructures, integrating both fixed and mobile chargers within urban road
networks. We introduce the Hybrid Charging Station Planning and Operation
(HCSPO) problem, which simultaneously optimizes the location and configuration
of fixed charging stations and schedules mobile chargers for dynamic
operations. Our approach incorporates a charging demand prediction model
grounded in Model Predictive Control (MPC) to enhance decision-making. To solve
the HCSPO problem, we propose a deep reinforcement learning method, augmented
with heuristic scheduling techniques, to effectively bridge the planning of
fixed chargers with the real-time operation of mobile chargers. Extensive case
studies using real-world urban scenarios demonstrate that our method
significantly improves the availability of charging infrastructure and reduces
user inconvenience compared to existing solutions and baselines.

TL;DR: The paper explores geographic biases in image generation models like FLUX 1 and Stable Diffusion 3.5, revealing a preference for metropolis-like areas and issues with European-sounding names.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the geographic knowledge and biases embedded in state-of-the-art image generation models.

Method: Generated 150 synthetic images per US state and capital using FLUX 1 and Stable Diffusion 3.5, analyzed similarity with DINO-v2 ViT-S/14 and Fréchet Inception Distances.

Result: Models show implicit geographic learning but exhibit bias toward urban areas and struggle with European-sounding names.

Conclusion: Image generation models embed geographic biases, favoring urban over rural areas and facing disambiguation challenges.

Abstract: Image generation models are revolutionizing many domains, and urban analysis
and design is no exception. While such models are widely adopted, there is a
limited literature exploring their geographic knowledge, along with the biases
they embed. In this work, we generated 150 synthetic images for each state in
the USA and related capitals using FLUX 1 and Stable Diffusion 3.5, two
state-of-the-art models for image generation. We embed each image using DINO-v2
ViT-S/14 and the Fr\'echet Inception Distances to measure the similarity
between the generated images. We found that while these models have implicitly
learned aspects of USA geography, if we prompt the models to generate an image
for "United States" instead of specific cities or states, the models exhibit a
strong representative bias toward metropolis-like areas, excluding rural states
and smaller cities. {\color{black} In addition, we found that models
systematically exhibit some entity-disambiguation issues with European-sounding
names like Frankfort or Devon.

TL;DR: A heuristic MAB method for dynamic discrete environments is proposed, extending BBO with an Ising machine to optimize actions in real-time systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time systems require optimization in dynamic environments, but conventional MAB algorithms fail due to combinatorial complexity.

Method: Extends BBO using an Ising machine to explore actions, considering variable interactions and environmental changes.

Result: Demonstrated dynamic adaptability in a wireless communication system with moving users.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively optimizes dynamic, discrete environments where conventional MAB algorithms fall short.

Abstract: Many real-time systems require the optimization of discrete variables.
Black-box optimization (BBO) algorithms and multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms
perform optimization by repeatedly taking actions and observing the
corresponding instant rewards without any prior knowledge. Recently, a BBO
method using an Ising machine has been proposed to find the best action that is
represented by a combination of discrete values and maximizes the instant
reward in static environments. In contrast, dynamic environments, where
real-time systems operate, necessitate MAB algorithms that maximize the average
reward over multiple trials. However, due to the enormous number of actions
resulting from the combinatorial nature of discrete optimization, conventional
MAB algorithms cannot effectively optimize dynamic, discrete environments.
Here, we show a heuristic MAB method for dynamic, discrete environments by
extending the BBO method, in which an Ising machine effectively explores the
actions while considering interactions between variables and changes in dynamic
environments. We demonstrate the dynamic adaptability of the proposed method in
a wireless communication system with moving users.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GTSP is challenging for mobile robots in tasks like warehouse retrieval and environmental monitoring, requiring accurate and efficient solutions.

Method: Introduces a coordinate-based image builder, adaptive resolution scaling, and a multimodal fusion module to integrate geometric and spatial features.

Result: MMFL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in GTSP instances and maintains computational efficiency for real-time use.

Conclusion: The framework is validated in physical robot tests, proving its practical effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Effective and efficient task planning is essential for mobile robots,
especially in applications like warehouse retrieval and environmental
monitoring. These tasks often involve selecting one location from each of
several target clusters, forming a Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem
(GTSP) that remains challenging to solve both accurately and efficiently. To
address this, we propose a Multimodal Fused Learning (MMFL) framework that
leverages both graph and image-based representations to capture complementary
aspects of the problem, and learns a policy capable of generating high-quality
task planning schemes in real time. Specifically, we first introduce a
coordinate-based image builder that transforms GTSP instances into spatially
informative representations. We then design an adaptive resolution scaling
strategy to enhance adaptability across different problem scales, and develop a
multimodal fusion module with dedicated bottlenecks that enables effective
integration of geometric and spatial features. Extensive experiments show that
our MMFL approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across
various GTSP instances while maintaining the computational efficiency required
for real-time robotic applications. Physical robot tests further validate its
practical effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: A novel LfD algorithm for Mahjong bots improves proficiency and preserves unique play styles with minimal PPO modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with randomness and out-of-distribution states in Mahjong, limiting bot diversity and performance.

Method: Leverages gameplay histories of Mahjong agents and introduces a modified LfD algorithm based on Proximal Policy Optimization.

Result: Significantly enhances agent proficiency while maintaining distinct play styles.

Conclusion: The proposed method addresses limitations of existing approaches, improving both performance and diversity in Mahjong bots.

Abstract: A wide variety of bots in games enriches the gameplay experience and enhances
replayability. Recent advancements in game artificial intelligence have
predominantly focused on improving the proficiency of bots. Nevertheless,
developing highly competent bots with a wide range of distinct play styles
remains a relatively under-explored area. We select the Mahjong game
environment as a case study. The high degree of randomness inherent in the
Mahjong game and the prevalence of out-of-distribution states lead to
suboptimal performance of existing offline learning and
Learning-from-Demonstration (LfD) algorithms. In this paper, we leverage the
gameplay histories of existing Mahjong agents and put forward a novel LfD
algorithm that necessitates only minimal modifications to the Proximal Policy
Optimization algorithm. The comprehensive empirical results illustrate that our
proposed method not only significantly enhances the proficiency of the agents
but also effectively preserves their unique play styles.

### [152] [Dispositions and Roles of Generically Dependent Entities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17085)
*Fabian Neuhaus*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BFO 2020 lacks support for functions, dispositions, and roles of generically dependent continuants (e.g., software, datasets), limiting representation of their roles in models. Two solutions are proposed: defined classes and BFO modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limitation in BFO 2020 hinders adequate representation of functions and roles of generically dependent continuants, such as software or datasets in models.

Method: The paper discusses BFO 2020's limitations and presents two approaches: (a) using defined classes and (b) proposing changes to BFO to support these entities.

Result: The paper identifies the issue and suggests practical solutions to enhance BFO 2020's capability.

Conclusion: Addressing this limitation in BFO 2020 is crucial for better representation of generically dependent continuants, and the proposed solutions offer viable paths forward.

Abstract: BFO 2020 does not support functions, dispositions, and roles of generically
dependent continuants (like software or datasets). In this paper, we argue that
this is a severe limitation, which prevents, for example, the adequate
representation of the functions of computer models or the various roles of
datasets during the execution of these models. We discuss the aspects of BFO
2020 that prevent the representation of realizable entities of generically
dependent continuants. Two approaches to address the issue are presented: (a)
the use of defined classes and (b) a proposal of changes that allow BFO to
support functions, dispositions, and roles of generically dependent
continuants.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces DREAM, a self-adaptive solution to improve LLMs' multi-step FOL reasoning by enhancing diversity and reasonability in proof strategies, addressing early errors and low accuracy in complex mathematical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with multi-step FOL reasoning due to limited proof strategy diversity and early errors, as shown by low accuracy (4.2%) on a theorem proving dataset.

Method: DREAM uses Axiom-Driven Strategy Diversification and Sub-Proposition Error Feedback to diversify strategies and correct proofs.

Result: DREAM improves LLM performance by 0.6% to 6.4% on a curated dataset of 447 theorems in Lean 4 format.

Conclusion: DREAM advances LLMs' mathematical reasoning by addressing key challenges in FOL theorem proving, offering a novel solution and evaluation dataset.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising first-order logic (FOL)
reasoning capabilities with applications in various areas. However, their
effectiveness in complex mathematical reasoning involving multi-step FOL
deductions is still under-researched. While LLMs perform competitively on
established mathematical reasoning benchmarks, they struggle with multi-step
FOL tasks, as demonstrated by Deepseek-Prover-V2-7B's low accuracy (4.2%) on
our proposed theorem proving dataset. This issue arises from the limited
exploration of diverse proof strategies and the potential for early reasoning
mistakes to undermine entire proofs. To address these issues, we propose DREAM,
a self-adaptive solution that enhances the Diversity and REAsonability of LLMs'
generation strategies. DREAM incorporates an Axiom-Driven Strategy
Diversification mechanism to promote varied strategic outcomes and a
Sub-Proposition Error Feedback to help LLMs reflect on and correct their
proofs. Our contributions include pioneering advancements in LLMs' mathematical
reasoning through FOL theorem proving, introducing a novel inference stage
solution that improves performance by 0.6% to 6.4%, and providing a curated
dataset of 447 mathematical theorems in Lean 4 format for evaluation.

*Lina Berrayana,Sean Rooney,Luis Garcés-Erice,Ioana Giurgiu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Different bias evaluation methods for Large Language Models yield inconsistent rankings, highlighting the need for standardized benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the robustness of independent benchmarks used to evaluate the safety of Large Language Models, particularly for bias.

Method: Investigated how different bias evaluation methods rank a set of representative models and compared the consistency of these rankings.

Result: Found that widely used bias evaluation methods produce disparate model rankings.

Conclusion: Recommends community guidelines for the usage of such benchmarks to ensure consistency and reliability.

Abstract: The creation of benchmarks to evaluate the safety of Large Language Models is
one of the key activities within the trusted AI community. These benchmarks
allow models to be compared for different aspects of safety such as toxicity,
bias, harmful behavior etc. Independent benchmarks adopt different approaches
with distinct data sets and evaluation methods. We investigate how robust such
benchmarks are by using different approaches to rank a set of representative
models for bias and compare how similar are the overall rankings. We show that
different but widely used bias evaluations methods result in disparate model
rankings. We conclude with recommendations for the community in the usage of
such benchmarks.

*Dadi Guo,Jiayu Liu,Zhiyuan Fan,Zhitao He,Haoran Li,Yumeng Wang,Yi R.,Fung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the RFMDataset to evaluate large reasoning models' performance on mathematical proofs, revealing significant shortcomings like low correctness rates, diverse reasoning failures, and hallucination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose hidden reasoning failures in large models masked by high accuracy on numerical evaluations and potential benchmark leakage.

Method: Proposes the RFMDataset of 200 proof problems and analyzes models' performance, identifying 10 error types.

Result: Models struggle with proofs (some <20% correctness), show diverse reasoning failures, and exhibit hallucination and incompleteness.

Conclusion: Current models lack sufficient self-reflection and require formalized, fine-grained logical training to address these limitations.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (e.g., R1, o3) have demonstrated remarkable
mathematical problem-solving abilities. However, the high reported accuracy of
these advanced models on popular datasets, reliance on purely numerical
evaluation and potential benchmark leakage, often masks their true reasoning
shortcomings. To address this, we propose leveraging the inherent rigor and
methodological complexity of mathematical proofs as a diagnostic tool to expose
these hidden failures. Specifically, we introduce the RFMDataset (Reveal
Failure Modes), a collection of 200 diverse mathematical proof problems, and
thoroughly evaluate advanced models' performance on it. Our in-depth analysis
of their failures uncovers 10 fine-grained error types, which shows fundamental
limitations in current large reasoning models: 1) large reasoning models
grapple profoundly with mathematical proofs, with some generating entirely
correct proofs for less than 20% of problems and failing even on basic ones; 2)
models exhibit a diverse spectrum of reasoning failures, prominently
demonstrating the lack of guarantees for the correctness and rigor of
single-step reasoning; and 3) models show hallucination and incompleteness
during the reasoning process. Our findings reveal that models' self-reflection
is insufficient to resolve the current logical dilemmas, necessitating
formalized and fine-grained logical training.

### [156] [When Can Model-Free Reinforcement Learning be Enough for Thinking?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17124)
*Josiah P. Hanna,Nicholas E. Corrado*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how model-free RL can lead to 'thinking' behaviors in agents, introduces a theoretical 'thought MDP' model, and validates its predictions using LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when and why model-free RL results in 'thinking' strategies for reward maximization, despite such actions not directly influencing rewards or world states.

Method: Introduces a 'thought MDP' model, analyzes policy initialization's role, and tests predictions with open-source LLMs. Also hypothesizes conditions for learning thinking outside language tasks.

Result: Proves thought actions equate to policy improvement steps and shows LLMs meet necessary conditions for thinking-like behavior. Demonstrates data-efficient RL in a toy domain with designated thought actions.

Conclusion: The study provides a theoretical and empirical foundation for understanding thinking in model-free RL, with potential applications beyond language tasks.

Abstract: Recent work on large language models has demonstrated the use of model-free
reinforcement learning (RL) to train reasoning-like capabilities. The emergence
of "thinking" through model-free RL is interesting as thinking actions neither
produce reward nor change the external world state to one where the agent is
more likely to get reward. This paper seeks to build a domain-independent
understanding of when model-free RL will lead to "thinking" as a strategy for
reward maximization. To build this understanding, we first introduce a
theoretical model which we call a \textit{thought Markov decision process}
(MDP). Thought MDPs minimally extend the classical MDP model to include an
abstract notion of thought state and thought action. Using the thought MDP
model, we prove the importance of policy initialization in determining whether
or not thinking emerges and show formally that thought actions are equivalent
to the agent choosing to perform a step of policy improvement before continuing
to act. We then show that open-source LLMs satisfy the conditions that our
theory predicts are necessary for model-free RL to produce thinking-like
behavior. Finally, we hypothesize sufficient conditions that would enable
thinking to be learned outside of language generation and introduce a toy
domain where a combination of multi-task pre-training and designated thought
actions enable more data-efficient RL compared to non-thinking agents.

### [157] [Chain-of-Trust: A Progressive Trust Evaluation Framework Enabled by Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17130)
*Botao Zhu,Xianbin Wang,Lei Zhang,Xuemin,Shen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A progressive trust evaluation framework (chain-of-trust) is proposed to handle misaligned device attribute data in collaborative systems, improving trust assessment accuracy and reducing overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trust evaluation in dynamic networks is challenging due to varying data latencies and incomplete attribute observation.

Method: The framework divides trust evaluation into chained stages, using task-relevant data and generative AI for analysis.

Result: High accuracy in trust evaluation is achieved, with reduced complexity and overhead.

Conclusion: The chain-of-trust framework effectively addresses trust assessment challenges in collaborative systems.

Abstract: In collaborative systems with complex tasks relying on distributed resources,
trust evaluation of potential collaborators has emerged as an effective
mechanism for task completion. However, due to the network dynamics and varying
information gathering latencies, it is extremely challenging to observe and
collect all trust attributes of a collaborating device concurrently for a
comprehensive trust assessment. In this paper, a novel progressive trust
evaluation framework, namely chain-of-trust, is proposed to make better use of
misaligned device attribute data. This framework, designed for effective task
completion, divides the trust evaluation process into multiple chained stages
based on task decomposition. At each stage, based on the task completion
process, the framework only gathers the latest device attribute data relevant
to that stage, leading to reduced trust evaluation complexity and overhead. By
leveraging advanced in-context learning, few-shot learning, and reasoning
capabilities, generative AI is then employed to analyze and interpret the
collected data to produce correct evaluation results quickly. Only devices
deemed trustworthy at this stage proceed to the next round of trust evaluation.
The framework ultimately determines devices that remain trustworthy across all
stages. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves
high accuracy in trust evaluation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MedPerturb dataset evaluates medical LLMs under controlled perturbations, revealing differences in sensitivity to gender, style, and format changes between LLMs and humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how LLMs and humans differ in handling real-world clinical variability, ensuring clinical robustness for safe deployment.

Method: Introduces MedPerturb, a dataset with 800 clinical contexts perturbed along gender, style, and format axes, comparing outputs from four LLMs and human experts.

Result: LLMs are more sensitive to gender and style changes, while humans are more affected by format perturbations like summaries.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for dynamic evaluation frameworks to align LLM decisions with human clinicians under clinical variability.

Abstract: Clinical robustness is critical to the safe deployment of medical Large
Language Models (LLMs), but key questions remain about how LLMs and humans may
differ in response to the real-world variability typified by clinical settings.
To address this, we introduce MedPerturb, a dataset designed to systematically
evaluate medical LLMs under controlled perturbations of clinical input.
MedPerturb consists of clinical vignettes spanning a range of pathologies, each
transformed along three axes: (1) gender modifications (e.g., gender-swapping
or gender-removal); (2) style variation (e.g., uncertain phrasing or colloquial
tone); and (3) format changes (e.g., LLM-generated multi-turn conversations or
summaries). With MedPerturb, we release a dataset of 800 clinical contexts
grounded in realistic input variability, outputs from four LLMs, and three
human expert reads per clinical context. We use MedPerturb in two case studies
to reveal how shifts in gender identity cues, language style, or format reflect
diverging treatment selections between humans and LLMs. We find that LLMs are
more sensitive to gender and style perturbations while human annotators are
more sensitive to LLM-generated format perturbations such as clinical
summaries. Our results highlight the need for evaluation frameworks that go
beyond static benchmarks to assess the similarity between human clinician and
LLM decisions under the variability characteristic of clinical settings.

TL;DR: The paper explores optimization in large language models (LLMs) using information geometry, highlighting its benefits for understanding training phenomena and suggesting quantum analogies for efficient optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of optimizing LLMs in high-dimensional, non-Euclidean parameter spaces by leveraging information geometry.

Method: Uses the Fisher information metric and natural gradient descent to analyze LLM training, with additional speculation on quantum analogies like the Fubini-Study metric and Quantum Fisher Information.

Result: The geometric approach clarifies phenomena like sharp minima, generalization, and scaling laws in LLMs.

Conclusion: Curvature-aware methods enhance LLM training understanding, and quantum-inspired metrics may enable efficient optimization in quantum-enhanced systems.

Abstract: Optimization in large language models (LLMs) unfolds over high-dimensional
parameter spaces with non-Euclidean structure. Information geometry frames this
landscape using the Fisher information metric, enabling more principled
learning via natural gradient descent. Though often impractical, this geometric
lens clarifies phenomena such as sharp minima, generalization, and observed
scaling laws. We argue that curvature-aware approaches deepen our understanding
of LLM training. Finally, we speculate on quantum analogies based on the
Fubini-Study metric and Quantum Fisher Information, hinting at efficient
optimization in quantum-enhanced systems.

*Zijian Zhou,Ao Qu,Zhaoxuan Wu,Sunghwan Kim,Alok Prakash,Daniela Rus,Jinhua Zhao,Bryan Kian Hsiang Low,Paul Pu Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MEM1 is a reinforcement learning framework for language agents, enabling constant memory usage in long multi-turn tasks by consolidating and discarding irrelevant information, improving efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM systems suffer from unbounded memory growth and degraded performance due to full-context prompting, necessitating a scalable solution for long-horizon tasks.

Method: MEM1 uses a compact shared internal state updated at each turn, integrating prior memory with new observations while discarding irrelevant data. Training involves composing datasets into complex task sequences.

Result: MEM1-7B outperforms Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct by 3.5x in performance and reduces memory usage by 3.7x, generalizing beyond training horizons.

Conclusion: MEM1 demonstrates the effectiveness of reasoning-driven memory consolidation for scalable, efficient long-horizon interactive agents.

Abstract: Modern language agents must operate over long-horizon, multi-turn
interactions, where they retrieve external information, adapt to observations,
and answer interdependent queries. Yet, most LLM systems rely on full-context
prompting, appending all past turns regardless of their relevance. This leads
to unbounded memory growth, increased computational costs, and degraded
reasoning performance on out-of-distribution input lengths. We introduce MEM1,
an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that enables agents to operate
with constant memory across long multi-turn tasks. At each turn, MEM1 updates a
compact shared internal state that jointly supports memory consolidation and
reasoning. This state integrates prior memory with new observations from the
environment while strategically discarding irrelevant or redundant information.
To support training in more realistic and compositional settings, we propose a
simple yet effective and scalable approach to constructing multi-turn
environments by composing existing datasets into arbitrarily complex task
sequences. Experiments across three domains, including internal retrieval QA,
open-domain web QA, and multi-turn web shopping, show that MEM1-7B improves
performance by 3.5x while reducing memory usage by 3.7x compared to
Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct on a 16-objective multi-hop QA task, and generalizes
beyond the training horizon. Our results demonstrate the promise of
reasoning-driven memory consolidation as a scalable alternative to existing
solutions for training long-horizon interactive agents, where both efficiency
and performance are optimized.

Motivation: Existing evaluation frameworks for LMs in finance have methodological gaps, leading to underestimation of LM performance on FinNLP tasks.

Method: The study evaluates 23 foundation LMs on 20 core NLP tasks in finance, comparing standard LMs to 'reasoning-reinforced' LMs.

Result: The paper provides empirical evidence of LMs' capabilities in finance, supported by open-sourced framework, data, and results.

Conclusion: FLaME demonstrates the untapped potential of LMs in finance, offering a robust evaluation tool for future research.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities with core
Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. The effectiveness of LMs for highly
specialized knowledge-intensive tasks in finance remains difficult to assess
due to major gaps in the methodologies of existing evaluation frameworks, which
have caused an erroneous belief in a far lower bound of LMs' performance on
common Finance NLP (FinNLP) tasks. To demonstrate the potential of LMs for
these FinNLP tasks, we present the first holistic benchmarking suite for
Financial Language Model Evaluation (FLaME). We are the first research paper to

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes entropy-informed pre-tokenization strategies to improve BPE for unsegmented languages like Chinese, showing better segmentation performance than standard BPE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BPE's frequency-driven approach struggles with unsegmented languages like Chinese due to its ignorance of linguistic boundaries.

Method: Two strategies: 1) using pointwise mutual information and entropy to identify coherent spans, and 2) leveraging GPT-2's predictive entropy for boundary detection.

Result: Improved segmentation precision, recall, and F1 score on the PKU dataset compared to standard BPE.

Conclusion: Entropy-guided pre-tokenization enhances linguistic alignment and offers potential for better tokenization in low-resource and multilingual contexts.

Abstract: Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) has become a widely adopted subword tokenization
method in modern language models due to its simplicity and strong empirical
performance across downstream tasks. However, applying BPE to unsegmented
languages such as Chinese presents significant challenges, as its
frequency-driven merge operation is agnostic to linguistic boundaries. To
address this, we propose two entropy-informed pre-tokenization strategies that
guide BPE segmentation using unsupervised information-theoretic cues. The first
approach uses pointwise mutual information and left/right entropy to identify
coherent character spans, while the second leverages predictive entropy derived
from a pretrained GPT-2 model to detect boundary uncertainty. We evaluate both
methods on a subset of the PKU dataset and demonstrate substantial improvements
in segmentation precision, recall, and F1 score compared to standard BPE. Our
results suggest that entropy-guided pre-tokenization not only enhances
alignment with gold-standard linguistic units but also offers a promising
direction for improving tokenization quality in low-resource and multilingual
settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show strong intrinsic self-correction abilities in reasoning tasks, even without fine-tuning for long Chain of Thought (CoT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the self-correction capabilities of LLMs, especially in response to synthetic perturbations in reasoning tasks.

Method: Experiments measuring models' ability to self-correct synthetic perturbations in their CoT reasoning across various open-weight models and datasets.

Result: Robust single-utterance intrinsic self-correction behavior observed, ranging from subtle to explicit corrections.

Conclusion: LLMs may have stronger intrinsic self-correction capabilities than previously thought, suggesting recent advancements amplify existing traits.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive mathematical
reasoning capabilities, yet their performance remains brittle to minor
variations in problem description and prompting strategy. Furthermore,
reasoning is vulnerable to sampling-induced errors which autoregressive models
must primarily address using self-correction via additionally-generated tokens.
To better understand self-correction capabilities of recent models, we conduct
experiments measuring models' ability to self-correct synthetic perturbations
introduced into their Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning. We observe robust
single-utterance intrinsic self-correction behavior across a range of
open-weight models and datasets, ranging from subtle, implicit corrections to
explicit acknowledgments and corrections of errors. Our findings suggest that
LLMs, including those not finetuned for long CoT, may possess stronger
intrinsic self-correction capabilities than commonly shown in the literature.
The presence of this ability suggests that recent "reasoning" model work
involves amplification of traits already meaningfully present in models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in modern AI systems by leveraging centuries-old Islamic medical texts for culturally sensitive medical guidance.

Method: A unified evaluation pipeline (Tibbe-AG) aligns 30 Prophetic-medicine questions with human-verified remedies, testing three LLMs under direct generation, retrieval-augmented generation, and self-critique configurations.

Result: Retrieval improves factual accuracy by 13%, and the agentic prompt adds another 10% improvement through deeper insight and safety considerations.

Conclusion: Combining classical Islamic texts with retrieval and self-evaluation enables reliable, culturally sensitive medical question-answering.

Abstract: Centuries-old Islamic medical texts like Avicenna's Canon of Medicine and the
Prophetic Tibb-e-Nabawi encode a wealth of preventive care, nutrition, and
holistic therapies, yet remain inaccessible to many and underutilized in modern
AI systems. Existing language-model benchmarks focus narrowly on factual recall
or user preference, leaving a gap in validating culturally grounded medical
guidance at scale. We propose a unified evaluation pipeline, Tibbe-AG, that
aligns 30 carefully curated Prophetic-medicine questions with human-verified
remedies and compares three LLMs (LLaMA-3, Mistral-7B, Qwen2-7B) under three
configurations: direct generation, retrieval-augmented generation, and a
scientific self-critique filter. Each answer is then assessed by a secondary
LLM serving as an agentic judge, yielding a single 3C3H quality score.
Retrieval improves factual accuracy by 13%, while the agentic prompt adds
another 10% improvement through deeper mechanistic insight and safety
considerations. Our results demonstrate that blending classical Islamic texts
with retrieval and self-evaluation enables reliable, culturally sensitive
medical question-answering.

TL;DR: The paper identifies reliable metrics for evaluating perspective summary quality in LLMs, showing that model-based metrics outperform traditional ones. It also demonstrates the effectiveness of reranking and preference tuning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation frameworks for perspective summarization lack reliable metrics, and efforts to improve summarizers are underdeveloped.

Method: The study builds a test set with human annotations to benchmark metric reliability and evaluates LLM-based methods, including reranking and preference tuning with synthetic data.

Result: Model-based metrics outperform traditional ones, and reranking and preference tuning methods significantly improve summarization performance.

Conclusion: The findings support better evaluation and development of perspective summarization methods.

Abstract: Generating unbiased summaries in real-world settings such as political
perspective summarization remains a crucial application of Large Language
Models (LLMs). Yet, existing evaluation frameworks rely on traditional metrics
for measuring key attributes such as coverage and faithfulness without
verifying their applicability, and efforts to develop improved summarizers are
still nascent. We address these gaps by (1) identifying reliable metrics for
measuring perspective summary quality, and (2) investigating the efficacy of
LLM-based methods beyond zero-shot inference. Namely, we build a test set for
benchmarking metric reliability using human annotations and show that
traditional metrics underperform compared to language model-based metrics,
which prove to be strong evaluators. Using these metrics, we show that
reranking-based methods yield strong results, and preference tuning with
synthetically generated and reranking-labeled data further boosts performance.
Our findings aim to contribute to the reliable evaluation and development of
perspective summarization methods.

TL;DR: The paper proposes DE-detect, a multimodal method combining transcribed lyrics and speech features from audio to detect AI-generated music, outperforming existing detectors in robustness and practicality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of AI-generated music challenges artists and copyright holders, requiring reliable detection methods. Current detectors (audio or lyrics-based) have limitations like poor generalization and reliance on clean lyrics.

Method: A multimodal, modular late-fusion pipeline integrating transcribed sung lyrics and speech features from audio to capture lyrics-related information.

Result: DE-detect outperforms existing lyrics-based detectors and is more robust to audio perturbations.

Conclusion: DE-detect provides an effective, robust solution for detecting AI-generated music in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-based music generation tools is revolutionizing
the music industry but also posing challenges to artists, copyright holders,
and providers alike. This necessitates reliable methods for detecting such
AI-generated content. However, existing detectors, relying on either audio or
lyrics, face key practical limitations: audio-based detectors fail to
generalize to new or unseen generators and are vulnerable to audio
perturbations; lyrics-based methods require cleanly formatted and accurate
lyrics, unavailable in practice. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
novel, practically grounded approach: a multimodal, modular late-fusion
pipeline that combines automatically transcribed sung lyrics and speech
features capturing lyrics-related information within the audio. By relying on
lyrical aspects directly from audio, our method enhances robustness, mitigates
susceptibility to low-level artifacts, and enables practical applicability.
Experiments show that our method, DE-detect, outperforms existing lyrics-based
detectors while also being more robust to audio perturbations. Thus, it offers
an effective, robust solution for detecting AI-generated music in real-world
scenarios. Our code is available at

TL;DR: ProxyReward is an RL-based framework for Open-LTG tasks, using automated dataset generation and targeted reward signals to outperform GPT-4-Turbo and LLM-as-a-Judge by 20%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of exploration in Open-LTG tasks and the absence of gold standard reference data, ProxyReward aims to improve accuracy beyond general assessments.

Method: Introduces ProxyReward, combining automated dataset generation via prompts and a reward signal for evaluating information comprehensiveness and accuracy.

Result: ProxyReward outperforms GPT-4-Turbo and LLM-as-a-Judge, improving Open-LTG task performance by 20%.

Conclusion: ProxyReward effectively enhances LLMs' ability to handle complex open-ended questions, offering a scalable solution without extensive labeled data.

Abstract: Current research on long-form context in Large Language Models (LLMs)
primarily focuses on the understanding of long-contexts, the Open-ended Long
Text Generation (Open-LTG) remains insufficiently explored. Training a
long-context generation model requires curation of gold standard reference
data, which is typically nonexistent for informative Open-LTG tasks. However,
previous methods only utilize general assessments as reward signals, which
limits accuracy. To bridge this gap, we introduce ProxyReward, an innovative
reinforcement learning (RL) based framework, which includes a dataset and a
reward signal computation method. Firstly, ProxyReward Dataset generation is
accomplished through simple prompts that enables the model to create
automatically, obviating extensive labeled data or significant manual effort.
Secondly, ProxyReward Signal offers a targeted evaluation of information
comprehensiveness and accuracy for specific questions. The experimental results
indicate that our method ProxyReward surpasses even GPT-4-Turbo. It can
significantly enhance performance by 20% on the Open-LTG task when training
widely used open-source models, while also surpassing the LLM-as-a-Judge
approach. Our work presents effective methods to enhance the ability of LLMs to
address complex open-ended questions posed by human.

TL;DR: EvoLM is a model suite for analyzing LM training dynamics across stages, revealing insights like diminishing returns from excessive training and the importance of mitigating forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable systematic and transparent analysis of LM training stages, addressing challenges in evaluating design choices.

Method: Training over 100 LMs (1B and 4B parameters) from scratch, evaluating upstream and downstream capabilities, and analyzing generalization.

Result: Key findings include diminishing returns from excessive training, the role of continued pre-training, and trade-offs in fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: EvoLM provides valuable insights and open resources for LM research, promoting reproducibility and transparency.

Abstract: Modern language model (LM) training has been divided into multiple stages,
making it difficult for downstream developers to evaluate the impact of design
choices made at each stage. We present EvoLM, a model suite that enables
systematic and transparent analysis of LMs' training dynamics across
pre-training, continued pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement
learning. By training over 100 LMs with 1B and 4B parameters from scratch, we
rigorously evaluate both upstream (language modeling) and downstream
(problem-solving) reasoning capabilities, including considerations of both
in-domain and out-of-domain generalization. Key insights highlight the
diminishing returns from excessive pre-training and post-training, the
importance and practices of mitigating forgetting during domain-specific
continued pre-training, the crucial role of continued pre-training in bridging
pre-training and post-training phases, and various intricate trade-offs when
configuring supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. To facilitate
open research and reproducibility, we release all pre-trained and post-trained
models, training datasets for all stages, and our entire training and
evaluation pipeline.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DynScaling improves LLM performance under resource constraints by integrating parallel-sequential sampling and dynamic budget allocation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current inference-time scaling methods for LLMs rely on external verifiers or lack optimization for practical computational limits.

Method: DynScaling uses an integrated parallel-sequential sampling strategy and a bandit-based dynamic budget allocation framework.

Result: DynScaling outperforms verifier-free baselines in task performance and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: DynScaling offers a practical solution for enhancing LLM performance without external verifiers.

Abstract: Inference-time scaling has proven effective in boosting large language model
(LLM) performance through increased test-time computation. Yet, its practical
application is often hindered by reliance on external verifiers or a lack of
optimization for realistic computational constraints. We propose DynScaling,
which addresses these limitations through two primary innovations: an
integrated parallel-sequential sampling strategy and a bandit-based dynamic
budget allocation framework. The integrated sampling strategy unifies parallel
and sequential sampling by constructing synthetic sequential reasoning chains
from initially independent parallel responses, promoting diverse and coherent
reasoning trajectories. The dynamic budget allocation framework formulates the
allocation of computational resources as a multi-armed bandit problem,
adaptively distributing the inference budget across queries based on the
uncertainty of previously sampled responses, thereby maximizing computational
efficiency. By combining these components, DynScaling effectively improves LLM
performance under practical resource constraints without the need for external
verifiers. Experimental results demonstrate that DynScaling consistently
surpasses existing verifier-free inference scaling baselines in both task
performance and computational cost.

TL;DR: A hybrid model combining transformer-based contextual understanding and broad learning systems for cyberbullying detection achieves high accuracy across datasets and includes explainability mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the growing issue of cyberbullying by leveraging advanced AI techniques for more effective detection and transparency in content moderation.

Method: Combines a modified DeBERTa model with Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks and sentiment analysis, integrated with a Gated Broad Learning System (GBLS) classifier.

Result: Achieved accuracies of 79.3% (HateXplain), 95.41% (SOSNet), 91.37% (Mendeley-I), and 94.67% (Mendeley-II).

Conclusion: The framework outperforms existing methods, offers transparency, and identifies challenges like implicit bias and sarcasm for future improvements.

Abstract: The proliferation of online communication platforms has created unprecedented
opportunities for global connectivity while simultaneously enabling harmful
behaviors such as cyberbullying, which affects approximately 54.4\% of
teenagers according to recent research. This paper presents a hybrid
architecture that combines the contextual understanding capabilities of
transformer-based models with the pattern recognition strengths of broad
learning systems for effective cyberbullying detection. This approach
integrates a modified DeBERTa model augmented with Squeeze-and-Excitation
blocks and sentiment analysis capabilities with a Gated Broad Learning System
(GBLS) classifier, creating a synergistic framework that outperforms existing
approaches across multiple benchmark datasets. The proposed ModifiedDeBERTa +
GBLS model achieved good performance on four English datasets: 79.3\% accuracy
on HateXplain, 95.41\% accuracy on SOSNet, 91.37\% accuracy on Mendeley-I, and
94.67\% accuracy on Mendeley-II. Beyond performance gains, the framework
incorporates comprehensive explainability mechanisms including token-level
attribution analysis, LIME-based local interpretations, and confidence
calibration, addressing critical transparency requirements in automated content
moderation. Ablation studies confirm the meaningful contribution of each
architectural component, while failure case analysis reveals specific
challenges in detecting implicit bias and sarcastic content, providing valuable
insights for future improvements in cyberbullying detection systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how deeper transformers gain expressive capabilities, linking them to C-RASP programs and temporal logic, and provides empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formally establish which capabilities transformers gain with increased depth, bridging theory and practice.

Method: Theoretical proof linking transformers to C-RASP programs and temporal logic, followed by empirical study on sequential dependency tasks.

Result: Deeper transformers are more expressive than shallower ones, and the theory predicts depth requirements for generalization.

Conclusion: The study provides a formal understanding of transformer depth's impact on expressiveness, supported by empirical evidence.

Abstract: It has been observed that transformers with greater depth (that is, more
layers) have more capabilities, but can we establish formally which
capabilities are gained with greater depth? We answer this question with a
theoretical proof followed by an empirical study. First, we consider
transformers that round to fixed precision except inside attention. We show
that this subclass of transformers is expressively equivalent to the
programming language C-RASP and this equivalence preserves depth. Second, we
prove that deeper C-RASP programs are more expressive than shallower C-RASP
programs, implying that deeper transformers are more expressive than shallower
transformers (within the subclass mentioned above). These results are
established by studying a form of temporal logic with counting operators, which
was shown equivalent to C-RASP in previous work. Finally, we provide empirical
evidence that our theory predicts the depth required for transformers without
positional encodings to length-generalize on a family of sequential dependency
tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs for honesty and helpfulness, proposes a self-critique-guided prompting strategy, and shows improved results on the HONESET dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of ensuring LLM outputs are consistently honest and helpful without additional training.

Method: Benchmark evaluation of 10 LLMs and a novel prompting strategy (self-critique-guided curiosity refinement) with in-context self-critique and refinement steps.

Result: Improved H² scores (1.4% to 4.3% gains), fewer poor-quality responses, and more high-quality outputs.

Conclusion: Structured self-refinement is effective and scalable for enhancing LLM trustworthiness without training.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated robust capabilities across
various natural language tasks. However, producing outputs that are
consistently honest and helpful remains an open challenge. To overcome this
challenge, this paper tackles the problem through two complementary directions.
It conducts a comprehensive benchmark evaluation of ten widely used large
language models, including both proprietary and open-weight models from OpenAI,
Meta, and Google. In parallel, it proposes a novel prompting strategy,
self-critique-guided curiosity refinement prompting. The key idea behind this
strategy is enabling models to self-critique and refine their responses without
additional training. The proposed method extends the curiosity-driven prompting
strategy by incorporating two lightweight in-context steps including
self-critique step and refinement step.
  The experiment results on the HONESET dataset evaluated using the framework
$\mathrm{H}^2$ (honesty and helpfulness), which was executed with GPT-4o as a
judge of honesty and helpfulness, show consistent improvements across all
models. The approach reduces the number of poor-quality responses, increases
high-quality responses, and achieves relative gains in $\mathrm{H}^2$ scores
ranging from 1.4% to 4.3% compared to curiosity-driven prompting across
evaluated models. These results highlight the effectiveness of structured
self-refinement as a scalable and training-free strategy to improve the
trustworthiness of LLMs outputs.

TL;DR: A framework using MURIL architecture for cyberbullying detection in Hinglish text outperforms existing models, achieving high accuracy across datasets, with explainability features and insights for future research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of code-mixed Hindi-English (Hinglish) communication on digital platforms challenges existing monolingual cyberbullying detection systems, necessitating a specialized approach.

Method: The paper employs the MURIL architecture, incorporating selective layer freezing, classification head design, and specialized preprocessing for code-mixed content, along with explainability features like attribution analysis.

Result: The MURIL-based approach outperforms RoBERTa and IndicBERT, with accuracy improvements of 1.36 to 13.07 percentage points across six datasets, achieving up to 94.63% accuracy.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates effectiveness for Hinglish cyberbullying detection, with ablation studies and failure analysis highlighting key improvements and future research directions, such as context-dependent interpretation and sarcasm detection.

Abstract: The growth of digital communication platforms has led to increased
cyberbullying incidents worldwide, creating a need for automated detection
systems to protect users. The rise of code-mixed Hindi-English (Hinglish)
communication on digital platforms poses challenges for existing cyberbullying
detection systems, which were designed primarily for monolingual text. This
paper presents a framework for cyberbullying detection in Hinglish text using
the Multilingual Representations for Indian Languages (MURIL) architecture to
address limitations in current approaches. Evaluation across six benchmark
datasets -- Bohra \textit{et al.}, BullyExplain, BullySentemo, Kumar \textit{et
al.}, HASOC 2021, and Mendeley Indo-HateSpeech -- shows that the MURIL-based
approach outperforms existing multilingual models including RoBERTa and
IndicBERT, with improvements of 1.36 to 13.07 percentage points and accuracies
of 86.97\% on Bohra, 84.62\% on BullyExplain, 86.03\% on BullySentemo, 75.41\%
on Kumar datasets, 83.92\% on HASOC 2021, and 94.63\% on Mendeley dataset. The
framework includes explainability features through attribution analysis and
cross-linguistic pattern recognition. Ablation studies show that selective
layer freezing, appropriate classification head design, and specialized
preprocessing for code-mixed content improve detection performance, while
failure analysis identifies challenges including context-dependent
interpretation, cultural understanding, and cross-linguistic sarcasm detection,
providing directions for future research in multilingual cyberbullying
detection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FinCoT introduces structured CoT prompting for financial reasoning, outperforming standard and unstructured CoT methods, improving accuracy and reducing token usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance financial reasoning in language models by incorporating domain-specific expert insights, addressing gaps in structured CoT prompting.

Method: Evaluates three prompting styles (standard, unstructured CoT, structured CoT) and FinCoT on CFA-style questions across ten financial domains.

Result: FinCoT boosts performance (63.2% to 80.5%) and reduces token generation by eight-fold compared to structured CoT.

Conclusion: Domain-aligned structured prompts improve performance, reduce costs, and yield more interpretable, expert-aligned reasoning.

Abstract: This paper presents FinCoT, a structured chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting
approach that incorporates insights from domain-specific expert financial
reasoning to guide the reasoning traces of large language models. We
investigate that there are three main prompting styles in FinNLP: (1) standard
prompting--zero-shot prompting; (2) unstructured CoT--CoT prompting without an
explicit reasoning structure, such as the use of tags; and (3) structured CoT
prompting--CoT prompting with explicit instructions or examples that define
structured reasoning steps. Previously, FinNLP has primarily focused on prompt
engineering with either standard or unstructured CoT prompting. However,
structured CoT prompting has received limited attention in prior work.
Furthermore, the design of reasoning structures in structured CoT prompting is
often based on heuristics from non-domain experts. In this study, we
investigate each prompting approach in FinNLP. We evaluate the three main
prompting styles and FinCoT on CFA-style questions spanning ten financial
domains. We observe that FinCoT improves performance from 63.2% to 80.5% and
Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct from 69.7% to 74.2%, while reducing generated tokens
eight-fold compared to structured CoT prompting. Our findings show that
domain-aligned structured prompts not only improve performance and reduce
inference costs but also yield more interpretable and expert-aligned reasoning
traces.

*Chenxi Wang,Yixuan Zhang,Lang Gao,Zixiang Xu,Zirui Song,Yanbo Wang,Xiuying Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs internalize language-specific reasoning biases, as shown by attention patterns and performance on a bilingual causal reasoning dataset (BICAUSE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test if LLMs internalize habitual logical structures from language, inspired by linguistic relativity.

Method: Used BICAUSE, a bilingual dataset with aligned Chinese and English causal reasoning samples, to analyze LLM attention and performance.

Result: LLMs show typologically aligned attention patterns, language-specific causal order preferences, and degraded performance on atypical inputs. Successful reasoning leads to semantically aligned abstractions across languages.

Conclusion: LLMs mimic and internalize language-shaped reasoning biases, empirically verified for the first time.

Abstract: Language is not only a tool for communication but also a medium for human
cognition and reasoning. If, as linguistic relativity suggests, the structure
of language shapes cognitive patterns, then large language models (LLMs)
trained on human language may also internalize the habitual logical structures
embedded in different languages. To examine this hypothesis, we introduce
BICAUSE, a structured bilingual dataset for causal reasoning, which includes
semantically aligned Chinese and English samples in both forward and reversed
causal forms. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) LLMs exhibit
typologically aligned attention patterns, focusing more on causes and
sentence-initial connectives in Chinese, while showing a more balanced
distribution in English. (2) Models internalize language-specific preferences
for causal word order and often rigidly apply them to atypical inputs, leading
to degraded performance, especially in Chinese. (3) When causal reasoning
succeeds, model representations converge toward semantically aligned
abstractions across languages, indicating a shared understanding beyond surface
form. Overall, these results suggest that LLMs not only mimic surface
linguistic forms but also internalize the reasoning biases shaped by language.
Rooted in cognitive linguistic theory, this phenomenon is for the first time
empirically verified through structural analysis of model internals.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SGIC, a Self-Guided Iterative Calibration Framework for LLMs, using uncertainty scores to improve calibration and response accuracy in retrieval-augmented generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG methods often overlook LLMs' calibration capabilities. This work aims to leverage LLMs' in-context reasoning by providing specific cues to enhance calibration.

Method: SGIC uses uncertainty scores to assess document relevance and LLM confidence, iteratively refining calibration. It also introduces a method to create a self-calibration training set.

Result: The framework significantly boosts performance on both closed-source and open-weight LLMs.

Conclusion: SGIC effectively improves LLM calibration and response accuracy in RAG tasks.

Abstract: Recent research in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has concentrated on
retrieving useful information from candidate documents. However, numerous
methodologies frequently neglect the calibration capabilities of large language
models (LLMs), which capitalize on their robust in-context reasoning prowess.
This work illustrates that providing LLMs with specific cues substantially
improves their calibration efficacy, especially in multi-round calibrations. We
present a new SGIC: Self-Guided Iterative Calibration Framework that employs
uncertainty scores as a tool. Initially, this framework calculates uncertainty
scores to determine both the relevance of each document to the query and the
confidence level in the responses produced by the LLMs. Subsequently, it
reevaluates these scores iteratively, amalgamating them with prior responses to
refine calibration. Furthermore, we introduce an innovative approach for
constructing an iterative self-calibration training set, which optimizes LLMs
to efficiently harness uncertainty scores for capturing critical information
and enhancing response accuracy. Our proposed framework significantly improves
performance on both closed-source and open-weight LLMs.

Result: Identifies strengths and limitations of each model in medical text summarization.

Conclusion: Provides insights for healthcare professionals seeking automated summarization tools.

Abstract: The findings section of a radiology report is often detailed and lengthy,

with a coverage mechanism. To ensure a thorough assessment, multiple evaluation
metrics are employed, including ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, METEOR, and
BERTScore. By analyzing the performance of these models, this study identifies
their respective strengths and limitations in the summarization of medical
text. The findings of this paper provide helpful information for medical

Motivation: Addressing the challenge of scarce high-quality annotated data for low-resource languages in speech-to-text translation.

Method: Constructed datasets using bitext mining with state-of-the-art sentence encoders, creating Shrutilipi-anuvaad for Bengali-Hindi, Malayalam-Hindi, Odia-Hindi, and Telugu-Hindi pairs. Varied data quality and quantity were tested.

Result: ST systems built with weakly labeled data perform comparably to massive multi-modal baselines like SONAR and SeamlessM4T.

Conclusion: Weakly labeled data is a viable alternative for developing ST systems in low-resource scenarios.

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality annotated data presents a significant challenge
in developing effective end-to-end speech-to-text translation (ST) systems,
particularly for low-resource languages. This paper explores the hypothesis
that weakly labeled data can be used to build ST models for low-resource
language pairs. We constructed speech-to-text translation datasets with the
help of bitext mining using state-of-the-art sentence encoders. We mined the
multilingual Shrutilipi corpus to build Shrutilipi-anuvaad, a dataset
comprising ST data for language pairs Bengali-Hindi, Malayalam-Hindi,
Odia-Hindi, and Telugu-Hindi. We created multiple versions of training data
with varying degrees of quality and quantity to investigate the effect of
quality versus quantity of weakly labeled data on ST model performance. Results
demonstrate that ST systems can be built using weakly labeled data, with
performance comparable to massive multi-modal multilingual baselines such as
SONAR and SeamlessM4T.

TL;DR: The paper improves automated speaking assessment (ASA) by adding a multifaceted relevance module and fine-grained grammar error features, enhancing content relevance and grammar analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ASA systems lack detailed content relevance and grammar error analysis, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Introduces a hybrid scoring model with a relevance module (integrating question, image, exemplar, and spoken response) and fine-grained grammar error features using GEC and annotation.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements in evaluating content relevance, language use, and overall ASA performance.

Conclusion: Richer, nuanced feature sets enhance holistic speaking assessment.

Abstract: Current automated speaking assessment (ASA) systems for use in multi-aspect
evaluations often fail to make full use of content relevance, overlooking image
or exemplar cues, and employ superficial grammar analysis that lacks detailed
error types. This paper ameliorates these deficiencies by introducing two novel
enhancements to construct a hybrid scoring model. First, a multifaceted
relevance module integrates question and the associated image content,
exemplar, and spoken response of an L2 speaker for a comprehensive assessment
of content relevance. Second, fine-grained grammar error features are derived
using advanced grammar error correction (GEC) and detailed annotation to
identify specific error categories. Experiments and ablation studies
demonstrate that these components significantly improve the evaluation of
content relevance, language use, and overall ASA performance, highlighting the
benefits of using richer, more nuanced feature sets for holistic speaking
assessment.

TL;DR: A benchmark dataset for LLM safety in Polish is introduced, along with adversarial samples. Experiments show a HerBERT-based classifier outperforms others, especially under adversarial conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM safety assessments are biased toward high-resource languages, leaving others like Polish underexamined.

Method: A manually annotated benchmark dataset and adversarial samples are created. Three models (Llama-Guard-3-8B, HerBERT-based classifier, PLLuM) are fine-tuned and evaluated.

Result: The HerBERT-based classifier achieves the highest performance, particularly in adversarial scenarios.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for multilingual safety assessments and demonstrates the effectiveness of a HerBERT-based approach for Polish.

Abstract: Despite increasing efforts to ensure the safety of large language models
(LLMs), most existing safety assessments and moderation tools remain heavily
biased toward English and other high-resource languages, leaving majority of
global languages underexamined. To address this gap, we introduce a manually
annotated benchmark dataset for language model safety classification in Polish.
We also create adversarially perturbed variants of these samples designed to
challenge model robustness. We conduct a series of experiments to evaluate
LLM-based and classifier-based models of varying sizes and architectures.
Specifically, we fine-tune three models: Llama-Guard-3-8B, a HerBERT-based
classifier (a Polish BERT derivative), and PLLuM, a Polish-adapted Llama-8B
model. We train these models using different combinations of annotated data and
evaluate their performance, comparing it against publicly available guard
models. Results demonstrate that the HerBERT-based classifier achieves the
highest overall performance, particularly under adversarial conditions.

*Agnese Daffara,Sourabh Dattawad,Sebastian Padó,Tanise Ceron*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the applicability of the Media Frame Corpus (MFC) to Brazilian Portuguese news, finding it broadly applicable but needing minor adjustments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if MFC frames generalize to non-U.S. cultural contexts, specifically Brazilian news.

Method: Introduce FrameNews-PT, annotate it using MFC, and evaluate frame generalization and model performance.

Result: MFC frames are mostly applicable with minor guideline revisions, but some frames are rarely used.

Conclusion: Cross-cultural frame analysis requires careful adaptation.

Abstract: Frames capture aspects of an issue that are emphasized in a debate by
interlocutors and can help us understand how political language conveys
different perspectives and ultimately shapes people's opinions. The Media Frame
Corpus (MFC) is the most commonly used framework with categories and detailed
guidelines for operationalizing frames. It is, however, focused on a few
salient U.S. news issues, making it unclear how well these frames can capture
news issues in other cultural contexts. To explore this, we introduce
FrameNews-PT, a dataset of Brazilian Portuguese news articles covering
political and economic news and annotate it within the MFC framework. Through
several annotation rounds, we evaluate the extent to which MFC frames
generalize to the Brazilian debate issues. We further evaluate how fine-tuned
and zero-shot models perform on out-of-domain data. Results show that the 15
MFC frames remain broadly applicable with minor revisions of the guidelines.
However, some MFC frames are rarely used, and novel news issues are analyzed
using general 'fall-back' frames. We conclude that cross-cultural frame use
requires careful consideration.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Incorporating knowledge graph information improves relation extraction models, especially in imbalanced datasets, using graph-aware Neural Bellman-Ford networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test if entity positions in knowledge graphs enhance relation extraction performance.

Method: Combined established relation extraction methods with graph-aware Neural Bellman-Ford networks, tested in supervised and zero-shot settings.

Result: Significant performance improvement, particularly in imbalanced training scenarios.

Conclusion: Knowledge graph integration boosts relation extraction effectiveness across diverse datasets.

Abstract: We examine the impact of incorporating knowledge graph information on the
performance of relation extraction models across a range of datasets. Our
hypothesis is that the positions of entities within a knowledge graph provide
important insights for relation extraction tasks. We conduct experiments on
multiple datasets, each varying in the number of relations, training examples,
and underlying knowledge graphs. Our results demonstrate that integrating
knowledge graph information significantly enhances performance, especially when
dealing with an imbalance in the number of training examples for each relation.
We evaluate the contribution of knowledge graph-based features by combining
established relation extraction methods with graph-aware Neural Bellman-Ford
networks. These features are tested in both supervised and zero-shot settings,
demonstrating consistent performance improvements across various datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel discriminative method for closed information extraction improves accuracy, especially for long-tail relations, outperforming generative models and emphasizing efficiency with smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance relation extraction accuracy, particularly for long-tail relations and large-scale closed information extraction tasks.

Method: Uses a discriminative approach incorporating type and entity-specific information, leveraging smaller models for efficiency.

Result: Superior performance compared to state-of-the-art generative models, achieving comparable or better results with smaller models.

Conclusion: The method promises more accurate and efficient information extraction, especially for large-scale tasks.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for closed information extraction. The
method employs a discriminative approach that incorporates type and
entity-specific information to improve relation extraction accuracy,
particularly benefiting long-tail relations. Notably, this method demonstrates
superior performance compared to state-of-the-art end-to-end generative models.
This is especially evident for the problem of large-scale closed information
extraction where we are confronted with millions of entities and hundreds of
relations. Furthermore, we emphasize the efficiency aspect by leveraging
smaller models. In particular, the integration of type-information proves
instrumental in achieving performance levels on par with or surpassing those of
a larger generative model. This advancement holds promise for more accurate and
efficient information extraction techniques.

### [189] [Can structural correspondences ground real world representational content in Large Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16370)
*Iwan Williams*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines whether LLMs like GPT-4 can represent real-world entities, arguing that structural correspondences alone are insufficient unless they explain task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address uncertainty about LLMs' representational capacities, especially since they lack direct contact with extra-linguistic reality.

Method: Uses a structural-correspondence account of representation to analyze evidence and argue for necessary conditions.

Result: Structural correspondences must play a functional role in task performance to ground real-world representation.

Conclusion: LLMs' text-boundedness poses a challenge, but functional structural correspondences could enable real-world representation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 produce compelling responses to a
wide range of prompts. But their representational capacities are uncertain.
Many LLMs have no direct contact with extra-linguistic reality: their inputs,
outputs and training data consist solely of text, raising the questions (1) can
LLMs represent anything and (2) if so, what? In this paper, I explore what it
would take to answer these questions according to a structural-correspondence
based account of representation, and make an initial survey of this evidence. I
argue that the mere existence of structural correspondences between LLMs and
worldly entities is insufficient to ground representation of those entities.
However, if these structural correspondences play an appropriate role - they
are exploited in a way that explains successful task performance - then they
could ground real world contents. This requires overcoming a challenge: the
text-boundedness of LLMs appears, on the face of it, to prevent them engaging
in the right sorts of tasks.

*Kexin Huang,Qian Tu,Liwei Fan,Chenchen Yang,Dong Zhang,Shimin Li,Zhaoye Fei,Qinyuan Cheng,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces InstructTTSEval, a benchmark for evaluating instruction-driven TTS systems, addressing gaps in flexibility and evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional TTS systems lack flexibility in handling paralinguistic cues, and there's a shortage of high-quality benchmarks for instruction-based TTS.

Method: The authors propose InstructTTSEval, a benchmark with three tasks (Acoustic-Parameter Specification, Descriptive-Style Directive, Role-Play) across English and Chinese, using Gemini for automated evaluation.

Result: Evaluation reveals significant room for improvement in current instruction-following TTS systems.

Conclusion: InstructTTSEval aims to advance more flexible and accurate instruction-driven TTS models.

Abstract: In modern speech synthesis, paralinguistic information--such as a speaker's
vocal timbre, emotional state, and dynamic prosody--plays a critical role in
conveying nuance beyond mere semantics. Traditional Text-to-Speech (TTS)
systems rely on fixed style labels or inserting a speech prompt to control
these cues, which severely limits flexibility. Recent attempts seek to employ
natural-language instructions to modulate paralinguistic features,
substantially improving the generalization of instruction-driven TTS models.
Although many TTS systems now support customized synthesis via textual
description, their actual ability to interpret and execute complex instructions
remains largely unexplored. In addition, there is still a shortage of
high-quality benchmarks and automated evaluation metrics specifically designed
for instruction-based TTS, which hinders accurate assessment and iterative
optimization of these models. To address these limitations, we introduce
InstructTTSEval, a benchmark for measuring the capability of complex
natural-language style control. We introduce three tasks, namely
Acoustic-Parameter Specification, Descriptive-Style Directive, and Role-Play,
including English and Chinese subsets, each with 1k test cases (6k in total)
paired with reference audio. We leverage Gemini as an automatic judge to assess
their instruction-following abilities. Our evaluation of accessible
instruction-following TTS systems highlights substantial room for further
improvement. We anticipate that InstructTTSEval will drive progress toward more
powerful, flexible, and accurate instruction-following TTS.

Motivation: To systematically review and synthesize recent advancements in LLM-driven AM, addressing gaps and challenges in the field.

Method: The survey reviews foundational theories, datasets, and taxonomies of AM subtasks, while analyzing LLM techniques like prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning.

Result: Highlights the impact of LLMs on AM, identifies challenges (e.g., long-context reasoning, interpretability), and proposes a research agenda.

Conclusion: LLMs have significantly advanced AM, but challenges remain; future research should focus on emerging trends and strategic directions.

Abstract: Argument Mining (AM), a critical subfield of Natural Language Processing
(NLP), focuses on extracting argumentative structures from text. The advent of
Large Language Models (LLMs) has profoundly transformed AM, enabling advanced
in-context learning, prompt-based generation, and robust cross-domain
adaptability. This survey systematically synthesizes recent advancements in
LLM-driven AM. We provide a concise review of foundational theories and
annotation frameworks, alongside a meticulously curated catalog of datasets. A
key contribution is our comprehensive taxonomy of AM subtasks, elucidating how
contemporary LLM techniques -- such as prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning,
and retrieval augmentation -- have reconfigured their execution. We further
detail current LLM architectures and methodologies, critically assess
evaluation practices, and delineate pivotal challenges including long-context
reasoning, interpretability, and annotation bottlenecks. Conclusively, we
highlight emerging trends and propose a forward-looking research agenda for
LLM-based computational argumentation, aiming to strategically guide
researchers in this rapidly evolving domain.

*Chenyi Zhou,Zhengyan Shi,Yuan Yao,Lei Liang,Huajun Chen,Qiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RiOT is a novel framework for automatic prompt optimization in LLMs, addressing diversity and semantic drift issues by iteratively refining prompts using text gradients and residual connections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt optimization methods lack diversity and suffer from semantic drift, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: RiOT uses text gradients to generate diverse prompt candidates, selects the best via perplexity, and employs residual connections to mitigate semantic drift. A tree structure manages scalability.

Result: RiOT outperforms previous methods and manual prompting across five benchmarks, including commonsense and mathematical reasoning.

Conclusion: RiOT effectively addresses diversity and semantic drift, demonstrating superior performance in prompt optimization for LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted their
potential across a variety of tasks, but their performance still heavily relies
on the design of effective prompts. Existing methods for automatic prompt
optimization face two challenges: lack of diversity, limiting the exploration
of valuable and innovative directions and semantic drift, where optimizations
for one task can degrade performance in others. To address these issues, we
propose Residual Optimization Tree (RiOT), a novel framework for automatic
prompt optimization. RiOT iteratively refines prompts through text gradients,
generating multiple semantically diverse candidates at each step, and selects
the best prompt using perplexity. Additionally, RiOT incorporates the text
residual connection to mitigate semantic drift by selectively retaining
beneficial content across optimization iterations. A tree structure efficiently
manages the optimization process, ensuring scalability and flexibility.
Extensive experiments across five benchmarks, covering commonsense,
mathematical, logical, temporal, and semantic reasoning, demonstrate that RiOT
outperforms both previous prompt optimization methods and manual prompting.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoAnnotator is a multi-model cooperative annotation framework that reduces costs and improves accuracy by combining LLMs and SLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high cost and low accuracy of LLMs in fine-grained semantic tasks by leveraging SLMs and a cooperative annotation paradigm.

Method: A two-layer framework: meta-controller (LLMs for selection, code generation, and verification) and task-specialist (SLMs for annotation via voting). Uses continual learning for SLM improvement.

Result: Outperforms LLMs in zero-shot, one-shot, CoT, and majority voting, reducing cost by 74.15% and improving accuracy by 6.21%.

Conclusion: AutoAnnotator offers a cost-effective and accurate alternative to LLM-based annotation, enhancing performance in fine-grained tasks.

Abstract: Although the annotation paradigm based on Large Language Models (LLMs) has
made significant breakthroughs in recent years, its actual deployment still has
two core bottlenecks: first, the cost of calling commercial APIs in large-scale
annotation is very expensive; second, in scenarios that require fine-grained
semantic understanding, such as sentiment classification and toxicity
classification, the annotation accuracy of LLMs is even lower than that of
Small Language Models (SLMs) dedicated to this field. To address these
problems, we propose a new paradigm of multi-model cooperative annotation and
design a fully automatic annotation framework AutoAnnotator based on this.
Specifically, AutoAnnotator consists of two layers. The upper-level
meta-controller layer uses the generation and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to
select SLMs for annotation, automatically generate annotation code and verify
difficult samples; the lower-level task-specialist layer consists of multiple
SLMs that perform annotation through multi-model voting. In addition, we use
the difficult samples obtained by the secondary review of the meta-controller
layer as the reinforcement learning set and fine-tune the SLMs in stages
through a continual learning strategy, thereby improving the generalization of
SLMs. Extensive experiments show that AutoAnnotator outperforms existing
open-source/API LLMs in zero-shot, one-shot, CoT, and majority voting settings.
Notably, AutoAnnotator reduces the annotation cost by 74.15% compared to
directly annotating with GPT-3.5-turbo, while still improving the accuracy by
6.21%. Project page: https://github.com/Zhaiyuan-Ji/AutoAnnotator.

Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to fully assess LLMs' competitive-level code reasoning capabilities.

Method: OJBench includes 232 programming competition problems from NOI and ICPC, tested on 37 diverse models.

Result: State-of-the-art models like o4-mini and Gemini-2.5-pro-exp struggle with highly challenging problems.

Conclusion: Competitive-level code reasoning remains a significant challenge for LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
significant progress in math and code reasoning capabilities. However, existing
code benchmark are limited in their ability to evaluate the full spectrum of
these capabilities, particularly at the competitive level. To bridge this gap,
we introduce OJBench, a novel and challenging benchmark designed to assess the
competitive-level code reasoning abilities of LLMs. OJBench comprises 232
programming competition problems from NOI and ICPC, providing a more rigorous
test of models' reasoning skills. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation using
OJBench on 37 models, including both closed-source and open-source models,
reasoning-oriented and non-reasoning-oriented models. Our results indicate that
even state-of-the-art reasoning-oriented models, such as o4-mini and
Gemini-2.5-pro-exp, struggle with highly challenging competition-level
problems. This highlights the significant challenges that models face in
competitive-level code reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces NepaliGPT, the first generative large language model for the Nepali language, addressing the lack of such models and downstream tasks. It also presents the Devanagari Corpus and a benchmark dataset, achieving notable performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The absence of a generative language model for Nepali hinders NLP tasks. This research fills the gap by developing NepaliGPT and providing resources like the Devanagari Corpus and a benchmark dataset.

Method: The study collects the Devanagari Corpus from multiple sources and creates a benchmark dataset of 4,296 Nepali question-answer pairs. NepaliGPT is then developed and evaluated using metrics like perplexity, ROUGE-1, causal coherence, and consistency.

Result: NepaliGPT achieves a perplexity of 26.32245, ROUGE-1 score of 0.2604, causal coherence of 81.25%, and causal consistency of 85.41%.

Conclusion: The research successfully introduces NepaliGPT and foundational resources, advancing NLP for the Nepali language and enabling future downstream applications.

Abstract: After the release of ChatGPT, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained huge
popularity in recent days and thousands of variants of LLMs have been released.
However, there is no generative language model for the Nepali language, due to
which other downstream tasks, including fine-tuning, have not been explored
yet. To fill this research gap in the Nepali NLP space, this research proposes
\textit{NepaliGPT}, a generative large language model tailored specifically for
the Nepali language. This research introduces an advanced corpus for the Nepali
language collected from several sources, called the Devanagari Corpus.
Likewise, the research introduces the first NepaliGPT benchmark dataset
comprised of 4,296 question-answer pairs in the Nepali language. The proposed
LLM NepaliGPT achieves the following metrics in text generation: Perplexity of

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to address LLM challenges with long texts, identifying three failure modes and validating multi-agent chunking as an effective solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate the challenges of applying LLMs to long texts by identifying failure modes and testing chunking strategies.

Method: Proposes a theoretical framework categorizing failure modes and tests multi-agent chunking on tasks like retrieval, QA, and summarization.

Result: Confirms the framework's validity and shows chunking can outperform advanced models like GPT4o for large inputs.

Conclusion: A principled framework and chunking strategies offer a pathway to effectively handle long contexts in LLMs.

Abstract: We investigate the challenge of applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to long
texts. We propose a theoretical framework that distinguishes the failure modes
of long context tasks into three categories: cross-chunk dependence (task
noise), confusion that grows with context size (model noise), and the imperfect
integration of partial results (aggregator noise). Under this view, we analyze
when it is effective to use multi-agent chunking, i.e., dividing a length
sequence into smaller chunks and aggregating the processed results of each
chunk. Our experiments on tasks such as retrieval, question answering, and
summarization confirm both the theoretical analysis and the conditions that
favor multi-agent chunking. By exploring superlinear model noise growth with
input length, we also explain why, for large inputs, a weaker model configured
with chunk-based processing can surpass a more advanced model like GPT4o
applied in a single shot. Overall, we present a principled understanding
framework and our results highlight a direct pathway to handling long contexts
in LLMs with carefully managed chunking and aggregator strategies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: REIS, an In-Storage Processing system, enhances Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by optimizing retrieval performance and energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) are limited by static training data, and RAG's retrieval stage is a bottleneck due to data movement overheads. Existing ISP solutions for ANNS are inefficient and hardware-heavy.

Method: REIS introduces three mechanisms: a linked database layout, ISP-tailored data placement, and an ANNS engine using existing storage resources.

Result: REIS improves retrieval performance by 13x and energy efficiency by 55x compared to server-grade systems.

Conclusion: REIS effectively addresses RAG's retrieval bottlenecks with minimal hardware changes, offering significant performance and efficiency gains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face an inherent challenge: their knowledge is
confined to the data that they have been trained on. To overcome this issue,
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) complements the static training-derived
knowledge of LLMs with an external knowledge repository. RAG consists of three
stages: indexing, retrieval, and generation. The retrieval stage of RAG becomes
a significant bottleneck in inference pipelines. In this stage, a user query is
mapped to an embedding vector and an Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS)
algorithm searches for similar vectors in the database to identify relevant
items. Due to the large database sizes, ANNS incurs significant data movement
overheads between the host and the storage system. To alleviate these
overheads, prior works propose In-Storage Processing (ISP) techniques that
accelerate ANNS by performing computations inside storage. However, existing
works that leverage ISP for ANNS (i) employ algorithms that are not tailored to
ISP systems, (ii) do not accelerate data retrieval operations for data selected
by ANNS, and (iii) introduce significant hardware modifications, limiting
performance and hindering their adoption. We propose REIS, the first ISP system
tailored for RAG that addresses these limitations with three key mechanisms.
First, REIS employs a database layout that links database embedding vectors to
their associated documents, enabling efficient retrieval. Second, it enables
efficient ANNS by introducing an ISP-tailored data placement technique that
distributes embeddings across the planes of the storage system and employs a
lightweight Flash Translation Layer. Third, REIS leverages an ANNS engine that
uses the existing computational resources inside the storage system. Compared
to a server-grade system, REIS improves the performance (energy efficiency) of
retrieval by an average of 13x (55x).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StoryWriter, a multi-agent framework, addresses long story generation challenges by using outline, planning, and writing agents to ensure coherence and narrative complexity, outperforming baselines and generating a high-quality dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs struggle with long story generation due to issues in discourse coherence and narrative complexity.

Method: Proposes StoryWriter with three modules: outline agent (event-based outlines), planning agent (detailed event planning), and writing agent (dynamic history compression).

Result: Outperforms baselines in story quality and length, generates a dataset of 6,000 long stories (~8,000 words each), and fine-tunes models (Llama3.1-8B, GLM4-9B) for advanced performance.

Conclusion: StoryWriter effectively addresses long story generation challenges, demonstrating superior performance and scalability.

Abstract: Long story generation remains a challenge for existing large language models
(LLMs), primarily due to two main factors: (1) discourse coherence, which
requires plot consistency, logical coherence, and completeness in the long-form
generation, and (2) narrative complexity, which requires an interwoven and
engaging narrative. To address these challenges, we propose StoryWriter, a
multi-agent story generation framework, which consists of three main modules:
(1) outline agent, which generates event-based outlines containing rich event
plots, character, and event-event relationships. (2) planning agent, which
further details events and plans which events should be written in each chapter
to maintain an interwoven and engaging story. (3) writing agent, which
dynamically compresses the story history based on the current event to generate
and reflect new plots, ensuring the coherence of the generated story. We
conduct both human and automated evaluation, and StoryWriter significantly
outperforms existing story generation baselines in both story quality and
length. Furthermore, we use StoryWriter to generate a dataset, which contains
about $6,000$ high-quality long stories, with an average length of $8,000$
words. We train the model Llama3.1-8B and GLM4-9B using supervised fine-tuning
on LongStory and develop StoryWriter_GLM and StoryWriter_GLM, which
demonstrates advanced performance in long story generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to detect implicit hate speech in existing harmful speech datasets by leveraging lexicon analysis, influential sample identification, reannotation, and augmentation using large language models (Llama-3 70B and GPT-4o). It shows a +12.9 F1 score improvement over baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Implicit hate speech is a growing challenge for social media, but existing datasets often miss or mislabel it due to its subtlety and annotator subjectivity.

Method: The approach involves three steps: influential sample identification, reannotation, and augmentation using Llama-3 70B and GPT-4o.

Result: The method improves implicit hate detection, achieving a +12.9-point F1 score gain over baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively enhances the detection of implicit hate speech and generalizes well across datasets.

Abstract: Implicit hate speech has recently emerged as a critical challenge for social
media platforms. While much of the research has traditionally focused on
harmful speech in general, the need for generalizable techniques to detect
veiled and subtle forms of hate has become increasingly pressing. Based on
lexicon analysis, we hypothesize that implicit hate speech is already present
in publicly available harmful speech datasets but may not have been explicitly
recognized or labeled by annotators. Additionally, crowdsourced datasets are
prone to mislabeling due to the complexity of the task and often influenced by
annotators' subjective interpretations. In this paper, we propose an approach
to address the detection of implicit hate speech and enhance generalizability
across diverse datasets by leveraging existing harmful speech datasets. Our
method comprises three key components: influential sample identification,
reannotation, and augmentation using Llama-3 70B and GPT-4o. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving implicit
hate detection, achieving a +12.9-point F1 score improvement compared to the
baseline.

TL;DR: RELIC is an in-context learning framework for improving reward model accuracy in low-resource Indic languages by leveraging high-resource language examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multilingual reward models are unreliable for low-resource Indic languages due to lack of preference data, making traditional training impractical.

Method: RELIC trains a retriever with a pairwise ranking objective to select effective in-context examples from high-resource languages.

Result: RELIC improves accuracy by 12.81% and 10.13% over zero-shot and state-of-the-art methods, respectively, on Bodo language.

Conclusion: RELIC effectively addresses the challenge of reward modeling for low-resource languages by leveraging in-context learning.

Abstract: Reward models are essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with
human preferences. However, most open-source multilingual reward models are
primarily trained on preference datasets in high-resource languages, resulting
in unreliable reward signals for low-resource Indic languages. Collecting
large-scale, high-quality preference data for these languages is prohibitively
expensive, making preference-based training approaches impractical. To address
this challenge, we propose RELIC, a novel in-context learning framework for
reward modeling in low-resource Indic languages. RELIC trains a retriever with
a pairwise ranking objective to select in-context examples from auxiliary
high-resource languages that most effectively highlight the distinction between
preferred and less-preferred responses. Extensive experiments on three
preference datasets- PKU-SafeRLHF, WebGPT, and HH-RLHF-using state-of-the-art
open-source reward models demonstrate that RELIC significantly improves reward
model accuracy for low-resource Indic languages, consistently outperforming
existing example selection methods. For example, on Bodo-a low-resource Indic
language-using a LLaMA-3.2-3B reward model, RELIC achieves a 12.81% and 10.13%
improvement in accuracy over zero-shot prompting and state-of-the-art example
selection method, respectively.

### [202] [Automatic Speech Recognition Biases in Newcastle English: an Error Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16558)
*Dana Serditova,Kevin Tang,Jochen Steffens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ASR systems perform poorly on regional dialects like Newcastle English due to biased training. This study identifies dialectal features as the main cause of errors, advocating for more diverse training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate underexamined regional bias in ASR systems, focusing on Newcastle English, and understand the causes of misrecognitions.

Method: A two-stage analysis: manual error analysis of phonological, lexical, and morphosyntactic errors, followed by a case study on regional pronouns.

Result: ASR errors are linked to dialectal features, with social factors having minimal impact.

Conclusion: Greater dialectal diversity in training data and sociolinguistic analysis are needed to address regional biases in ASR.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems struggle with regional dialects
due to biased training which favours mainstream varieties. While previous
research has identified racial, age, and gender biases in ASR, regional bias
remains underexamined. This study investigates ASR performance on Newcastle
English, a well-documented regional dialect known to be challenging for ASR. A
two-stage analysis was conducted: first, a manual error analysis on a subsample
identified key phonological, lexical, and morphosyntactic errors behind ASR
misrecognitions; second, a case study focused on the systematic analysis of ASR
recognition of the regional pronouns ``yous'' and ``wor''. Results show that
ASR errors directly correlate with regional dialectal features, while social
factors play a lesser role in ASR mismatches. We advocate for greater dialectal
diversity in ASR training data and highlight the value of sociolinguistic
analysis in diagnosing and addressing regional biases.

*Enes Yavuz Ugan,Ngoc-Quan Pham,Alexander Waibel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A continual learning approach for neural speech recognition models prevents catastrophic forgetting using factorization and centralization phases, inspired by human learning cycles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable neural networks to absorb new data without full re-training, avoiding catastrophic forgetting in rehearsal-free, multilingual settings.

Method: Proposes a two-phase approach: factorization for learning and centralization for merging knowledge, using low-rank adapters.

Result: Effective prevention of catastrophic forgetting in experiments with varied code-switching datasets.

Conclusion: The centralization phase successfully preserves knowledge by accumulating it in low-rank adapters.

Abstract: Modern neural network based speech recognition models are required to
continually absorb new data without re-training the whole system, especially in
downstream applications using foundation models, having no access to the
original training data. Continually training the models in a rehearsal-free,
multilingual, and language agnostic condition, likely leads to catastrophic
forgetting, when a seemingly insignificant disruption to the weights can
destructively harm the quality of the models. Inspired by the ability of human
brains to learn and consolidate knowledge through the waking-sleeping cycle, we
propose a continual learning approach with two distinct phases: factorization
and centralization, learning and merging knowledge accordingly. Our experiments
on a sequence of varied code-switching datasets showed that the centralization
stage can effectively prevent catastrophic forgetting by accumulating the
knowledge in multiple scattering low-rank adapters.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A streaming accent conversion model transforms non-native speech into native-like accents while preserving speaker identity, prosody, and improving pronunciation, with stable latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable real-time processing of accent conversion while maintaining high performance and preserving key speech attributes.

Method: Modifies a previous AC architecture with an Emformer encoder and optimized inference, integrating a native TTS model for training data.

Result: Achieves comparable performance to top AC models with stable latency, enabling streaming capability.

Conclusion: The proposed model is the first streaming AC system, balancing performance and real-time processing.

Abstract: We propose a first streaming accent conversion (AC) model that transforms
non-native speech into a native-like accent while preserving speaker identity,
prosody and improving pronunciation. Our approach enables stream processing by
modifying a previous AC architecture with an Emformer encoder and an optimized
inference mechanism. Additionally, we integrate a native text-to-speech (TTS)
model to generate ideal ground-truth data for efficient training. Our streaming
AC model achieves comparable performance to the top AC models while maintaining
stable latency, making it the first AC system capable of streaming.

### [205] [Measuring (a Sufficient) World Model in LLMs: A Variance Decomposition Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16584)
*Nadav Kunievsky,James A. Evans*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to evaluate if LLMs have a robust world model by analyzing response variability across semantically equivalent prompts. Larger models show better robustness but not uniformly across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing LLMs' reliability in high-stakes applications requires understanding if they possess a structured world model supporting generalization beyond surface patterns.

Method: Introduces an evaluation approach decomposing response variability into user purpose, articulation, and model instability to quantify semantic grounding.

Result: Larger models attribute more variability to user purpose, indicating a stronger world model, but improvements are modest and not uniform across domains.

Conclusion: Semantic diagnostics, not just accuracy benchmarks, are crucial for assessing LLMs' internal world understanding.

Abstract: Understanding whether large language models (LLMs) possess a world model-a
structured understanding of the world that supports generalization beyond
surface-level patterns-is central to assessing their reliability, especially in
high-stakes applications. We propose a formal framework for evaluating whether
an LLM exhibits a sufficiently robust world model, defined as producing
consistent outputs across semantically equivalent prompts while distinguishing
between prompts that express different intents. We introduce a new evaluation
approach to measure this that decomposes model response variability into three
components: variability due to user purpose, user articulation, and model
instability. An LLM with a strong world model should attribute most of the
variability in its responses to changes in foundational purpose rather than
superficial changes in articulation. This approach allows us to quantify how
much of a model's behavior is semantically grounded rather than driven by model
instability or alternative wording. We apply this framework to evaluate LLMs
across diverse domains. Our results show how larger models attribute a greater
share of output variability to changes in user purpose, indicating a more
robust world model. This improvement is not uniform, however: larger models do
not consistently outperform smaller ones across all domains, and their
advantage in robustness is often modest. These findings highlight the
importance of moving beyond accuracy-based benchmarks toward semantic
diagnostics that more directly assess the structure and stability of a model's
internal understanding of the world.

### [207] [Modeling Public Perceptions of Science in Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16622)
*Jiaxin Pei,Dustin Wright,Isabelle Augenstin,David Jurgens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A computational framework models public perception of science news across 12 dimensions, using a large dataset and NLP models to predict engagement and analyze influencing factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of anticipating public perception and engagement with scientific news amid increasing information volume.

Method: Developed a computational framework and NLP models to analyze public perception, using a dataset of 10,489 annotations from 2,101 participants.

Result: Frequency of science news consumption drives perception, while demographic factors have minimal impact. Positive perception scores correlate with higher engagement (comments/upvotes).

Conclusion: Nuanced perception modeling is crucial for predicting public interest and engagement with scientific content.

Abstract: Effectively engaging the public with science is vital for fostering trust and
understanding in our scientific community. Yet, with an ever-growing volume of
information, science communicators struggle to anticipate how audiences will
perceive and interact with scientific news. In this paper, we introduce a
computational framework that models public perception across twelve dimensions,
such as newsworthiness, importance, and surprisingness. Using this framework,
we create a large-scale science news perception dataset with 10,489 annotations
from 2,101 participants from diverse US and UK populations, providing valuable
insights into public responses to scientific information across domains. We
further develop NLP models that predict public perception scores with a strong
performance. Leveraging the dataset and model, we examine public perception of
science from two perspectives: (1) Perception as an outcome: What factors
affect the public perception of scientific information? (2) Perception as a
predictor: Can we use the estimated perceptions to predict public engagement
with science? We find that individuals' frequency of science news consumption
is the driver of perception, whereas demographic factors exert minimal
influence. More importantly, through a large-scale analysis and carefully
designed natural experiment on Reddit, we demonstrate that the estimated public
perception of scientific information has direct connections with the final
engagement pattern. Posts with more positive perception scores receive
significantly more comments and upvotes, which is consistent across different
scientific information and for the same science, but are framed differently.
Overall, this research underscores the importance of nuanced perception
modeling in science communication, offering new pathways to predict public
interest and engagement with scientific content.

### [208] [Initial Investigation of LLM-Assisted Development of Rule-Based Clinical NLP System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16628)
*Jianlin Shi,Brian T. Bucher*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using LLMs to automate the development of rule-based NLP systems, improving efficiency and reducing manual labor in clinical settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rule-based NLP systems are preferred in clinical settings for interpretability and efficiency, but their manual development is labor-intensive.

Method: Employ LLMs during the rule-based system development phase, focusing on identifying relevant text snippets and extracting keywords for NER.

Result: High recall in identifying relevant snippets (Deepseek: 0.98, Qwen: 0.99) and perfect key term extraction (1.0).

Conclusion: The approach enables faster, cost-effective, and transparent development of rule-based NLP systems compared to deep learning solutions.

Abstract: Despite advances in machine learning (ML) and large language models (LLMs),
rule-based natural language processing (NLP) systems remain active in clinical
settings due to their interpretability and operational efficiency. However,
their manual development and maintenance are labor-intensive, particularly in
tasks with large linguistic variability. To overcome these limitations, we
proposed a novel approach employing LLMs solely during the rule-based systems
development phase. We conducted the initial experiments focusing on the first
two steps of developing a rule-based NLP pipeline: find relevant snippets from
the clinical note; extract informative keywords from the snippets for the
rule-based named entity recognition (NER) component. Our experiments
demonstrated exceptional recall in identifying clinically relevant text
snippets (Deepseek: 0.98, Qwen: 0.99) and 1.0 in extracting key terms for NER.
This study sheds light on a promising new direction for NLP development,
enabling semi-automated or automated development of rule-based systems with
significantly faster, more cost-effective, and transparent execution compared
with deep learning model-based solutions.

*Fenghua Cheng,Jinxiang Wang,Sen Wang,Zi Huang,Xue Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GeoGuess, a novel multimodal reasoning task involving hierarchical visual clues and geographic knowledge, and presents the SightSense method for solving it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal reasoning tasks lack focus on hierarchical visual clues (local details and global context), which are crucial in real-world scenarios.

Method: The authors propose SightSense, a multimodal and multilevel reasoning method, and introduce the GeoExplain dataset for benchmarking.

Result: SightSense demonstrates outstanding performance in the GeoGuess task.

Conclusion: GeoGuess and SightSense address the gap in hierarchical multimodal reasoning, offering a new benchmark and effective solution.

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning is a process of understanding, integrating and inferring
information across different data modalities. It has recently attracted surging
academic attention as a benchmark for Artificial Intelligence (AI). Although
there are various tasks for evaluating multimodal reasoning ability, they still
have limitations. Lack of reasoning on hierarchical visual clues at different
levels of granularity, e.g., local details and global context, is of little
discussion, despite its frequent involvement in real scenarios. To bridge the
gap, we introduce a novel and challenging task for multimodal reasoning, namely
GeoGuess. Given a street view image, the task is to identify its location and
provide a detailed explanation. A system that succeeds in GeoGuess should be
able to detect tiny visual clues, perceive the broader landscape, and associate
with vast geographic knowledge. Therefore, GeoGuess would require the ability
to reason between hierarchical visual information and geographic knowledge. In
this work, we establish a benchmark for GeoGuess by introducing a specially
curated dataset GeoExplain which consists of
panoramas-geocoordinates-explanation tuples. Additionally, we present a
multimodal and multilevel reasoning method, namely SightSense which can make
prediction and generate comprehensive explanation based on hierarchy of visual
information and external knowledge. Our analysis and experiments demonstrate
their outstanding performance in GeoGuess.

*Pavlo Vasylenko,Marcos Treviso,André F. T. Martins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ASEntmax, a sparse attention mechanism with learnable temperature, to improve focus on fixed-size patterns in transformers, outperforming traditional softmax and other baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Softmax attention in transformers disperses focus on non-informative tokens, harming tasks requiring precise attention on fixed-size patterns.

Method: Proposes ASEntmax, a variant of α-entmax with learnable temperature, and integrates it with optimized positional encodings.

Result: ASEntmax outperforms softmax, scalable softmax, and fixed α-entmax in long-context generalization tasks.

Conclusion: Sparse attention with ASEntmax and proper positional encodings enhances transformer performance for pattern-focused tasks.

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures traditionally employ softmax to compute
attention weights, which produces dense distributions over all tokens in a
sequence. While effective in many settings, this density has been shown to be
detrimental for tasks that demand precise focus on fixed-size patterns: as
sequence length increases, non-informative tokens accumulate attention
probability mass, leading to dispersion and representational collapse. We show
in this paper that sparse attention mechanisms using $\alpha$-entmax can avoid
these issues, due to their ability to assign exact zeros to irrelevant tokens.
Furthermore, we introduce Adaptive-Scalable Entmax (ASEntmax), which endows
$\alpha$-entmax with a learnable temperature parameter, allowing the attention
distribution to interpolate between sparse (pattern-focused) and dense
(softmax-like) regimes. Finally, we show that the ability to locate and
generalize fixed-size patterns can be further improved through a careful design
of position encodings, which impacts both dense and sparse attention methods.
By integrating ASEntmax into standard transformer layers alongside proper
positional encodings, we show that our models greatly outperform softmax,
scalable softmax, and fixed-temperature $\alpha$-entmax baselines on
long-context generalization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Arch-Router, a 1.5B model for preference-aligned routing of LLMs, addressing limitations in existing routing methods by capturing human preferences and enabling flexible model additions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM routing approaches lack alignment with human preferences and flexibility in model selection, prompting the need for a better solution.

Method: Proposes Arch-Router, a compact model that maps queries to domain-action preferences for routing decisions, supporting new models without retraining.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance in matching queries with human preferences, outperforming proprietary models on conversational datasets.

Conclusion: Arch-Router improves routing transparency, flexibility, and preference alignment, with the model publicly available for use.

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) -- each
optimized for different strengths, style, or latency/cost profile -- routing
has become an essential technique to operationalize the use of different
models. However, existing LLM routing approaches are limited in two key ways:
they evaluate performance using benchmarks that often fail to capture human
preferences driven by subjective evaluation criteria, and they typically select
from a limited pool of models. In this work, we propose a preference-aligned
routing framework that guides model selection by matching queries to
user-defined domains (e.g., travel) or action types (e.g., image editing) --
offering a practical mechanism to encode preferences in routing decisions.
Specifically, we introduce \textbf{Arch-Router}, a compact 1.5B model that
learns to map queries to domain-action preferences for model routing decisions.
Our approach also supports seamlessly adding new models for routing without
requiring retraining or architectural modifications. Experiments on
conversational datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) results in matching queries with human preferences, outperforming top
proprietary models. Our approach captures subjective evaluation criteria and
makes routing decisions more transparent and flexible. Our model is available

*Ananth Agarwal,Jasper Jian,Christopher D. Manning,Shikhar Murty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Probing syntactic features in LLMs doesn't reliably predict downstream syntactic performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if probing accuracy in LLMs correlates with actual syntactic performance in tasks.

Method: Evaluated 32 transformer models using probing and targeted syntax evaluations.

Result: Syntactic features from probing don't predict downstream syntactic behavior.

Conclusion: Latent syntactic representations from probing don't align with observable syntactic behaviors.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a robust mastery of syntax when
processing and generating text. While this suggests internalized understanding
of hierarchical syntax and dependency relations, the precise mechanism by which
they represent syntactic structure is an open area within interpretability
research. Probing provides one way to identify the mechanism of syntax being
linearly encoded in activations, however, no comprehensive study has yet
established whether a model's probing accuracy reliably predicts its downstream
syntactic performance. Adopting a "mechanisms vs. outcomes" framework, we
evaluate 32 open-weight transformer models and find that syntactic features
extracted via probing fail to predict outcomes of targeted syntax evaluations
across English linguistic phenomena. Our results highlight a substantial
disconnect between latent syntactic representations found via probing and
observable syntactic behaviors in downstream tasks.

TL;DR: LegiGPT combines LLM and XAI to analyze transportation bills, revealing how political ideologies and sponsor traits influence legislative outcomes in South Korea.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the impact of lawmakers' political ideologies on policymaking, especially in transportation legislation.

Method: LegiGPT uses GPT-4 for zero-shot classification of bills and XAI to analyze relationships between party affiliation and attributes.

Result: Key factors like sponsor ideology, party affiliation, and district size significantly shape transportation policymaking.

Conclusion: The framework aids in understanding legislative dynamics and informs future policy, with broader governance implications.

Abstract: Given the significant influence of lawmakers' political ideologies on
legislative decision-making, understanding their impact on policymaking is
critically important. We introduce a novel framework, LegiGPT, which integrates
a large language model (LLM) with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to
analyze transportation-related legislative proposals. LegiGPT employs a
multi-stage filtering and classification pipeline using zero-shot prompting
with GPT-4. Using legislative data from South Korea's 21st National Assembly,
we identify key factors - including sponsor characteristics, political
affiliations, and geographic variables - that significantly influence
transportation policymaking. The LLM was used to classify
transportation-related bill proposals through a stepwise filtering process
based on keywords, phrases, and contextual relevance. XAI techniques were then
applied to examine relationships between party affiliation and associated
attributes. The results reveal that the number and proportion of conservative
and progressive sponsors, along with district size and electoral population,
are critical determinants shaping legislative outcomes. These findings suggest
that both parties contributed to bipartisan legislation through different forms
of engagement, such as initiating or supporting proposals. This integrated
approach provides a valuable tool for understanding legislative dynamics and
guiding future policy development, with broader implications for infrastructure
planning and governance.

*Bin Chen,Xinzge Gao,Chuanrui Hu,Penghang Yu,Hua Zhang,Bing-Kun Bao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReasonGRM is a three-stage framework improving Generative Reward Models (GRMs) by enhancing reasoning quality, reducing hallucinations, and outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRMs lack robust reasoning, leading to incomplete or speculative outputs. ReasonGRM aims to address this by improving reasoning paths and reducing hallucinations.

Method: 1. Zero-RL generates concise reasoning paths. 2. Novel metric $R^\star$ scores paths for correctness and efficiency. 3. Reinforcement learning refines the model on challenging examples.

Result: ReasonGRM outperforms previous GRMs by 1.8% and proprietary models like GPT-4o by up to 5.6% on benchmarks.

Conclusion: ReasonGRM demonstrates the value of reasoning-aware training and high-quality rationale selection for reliable preference modeling.

Abstract: Generative Reward Models (GRMs) provide greater flexibility than scalar
reward models in capturing human preferences, but their effectiveness is
limited by poor reasoning capabilities. This often results in incomplete or
overly speculative reasoning paths, leading to hallucinations or missing key
information in complex tasks. We address this challenge with ReasonGRM, a
three-stage generative reward modeling framework. In the first stage, Zero-RL
is used to generate concise, outcome-directed reasoning paths that reduce the
likelihood of critical omissions. In the second stage, we introduce a novel
evaluation metric, $R^\star$, which scores reasoning paths based on their
generation likelihood. This favors paths that reach correct answers with
minimal exploration, helping to reduce hallucination-prone data during
training. In the final stage, the model is further refined through
reinforcement learning on challenging examples to enhance its preference
discrimination capabilities. Experiments on three public benchmarks show that
ReasonGRM achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance, outperforming
previous best GRMs by 1.8\% on average and surpassing proprietary models such
as GPT-4o by up to 5.6\%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of
reasoning-aware training and highlight the importance of high-quality rationale
selection for reliable preference modeling.

### [215] [The Role of Model Confidence on Bias Effects in Measured Uncertainties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16724)
*Xinyi Liu,Weiguang Wang,Hangfeng He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of bias on epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty in LLMs, finding that mitigating bias improves uncertainty quantification, especially when model confidence is low.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate assessment of epistemic uncertainty in LLMs is crucial for reliable outcomes, but is complicated by aleatoric uncertainty and bias.

Method: Experiments on VQA tasks with GPT-4o and Qwen2-VL, analyzing the effects of prompt biases on uncertainty at varying confidence levels.

Result: Bias mitigation improves uncertainty quantification; lower bias-free confidence leads to greater underestimation of epistemic uncertainty.

Conclusion: The findings enhance understanding of bias's role in uncertainty quantification, aiding the development of better techniques.

Abstract: With the growing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) for open-ended
tasks, accurately assessing epistemic uncertainty, which reflects a model's
lack of knowledge, has become crucial to ensuring reliable outcomes. However,
quantifying epistemic uncertainty in such tasks is challenging due to the
presence of aleatoric uncertainty, which arises from multiple valid answers.
While bias can introduce noise into epistemic uncertainty estimation, it may
also reduce noise from aleatoric uncertainty. To investigate this trade-off, we
conduct experiments on Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks and find that
mitigating prompt-introduced bias improves uncertainty quantification in
GPT-4o. Building on prior work showing that LLMs tend to copy input information
when model confidence is low, we further analyze how these prompt biases affect
measured epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty across varying bias-free
confidence levels with GPT-4o and Qwen2-VL. We find that all considered biases
induce greater changes in both uncertainties when bias-free model confidence is
lower. Moreover, lower bias-free model confidence leads to greater
underestimation of epistemic uncertainty (i.e. overconfidence) due to bias,
whereas it has no significant effect on the direction of changes in aleatoric
uncertainty estimation. These distinct effects deepen our understanding of bias
mitigation for uncertainty quantification and potentially inform the
development of more advanced techniques.

### [216] [LM-SPT: LM-Aligned Semantic Distillation for Speech Tokenization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16738)
*Daejin Jo,Jeeyoung Yun,Byungseok Roh,Sungwoong Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LM-SPT introduces a novel semantic distillation method for speech tokenization, improving alignment with language models and supporting multiple frame rates, outperforming baselines in speech-to-text and text-to-speech tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of long speech token sequences by improving semantic alignment with language models while maintaining reconstruction fidelity.

Method: Proposes LM-SPT, which reconstructs speech from semantic tokens and minimizes discrepancy between original and reconstructed waveforms using a frozen ASR encoder. Also includes architectural improvements and supports multiple frame rates.

Result: LM-SPT achieves superior reconstruction fidelity and SLMs using its tokens outperform baselines in speech-to-text and text-to-speech tasks.

Conclusion: LM-SPT effectively bridges the gap between speech and text modalities, enhancing efficiency and performance in speech-language modeling.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of speech language models (SLMs), discrete speech
tokens have emerged as a core interface between speech and text, enabling
unified modeling across modalities. Recent speech tokenization approaches aim
to isolate semantic information from low-level acoustics to better align with
language models. In particular, previous methods use SSL teachers such as
HuBERT to extract semantic representations, which are then distilled into a
semantic quantizer to suppress acoustic redundancy as well as capture
content-related latent structures. However, they still produce speech token
sequences significantly longer than their textual counterparts, creating
challenges for efficient speech-language modeling. Reducing the frame rate is a
natural solution, but standard techniques, such as rigid average pooling across
frames, can distort or dilute the semantic structure required for effective LM
alignment. To address this, we propose LM-SPT, a speech tokenization method
that introduces a novel semantic distillation. Instead of directly matching
teacher and student features via pooling, we reconstruct speech solely from
semantic tokens and minimize the discrepancy between the encoded
representations of the original and reconstructed waveforms, obtained from a
frozen automatic speech recognition (ASR) encoder. This indirect yet
data-driven supervision enables the tokenizer to learn discrete units that are
more semantically aligned with language models. LM-SPT further incorporates
architectural improvements to the encoder and decoder for speech tokenization,
and supports multiple frame rates, including 25Hz, 12.5Hz, and 6.25Hz.
Experimental results show that LM-SPT achieves superior reconstruction fidelity
compared to baselines, and that SLMs trained with LM-SPT tokens achieve
competitive performances on speech-to-text and consistently outperform

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LIRAS integrates language and visual inputs for social reasoning, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language provides critical social information, especially in novel situations where visual data is insufficient.

Method: LIRAS combines multimodal language models for parsing inputs into symbolic representations and a Bayesian inverse planning engine for probabilistic judgments.

Result: LIRAS outperforms ablations and state-of-the-art models in capturing human judgments across tasks.

Conclusion: LIRAS effectively integrates linguistic and visual inputs for robust social reasoning.

Abstract: Drawing real world social inferences usually requires taking into account
information from multiple modalities. Language is a particularly powerful
source of information in social settings, especially in novel situations where
language can provide both abstract information about the environment dynamics
and concrete specifics about an agent that cannot be easily visually observed.
In this paper, we propose Language-Informed Rational Agent Synthesis (LIRAS), a
framework for drawing context-specific social inferences that integrate
linguistic and visual inputs. LIRAS frames multimodal social reasoning as a
process of constructing structured but situation-specific agent and environment
representations - leveraging multimodal language models to parse language and
visual inputs into unified symbolic representations, over which a Bayesian
inverse planning engine can be run to produce granular probabilistic judgments.
On a range of existing and new social reasoning tasks derived from cognitive
science experiments, we find that our model (instantiated with a comparatively
lightweight VLM) outperforms ablations and state-of-the-art models in capturing
human judgments across all domains.

*Zhuang Chen,Yaru Cao,Guanqun Bi,Jincenzi Wu,Jinfeng Zhou,Xiyao Xiao,Si Chen,Hongning Wang,Minlie Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SocialSim is a framework for simulating emotional support conversations (ESC) by integrating social disclosure and awareness, outperforming crowdsourced data in quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High costs of crowdsourcing ESC data and the lack of social dynamics in existing methods motivated the development of SocialSim.

Method: SocialSim uses a persona bank for social disclosure and cognitive reasoning for social awareness to generate synthetic ESC data (SSConv).

Result: SSConv surpasses crowdsourced ESC data in quality, and a chatbot trained on it achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: SocialSim provides a scalable solution for synthesizing high-quality ESC, enhancing accessibility to emotional care.

Abstract: Emotional support conversation (ESC) helps reduce people's psychological
stress and provide emotional value through interactive dialogues. Due to the
high cost of crowdsourcing a large ESC corpus, recent attempts use large
language models for dialogue augmentation. However, existing approaches largely
overlook the social dynamics inherent in ESC, leading to less effective
simulations. In this paper, we introduce SocialSim, a novel framework that
simulates ESC by integrating key aspects of social interactions: social
disclosure and social awareness. On the seeker side, we facilitate social
disclosure by constructing a comprehensive persona bank that captures diverse
and authentic help-seeking scenarios. On the supporter side, we enhance social
awareness by eliciting cognitive reasoning to generate logical and supportive
responses. Building upon SocialSim, we construct SSConv, a large-scale
synthetic ESC corpus of which quality can even surpass crowdsourced ESC data.
We further train a chatbot on SSConv and demonstrate its state-of-the-art
performance in both automatic and human evaluations. We believe SocialSim
offers a scalable way to synthesize ESC, making emotional care more accessible
and practical.

*Lei Jiang,Zixun Zhang,Zizhou Wang,Xiaobing Sun,Zhen Li,Liangli Zhen,Xiaohua Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CAMO is a stealthy, efficient black-box jailbreak attack for LVLMs, using cross-modal reasoning to bypass safety mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing jailbreak methods are detectable and inefficient; CAMO aims to evade detection while improving efficiency.

Method: Decomposes malicious prompts into benign visual/textual fragments, leveraging LVLMs' cross-modal reasoning for covert reconstruction.

Result: CAMO outperforms prior attacks in stealth and efficiency, with strong cross-model transferability.

Conclusion: Highlights vulnerabilities in LVLM safety mechanisms, calling for advanced security solutions.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance
across multimodal tasks, yet remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass
built-in safety mechanisms to elicit restricted content generation. Existing
black-box jailbreak methods primarily rely on adversarial textual prompts or
image perturbations, yet these approaches are highly detectable by standard
content filtering systems and exhibit low query and computational efficiency.
In this work, we present Cross-modal Adversarial Multimodal Obfuscation (CAMO),
a novel black-box jailbreak attack framework that decomposes malicious prompts
into semantically benign visual and textual fragments. By leveraging LVLMs'
cross-modal reasoning abilities, CAMO covertly reconstructs harmful
instructions through multi-step reasoning, evading conventional detection
mechanisms. Our approach supports adjustable reasoning complexity and requires
significantly fewer queries than prior attacks, enabling both stealth and
efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on leading LVLMs validate
CAMO's effectiveness, showcasing robust performance and strong cross-model
transferability. These results underscore significant vulnerabilities in
current built-in safety mechanisms, emphasizing an urgent need for advanced,
alignment-aware security and safety solutions in vision-language systems.

*Heloisa Oss Boll,Antonio Oss Boll,Leticia Puttlitz Boll,Ameen Abu Hanna,Iacer Calixto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Distillnote, an LLM-based framework, generates clinical note summaries using three techniques, achieving high compression and improved predictive performance for heart failure compared to original notes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To alleviate the burden of clinical documentation by generating concise summaries of patient information using LLMs.

Method: Three summarization techniques: one-step direct summarization, structured summarization, and distilled summarization. Evaluated using predictive performance, LLM-as-judge, and clinician comparisons.

Result: Distilled summaries achieve 79% text compression and 18.2% AUPRC improvement. One-step summaries are favored for relevance, while distilled summaries excel in efficiency and reduce hallucinations.

Conclusion: Distillnote effectively balances summary quality and efficiency, with potential to enhance clinical documentation and decision-making.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities to generate
concise summaries of patient information and alleviate the burden of clinical
documentation that overwhelms healthcare providers. We present Distillnote, a
framework for LLM-based clinical note summarization, and generate over 64,000
admission note summaries through three techniques: (1) One-step, direct
summarization, and a divide-and-conquer approach involving (2) Structured
summarization focused on independent clinical insights, and (3) Distilled
summarization that further condenses the Structured summaries. We test how
useful are the summaries by using them to predict heart failure compared to a
model trained on the original notes. Distilled summaries achieve 79% text
compression and up to 18.2% improvement in AUPRC compared to an LLM trained on
the full notes. We also evaluate the quality of the generated summaries in an
LLM-as-judge evaluation as well as through blinded pairwise comparisons with
clinicians. Evaluations indicate that one-step summaries are favoured by
clinicians according to relevance and clinical actionability, while distilled
summaries offer optimal efficiency (avg. 6.9x compression-to-performance ratio)
and significantly reduce hallucinations. We release our summaries on PhysioNet
to encourage future research.

*Muyang Zheng,Yuanzhi Yao,Changting Lin,Rui Wang,Meng Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MIST, a method for jailbreaking black-box LLMs via iterative semantic tuning, achieving high success rates and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks despite alignment efforts, prompting the need for effective black-box attack methods.

Method: MIST uses iterative semantic tuning with sequential synonym search and order-determining optimization to refine prompts for harmful content.

Result: MIST outperforms state-of-the-art methods in attack success and transferability across multiple models.

Conclusion: MIST is a practical and efficient solution for jailbreaking black-box LLMs, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: Despite efforts to align large language models (LLMs) with societal and moral
values, these models remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks--methods designed
to elicit harmful responses. Jailbreaking black-box LLMs is considered
challenging due to the discrete nature of token inputs, restricted access to
the target LLM, and limited query budget. To address the issues above, we
propose an effective method for jailbreaking black-box large language Models
via Iterative Semantic Tuning, named MIST. MIST enables attackers to
iteratively refine prompts that preserve the original semantic intent while
inducing harmful content. Specifically, to balance semantic similarity with
computational efficiency, MIST incorporates two key strategies: sequential
synonym search, and its advanced version--order-determining optimization.
Extensive experiments across two open-source models and four closed-source
models demonstrate that MIST achieves competitive attack success rates and
attack transferability compared with other state-of-the-art white-box and
black-box jailbreak methods. Additionally, we conduct experiments on
computational efficiency to validate the practical viability of MIST.

*Daniel Christoph,Max Ploner,Patrick Haller,Alan Akbik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores how model architecture and size affect learning efficiency for high- and low-frequency facts in language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sample efficiency is critical for training models to handle long-tailed information distributions in real-world text.

Method: Analyzed multiple models of varying architectures and sizes trained on the same data, annotating relational facts by frequency.

Result: Models perform similarly on high-frequency facts but differ on low-frequency ones.

Conclusion: Provides insights into how model architecture and size influence factual learning efficiency.

Abstract: Sample efficiency is a crucial property of language models with practical
implications for training efficiency. In real-world text, information follows a
long-tailed distribution. Yet, we expect models to learn and recall frequent
and infrequent facts. Sample-efficient models are better equipped to handle
this challenge of learning and retaining rare information without requiring
excessive exposure. This study analyzes multiple models of varying
architectures and sizes, all trained on the same pre-training data. By
annotating relational facts with their frequencies in the training corpus, we
examine how model performance varies with fact frequency. Our findings show
that most models perform similarly on high-frequency facts but differ notably
on low-frequency facts. This analysis provides new insights into the
relationship between model architecture, size, and factual learning efficiency.

### [223] [Language Bottleneck Models: A Framework for Interpretable Knowledge Tracing and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16982)
*Antonin Berthon,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Language Bottleneck Model (LBM) for Knowledge Tracing (KT), which uses interpretable natural-language summaries to improve accuracy and transparency over traditional KT and LLM-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional KT methods lack interpretability due to opaque latent embeddings, and LLM-based approaches may produce unreliable predictions. The paper aims to address these issues by making KT more interpretable and accurate.

Method: The LBM consists of an encoder LLM that generates a concise, interpretable knowledge summary and a frozen decoder LLM that uses this summary to predict student responses. The model is trained with group-relative policy optimization to improve summary quality.

Result: LBMs achieve accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art KT and LLM methods while requiring significantly fewer student trajectories. The summaries are both interpretable and accurate.

Conclusion: The LBM framework successfully balances interpretability and accuracy in KT, offering a promising alternative to traditional and LLM-based approaches.

Abstract: Accurately assessing student knowledge is critical for effective education,
yet traditional Knowledge Tracing (KT) methods rely on opaque latent
embeddings, limiting interpretability. Even LLM-based approaches generate
direct predictions or summaries that may hallucinate without any accuracy
guarantees. We recast KT as an inverse problem: learning the minimum
natural-language summary that makes past answers explainable and future answers
predictable. Our Language Bottleneck Model (LBM) consists of an encoder LLM
that writes an interpretable knowledge summary and a frozen decoder LLM that
must reconstruct and predict student responses using only that summary text. By
constraining all predictive information to pass through a short
natural-language bottleneck, LBMs ensure that the summary contains accurate
information while remaining human-interpretable. Experiments on synthetic
arithmetic benchmarks and the large-scale Eedi dataset show that LBMs rival the
accuracy of state-of-the-art KT and direct LLM methods while requiring
orders-of-magnitude fewer student trajectories. We demonstrate that training
the encoder with group-relative policy optimization, using downstream decoding
accuracy as a reward signal, effectively improves summary quality.

*Sahil Kale,Vijaykant Nadadur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TeXpert, a benchmark dataset for evaluating LLMs' ability to generate LaTeX code from natural language prompts, revealing performance gaps and common errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks lack evaluation of LLMs' ability to generate LaTeX code for scientific documents, despite its importance for researchers.

Method: The authors create TeXpert, a dataset with natural language prompts for LaTeX generation across difficulty levels, and evaluate LLMs' performance.

Result: LLMs perform poorly in LaTeX generation, with accuracy dropping as task complexity increases. Open-source models rival closed-source ones, and formatting/package errors are common.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for diverse LaTeX training data and provides a benchmark (TeXpert) for future improvements in LLM-based LaTeX generation.

Abstract: LaTeX's precision and flexibility in typesetting have made it the gold
standard for the preparation of scientific documentation. Large Language Models
(LLMs) present a promising opportunity for researchers to produce
publication-ready material using LaTeX with natural language instructions, yet
current benchmarks completely lack evaluation of this ability. By introducing
TeXpert, our benchmark dataset with natural language prompts for generating
LaTeX code focused on components of scientific documents across multiple
difficulty levels, we conduct an in-depth analysis of LLM performance in this
regard and identify frequent error types. Our evaluation across open and
closed-source LLMs highlights multiple key findings: LLMs excelling on standard
benchmarks perform poorly in LaTeX generation with a significant accuracy
drop-off as the complexity of tasks increases; open-source models like DeepSeek
v3 and DeepSeek Coder strongly rival closed-source counterparts in LaTeX tasks;
and formatting and package errors are unexpectedly prevalent, suggesting a lack
of diverse LaTeX examples in the training datasets of most LLMs. Our dataset,
code, and model evaluations are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using knowledge graphs with standard and hyperedges for personalized language models, showing robustness in benchmarks like TriviaQA and DiaASQ.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance personalization in language models by retaining and utilizing extensive personal information dynamically.

Method: Utilizes external memory via knowledge graphs (including hyperedges) constructed and updated by the LLM itself, based on AriGraph architecture.

Result: Improved robustness in graph construction and knowledge extraction, with maintained performance even after augmenting benchmarks with temporal and contradictory elements.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture effectively handles temporal dependencies and personalization, demonstrating scalability and robustness in question-answering tasks.

Abstract: The challenge of personalizing language models, specifically the ability to
account for a user's history during interactions, is of significant interest.
Despite recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and Retrieval
Augmented Generation that have enhanced the factual base of LLMs, the task of
retaining extensive personal information and using it to generate personalized
responses remains pertinent. To address this, we propose utilizing external
memory in the form of knowledge graphs, which are constructed and updated by
the LLM itself. We have expanded upon ideas of AriGraph architecture and for
the first time introduced a combined graph featuring both standard edges and
two types of hyperedges. Experiments conducted on the TriviaQA, HotpotQA and
DiaASQ benchmarks indicates that this approach aids in making the process of
graph construction and knowledge extraction unified and robust. Furthermore, we
augmented the DiaASQ benchmark by incorporating parameters such as time into
dialogues and introducing contradictory statements made by the same speaker at
different times. Despite these modifications, the performance of the
question-answering system remained robust, demonstrating the proposed
architecture's ability to maintain and utilize temporal dependencies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-generated feedback shows moderate learning benefits in tutor training, with effectiveness linked to learners' tendency to seek support, without increasing completion time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the impact of LLM-generated feedback on learning compared to existing methods, addressing gaps in understanding its effectiveness.

Method: Analyzed 2,600 lesson completions from 885 tutor learners across three groups (LLM feedback, declined feedback, no access) using propensity scoring to adjust for selection bias.

Result: Two out of seven lessons showed significant learning benefits (effect sizes 0.28, 0.33). LLM feedback was rated helpful and didn't increase completion time.

Conclusion: LLM feedback is a scalable, low-cost tool for improving learning in open-ended tasks, especially in systems already providing feedback.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate feedback, yet
their impact on learning remains underexplored, especially compared to existing
feedback methods. This study investigates how on-demand LLM-generated
explanatory feedback influences learning in seven scenario-based tutor training
lessons. Analyzing over 2,600 lesson completions from 885 tutor learners, we
compare posttest performance among learners across three groups: learners who
received feedback generated by gpt-3.5-turbo, those who declined it, and those
without access. All groups received non-LLM corrective feedback. To address
potential selection bias-where higher-performing learners may be more inclined
to use LLM feedback-we applied propensity scoring. Learners with a higher
predicted likelihood of engaging with LLM feedback scored significantly higher
at posttest than those with lower propensity. After adjusting for this effect,
two out of seven lessons showed statistically significant learning benefits
from LLM feedback with standardized effect sizes of 0.28 and 0.33. These
moderate effects suggest that the effectiveness of LLM feedback depends on the
learners' tendency to seek support. Importantly, LLM feedback did not
significantly increase completion time, and learners overwhelmingly rated it as
helpful. These findings highlight LLM feedback's potential as a low-cost and
scalable way to improve learning on open-ended tasks, particularly in existing
systems already providing feedback without LLMs. This work contributes open
datasets, LLM prompts, and rubrics to support reproducibility.

Motivation: To address the challenge of instruction-following speech processing efficiently with limited resources, leveraging small-scale models and high-quality data.

Method: A two-phase approach: modality alignment between a pre-trained speech encoder and text decoder, followed by instruction fine-tuning. Uses small-scale language models (< 2B) and high-quality CC-BY data, supplemented with synthetic data.

Result: Submitted results for the Short Track (speech recognition, translation, and spoken question answering) at IWSLT 2025.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MUCAR is a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal ambiguity resolution, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks by focusing on multilingual and cross-modal scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks overlook linguistic and visual ambiguities, failing to leverage mutual clarification between modalities.

Method: MUCAR includes a multilingual dataset and a dual-ambiguity dataset, designed for mutual disambiguation.

Result: Evaluations of 19 state-of-the-art models show significant performance gaps compared to humans.

Conclusion: The benchmark highlights the need for advanced cross-modal ambiguity comprehension methods.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
advances across numerous vision-language tasks. Due to their strong image-text
alignment capability, MLLMs can effectively understand image-text pairs with
clear meanings. However, effectively resolving the inherent ambiguities in
natural language and visual contexts remains challenging. Existing multimodal
benchmarks typically overlook linguistic and visual ambiguities, relying mainly
on unimodal context for disambiguation and thus failing to exploit the mutual
clarification potential between modalities. To bridge this gap, we introduce
MUCAR, a novel and challenging benchmark designed explicitly for evaluating
multimodal ambiguity resolution across multilingual and cross-modal scenarios.
MUCAR includes: (1) a multilingual dataset where ambiguous textual expressions
are uniquely resolved by corresponding visual contexts, and (2) a
dual-ambiguity dataset that systematically pairs ambiguous images with
ambiguous textual contexts, with each combination carefully constructed to
yield a single, clear interpretation through mutual disambiguation. Extensive
evaluations involving 19 state-of-the-art multimodal models--encompassing both
open-source and proprietary architectures--reveal substantial gaps compared to
human-level performance, highlighting the need for future research into more
sophisticated cross-modal ambiguity comprehension methods, further pushing the
boundaries of multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: Proposes a new latency measure and demonstrates effective simultaneous translation.

Abstract: This paper describes Charles University submission to the Simultaneous Speech

speech model, which we use for both translation and transcription in
simultaneous mode with the state-of-the-art simultaneous policy AlignAtt. We
further improve the performance by prompting to inject in-domain terminology,
and we accommodate context. Our cascaded systems further use EuroLLM for
unbounded simultaneous translation. Compared to the Organizers' baseline, our
systems improve by 2 BLEU points on Czech to English and 13-22 BLEU points on
English to German, Chinese and Japanese on the development sets. Additionally,
we also propose a new enhanced measure of speech recognition latency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Tower+ is a suite of models balancing translation specialization and multilingual general-purpose capabilities, outperforming larger models in both domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between fine-tuning LLMs for specific tasks (e.g., translation) and retaining general-purpose capabilities like reasoning and instruction-following.

Method: A novel training recipe involving continued pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, preference optimization, and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, using carefully curated data.

Result: Smaller Tower+ models outperform larger general-purpose LLMs, and the largest model achieves top translation and multilingual task performance.

Conclusion: It's possible to rival frontier models in general capabilities while optimizing for specific domains like translation.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained LLMs has been shown to be an effective strategy for
reaching state-of-the-art performance on specific tasks like machine
translation. However, this process of adaptation often implies sacrificing
general-purpose capabilities, such as conversational reasoning and
instruction-following, hampering the utility of the system in real-world
applications that require a mixture of skills. In this paper, we introduce
Tower+, a suite of models designed to deliver strong performance across both
translation and multilingual general-purpose text capabilities. We achieve a
Pareto frontier between translation specialization and multilingual
general-purpose capabilities by introducing a novel training recipe that builds
on Tower (Alves et al., 2024), comprising continued pretraining, supervised
fine-tuning, preference optimization, and reinforcement learning with
verifiable rewards. At each stage of training, we carefully generate and curate
data to strengthen performance on translation as well as general-purpose tasks
involving code generation, mathematics problem solving, and general
instruction-following. We develop models at multiple scales: 2B, 9B, and 72B.
Our smaller models often outperform larger general-purpose open-weight and
proprietary LLMs (e.g., Llama 3.3 70B, GPT-4o). Our largest model delivers
best-in-class translation performance for high-resource languages and top
results in multilingual Arena Hard evaluations and in IF-MT, a benchmark we
introduce for evaluating both translation and instruction-following. Our
findings highlight that it is possible to rival frontier models in general
capabilities, while optimizing for specific business domains, such as
translation and localization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoT prompting reduces LLM hallucinations but complicates detection by obscuring key signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting affects hallucination detection in LLMs.

Method: Empirical evaluation of CoT's impact on hallucination detection, analyzing score distributions, accuracy, and confidence.

Result: CoT reduces hallucinations but impairs detection effectiveness by masking critical signals.

Conclusion: CoT introduces a trade-off between reducing hallucinations and maintaining detection efficacy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit \textit{hallucinations},
generating factually incorrect or semantically irrelevant content in response
to prompts. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting can mitigate hallucinations by
encouraging step-by-step reasoning, but its impact on hallucination detection
remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic empirical
evaluation. We begin with a pilot experiment, revealing that CoT reasoning
significantly affects the LLM's internal states and token probability
distributions. Building on this, we evaluate the impact of various CoT
prompting methods on mainstream hallucination detection methods across both
instruction-tuned and reasoning-oriented LLMs. Specifically, we examine three
key dimensions: changes in hallucination score distributions, variations in
detection accuracy, and shifts in detection confidence. Our findings show that
while CoT prompting helps reduce hallucination frequency, it also tends to
obscure critical signals used for detection, impairing the effectiveness of
various detection methods. Our study highlights an overlooked trade-off in the
use of reasoning. Code is publicly available at:

*Murtaza Nazir,Matthew Finlayson,John X. Morris,Xiang Ren,Swabha Swayamdipta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PILS method recovers hidden prompts from language model outputs using next-token probabilities, achieving 2--3.5x higher recovery rates than prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address security risks like private data leaks from API-protected language models by improving prompt inversion.

Method: PILS leverages low-dimensional subspace of model outputs to compress next-token probabilities, enabling efficient inversion.

Result: Achieves 2--3.5x higher exact recovery rates, e.g., from 17% to 60%, and generalizes well to more generation steps.

Conclusion: Next-token probabilities are a vulnerable attack surface, and PILS significantly advances prompt inversion capabilities.

Abstract: Language model inversion seeks to recover hidden prompts using only language
model outputs. This capability has implications for security and accountability
in language model deployments, such as leaking private information from an
API-protected language model's system message. We propose a new method --
prompt inversion from logprob sequences (PILS) -- that recovers hidden prompts
by gleaning clues from the model's next-token probabilities over the course of
multiple generation steps. Our method is enabled by a key insight: The
vector-valued outputs of a language model occupy a low-dimensional subspace.
This enables us to losslessly compress the full next-token probability
distribution over multiple generation steps using a linear map, allowing more
output information to be used for inversion. Our approach yields massive gains
over previous state-of-the-art methods for recovering hidden prompts, achieving
2--3.5 times higher exact recovery rates across test sets, in one case
increasing the recovery rate from 17% to 60%. Our method also exhibits
surprisingly good generalization behavior; for instance, an inverter trained on
16 generations steps gets 5--27 points higher prompt recovery when we increase
the number of steps to 32 at test time. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong
performance of our method on the more challenging task of recovering hidden
system messages. We also analyze the role of verbatim repetition in prompt
recovery and propose a new method for cross-family model transfer for
logit-based inverters. Our findings show that next-token probabilities are a
considerably more vulnerable attack surface for inversion attacks than
previously known.

### [233] [Cache Me If You Can: How Many KVs Do You Need for Effective Long-Context LMs?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17121)
*Adithya Bhaskar,Alexander Wettig,Tianyu Gao,Yihe Dong,Danqi Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the *KV footprint* metric to evaluate methods for managing key-value (KV) cache memory in long-context language models, revealing issues with prior methods and proposing optimizations like post-fill eviction adaptation and PruLong for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory costs for KV cache grow with longer contexts in language models, but existing methods lack fair comparison and have caveats like high peak memory or performance loss.

Method: Proposes the *KV footprint* metric, adapts post-fill eviction methods for pre-filling, and introduces PruLong for optimizing KV cache retention.

Result: PruLong achieves a 12% smaller KV footprint than prior methods while maintaining performance in recall tasks.

Conclusion: The paper provides a unified metric and optimizations for KV cache management, enabling future advancements in minimizing memory usage for long-context models.

Abstract: Language models handle increasingly long contexts for tasks such as book
summarization, but this leads to growing memory costs for the key-value (KV)
cache. Many prior works have proposed ways of discarding KVs from memory, but
their approaches are tailored to favorable settings, obscuring caveats like
high peak memory and performance degradation, and a fair comparison between
methods is difficult. In this paper, we propose the *KV footprint* as a unified
metric, which accounts for both the amount of KV entries stored and their
lifespan in memory. We evaluate methods based on the smallest footprint they
attain while preserving performance in both long-context understanding and
generation, with context lengths of up to 128K tokens. This metric reveals the
high peak memory of prior KV eviction methods. One class of methods --
*post-fill eviction* -- has a high footprint due to being incompatible with
eviction during pre-filling. We adapt these methods to be able to evict KVs
during pre-filling, achieving substantially lower KV footprints. We then turn
to *recency eviction* methods, wherein we propose PruLong, an end-to-end
optimization method for learning which attention heads need to retain the full
KV cache and which do not. PruLong saves memory while preserving long-context
performance, achieving 12% smaller KV footprint than prior methods while
retaining performance in challenging recall tasks. Our paper clarifies the
complex tangle of long-context inference methods and paves the way for future
development to minimize the KV footprint.

### [234] [CLEAR-3K: Assessing Causal Explanatory Capabilities in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17180)
*Naiming Liu,Richard Baraniuk,Shashank Sonkar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLEAR-3K is a dataset of 3,000 assertion-reasoning questions to test language models' ability to distinguish causal explanations from semantic relatedness. Evaluations of 21 models reveal they often confuse the two, with performance plateauing at 0.55 MCC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether language models can accurately distinguish genuine causal relationships from mere semantic relatedness, a critical capability for applications relying on causal reasoning.

Method: The study introduces CLEAR-3K, a dataset of assertion-reason pairs, and evaluates 21 state-of-the-art language models (0.5B to 72B parameters) on their ability to identify causal explanations.

Result: Models frequently confuse semantic similarity with causality, and larger models shift from skepticism to permissiveness. Performance plateaus at 0.55 MCC, indicating limited causal reasoning ability.

Conclusion: CLEAR-3K serves as a benchmark for improving causal reasoning in language models, highlighting current limitations despite model size increases.

Abstract: We introduce CLEAR-3K, a dataset of 3,000 assertion-reasoning questions
designed to evaluate whether language models can determine if one statement
causally explains another. Each question present an assertion-reason pair and
challenge language models to distinguish between semantic relatedness and
genuine causal explanatory relationships. Through comprehensive evaluation of
21 state-of-the-art language models (ranging from 0.5B to 72B parameters), we
identify two fundamental findings. First, language models frequently confuse
semantic similarity with causality, relying on lexical and semantic overlap
instead of inferring actual causal explanatory relationships. Second, as
parameter size increases, models tend to shift from being overly skeptical
about causal relationships to being excessively permissive in accepting them.
Despite this shift, performance measured by the Matthews Correlation
Coefficient plateaus at just 0.55, even for the best-performing models.Hence,
CLEAR-3K provides a crucial benchmark for developing and evaluating genuine
causal reasoning in language models, which is an essential capability for
applications that require accurate assessment of causal relationships.

Motivation: To develop next-generation search systems that emulate human information processing and decision-making for tasks ranging from simple queries to complex reasoning.

Method: Employs a modular architecture with four agents (Master, Planner, Executor, Writer) for task planning, execution, and synthesis, integrating algorithmic and infrastructure optimizations.

Result: A comprehensive blueprint for adaptive, scalable, and trustworthy AI search systems.

Conclusion: The work provides foundational methodologies for developing advanced AI search systems, emphasizing adaptability and robustness.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the AI Search Paradigm, a comprehensive blueprint
for next-generation search systems capable of emulating human information
processing and decision-making. The paradigm employs a modular architecture of
four LLM-powered agents (Master, Planner, Executor and Writer) that dynamically
adapt to the full spectrum of information needs, from simple factual queries to
complex multi-stage reasoning tasks. These agents collaborate dynamically
through coordinated workflows to evaluate query complexity, decompose problems
into executable plans, and orchestrate tool usage, task execution, and content
synthesis. We systematically present key methodologies for realizing this
paradigm, including task planning and tool integration, execution strategies,
aligned and robust retrieval-augmented generation, and efficient LLM inference,
spanning both algorithmic techniques and infrastructure-level optimizations. By
providing an in-depth guide to these foundational components, this work aims to
inform the development of trustworthy, adaptive, and scalable AI search
systems.

### [236] [Fine-Tuning Lowers Safety and Disrupts Evaluation Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17209)
*Kathleen C. Fraser,Hillary Dawkins,Isar Nejadgholi,Svetlana Kiritchenko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuning LLMs can unintentionally remove safety features, posing risks even with benign data. Safety benchmarks show high variance, raising concerns about evaluation reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the unintended removal of safety features during fine-tuning and the unreliability of current safety evaluations.

Method: Investigates robustness of safety benchmarks by testing trivial variations in fine-tuning setups and stochastic LLM behavior.

Result: High variance in safety evaluation results due to minor changes, undermining reliability.

Conclusion: Urgent need for standardized safety evaluation reporting to ensure meaningful comparisons and mitigate risks.

Abstract: Fine-tuning a general-purpose large language model (LLM) for a specific
domain or task has become a routine procedure for ordinary users. However,
fine-tuning is known to remove the safety alignment features of the model, even
when the fine-tuning data does not contain any harmful content. We consider
this to be a critical failure mode of LLMs due to the widespread uptake of
fine-tuning, combined with the benign nature of the "attack". Most
well-intentioned developers are likely unaware that they are deploying an LLM
with reduced safety. On the other hand, this known vulnerability can be easily
exploited by malicious actors intending to bypass safety guardrails. To make
any meaningful progress in mitigating this issue, we first need reliable and
reproducible safety evaluations. In this work, we investigate how robust a
safety benchmark is to trivial variations in the experimental procedure, and
the stochastic nature of LLMs. Our initial experiments expose surprising
variance in the results of the safety evaluation, even when seemingly
inconsequential changes are made to the fine-tuning setup. Our observations
have serious implications for how researchers in this field should report
results to enable meaningful comparisons in the future.

*Ho Yin 'Sam' Ng,Ting-Yao Hsu,Aashish Anantha Ramakrishnan,Branislav Kveton,Nedim Lipka,Franck Dernoncourt,Dongwon Lee,Tong Yu,Sungchul Kim,Ryan A. Rossi,Ting-Hao 'Kenneth' Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LaMP-Cap introduces a multimodal dataset for personalized figure caption generation, leveraging profiles with images and text to improve caption quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing caption generation models lack personalization and multimodal context, requiring authors to revise generic AI-generated captions.

Method: LaMP-Cap provides multimodal profiles (images, captions, and paragraphs) for figures, tested with four LLMs to evaluate caption quality.

Result: Using profile information improves caption alignment with author-written ones, with images proving more helpful than text-only profiles.

Conclusion: Multimodal profiles enhance personalized caption generation, offering better context than text-only approaches.

Abstract: Figure captions are crucial for helping readers understand and remember a
figure's key message. Many models have been developed to generate these
captions, helping authors compose better quality captions more easily. Yet,
authors almost always need to revise generic AI-generated captions to match
their writing style and the domain's style, highlighting the need for
personalization. Despite language models' personalization (LaMP) advances,
these technologies often focus on text-only settings and rarely address
scenarios where both inputs and profiles are multimodal. This paper introduces
LaMP-Cap, a dataset for personalized figure caption generation with multimodal
figure profiles. For each target figure, LaMP-Cap provides not only the needed
inputs, such as figure images, but also up to three other figures from the same
document--each with its image, caption, and figure-mentioning paragraphs--as a
profile to characterize the context. Experiments with four LLMs show that using
profile information consistently helps generate captions closer to the original
author-written ones. Ablation studies reveal that images in the profile are
more helpful than figure-mentioning paragraphs, highlighting the advantage of
using multimodal profiles over text-only ones.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adversarial Evolution Training (AET) enhances robustness by prepending an ERM phase to adversarial training, improving efficiency and clean accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many adversarial training variants overlook foundational feature representations, focusing instead on stronger attacks. AET addresses this by emphasizing feature pre-conditioning.

Method: AET strategically combines an initial Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) phase with conventional adversarial training (AT) to cultivate a favorable feature manifold.

Result: AET achieves comparable or superior robustness faster, improves clean accuracy, and reduces training costs by 8-25%. It works across datasets, architectures, and existing AT methods.

Conclusion: Feature pre-conditioning via standard training (ERM) is crucial for developing efficient and principled robust defenses.

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is a cornerstone defense, but many variants
overlook foundational feature representations by primarily focusing on stronger
attack generation. We introduce Adversarial Evolution Training (AET), a simple
yet powerful framework that strategically prepends an Empirical Risk
Minimization (ERM) phase to conventional AT. We hypothesize this initial ERM
phase cultivates a favorable feature manifold, enabling more efficient and
effective robustness acquisition. Empirically, AET achieves comparable or
superior robustness more rapidly, improves clean accuracy, and cuts training
costs by 8-25\%. Its effectiveness is shown across multiple datasets,
architectures, and when augmenting established AT methods. Our findings
underscore the impact of feature pre-conditioning via standard training for
developing more efficient, principled robust defenses. Code is available in the

*Jiahe Qin,Junpeng Li,Changchun Hua,Yana Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes MDPU, a generalized learning framework for Label Proportion Learning (LLP), addressing challenges in obtaining precise proportion labels and leveraging proportional constraints effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practical applications struggle with obtaining precise supervisory information about instance proportions in LLP, necessitating a more adaptable framework.

Method: MDPU models instance distribution under constraints, derives an unbiased risk estimator via ERM, and introduces a risk correction method to prevent overfitting.

Result: Theoretical bounds confirm consistency, and experiments validate MDPU's effectiveness against baselines.

Conclusion: MDPU provides a robust and adaptable solution for LLP, supported by theory and empirical results.

Abstract: Label Proportion Learning (LLP) addresses the classification problem where
multiple instances are grouped into bags and each bag contains information
about the proportion of each class. However, in practical applications,
obtaining precise supervisory information regarding the proportion of instances
in a specific class is challenging. To better align with real-world application
scenarios and effectively leverage the proportional constraints of instances
within tuples, this paper proposes a generalized learning framework
\emph{MDPU}. Specifically, we first mathematically model the distribution of
instances within tuples of arbitrary size, under the constraint that the number
of positive instances is no less than that of negative instances. Then we
derive an unbiased risk estimator that satisfies risk consistency based on the
empirical risk minimization (ERM) method. To mitigate the inevitable
overfitting issue during training, a risk correction method is introduced,
leading to the development of a corrected risk estimator. The generalization
error bounds of the unbiased risk estimator theoretically demonstrate the
consistency of the proposed method. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets
and comparisons with other relevant baseline methods comprehensively validate
the effectiveness of the proposed learning framework.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: S$^2$GPT-PINN is a compact, efficient model for solving parametric PDEs, using minimal parameters and computational power via knowledge distillation and down-sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of traditional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) by creating a domain-specific, sparse, and small model.

Method: Uses a greedy algorithm for high-quality data selection, knowledge distillation from Pre-Trained PINNs, and down-sampling for physics-informed loss calculation.

Result: Achieves high efficiency with significantly fewer parameters than traditional PINNs.

Conclusion: S$^2$GPT-PINN offers a scalable and efficient solution for parametric PDEs, balancing performance and computational cost.

Abstract: We propose S$^2$GPT-PINN, a sparse and small model for solving parametric
partial differential equations (PDEs). Similar to Small Language Models (SLMs),
S$^2$GPT-PINN is tailored to domain-specific (families of) PDEs and
characterized by its compact architecture and minimal computational power.
Leveraging a small amount of extremely high quality data via a mathematically
rigorous greedy algorithm that is enabled by the large full-order models,
S$^2$GPT-PINN relies on orders of magnitude less parameters than PINNs to
achieve extremely high efficiency via two levels of customizations. The first
is knowledge distillation via task-specific activation functions that are
transferred from Pre-Trained PINNs. The second is a judicious down-sampling
when calculating the physics-informed loss of the network compressing the
number of data sites by orders of magnitude to the size of the small model.

TL;DR: Proposes an end-to-end framework for cellular traffic prediction using CNNs with attention and Kalman filters, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cellular traffic is dynamic and influenced by exogenous factors, degrading prediction accuracy.

Method: Uses CNNs with attention for spatial dynamics and Kalman filters for temporal modeling, incorporating auxiliary data like social activities.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning techniques in prediction accuracy on three real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The framework effectively captures spatiotemporal patterns and improves prediction performance.

Abstract: Cellular traffic prediction is of great importance for operators to manage
network resources and make decisions. Traffic is highly dynamic and influenced
by many exogenous factors, which would lead to the degradation of traffic
prediction accuracy. This paper proposes an end-to-end framework with two
variants to explicitly characterize the spatiotemporal patterns of cellular
traffic among neighboring cells. It uses convolutional neural networks with an
attention mechanism to capture the spatial dynamics and Kalman filter for
temporal modelling. Besides, we can fully exploit the auxiliary information
such as social activities to improve prediction performance. We conduct
extensive experiments on three real-world datasets. The results show that our
proposed models outperform the state-of-the-art machine learning techniques in
terms of prediction accuracy.

*Liulu He,Shenli Zhen,Karwei Sun,Yijiang Liu,Yufei Zhao,Chongkang Tan,Huanrui Yang,Yuan Du,Li Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BASE-Q improves quantization for LLMs by addressing limitations of current rotational methods, reducing errors and enabling blockwise optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current rotational quantization methods for LLMs have limitations like misaligned channel means and Gaussian-like activation distributions, leading to higher errors and memory overhead.

Method: Introduces BASE-Q, combining bias correction and asymmetric scaling to reduce rounding and clipping errors, and enables blockwise optimization.

Result: BASE-Q reduces the accuracy gap to full-precision models by 50.5%, 42.9%, and 29.2% compared to QuaRot, SpinQuant, and OSTQuant, respectively.

Conclusion: BASE-Q is a simple yet effective solution for LLM quantization, addressing key limitations and improving performance.

Abstract: Rotations have become essential to state-of-the-art quantization pipelines
for large language models (LLMs) by effectively smoothing outliers in weights
and activations. However, further optimizing the rotation parameters offers
only limited performance gains and introduces significant training overhead:
due to rotation parameter sharing, full-model must be loaded simultaneously to
enable backpropagation, resulting in substantial memory consumption and limited
practical utility. In this work, we identify two fundamental limitations of
current rotational quantization methods: (i) rotation fails to align channel
means, resulting in wider quantization bounds and increased rounding errors;
and (ii) rotation makes the activation distribution more Gaussian-like,
increasing energy loss caused by clipping errors. To address these issues, we
introduce \textbf{BASE-Q}, a simple yet powerful approach that combines bias
correction and asymmetric scaling to effectively reduce rounding and clipping
errors. Furthermore, BASE-Q enables blockwise optimization, eliminating the
need for memory-intensive full-model backpropagation. Extensive experiments on
various LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of BASE-Q, narrowing
the accuracy gap to full-precision models by 50.5\%, 42.9\%, and 29.2\%
compared to QuaRot, SpinQuant, and OSTQuant, respectively. The code will be
released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of synthetic data in LLM training raises concerns about model collapse, which is underexplored in network-level settings.

Method: The authors propose LWD, simulating the Internet with a RAG database to analyze model output convergence, supported by theoretical analogies to Gaussian Mixture Models.

Result: The framework efficiently investigates model collapse and demonstrates convergence patterns in model outputs.

Conclusion: LWD offers a novel approach to understanding and mitigating model collapse in LLMs at a network scale.

Abstract: The increasing use of synthetic data from the public Internet has enhanced
data usage efficiency in large language model (LLM) training. However, the
potential threat of model collapse remains insufficiently explored. Existing
studies primarily examine model collapse in a single model setting or rely
solely on statistical surrogates. In this work, we introduce LLM Web Dynamics
(LWD), an efficient framework for investigating model collapse at the network
level. By simulating the Internet with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
database, we analyze the convergence pattern of model outputs. Furthermore, we
provide theoretical guarantees for this convergence by drawing an analogy to
interacting Gaussian Mixture Models.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes whether latent action models (LAMs) capture controllable changes or noise in videos, using a tractable linear model to derive insights and validate strategies like data augmentation and cleaning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the concern of whether LAMs learn action-relevant changes or irrelevant noise from unlabeled videos.

Method: A tractable linear model is used to study LAM learning, connecting it to PCA and evaluating strategies like data augmentation and auxiliary action-prediction.

Result: Insights include connections to PCA, policy desiderata, and validation of strategies to enhance learning controllable changes. Numerical simulations illustrate the impact of observation, action, and noise structures.

Conclusion: The study provides analytical insights into LAM learning, highlighting effective strategies to focus on action-relevant changes and mitigate noise.

Abstract: Latent action models (LAMs) aim to learn action-relevant changes from
unlabeled videos by compressing changes between frames as latents. However,
differences between video frames can be caused by controllable changes as well
as exogenous noise, leading to an important concern -- do latents capture the
changes caused by actions or irrelevant noise? This paper studies this issue
analytically, presenting a linear model that encapsulates the essence of LAM
learning, while being tractable.This provides several insights, including
connections between LAM and principal component analysis (PCA), desiderata of
the data-generating policy, and justification of strategies to encourage
learning controllable changes using data augmentation, data cleaning, and
auxiliary action-prediction. We also provide illustrative results based on
numerical simulation, shedding light on the specific structure of observations,
actions, and noise in data that influence LAM learning.

TL;DR: MLE-STAR is a novel approach for building LLM-based agents in machine learning engineering, leveraging external knowledge and iterative refinement to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based agents for MLE rely too much on inherent LLM knowledge and coarse exploration, limiting their effectiveness in model selection and deep component exploration.

Method: MLE-STAR uses a search engine to retrieve effective models, forms an initial solution, and iteratively refines it by exploring specific ML components, guided by ablation studies. It also introduces a novel ensembling method.

Result: MLE-STAR achieves medals in 44% of Kaggle competitions on MLE-bench, significantly outperforming alternatives.

Conclusion: MLE-STAR addresses limitations of existing approaches by combining external knowledge retrieval with targeted exploration and ensembling, leading to superior performance.

Abstract: Agents based on large language models (LLMs) for machine learning engineering
(MLE) can automatically implement ML models via code generation. However,
existing approaches to build such agents often rely heavily on inherent LLM
knowledge and employ coarse exploration strategies that modify the entire code
structure at once. This limits their ability to select effective task-specific
models and perform deep exploration within specific components, such as
experimenting extensively with feature engineering options. To overcome these,
we propose MLE-STAR, a novel approach to build MLE agents. MLE-STAR first
leverages external knowledge by using a search engine to retrieve effective
models from the web, forming an initial solution, then iteratively refines it
by exploring various strategies targeting specific ML components. This
exploration is guided by ablation studies analyzing the impact of individual
code blocks. Furthermore, we introduce a novel ensembling method using an
effective strategy suggested by MLE-STAR. Our experimental results show that
MLE-STAR achieves medals in 44% of the Kaggle competitions on the MLE-bench,

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning-based safety filters outperform conventional methods but lack formal safety guarantees.

Method: Extends verifiable self-consistency for Q value functions, proposes a multiplicative Q-network, and develops a verification pipeline.

Result: Successfully synthesizes formally verified, model-free safety certificates in four benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach provides formally verified safety guarantees for learning-based safety filters.

Abstract: Recent learning-based safety filters have outperformed conventional methods,
such as hand-crafted Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), by effectively adapting
to complex constraints. However, these learning-based approaches lack formal
safety guarantees. In this work, we introduce a verifiable model-free safety
filter based on Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis. Our primary
contributions include: 1) extending verifiable self-consistency properties for
Q value functions, 2) proposing a multiplicative Q-network structure to
mitigate zero-sublevel-set shrinkage issues, and 3) developing a verification
pipeline capable of soundly verifying these self-consistency properties. Our
proposed approach successfully synthesizes formally verified, model-free safety
certificates across four standard safe-control benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework combining kernel PCA, MLP, and MIGA for disease classification achieves high accuracy (up to 100%) and reduces tuning time by 60%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve disease classification accuracy and efficiency by integrating nonlinear feature extraction, MLP, and parallel optimization.

Method: Uses kernel PCA for dimensionality reduction, MLP for classification, and MIGA for parallel hyperparameter optimization.

Result: Achieved 99.12% (breast cancer), 94.87% (Parkinson's), and 100% (CKD) accuracy, outperforming other methods.

Conclusion: The MIGA-optimized MLP with kernel PCA is highly effective for disease classification, offering superior accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: This study introduces a framework that integrates nonlinear feature
extraction, classification, and efficient optimization. First, kernel principal
component analysis with a radial basis function kernel reduces dimensionality
while preserving 95% of the variance. Second, a multilayer perceptron (MLP)
learns to predict disease status. Finally, a modified multiprocessing genetic
algorithm (MIGA) optimizes MLP hyperparameters in parallel over ten
generations. We evaluated this approach on three datasets: the Wisconsin
Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset, the Parkinson's Telemonitoring dataset, and
the chronic kidney disease dataset. The MLP tuned by the MIGA achieved the best
accuracy of 99.12% for breast cancer, 94.87% for Parkinson's disease, and 100%
for chronic kidney disease. These results outperform those of other methods,
such as grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. Compared with a
standard genetic algorithm, kernel PCA revealed nonlinear relationships that
improved classification, and the MIGA's parallel fitness evaluations reduced
the tuning time by approximately 60%. The genetic algorithm incurs high
computational cost from sequential fitness evaluations, but our multiprocessing
interface GA (MIGA) parallelizes this step, slashing the tuning time and
steering the MLP toward the best accuracy score of 99.12%, 94.87%, and 100% for
breast cancer, Parkinson's disease, and CKD, respectively.

TL;DR: SimuGen is a multimodal framework that generates accurate Simulink simulation code by combining visual diagrams and domain knowledge, addressing LLMs' limitations in this domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with Simulink model generation due to lack of domain-specific pretraining data, necessitating a specialized solution.

Method: SimuGen uses a collaborative, agent-based approach with specialized roles (investigator, code generator, etc.) and a domain knowledge base.

Result: The framework produces interpretable, robust, and reproducible Simulink simulation code.

Conclusion: SimuGen effectively bridges the gap in LLM capabilities for Simulink model generation, with publicly available code.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive
performance in mathematical reasoning and code generation. However, LLMs still
struggle in the simulation domain, particularly in generating Simulink models,
which are essential tools in engineering and scientific research. Our
preliminary experiments indicate that LLM agents often fail to produce reliable
and complete Simulink simulation code from text-only inputs, likely due to the
lack of Simulink-specific data in their pretraining. To address this challenge,
we propose SimuGen, a multimodal agent-based framework that automatically
generates accurate Simulink simulation code by leveraging both the visual
Simulink diagram and domain knowledge. SimuGen coordinates several specialized
agents, including an investigator, unit test reviewer, code generator,
executor, debug locator, and report writer, supported by a domain-specific
knowledge base. This collaborative and modular design enables interpretable,
robust, and reproducible Simulink simulation generation. Our source code is

Result: Evaluated on five public cancer datasets, the method outperforms existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The CoC framework effectively integrates multiple modalities for survival prediction, demonstrating superior results and potential for clinical application.

Abstract: Survival prediction aims to evaluate the risk level of cancer patients.
Existing methods primarily rely on pathology and genomics data, either
individually or in combination. From the perspective of cancer pathogenesis,
epigenetic changes, such as methylation data, could also be crucial for this
task. Furthermore, no previous endeavors have utilized textual descriptions to
guide the prediction. To this end, we are the first to explore the use of four
modalities, including three clinical modalities and language, for conducting
survival prediction. In detail, we are motivated by the Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
to propose the Chain-of-Cancer (CoC) framework, focusing on intra-learning and
inter-learning. We encode the clinical data as the raw features, which remain
domain-specific knowledge for intra-learning. In terms of inter-learning, we
use language to prompt the raw features and introduce an Autoregressive Mutual
Traction module for synergistic representation. This tailored framework
facilitates joint learning among multiple modalities. Our approach is evaluated
across five public cancer datasets, and extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of our methods and proposed designs, leading to producing \sota
results. Codes will be released.

*Yunhak Oh,Junseok Lee,Yeongmin Kim,Sangwoo Seo,Namkyeong Lee,Chanyoung Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Spotscape introduces a Similarity Telescope module and similarity scaling strategy to improve spatial domain identification in SRT by capturing global relationships and regulating spot distances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based methods for SRT fail to provide meaningful spot representations, especially near boundaries, due to overemphasis on adjacent spots with minimal feature differences.

Method: Spotscape uses a Similarity Telescope module to capture global spot relationships and a similarity scaling strategy for multi-slice integration.

Result: Spotscape outperforms existing methods in single-slice and multi-slice downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Spotscape offers a superior framework for SRT by addressing limitations of current graph-based approaches.

Abstract: Spatially Resolved Transcriptomics (SRT) is a cutting-edge technique that
captures the spatial context of cells within tissues, enabling the study of
complex biological networks. Recent graph-based methods leverage both gene
expression and spatial information to identify relevant spatial domains.
However, these approaches fall short in obtaining meaningful spot
representations, especially for spots near spatial domain boundaries, as they
heavily emphasize adjacent spots that have minimal feature differences from an
anchor node. To address this, we propose Spotscape, a novel framework that
introduces the Similarity Telescope module to capture global relationships
between multiple spots. Additionally, we propose a similarity scaling strategy
to regulate the distances between intra- and inter-slice spots, facilitating
effective multi-slice integration. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of Spotscape in various downstream tasks, including single-slice
and multi-slice scenarios. Our code is available at the following link: https:

### [251] [BLUR: A Benchmark for LLM Unlearning Robust to Forget-Retain Overlap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15699)
*Shengyuan Hu,Neil Kale,Pratiksha Thaker,Yiwei Fu,Steven Wu,Virginia Smith*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces $	exttt{BLUR}$, a benchmark for LLM unlearning, addressing flaws in current benchmarks by providing realistic forget-retain overlap scenarios. It shows existing methods perform poorly on $	exttt{BLUR}$, emphasizing the need for robust evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM unlearning benchmarks have disparate forget and retain sets, misleadingly portraying unlearning effectiveness and leaving models vulnerable to attacks like relearning.

Method: The authors develop $	exttt{BLUR}$, a benchmark with extended evaluation tasks, combined forget/retain queries, and relearning datasets of varying difficulty.

Result: Existing unlearning methods perform poorly on $	exttt{BLUR}$, with simpler approaches outperforming recent ones, revealing vulnerabilities in current benchmarks.

Conclusion: $	exttt{BLUR}$ highlights the need for robust evaluation in LLM unlearning and suggests future research directions. The benchmark is publicly available.

Abstract: Machine unlearning has the potential to improve the safety of large language
models (LLMs) by removing sensitive or harmful information post hoc. A key
challenge in unlearning involves balancing between forget quality (effectively
unlearning undesirable information) and retain quality (maintaining good
performance on other, general tasks). Unfortunately, as we show, current LLM
unlearning benchmarks contain highly disparate forget and retain sets --
painting a false picture of the effectiveness of LLM unlearning methods. This
can be particularly problematic because it opens the door for benign
perturbations, such as relearning attacks, to easily reveal supposedly
unlearned knowledge once models are deployed. To address this, we present
$\texttt{BLUR}$: a benchmark for LLM unlearning that provides more realistic
scenarios of forget-retain overlap. $\texttt{BLUR}$ significantly expands on
existing unlearning benchmarks by providing extended evaluation tasks, combined
forget/retain queries, and relearning datasets of varying degrees of
difficulty. Despite the benign nature of the queries considered, we find that
the performance of existing methods drops significantly when evaluated on
$\texttt{BLUR}$, with simple approaches performing better on average than more
recent methods. These results highlight the importance of robust evaluation and
suggest several important directions of future study. Our benchmark is publicly
available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/forgelab/BLUR

*Minjae Cho,Hiroyasu Tsukamoto,Huy Trong Tran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper integrates Control Contraction Metrics (CCMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance optimality and scalability in control policies under unknown dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CCMs alone lack trajectory optimality and require known dynamics, limiting scalability. Combining CCMs with RL addresses these issues.

Method: Proposes Contraction Actor-Critic (CAC), which learns a contraction metric generator and an optimal tracking policy using RL.

Result: CAC improves CCMs by providing contracting policies with long-term optimality, validated in simulations and real-world robot experiments.

Conclusion: Integrating CCMs with RL enhances control policy performance, offering a scalable and automated solution for complex systems.

Abstract: Control contraction metrics (CCMs) provide a framework to co-synthesize a
controller and a corresponding contraction metric -- a positive-definite
Riemannian metric under which a closed-loop system is guaranteed to be
incrementally exponentially stable. However, the synthesized controller only
ensures that all the trajectories of the system converge to one single
trajectory and, as such, does not impose any notion of optimality across an
entire trajectory. Furthermore, constructing CCMs requires a known dynamics
model and non-trivial effort in solving an infinite-dimensional convex
feasibility problem, which limits its scalability to complex systems featuring
high dimensionality with uncertainty. To address these issues, we propose to
integrate CCMs into reinforcement learning (RL), where CCMs provide
dynamics-informed feedback for learning control policies that minimize
cumulative tracking error under unknown dynamics. We show that our algorithm,
called contraction actor-critic (CAC), formally enhances the capability of CCMs
to provide a set of contracting policies with the long-term optimality of RL in
a fully automated setting. Given a pre-trained dynamics model, CAC
simultaneously learns a contraction metric generator (CMG) -- which generates a
contraction metric -- and uses an actor-critic algorithm to learn an optimal
tracking policy guided by that metric. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
algorithm relative to established baselines through extensive empirical
studies, including simulated and real-world robot experiments, and provide a
theoretical rationale for incorporating contraction theory into RL.

TL;DR: Compiler-R1 is an RL-driven framework enhancing LLMs for compiler auto-tuning, featuring a high-quality dataset and a two-stage RL pipeline, achieving 8.46% IR instruction reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of high-quality reasoning datasets and limited interactions in LLM-driven compiler tuning.

Method: Introduces Compiler-R1 with a curated dataset and a two-stage RL training pipeline for efficient exploration and learning.

Result: Achieves an average 8.46% reduction in IR instruction count compared to opt -Oz across seven datasets.

Conclusion: Compiler-R1 demonstrates the strong potential of RL-trained LLMs in compiler optimization, with publicly available code and datasets.

Abstract: Compiler auto-tuning optimizes pass sequences to improve performance metrics
such as Intermediate Representation (IR) instruction count. Although recent
advances leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in
automating compiler tuning, two significant challenges still remain: the
absence of high-quality reasoning datasets for agents training, and limited
effective interactions with the compilation environment. In this work, we
introduce Compiler-R1, the first reinforcement learning (RL)-driven framework
specifically augmenting LLM capabilities for compiler auto-tuning. Compiler-R1
features a curated, high-quality reasoning dataset and a novel two-stage
end-to-end RL training pipeline, enabling efficient environment exploration and
learning through an outcome-based reward. Extensive experiments across seven
datasets demonstrate Compiler-R1 achieving an average 8.46% IR instruction
count reduction compared to opt -Oz, showcasing the strong potential of
RL-trained LLMs for compiler optimization. Our code and datasets are publicly

*Peter Belcak,Greg Heinrich,Jan Kautz,Pavlo Molchanov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Minifinetuning (MFT) reduces overfitting-induced performance loss in low-data domain adaptation without pre-training data, outperforming standard finetuning and parameter-efficient methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the deterioration of general performance in language models during domain adaptation, especially in low-data settings.

Method: Introduces MFT, using corrective self-distillation at the sample level to mitigate overfitting and degeneralization.

Result: MFT shows 2-10x better specialization-to-degeneralization ratios and works with as few as 500 samples.

Conclusion: MFT is robust, composable with other methods, and effective for domain adaptation in low-data scenarios.

Abstract: Finetuning language models for a new domain inevitably leads to the
deterioration of their general performance. This becomes more pronounced the
more limited the finetuning data resource.
  We introduce minifinetuning (MFT), a method for language model domain
adaptation that considerably reduces the effects of overfitting-induced
degeneralization in low-data settings and which does so in the absence of any
pre-training data for replay. MFT demonstrates 2-10x more favourable
specialization-to-degeneralization ratios than standard finetuning across a
wide range of models and domains and exhibits an intrinsic robustness to
overfitting when data in the new domain is scarce and down to as little as 500
samples.
  Employing corrective self-distillation that is individualized on the sample
level, MFT outperforms parameter-efficient finetuning methods, demonstrates
replay-like degeneralization mitigation properties, and is composable with
either for a combined effect.

*Guoqing Chao,Zhenghao Zhang,Lei Meng,Jie Wen,Dianhui Chu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FIMCFG is a federated incomplete multi-view clustering method using globally fused graph guidance to address missing data and exploit global information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current federated multi-view clustering methods lack global information utilization and ignore missing data issues.

Method: Uses dual-head graph convolutional encoders for global and view-specific feature extraction, fused under a global graph, with pseudo-label supervision.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness and superiority in experiments.

Conclusion: FIMCFG successfully addresses missing data and global information exploitation in federated multi-view clustering.

Abstract: Federated multi-view clustering has been proposed to mine the valuable
information within multi-view data distributed across different devices and has
achieved impressive results while preserving the privacy. Despite great
progress, most federated multi-view clustering methods only used global
pseudo-labels to guide the downstream clustering process and failed to exploit
the global information when extracting features. In addition, missing data
problem in federated multi-view clustering task is less explored. To address
these problems, we propose a novel Federated Incomplete Multi-view Clustering
method with globally Fused Graph guidance (FIMCFG). Specifically, we designed a
dual-head graph convolutional encoder at each client to extract two kinds of
underlying features containing global and view-specific information.
Subsequently, under the guidance of the fused graph, the two underlying
features are fused into high-level features, based on which clustering is
conducted under the supervision of pseudo-labeling. Finally, the high-level
features are uploaded to the server to refine the graph fusion and
pseudo-labeling computation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of FIMCFG. Our code is publicly available at
https://github.com/PaddiHunter/FIMCFG.

### [256] [Learn from the Past: Fast Sparse Indexing for Large Language Model Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15704)
*Feiyu Yao,Qian Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LFPS accelerates sparse indexing in LLMs by leveraging historical attention patterns, achieving significant speedups while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The memory demand for KV caches in LLMs grows with longer contexts, creating bottlenecks in GPU memory and bandwidth. Existing sparse attention methods inefficiently retrieve indices due to independent step processing.

Method: LFPS dynamically constructs sparse indexing candidates using historical attention patterns (vertical and slash patterns) and a positional expansion strategy to predict Top-k indices.

Result: LFPS achieves up to 22.8× speedup over full attention and 9.6× speedup over exact Top-k retrieval, preserving accuracy on benchmarks like LongBench-RULER.

Conclusion: LFPS provides an efficient and practical solution for optimizing long-context LLM decoding.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to support increasingly longer
contexts, the memory demand for key-value (KV) caches during decoding grows
rapidly, becoming a critical bottleneck in both GPU memory capacity and PCIe
bandwidth. Sparse attention mechanisms alleviate this issue by computing
attention weights only for selected key-value pairs. However, their indexing
computation typically requires traversing all key vectors, resulting in
significant computational and data transfer overhead. To reduce the cost of
index retrieval, existing methods often treat each decoding step as an
independent process, failing to exploit the temporal correlations embedded in
historical decoding information. To this end, we propose LFPS(Learn From the
Past for Sparse Indexing), an acceleration method that dynamically constructs
sparse indexing candidates based on historical attention patterns. LFPS
captures two prevalent trends in decoder attention -vertical patterns
(attending to fixed positions) and slash patterns (attending to relative
positions) -and incorporates a positional expansion strategy to effectively
predict the Top-k indices for the current step. We validate LFPS on challenging
long-context benchmarks such as LongBench-RULER, using Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct as
the base model. Experimental results show that LFPS achieves up to 22.8$\times$
speedup over full attention and 9.6$\times$ speedup over exact Top-k retrieval
on an RTX 4090 GPU and a single CPU core of a Xeon Gold 6430, respectively,
while preserving generation accuracy. These results demonstrate that LFPS
offers a practical and efficient solution for decoding optimization in
long-context LLM inference.

*Jittarin Jetwiriyanon,Teo Susnjak,Surangika Ranathunga*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TSFMs (Time Series Foundation Models) show strong zero-shot forecasting for macroeconomic indicators, matching classical models in stable conditions but struggling during rapid shocks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the zero-shot forecasting capabilities of TSFMs for macroeconomic indicators without extensive training or customization.

Method: Applied three TSFMs (Chronos, TimeGPT, Moirai) to univariate forecasting of economic indicators, tested under data-scarce conditions and structural breaks.

Result: TSFMs internalize economic dynamics, handle regime shifts, and provide uncertainty estimates, matching multivariate models but degrading during rapid shocks.

Conclusion: TSFMs are viable for zero-shot macroeconomic forecasting in stable conditions but require caution during rapid shocks.

Abstract: This study investigates zero-shot forecasting capabilities of Time Series
Foundation Models (TSFMs) for macroeconomic indicators. We apply TSFMs to
forecasting economic indicators under univariate conditions, bypassing the need
for train bespoke econometric models using and extensive training datasets. Our
experiments were conducted on a case study dataset, without additional
customisation. We rigorously back-tested three state-of-the-art TSFMs (Chronos,
TimeGPT and Moirai) under data-scarce conditions and structural breaks. Our
results demonstrate that appropriately engineered TSFMs can internalise rich
economic dynamics, accommodate regime shifts, and deliver well-behaved
uncertainty estimates out of the box, while matching state-of-the-art
multivariate models on this domain. Our findings suggest that, without any
fine-tuning, TSFMs can match or exceed classical models during stable economic
conditions. However, they are vulnerable to degradation in performances during
periods of rapid shocks. The findings offer guidance to practitioners on when
zero-shot deployments are viable for macroeconomic monitoring and strategic
planning.

### [258] [MDPO: Multi-Granularity Direct Preference Optimization for Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15706)
*Yunze Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multi-Granularity Direct Preference Optimization (MDPO) to enhance LLMs' mathematical reasoning by optimizing at three granularities, outperforming DPO and variants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of DPO in long-chain mathematical reasoning due to its inability to capture nuanced differences in preferences and align with generation metrics.

Method: Proposes MDPO, optimizing at Solution2Solution, Inference2Inference, and Step2Step granularities, with unified training objectives.

Result: Achieves improvements of 1.7% and 0.9% on GSM8K, and 2.3% and 1.2% on MATH datasets for Qwen2 and Llama3 models.

Conclusion: MDPO effectively enhances LLMs' mathematical reasoning and provides a cost-efficient data construction pipeline.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning presents a significant challenge for Large Language
Models (LLMs) as it requires ensuring the correctness of each reasoning step.
Researchers have been strengthening the mathematical reasoning abilities of
LLMs through supervised fine-tuning, but due to the inability to suppress
incorrect outputs, illusions can easily arise. Recently, Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) has been widely adopted for aligning human intent by using
preference data to prevent LLMs from generating incorrect outputs. However, it
has shown limited benefits in long-chain mathematical reasoning, mainly because
DPO struggles to effectively capture the differences between accepted and
rejected answers from preferences in long-chain data. The inconsistency between
DPO training and LLMs' generation metrics also affects the effectiveness of
suppressing incorrect outputs. We propose the Multi-Granularity Direct
Preference Optimization (MDPO) method, optimizing the mathematical reasoning of
LLMs at three granularities: Solution2Solution, Inference2Inference, and
Step2Step. Solution2Solution focuses on the correctness of entire long-chain
reasoning; Inference2Inference concentrates on logical reasoning between steps;
Step2Step corrects computational errors in steps, enhancing the computational
capabilities of LLMs. Additionally, we unify the training objectives of the
three granularities to align with the generation metrics. We conducted
experiments on the open-source models Qwen2 and Llama3, achieving improvements
of 1.7% and 0.9% on the GSM8K dataset, and 2.3% and 1.2% on the MATH dataset,
outperforming DPO and other DPO variant methods. Furthermore, we also provide a
pipeline for constructing MDPO training data that is simple and does not
require manual annotation costs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TTS improves LLM performance via search-based reasoning paths. DORA optimizes resource allocation for better efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing search methods inefficiently allocate compute resources, favoring reasoning directions with more candidates, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Proposes DORA, a direction-level resource allocation strategy, to decouple direction quality from candidate count for optimal compute use.

Result: DORA outperforms baselines on MATH500, AIME2024, and AIME2025 benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.

Conclusion: DORA provides an optimal TTS strategy for LLMs, enhancing performance and compute efficiency.

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves the performance of Large Language Models
(LLMs) by using additional inference-time computation to explore multiple
reasoning paths through search. Yet how to allocate a fixed rollout budget most
effectively during search remains underexplored, often resulting in inefficient
use of compute at test time. To bridge this gap, we formulate test-time search
as a resource allocation problem and derive the optimal allocation strategy
that maximizes the probability of obtaining a correct solution under a fixed
rollout budget. Within this formulation, we reveal a core limitation of
existing search methods: solution-level allocation tends to favor reasoning
directions with more candidates, leading to theoretically suboptimal and
inefficient use of compute. To address this, we propose Direction-Oriented
Resource Allocation (DORA), a provably optimal method that mitigates this bias
by decoupling direction quality from candidate count and allocating resources
at the direction level. To demonstrate DORA's effectiveness, we conduct
extensive experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks
including MATH500, AIME2024, and AIME2025. The empirical results show that DORA
consistently outperforms strong baselines with comparable computational cost,
achieving state-of-the-art accuracy. We hope our findings contribute to a
broader understanding of optimal TTS for LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CGB is a novel GNN framework that models causal relationships between brain ROIs using transfer entropy and geometric curvature, outperforming existing methods in brain disease classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNNs for brain disease detection often ignore causal relationships between ROIs, which are crucial for understanding signal interactions.

Method: CGB combines causal discovery (transfer entropy), geometric curvature for graph rewiring, and GNNs to model refined brain networks.

Result: CGB achieves higher F1 scores than state-of-the-art methods in brain disease classification tasks.

Conclusion: CGB effectively captures causal relationships and refines brain networks, enhancing disease classification performance.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been developed to model the relationship
between regions of interest (ROIs) in brains and have shown significant
improvement in detecting brain diseases. However, most of these frameworks do
not consider the intrinsic relationship of causality factor between brain ROIs,
which is arguably more essential to observe cause and effect interaction
between signals rather than typical correlation values. We propose a novel
framework called CGB (Causal Graphs for Brains) for brain disease
classification/detection, which models refined brain networks based on the
causal discovery method, transfer entropy, and geometric curvature strategy.
CGB unveils causal relationships between ROIs that bring vital information to
enhance brain disease classification performance. Furthermore, CGB also
performs a graph rewiring through a geometric curvature strategy to refine the
generated causal graph to become more expressive and reduce potential
information bottlenecks when GNNs model it. Our extensive experiments show that
CGB outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classification tasks on brain
disease datasets, as measured by average F1 scores.

*Pedro C. Vieira,Miguel E. P. Silva,Pedro Manuel Pinto Ribeiro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for direct network motif significance-profile (SP) estimation using GNNs, shifting from traditional subgraph frequency counting to multitarget regression for better interpretability and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The application of GNNs to SP prediction is under-explored, with no established benchmarks, prompting the need for a direct SP estimation approach.

Method: The method reformulates SP estimation as multitarget regression, optimizing for interpretability, stability, and scalability on large graphs.

Result: Experiments show 1-WL limited models struggle with precise SP estimation but can generalize to approximate graph generation processes.

Conclusion: Direct SP estimation with GNNs can overcome theoretical limitations of traditional subgraph counting for motif estimation.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a predominant method for graph
representation learning. However, beyond subgraph frequency estimation, their
application to network motif significance-profile (SP) prediction remains
under-explored, with no established benchmarks in the literature. We propose to
address this problem, framing SP estimation as a task independent of subgraph
frequency estimation. Our approach shifts from frequency counting to direct SP
estimation and modulates the problem as multitarget regression. The
reformulation is optimised for interpretability, stability and scalability on
large graphs. We validate our method using a large synthetic dataset and
further test it on real-world graphs. Our experiments reveal that 1-WL limited
models struggle to make precise estimations of SPs. However, they can
generalise to approximate the graph generation processes of networks by
comparing their predicted SP with the ones originating from synthetic
generators. This first study on GNN-based motif estimation also hints at how
using direct SP estimation can help go past the theoretical limitations that
motif estimation faces when performed through subgraph counting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RAST transfers RL-induced probability adjustments from small to large models, enhancing reasoning efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL improves LLMs but is resource-intensive; RAST aims to scale benefits without full computational cost.

Method: Token-level analysis of RL-induced distributions; propose RAST to transfer adjustments from small to large models.

Result: RAST enhances reasoning in base models with lower GPU memory, sometimes outperforming direct RL training.

Conclusion: RAST offers insights into RL-driven reasoning and practical scaling strategies.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful approach for improving the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), as evidenced by recent
successes such as OpenAI's o1 and Deepseek-R1. However, applying RL at scale
remains intimidatingly resource-intensive, requiring multiple model copies and
extensive GPU workloads. On the other hand, while being powerful, recent
studies suggest that RL does not fundamentally endow models with new knowledge;
rather, it primarily reshapes the model's output distribution to activate
reasoning capabilities latent in the base model. Building on this insight, we
hypothesize that the changes in output probabilities induced by RL are largely
model-size invariant, opening the door to a more efficient paradigm: training a
small model with RL and transferring its induced probability shifts to larger
base models. To verify our hypothesis, we conduct a token-level analysis of
decoding trajectories and find high alignment in RL-induced output
distributions across model scales, validating our hypothesis. Motivated by
this, we propose RAST, a simple yet effective method that transfers reasoning
behaviors by injecting RL-induced probability adjustments from a small
RL-trained model into larger models. Experiments across multiple mathematical
reasoning benchmarks show that RAST substantially and consistently enhances the
reasoning capabilities of base models while requiring significantly lower GPU
memory than direct RL training, sometimes even yielding better performance than
the RL-trained counterparts. Our findings offer new insights into the nature of
RL-driven reasoning and practical strategies for scaling its benefits without
incurring its full computational cost. The project page of RAST is available at

### [263] [Shadow defense against gradient inversion attack in federated learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15711)
*Le Jiang,Liyan Ma,Guang Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for targeted noise injection in federated learning to defend against gradient inversion attacks, balancing privacy and model accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy leakage in federated learning, especially in healthcare, poses risks like gradient inversion attacks, which can reconstruct sensitive data from model updates. Existing defenses are indiscriminate, harming model performance or failing to protect privacy.

Method: Uses a shadow model with interpretability to identify sensitive areas in images, enabling sample-specific noise injection for targeted defense.

Result: Achieves significant privacy protection (e.g., 3.73 PSNR discrepancy on ChestXRay) with minimal model performance impact (<1% F1 reduction). Validated across diverse medical datasets.

Conclusion: The framework effectively defends against gradient inversion attacks while preserving model utility, offering a universal solution for sensitive data in federated learning.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative framework for
privacy-preserving distributed training, allowing clients to collaboratively
train a global model without sharing their local data. This is especially
crucial in sensitive fields like healthcare, where protecting patient data is
paramount. However, privacy leakage remains a critical challenge, as the
communication of model updates can be exploited by potential adversaries.
Gradient inversion attacks (GIAs), for instance, allow adversaries to
approximate the gradients used for training and reconstruct training images,
thus stealing patient privacy. Existing defense mechanisms obscure gradients,
yet lack a nuanced understanding of which gradients or types of image
information are most vulnerable to such attacks. These indiscriminate
calibrated perturbations result in either excessive privacy protection
degrading model accuracy, or insufficient one failing to safeguard sensitive
information. Therefore, we introduce a framework that addresses these
challenges by leveraging a shadow model with interpretability for identifying
sensitive areas. This enables a more targeted and sample-specific noise
injection. Specially, our defensive strategy achieves discrepancies of 3.73 in
PSNR and 0.2 in SSIM compared to the circumstance without defense on the
ChestXRay dataset, and 2.78 in PSNR and 0.166 in the EyePACS dataset. Moreover,
it minimizes adverse effects on model performance, with less than 1\% F1
reduction compared to SOTA methods. Our extensive experiments, conducted across
diverse types of medical images, validate the generalization of the proposed
framework. The stable defense improvements for FedAvg are consistently over
1.5\% times in LPIPS and SSIM. It also offers a universal defense against
various GIA types, especially for these sensitive areas in images.

Method: Extends BERT with a time-series-to-token module and point-MSM pretraining task for self-supervised learning on battery data, combined with metadata for classification.

Result: Achieves AUROC of 0.945, outperforming existing methods in representation quality and classification accuracy.

Conclusion: BERT-style pretraining is effective for time-series fault detection in batteries.

Abstract: Accurate fault detection in lithium-ion batteries is essential for the safe
and reliable operation of electric vehicles and energy storage systems.
However, existing methods often struggle to capture complex temporal
dependencies and cannot fully leverage abundant unlabeled data. Although large
language models (LLMs) exhibit strong representation capabilities, their
architectures are not directly suited to the numerical time-series data common
in industrial settings. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
framework that adapts BERT-style pretraining for battery fault detection by
extending the standard BERT architecture with a customized time-series-to-token
representation module and a point-level Masked Signal Modeling (point-MSM)
pretraining task tailored to battery applications. This approach enables
self-supervised learning on sequential current, voltage, and other
charge-discharge cycle data, yielding distributionally robust, context-aware
temporal embeddings. We then concatenate these embeddings with battery metadata
and feed them into a downstream classifier for accurate fault classification.
Experimental results on a large-scale real-world dataset show that models
initialized with our pretrained parameters significantly improve both
representation quality and classification accuracy, achieving an AUROC of 0.945
and substantially outperforming existing approaches. These findings validate
the effectiveness of BERT-style pretraining for time-series fault detection.

*Michael T. M. B. Morris-Thomas,Marius Martens*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A machine learning model predicts floating offshore asset behavior with high accuracy, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods fail in extreme sea states and nonlinear responses, necessitating a better approach.

Method: Supervised machine learning with multivariate regression, combining gradient-boosted ensemble and a custom solver, trained on 1M samples.

Result: Mean prediction errors <5% for mooring parameters and <2.5° for vessel heading, outperforming frequency-domain methods.

Conclusion: The framework is effective for real-time monitoring and decision-making in offshore operations.

Abstract: The real-time prediction of floating offshore asset behavior under stochastic
metocean conditions remains a significant challenge in offshore engineering.
While traditional empirical and frequency-domain methods work well in benign
conditions, they struggle with both extreme sea states and nonlinear responses.
This study presents a supervised machine learning approach using multivariate
regression to predict the nonlinear motion response of a turret-moored vessel
in 400 m water depth. We developed a machine learning workflow combining a
gradient-boosted ensemble method with a custom passive weathervaning solver,
trained on approximately $10^6$ samples spanning 100 features. The model
achieved mean prediction errors of less than 5% for critical mooring parameters
and vessel heading accuracy to within 2.5 degrees across diverse metocean
conditions, significantly outperforming traditional frequency-domain methods.
The framework has been successfully deployed on an operational facility,
demonstrating its efficacy for real-time vessel monitoring and operational
decision-making in offshore environments.

*Andrew Kiruluta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A learnable two-sided short-time Laplace transform (STLT) replaces self-attention in transformers, enabling dynamic adaptation of token relevance and frequency responses with trainable parameters. It achieves competitive performance on tasks like language modeling and translation, scaling to ultra-long sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational bottleneck of self-attention in transformers while maintaining or improving performance, especially for ultra-long sequences.

Method: Introduces a learnable STLT with trainable parameters for decay rates, frequencies, and window bandwidth. Uses fast recursive convolution, FFT-based relevance matrix computation, and adaptive node allocation.

Result: Achieves perplexities and scores comparable to or better than efficient transformers, scaling beyond 100k tokens. Ablations confirm the importance of learnable parameters and adaptive nodes.

Conclusion: The STLT combines interpretability, scalability, and robustness, offering a viable alternative to self-attention for ultra-long-sequence modeling.

Abstract: We propose an innovative, learnable two-sided short-time Laplace transform
(STLT) mechanism to supplant the traditional self attention in
transformer-based LLMs. Our STLT introduces trainable parameters for each
Laplace node, enabling end-to-end learning of decay rates , oscillatory
frequencies, and window bandwidth T. This flexibility allows the model to
dynamically adapt token relevance half lives and frequency responses during
training. By selecting S learnable nodes and leveraging fast recursive
convolution, we achieve an effective complexity of in time and memory. We
further incorporate an efficient FFT-based computation of the relevance matrix
and an adaptive node allocation mechanism to dynamically adjust the number of
active Laplace nodes. Empirical results on language modeling (WikiText\-103,
Project Gutenberg), machine translation (WMT'14 En\-De), and long document
question answering (NarrativeQA) demonstrate that our learnable STLT achieves
perplexities and scores on par with or better than existing efficient
transformers while naturally extending to context lengths exceeding 100k tokens
or more limited only by available hardware. Ablation studies confirm the
importance of learnable parameters and adaptive node allocation. The proposed
approach combines interpretability, through explicit decay and frequency
parameters, with scalability and robustness, offering a pathway towards
ultra-long-sequence language modeling without the computational bottleneck of
self-attention.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeuronSeek-TD replaces symbolic regression with tensor decomposition for stable, fast-converging task-driven neurons, backed by theoretical guarantees and competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by the human brain's task-specific neurons, the paper aims to improve deep learning by optimizing neuron formulations for stability and convergence.

Method: Uses tensor decomposition (TD) instead of symbolic regression (SR) to discover optimal neuron formulations, with theoretical guarantees on function approximation.

Result: NeuronSeek-TD achieves superior stability, faster convergence, and competitive performance against state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The NeuronSeek-TD framework provides a robust, theoretically grounded approach for designing task-driven neurons, validated by empirical results.

Abstract: Drawing inspiration from our human brain that designs different neurons for
different tasks, recent advances in deep learning have explored modifying a
network's neurons to develop so-called task-driven neurons. Prototyping
task-driven neurons (referred to as NeuronSeek) employs symbolic regression
(SR) to discover the optimal neuron formulation and construct a network from
these optimized neurons. Along this direction, this work replaces symbolic
regression with tensor decomposition (TD) to discover optimal neuronal
formulations, offering enhanced stability and faster convergence. Furthermore,
we establish theoretical guarantees that modifying the aggregation functions
with common activation functions can empower a network with a fixed number of
parameters to approximate any continuous function with an arbitrarily small
error, providing a rigorous mathematical foundation for the NeuronSeek
framework. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that our NeuronSeek-TD
framework not only achieves superior stability, but also is competitive
relative to the state-of-the-art models across diverse benchmarks. The code is
available at https://github.com/HanyuPei22/NeuronSeek.

*Angelos Assos,Carmel Baharav,Bailey Flanigan,Ariel Procaccia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an optimization framework for selecting alternates in citizens' assemblies to improve representation by estimating dropout probabilities and minimizing misrepresentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The legitimacy of citizens' assemblies depends on representing the broader population, but dropout of panelists leads to unbalanced composition. Existing methods ignore alternate selection, creating a gap.

Method: The authors introduce a learning-theoretic algorithm that uses historical data to estimate dropout probabilities and selects alternates to minimize expected misrepresentation. Theoretical guarantees on sample complexity and loss are provided.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows the method significantly improves representation and requires fewer alternates compared to current practices.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the issue of unbalanced representation in citizens' assemblies by optimizing alternate selection.

Abstract: An increasingly influential form of deliberative democracy centers on
citizens' assemblies, where randomly selected people discuss policy questions.
The legitimacy of these panels hinges on their representation of the broader
population, but panelists often drop out, leading to an unbalanced composition.
Although participant attrition is mitigated in practice by alternates, their
selection is not taken into account by existing methods. To address this gap,
we introduce an optimization framework for alternate selection. Our algorithmic
approach, which leverages learning-theoretic machinery, estimates dropout
probabilities using historical data and selects alternates to minimize expected
misrepresentation. We establish theoretical guarantees for our approach,
including worst-case bounds on sample complexity (with implications for
computational efficiency) and on loss when panelists' probabilities of dropping
out are mis-estimated. Empirical evaluation using real-world data demonstrates
that, compared to the status quo, our method significantly improves
representation while requiring fewer alternates.

### [269] [daDPO: Distribution-Aware DPO for Distilling Conversational Abilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15717)
*Zhengze Zhang,Shiqi Wang,Yiqun Shen,Simin Guo,Dahua Lin,Xiaoliang Wang,Nguyen Cam-Tu,Fei Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces daDPO, a method to enhance smaller LLMs by leveraging teacher model output distributions, outperforming existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smaller LLMs struggle with conversational abilities, limiting deployment in resource-constrained settings. Current knowledge distillation methods ignore teacher model output distributions.

Method: Proposes daDPO, combining preference optimization and distribution-based distillation, validated theoretically and empirically.

Result: daDPO improves pruned models (e.g., 20% pruned Vicuna1.5-7B achieves near-teacher performance) and smaller models (Qwen2.5-1.5B occasionally outperforms its 7B teacher).

Conclusion: daDPO effectively bridges the performance gap between smaller and larger LLMs, offering a practical solution for resource-limited deployments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across
various applications, but their conversational abilities decline sharply as
model size decreases, presenting a barrier to their deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Knowledge distillation with Direct
Preference Optimization (dDPO) has emerged as a promising approach to enhancing
the conversational abilities of smaller models using a larger teacher model.
However, current methods primarily focus on 'black-box' KD, which only uses the
teacher's responses, overlooking the output distribution offered by the
teacher. This paper addresses this gap by introducing daDPO (Distribution-Aware
DPO), a unified method for preference optimization and distribution-based
distillation. We provide rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical
validation, showing that daDPO outperforms existing methods in restoring
performance for pruned models and enhancing smaller LLM models. Notably, in
in-domain evaluation, our method enables a 20% pruned Vicuna1.5-7B to achieve
near-teacher performance (-7.3% preference rate compared to that of dDPO's
-31%), and allows Qwen2.5-1.5B to occasionally outperform its 7B teacher model
(14.0% win rate).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BuildingBRep-11K is a dataset of 11,978 multi-storey buildings, generated using shape-grammar-driven pipelines, with detailed metadata. It supports AI training for tasks like attribute regression and defect detection, showing learnability but non-trivial challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for large, clean, and richly annotated datasets for AI-driven 3-D building generation, ensuring compliance with architectural standards.

Method: A shape-grammar-driven pipeline generates buildings, incorporating design constraints and multi-stage filters. Two PointNet baselines are trained for multi-attribute regression and defect detection.

Result: The regression model achieved 0.37-storey MAE, 5.7-room MAE, and 3.2 m² MAE on mean area. The defect detection model reached 54% accuracy, with 82% recall for defects.

Conclusion: BuildingBRep-11K is a learnable dataset for AI tasks but presents non-trivial challenges, demonstrating its potential for advancing 3-D building generation research.

Abstract: With the rise of artificial intelligence, the automatic generation of
building-scale 3-D objects has become an active research topic, yet training
such models still demands large, clean and richly annotated datasets. We
introduce BuildingBRep-11K, a collection of 11 978 multi-storey (2-10 floors)
buildings (about 10 GB) produced by a shape-grammar-driven pipeline that
encodes established building-design principles. Every sample consists of a
geometrically exact B-rep solid-covering floors, walls, slabs and rule-based
openings-together with a fast-loading .npy metadata file that records detailed
per-floor parameters. The generator incorporates constraints on spatial scale,
daylight optimisation and interior layout, and the resulting objects pass
multi-stage filters that remove Boolean failures, undersized rooms and extreme
aspect ratios, ensuring compliance with architectural standards. To verify the
dataset's learnability we trained two lightweight PointNet baselines. (i)
Multi-attribute regression. A single encoder predicts storey count, total
rooms, per-storey vector and mean room area from a 4 000-point cloud. On 100
unseen buildings it attains 0.37-storey MAE (87 \% within $\pm1$), 5.7-room
MAE, and 3.2 m$^2$ MAE on mean area. (ii) Defect detection. With the same
backbone we classify GOOD versus DEFECT; on a balanced 100-model set the
network reaches 54 \% accuracy, recalling 82 \% of true defects at 53 \%
precision (41 TP, 9 FN, 37 FP, 13 TN). These pilots show that BuildingBRep-11K
is learnable yet non-trivial for both geometric regression and topological
quality assessment

*Manal Rahal,Bestoun S. Ahmed,Roger Renstrom,Robert Stener,Albrecht Wurtz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel ML-based approach combining predictive modeling and anomaly detection to optimize heat pump (HP) efficiency for household hot water production, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional threshold-based control methods limit HP efficiency for hot water production, and ML applications for household demand forecasting are understudied.

Method: A composite approach using ML (LightGBM, LSTM, Bi-LSTM with self-attention) and isolation forest (iForest) for demand forecasting and anomaly detection, validated on real HP installations.

Result: LightGBM outperformed LSTM variants with RMSE improvements up to 9.37%. iForest achieved an F1-score of 0.87 with a 5.2% false alarm rate.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective for real-world HP deployments, offering superior performance and generalization across household types.

Abstract: Heat pumps (HPs) have emerged as a cost-effective and clean technology for
sustainable energy systems, but their efficiency in producing hot water remains
restricted by conventional threshold-based control methods. Although machine
learning (ML) has been successfully implemented for various HP applications,
optimization of household hot water demand forecasting remains understudied.
This paper addresses this problem by introducing a novel approach that combines
predictive ML with anomaly detection to create adaptive hot water production
strategies based on household-specific consumption patterns. Our key
contributions include: (1) a composite approach combining ML and isolation
forest (iForest) to forecast household demand for hot water and steer
responsive HP operations; (2) multi-step feature selection with advanced
time-series analysis to capture complex usage patterns; (3) application and
tuning of three ML models: Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Bi-directional LSTM with the self-attention
mechanism on data from different types of real HP installations; and (4)
experimental validation on six real household installations. Our experiments
show that the best-performing model LightGBM achieves superior performance,
with RMSE improvements of up to 9.37\% compared to LSTM variants with $R^2$
values between 0.748-0.983. For anomaly detection, our iForest implementation
achieved an F1-score of 0.87 with a false alarm rate of only 5.2\%,
demonstrating strong generalization capabilities across different household
types and consumption patterns, making it suitable for real-world HP
deployments.

*Juntae Lee,Munawar Hayat,Sungrack Yun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel FSCIL method, Tri-WE, to address catastrophic forgetting and overfitting by interpolating model weights and using amplified data distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed feature extractors in FSCIL limit adaptability to new classes, leading to forgetting and overfitting.

Method: Proposes Tri-WE for weight-space ensemble and amplified data knowledge distillation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on miniImageNet, CUB200, and CIFAR100.

Conclusion: The method effectively balances adaptability and stability in few-shot incremental learning.

Abstract: Few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL) enables the continual learning of
new concepts with only a few training examples. In FSCIL, the model undergoes
substantial updates, making it prone to forgetting previous concepts and
overfitting to the limited new examples. Most recent trend is typically to
disentangle the learning of the representation from the classification head of
the model. A well-generalized feature extractor on the base classes (many
examples and many classes) is learned, and then fixed during incremental
learning. Arguing that the fixed feature extractor restricts the model's
adaptability to new classes, we introduce a novel FSCIL method to effectively
address catastrophic forgetting and overfitting issues. Our method enables to
seamlessly update the entire model with a few examples. We mainly propose a
tripartite weight-space ensemble (Tri-WE). Tri-WE interpolates the base,
immediately previous, and current models in weight-space, especially for the
classification heads of the models. Then, it collaboratively maintains
knowledge from the base and previous models. In addition, we recognize the
challenges of distilling generalized representations from the previous model
from scarce data. Hence, we suggest a regularization loss term using amplified
data knowledge distillation. Simply intermixing the few-shot data, we can
produce richer data enabling the distillation of critical knowledge from the
previous model. Consequently, we attain state-of-the-art results on the
miniImageNet, CUB200, and CIFAR100 datasets.

*Junqi Gao,Zhichang Guo,Dazhi Zhang,Dong Li,Runze Liu,Pengfei Li,Kai Tian,Biqing Qi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bohdi is a synthetic-data-only framework for heterogeneous LLM fusion, addressing limitations of existing methods by enabling dynamic domain exploration and adaptive data sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for LLM fusion rely on limited real data and fixed domain allocations, leading to incomplete knowledge transfer and capability imbalance.

Method: Bohdi uses a hierarchical tree for domain exploration, multi-model collaboration for data generation, and a DynaBranches mechanism for adaptive sampling.

Result: Bohdi outperforms baselines, achieves higher data efficiency, and eliminates capability imbalance in target LLMs.

Conclusion: Bohdi provides a robust solution for heterogeneous LLM fusion, enhancing knowledge transfer and adaptability.

Abstract: Heterogeneous Large Language Model (LLM) fusion integrates the strengths of
multiple source LLMs with different architectures into a target LLM with low
computational overhead. While promising, existing methods suffer from two major
limitations: 1) reliance on real data from limited domain for knowledge fusion,
preventing the target LLM from fully acquiring knowledge across diverse
domains, and 2) fixed data allocation proportions across domains, failing to
dynamically adjust according to the target LLM's varying capabilities across
domains, leading to a capability imbalance. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Bohdi, a synthetic-data-only heterogeneous LLM fusion framework.
Through the organization of knowledge domains into a hierarchical tree
structure, Bohdi enables automatic domain exploration and multi-domain data
generation through multi-model collaboration, thereby comprehensively
extracting knowledge from source LLMs. By formalizing domain expansion and data
sampling proportion allocation on the knowledge tree as a Hierarchical
Multi-Armed Bandit problem, Bohdi leverages the designed DynaBranches mechanism
to adaptively adjust sampling proportions based on the target LLM's performance
feedback across domains. Integrated with our proposed Introspection-Rebirth
(IR) mechanism, DynaBranches dynamically tracks capability shifts during target
LLM's updates via Sliding Window Binomial Likelihood Ratio Testing (SWBLRT),
further enhancing its online adaptation capability. Comparative experimental
results on a comprehensive suite of benchmarks demonstrate that Bohdi
significantly outperforms existing baselines on multiple target LLMs, exhibits
higher data efficiency, and virtually eliminates the imbalance in the target
LLM's capabilities. Our code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces UNIMATE, a unified model for mechanical metamaterial design that integrates 3D topology, density condition, and mechanical property, outperforming existing models in multiple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine learning models for mechanical metamaterials often overlook the integration of all three key modalities (3D topology, density condition, mechanical property), creating a gap in comprehensive design capabilities.

Method: UNIMATE combines a modality alignment module and a synergetic diffusion generation module to unify the three modalities.

Result: UNIMATE achieves superior performance in topology generation (80.2% improvement), property prediction (5.1%), and condition confirmation (50.2%) tasks compared to baselines.

Conclusion: UNIMATE bridges the gap in multimodal integration for mechanical metamaterial design and is made publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Metamaterials are artificial materials that are designed to meet unseen
properties in nature, such as ultra-stiffness and negative materials indices.
In mechanical metamaterial design, three key modalities are typically involved,
i.e., 3D topology, density condition, and mechanical property. Real-world
complex application scenarios place the demanding requirements on machine
learning models to consider all three modalities together. However, a
comprehensive literature review indicates that most existing works only
consider two modalities, e.g., predicting mechanical properties given the 3D
topology or generating 3D topology given the required properties. Therefore,
there is still a significant gap for the state-of-the-art machine learning
models capturing the whole. Hence, we propose a unified model named UNIMATE,
which consists of a modality alignment module and a synergetic diffusion
generation module. Experiments indicate that UNIMATE outperforms the other
baseline models in topology generation task, property prediction task, and
condition confirmation task by up to 80.2%, 5.1%, and 50.2%, respectively. We
opensource our proposed UNIMATE model and corresponding results at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MadaKV is a modality-adaptive KV cache eviction strategy for MLLMs, improving efficiency in long-context inference by addressing modality-specific disparities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional KV cache eviction methods are unimodal and fail to capture modality-specific information, leading to suboptimal performance in multimodal scenarios.

Method: MadaKV uses modality preference adaptation and hierarchical compression compensation to dynamically sense and retain critical tokens.

Result: Achieves 1.3 to 1.5 times improvement in KV cache memory footprint and decoding latency while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: MadaKV outperforms existing methods, demonstrating effectiveness in multimodal long-context tasks.

Abstract: This paper introduces MadaKV, a modality-adaptive key-value (KV) cache
eviction strategy designed to enhance the efficiency of multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) in long-context inference. In multimodal scenarios,
attention heads exhibit varying preferences for different modalities, resulting
in significant disparities in modality importance across attention heads.
Traditional KV cache eviction methods, which are tailored for unimodal
settings, fail to capture modality-specific information, thereby yielding
suboptimal performance. MadaKV addresses these challenges through two key
components: modality preference adaptation and hierarchical compression
compensation. By dynamically sensing modality information within attention
heads and adaptively retaining critical tokens, MadaKV achieves substantial
reductions in KV cache memory footprint and model inference decoding latency
(1.3 to 1.5 times improvement) while maintaining high accuracy across various
multimodal long-context tasks. Extensive experiments on representative MLLMs
and the MileBench benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of MadaKV compared to
existing KV cache eviction methods.

TL;DR: GrIDDD is a graph diffusion model that dynamically adjusts molecular size during generation, outperforming existing models in property-driven tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph diffusion models cannot adapt graph size during generation, limiting their effectiveness in conditional tasks like property-driven molecular design.

Method: Reformulates noising/denoising processes to allow monotonic node insertion/deletion, creating the GrIDDD model.

Result: GrIDDD matches/exceeds existing models in property targeting and performs competitively in molecular optimization.

Conclusion: GrIDDD enables size-adaptive molecular generation, advancing graph diffusion applications.

Abstract: Generative models of graphs based on discrete Denoising Diffusion
Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) offer a principled approach to molecular
generation by systematically removing structural noise through iterative atom
and bond adjustments. However, existing formulations are fundamentally limited
by their inability to adapt the graph size (that is, the number of atoms)
during the diffusion process, severely restricting their effectiveness in
conditional generation scenarios such as property-driven molecular design,
where the targeted property often correlates with the molecular size. In this
paper, we reformulate the noising and denoising processes to support monotonic
insertion and deletion of nodes. The resulting model, which we call GrIDDD,
dynamically grows or shrinks the chemical graph during generation. GrIDDD
matches or exceeds the performance of existing graph diffusion models on
molecular property targeting despite being trained on a more difficult problem.
Furthermore, when applied to molecular optimization, GrIDDD exhibits
competitive performance compared to specialized optimization models. This work
paves the way for size-adaptive molecular generation with graph diffusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve molecular property prediction by leveraging low-noise descriptors instead of noisy experimental or biased simulation data.

Method: Pre-trained on Mordred package descriptors using a Directed Message-Passing Neural Network, evaluated on Polaris and MoleculeACE datasets.

Result: Achieves 79% win rate on Polaris and 97% on MoleculeACE, outperforming Random Forest and other models, but struggles with activity cliffs.

Conclusion: Descriptor-based pre-training is promising for scalable molecular prediction, warranting further exploration of descriptor sets and unlabeled data.

Abstract: Fast and accurate prediction of molecular properties with machine learning is
pivotal to scientific advancements across myriad domains. Foundation models in
particular have proven especially effective, enabling accurate training on
small, real-world datasets. This study introduces CheMeleon, a novel molecular
foundation model pre-trained on deterministic molecular descriptors from the
Mordred package, leveraging a Directed Message-Passing Neural Network to
predict these descriptors in a noise-free setting. Unlike conventional
approaches relying on noisy experimental data or biased quantum mechanical
simulations, CheMeleon uses low-noise molecular descriptors to learn rich
molecular representations. Evaluated on 58 benchmark datasets from Polaris and
MoleculeACE, CheMeleon achieves a win rate of 79% on Polaris tasks,
outperforming baselines like Random Forest (46%), fastprop (39%), and Chemprop
(36%), and a 97% win rate on MoleculeACE assays, surpassing Random Forest (63%)
and other foundation models. However, it struggles to distinguish activity
cliffs like many of the tested models. The t-SNE projection of CheMeleon's
learned representations demonstrates effective separation of chemical series,
highlighting its ability to capture structural nuances. These results
underscore the potential of descriptor-based pre-training for scalable and
effective molecular property prediction, opening avenues for further
exploration of descriptor sets and unlabeled datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based methods inadequately model interactions across longitudinal medical encounters, limiting their ability to identify meaningful event groups.

Method: DeepJ combines graph convolutional transformers with differentiable graph pooling to capture intra- and inter-encounter event interactions.

Result: DeepJ outperforms five state-of-the-art baselines, enhancing interpretability and patient risk stratification.

Conclusion: DeepJ effectively addresses limitations of static graph methods, offering improved modeling of temporal and functional event relationships for better patient insights.

Abstract: In recent years, graph learning has gained significant interest for modeling
complex interactions among medical events in structured Electronic Health
Record (EHR) data. However, existing graph-based approaches often work in a
static manner, either restricting interactions within individual encounters or
collapsing all historical encounters into a single snapshot. As a result, when
it is necessary to identify meaningful groups of medical events spanning
longitudinal encounters, existing methods are inadequate in modeling
interactions cross encounters while accounting for temporal dependencies. To
address this limitation, we introduce Deep Patient Journey (DeepJ), a novel
graph convolutional transformer model with differentiable graph pooling to
effectively capture intra-encounter and inter-encounter medical event
interactions. DeepJ can identify groups of temporally and functionally related
medical events, offering valuable insights into key event clusters pertinent to
patient outcome prediction. DeepJ significantly outperformed five
state-of-the-art baseline models while enhancing interpretability,
demonstrating its potential for improved patient risk stratification.

*Luiz Pereira,M. Hadi Amini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes FedWB, a model fusion algorithm using Wasserstein barycenters for distributed DNN training, and extends it to HFRL, demonstrated on the CartPole problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address distributed training and heterogeneous environments in federated learning, ensuring model generalization.

Method: Divide data among agents with identical DNNs, train locally, aggregate weights using Wasserstein barycenters (FedWB), and apply to HFRL with DQNs in varied CartPole environments.

Result: FedWB successfully trains a global DNN and DQN, generalizing across heterogeneous settings.

Conclusion: FedWB is effective for distributed and heterogeneous federated learning, validated by CartPole experiments.

Abstract: In this paper, we first propose a novel algorithm for model fusion that
leverages Wasserstein barycenters in training a global Deep Neural Network
(DNN) in a distributed architecture. To this end, we divide the dataset into
equal parts that are fed to "agents" who have identical deep neural networks
and train only over the dataset fed to them (known as the local dataset). After
some training iterations, we perform an aggregation step where we combine the
weight parameters of all neural networks using Wasserstein barycenters. These
steps form the proposed algorithm referred to as FedWB. Moreover, we leverage
the processes created in the first part of the paper to develop an algorithm to
tackle Heterogeneous Federated Reinforcement Learning (HFRL). Our test
experiment is the CartPole toy problem, where we vary the lengths of the poles
to create heterogeneous environments. We train a deep Q-Network (DQN) in each
environment to learn to control each cart, while occasionally performing a
global aggregation step to generalize the local models; the end outcome is a
global DQN that functions across all environments.

*Kevin Yin,Julia Gersey,Pei Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A model using XGBoost for in-field calibration of low-cost air quality sensors to improve accuracy and coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-cost sensors limit spatial coverage; low-cost sensors suffer from drift and variability.

Method: XGBoost ensemble learning to consolidate data from neighboring sensors.

Result: Reduced dependence on individual sensor accuracy and better generalization across locations.

Conclusion: The proposed model enhances large-scale air quality monitoring by addressing cost and accuracy trade-offs.

Abstract: Effective large-scale air quality monitoring necessitates distributed sensing
due to the pervasive and harmful nature of particulate matter (PM),
particularly in urban environments. However, precision comes at a cost: highly
accurate sensors are expensive, limiting the spatial deployments and thus their
coverage. As a result, low-cost sensors have become popular, though they are
prone to drift caused by environmental sensitivity and manufacturing
variability. This paper presents a model for in-field sensor calibration using
XGBoost ensemble learning to consolidate data from neighboring sensors. This
approach reduces dependence on the presumed accuracy of individual sensors and
improves generalization across different locations.

TL;DR: The paper explores the misalignment between neural network (NN) uncertainty estimates and human perceptual uncertainty, finding weak correlation. It suggests using human-derived soft labels to improve calibration without losing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NNs often produce overconfident predictions, lacking reliable uncertainty estimates, which is problematic for critical applications. The study aims to compare NN uncertainty with human uncertainty.

Method: The research uses three vision benchmarks annotated with human disagreement and crowdsourced confidence to analyze correlations between model-predicted and human-perceived uncertainty.

Result: Current methods weakly align with human intuition, with task-dependent variability. Incorporating human-derived soft labels improves calibration while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: There's a gap between model and human uncertainty, but leveraging human insights can enhance AI trustworthiness.

Abstract: Modern neural networks (NNs) often achieve high predictive accuracy but
remain poorly calibrated, producing overconfident predictions even when wrong.
This miscalibration poses serious challenges in applications where reliable
uncertainty estimates are critical. In this work, we investigate how human
perceptual uncertainty compares to uncertainty estimated by NNs. Using three
vision benchmarks annotated with both human disagreement and crowdsourced
confidence, we assess the correlation between model-predicted uncertainty and
human-perceived uncertainty. Our results show that current methods only weakly
align with human intuition, with correlations varying significantly across
tasks and uncertainty metrics. Notably, we find that incorporating
human-derived soft labels into the training process can improve calibration
without compromising accuracy. These findings reveal a persistent gap between
model and human uncertainty and highlight the potential of leveraging human
insights to guide the development of more trustworthy AI systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Boundary-enforced Rectified Flow Model (Boundary RF Model) improves generative modeling by enforcing boundary conditions, outperforming the vanilla RF model in FID scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The vanilla RF model's unconstrained velocity field often fails to meet boundary conditions, causing inaccuracies in ODE-based sampling.

Method: Proposes Boundary RF Model, enforcing boundary conditions with minimal code changes.

Result: Achieves 8.01% FID improvement with ODE sampling and 8.98% with SDE sampling on ImageNet.

Conclusion: Boundary RF Model effectively addresses boundary condition issues, enhancing generative modeling performance.

Abstract: Rectified Flow offers a simple and effective approach to high-quality
generative modeling by learning a velocity field. However, we identify a
limitation in directly modeling the velocity with an unconstrained neural
network: the learned velocity often fails to satisfy certain boundary
conditions, leading to inaccurate velocity field estimations that deviate from
the desired ODE. This issue is particularly critical during stochastic sampling
at inference, as the score function's errors are amplified near the boundary.
To mitigate this, we propose a Boundary-enforced Rectified Flow Model (Boundary
RF Model), in which we enforce boundary conditions with a minimal code
modification. Boundary RF Model improves performance over vanilla RF model,
demonstrating 8.01% improvement in FID score on ImageNet using ODE sampling and
8.98% improvement using SDE sampling.

TL;DR: POLCA identifies hidden conceptual breakthroughs in training by decomposing loss changes along low-rank subspaces, revealing interpretable clusters of data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Loss curves often obscure frequent conceptual breakthroughs due to scalar aggregation; POLCA aims to uncover these hidden transitions for better understanding of learning dynamics.

Method: POLCA decomposes loss changes along arbitrary bases of the low-rank training subspace to identify clusters of samples with similar loss dynamics.

Result: POLCA successfully recovers interpretable clusters representing breakthroughs in synthetic arithmetic and natural language tasks.

Conclusion: POLCA offers a promising tool for unsupervised interpretability by revealing hidden phase transitions in model training.

Abstract: Loss curves are smooth during most of model training, so visible
discontinuities stand out as possible conceptual breakthroughs. Studying these
breakthroughs enables a deeper understanding of learning dynamics, but only
when they are properly identified. This paper argues that similar breakthroughs
occur frequently throughout training but they are obscured by a loss metric
that collapses all variation into a single scalar. To find these hidden
transitions, we introduce POLCA, a method for decomposing changes in loss along
arbitrary bases of the low-rank training subspace. We use our method to
identify clusters of samples that share similar changes in loss during
training, disaggregating the overall loss into that of smaller groups of
conceptually similar data. We validate our method on synthetic arithmetic and
natural language tasks, showing that POLCA recovers clusters that represent
interpretable breakthroughs in the model's capabilities. We demonstrate the
promise of these hidden phase transitions as a tool for unsupervised
interpretability.

Result: Identified significant salary and job role factors, and distinct job clusters, though based on synthetic data.

Conclusion: The methodology offers a transferable framework for job market analysis, despite synthetic data limitations.

Abstract: This paper presents a machine learning methodology prototype using a large

the key features influencing job market dynamics and provide valuable insights
for job seekers, employers, and researchers. Exploratory data analysis was
conducted to understand the dataset's characteristics. Subsequently, regression
models were developed to predict salaries, classification models to predict job
titles, and clustering techniques were applied to group similar jobs. The
analyses revealed significant factors influencing salary and job roles, and
identified distinct job clusters based on the provided data. While the results
are based on synthetic data and not intended for real-world deployment, the
methodology demonstrates a transferable framework for job market analysis.

TL;DR: SHRED models, enhanced with transformers (T-SHRED) and SINDy attention, improve forecasting from sparse sensor data by combining RNNs and MLPs for efficient, interpretable predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the performance and interpretability of SHRED models for chaotic dynamical systems forecasting from sparse sensor data.

Method: Introduces T-SHRED with transformers for temporal encoding and SINDy attention for symbolic regression in the latent space.

Result: T-SHRED with SINDy attention accurately predicts future states and provides interpretable symbolic models across various datasets.

Conclusion: The improved SHRED model (T-SHRED) with SINDy attention offers efficient, interpretable forecasting for dynamical systems.

Abstract: SHallow REcurrent Decoders (SHRED) are effective for system identification
and forecasting from sparse sensor measurements. Such models are light-weight
and computationally efficient, allowing them to be trained on consumer laptops.
SHRED-based models rely on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and a simple
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for the temporal encoding and spatial decoding
respectively. Despite the relatively simple structure of SHRED, they are able
to predict chaotic dynamical systems on different physical, spatial, and
temporal scales directly from a sparse set of sensor measurements. In this
work, we improve SHRED by leveraging transformers (T-SHRED) for the temporal
encoding which improves performance on next-step state prediction on large
datasets. We also introduce a sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics
(SINDy) attention mechanism into T-SHRED to perform symbolic regression
directly on the latent space as part of the model regularization architecture.
Symbolic regression improves model interpretability by learning and
regularizing the dynamics of the latent space during training. We analyze the
performance of T-SHRED on three different dynamical systems ranging from
low-data to high-data regimes. We observe that SINDy attention T-SHRED
accurately predicts future frames based on an interpretable symbolic model
across all tested datasets.

*Sheng Liu,Tianlang Chen,Pan Lu,Haotian Ye,Yizheng Chen,Lei Xing,James Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fractional Reasoning is a framework for dynamically adjusting reasoning intensity in LLMs at inference time, improving performance across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods apply uniform reasoning across inputs, ignoring varying problem complexities. Fractional Reasoning addresses this by enabling tailored reasoning.

Method: Extracts a latent steering vector for deeper reasoning and scales it dynamically based on input complexity.

Result: Consistently improves performance on GSM8K, MATH500, and GPQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: Fractional Reasoning offers a flexible, training-free approach to enhance LLM reasoning, outperforming fixed methods.

Abstract: Test-time compute has emerged as a powerful paradigm for improving the
performance of large language models (LLMs), where generating multiple outputs
or refining individual chains can significantly boost answer accuracy. However,
existing methods like Best-of-N, majority voting, and self-reflection typically
apply reasoning in a uniform way across inputs, overlooking the fact that
different problems may require different levels of reasoning depth. In this
work, we propose Fractional Reasoning, a training-free and model-agnostic
framework that enables continuous control over reasoning intensity at inference
time, going beyond the limitations of fixed instructional prompts. Our method
operates by extracting the latent steering vector associated with deeper
reasoning and reapplying it with a tunable scaling factor, allowing the model
to tailor its reasoning process to the complexity of each input. This supports
two key modes of test-time scaling: (1) improving output quality in
breadth-based strategies (e.g., Best-of-N, majority voting), and (2) enhancing
the correctness of individual reasoning chains in depth-based strategies (e.g.,
self-reflection). Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500, and GPQA demonstrate that
Fractional Reasoning consistently improves performance across diverse reasoning
tasks and models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a theoretical framework to study how contrastive examples impact active learners, focusing on sample complexity and revealing a connection to self-directed learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning benefits from contrastive examples (pairs of similar instances with different labels), as they help explain label differences. This paper aims to formalize their impact on active learning.

Method: The study uses a theoretical framework to analyze the effect of contrastive examples on sample complexity, illustrated with geometric concept classes and Boolean functions.

Result: The research reveals a connection between learning from contrastive examples and the classical model of self-directed learning.

Conclusion: Contrastive examples significantly influence sample complexity in active learning, with theoretical ties to self-directed learning.

Abstract: Machine learning can greatly benefit from providing learning algorithms with
pairs of contrastive training examples -- typically pairs of instances that
differ only slightly, yet have different class labels. Intuitively, the
difference in the instances helps explain the difference in the class labels.
This paper proposes a theoretical framework in which the effect of various
types of contrastive examples on active learners is studied formally. The focus
is on the sample complexity of learning concept classes and how it is
influenced by the choice of contrastive examples. We illustrate our results
with geometric concept classes and classes of Boolean functions. Interestingly,
we reveal a connection between learning from contrastive examples and the
classical model of self-directed learning.

*Yu Zhang,Gaoshan Bi,Simon Jeffery,Max Davis,Yang Li,Qing Xue,Po Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A knowledge-guided graph neural network framework is proposed to improve precision soil GHG flux prediction by integrating simulated agricultural data and advanced ML techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of comprehensive agricultural data hinders machine learning applications in GHG flux prediction, necessitating innovative solutions.

Method: The framework combines an agricultural process-based model for data simulation with autoencoder and multi-target multi-graph neural networks to extract features and integrate correlations.

Result: The approach outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and stability for predicting soil GHG fluxes.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses data scarcity and enhances GHG flux prediction, supporting sustainable agriculture.

Abstract: Precision soil greenhouse gas (GHG) flux prediction is essential in
agricultural systems for assessing environmental impacts, developing emission
mitigation strategies and promoting sustainable agriculture. Due to the lack of
advanced sensor and network technologies on majority of farms, there are
challenges in obtaining comprehensive and diverse agricultural data. As a
result, the scarcity of agricultural data seriously obstructs the application
of machine learning approaches in precision soil GHG flux prediction. This
research proposes a knowledge-guided graph neural network framework that
addresses the above challenges by integrating knowledge embedded in an
agricultural process-based model and graph neural network techniques.
Specifically, we utilise the agricultural process-based model to simulate and
generate multi-dimensional agricultural datasets for 47 countries that cover a
wide range of agricultural variables. To extract key agricultural features and
integrate correlations among agricultural features in the prediction process,
we propose a machine learning framework that integrates the autoencoder and
multi-target multi-graph based graph neural networks, which utilises the
autoencoder to selectively extract significant agricultural features from the
agricultural process-based model simulation data and the graph neural network
to integrate correlations among agricultural features for accurately predict
fertilisation-oriented soil GHG fluxes. Comprehensive experiments were
conducted with both the agricultural simulation dataset and real-world
agricultural dataset to evaluate the proposed approach in comparison with
well-known baseline and state-of-the-art regression methods. The results
demonstrate that our proposed approach provides superior accuracy and stability
in fertilisation-oriented soil GHG prediction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TrajDiff is a novel framework for trajectory similarity computation that addresses semantic gaps, noise, and global ranking challenges, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based methods for trajectory similarity computation struggle with semantic gaps between GPS and grid features, noise in trajectories, and lack of global ranking information.

Method: TrajDiff uses a semantic alignment module with cross-attention and adaptive fusion, noise-robust pre-training with DDBM, and ranking-aware regularization.

Result: TrajDiff achieves an average HR@1 gain of 33.38% across three datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: TrajDiff effectively addresses key challenges in trajectory similarity computation and demonstrates superior performance.

Abstract: With the proliferation of location-tracking technologies, massive volumes of
trajectory data are continuously being collected. As a fundamental task in
trajectory data mining, trajectory similarity computation plays a critical role
in a wide range of real-world applications. However, existing learning-based
methods face three challenges: First, they ignore the semantic gap between GPS
and grid features in trajectories, making it difficult to obtain meaningful
trajectory embeddings. Second, the noise inherent in the trajectories, as well
as the noise introduced during grid discretization, obscures the true motion
patterns of the trajectories. Third, existing methods focus solely on
point-wise and pair-wise losses, without utilizing the global ranking
information obtained by sorting all trajectories according to their similarity
to a given trajectory. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a
novel trajectory similarity computation framework, named TrajDiff.
Specifically, the semantic alignment module relies on cross-attention and an
attention score mask mechanism with adaptive fusion, effectively eliminating
semantic discrepancies between data at two scales and generating a unified
representation. Additionally, the DDBM-based Noise-robust Pre-Training
introduces the transfer patterns between any two trajectories into the model
training process, enhancing the model's noise robustness. Finally, the overall
ranking-aware regularization shifts the model's focus from a local to a global
perspective, enabling it to capture the holistic ordering information among
trajectories. Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets show
that TrajDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. In
particular, it achieves an average HR@1 gain of 33.38% across all three
evaluation metrics and datasets.

engineering. A two-step feature selection pipeline-univariate filtering (ANOVA
F-test) and Random Forest-based multivariate ranking-yielded 19 interpretable
features. Seven ML models were trained with stratified 5-fold cross-validation
and SMOTE oversampling. Interpretability was assessed via ablation and
Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) analysis.

Result: Reduces MAE by 24.9%, correctly clusters all real-world design groups, and achieves up to 89% runtime reduction in a partitioning task.

Conclusion: Validates Pieceformer's effectiveness for scalable, unbiased design reuse in modern VLSI systems.

Abstract: Accurate graph similarity is critical for knowledge transfer in VLSI design,

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores accelerating neural speech transcription by sparsifying time-domain signals early in transformer encoders, achieving up to 1.6x speedup with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech signals are highly compressible, and transformer-based models like Whisper can leverage sparsification for faster processing without fine-tuning.

Method: A systematic search over sparsification stages (encoder layers) and compression ratios (sparsity) was conducted using Whisper models.

Result: Optimal solutions sparsify hidden states to 40-60% sparsity early in encoding, yielding 1.6x runtime acceleration with <1% accuracy drop.

Conclusion: Early-stage sparsification in transformer encoders effectively balances speed and accuracy for speech transcription.

Abstract: Transformer-based neural speech processing has achieved state-of-the-art
performance. Since speech audio signals are known to be highly compressible,
here we seek to accelerate neural speech transcription by time-domain signal
sparsification early in the neural encoding stage, taking advantage of the
interpretability of the self-attention mechanism in transformer audio encoders.
With the Whisper family of models, we perform a systematic architecture search
over the joint space of sparsification stage (a certain encoder layer) and
compression ratio (sparsity). We found that the best resulting solutions under
1% accuracy degradation choose to sparsify the hidden state to 40-60% sparsity
at an early encoding stage, and thereby achieve up to 1.6x runtime acceleration
in English speech transcription tasks on Nvidia GPUs without any fine-tuning.

TL;DR: A novel FL framework using Power-Norm Cosine Similarity (PNCS) improves client selection for model aggregation, addressing non-IID data challenges and enhancing convergence speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL approaches often overlook gradient correlations between remote clients, especially problematic in data heterogeneity scenarios.

Result: Experiments with a VGG16 model show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The PNCS-based FL framework effectively addresses non-IID data challenges, improving performance in heterogeneous settings.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for leveraging
diverse datasets from multiple sources while preserving data privacy by
avoiding centralized storage. However, many existing approaches fail to account
for the intricate gradient correlations between remote clients, a limitation
that becomes especially problematic in data heterogeneity scenarios. In this
work, we propose a novel FL framework utilizing Power-Norm Cosine Similarity
(PNCS) to improve client selection for model aggregation. By capturing

### [297] [Competing Bandits in Matching Markets via Super Stability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15926)
*Soumya Basu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper extends bandit learning to two-sided reward uncertainty in matching markets, showing the Extended Gale-Shapley (GS) algorithm outperforms standard GS in achieving stable matchings under incomplete information. It achieves logarithmic pessimal stable regret and adapts to decentralized settings with minimal regret increase. A novel lower bound for binary stable regret is also established.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior research focused on single-sided uncertainty in matching markets. This work addresses the gap by studying two-sided reward uncertainty, aiming to improve stability and regret bounds in such settings.

Method: The paper leverages the concept of 'super-stability' and employs the Extended GS algorithm. It develops a centralized algorithm with logarithmic pessimal stable regret and adapts it to decentralized settings.

Result: The centralized algorithm achieves logarithmic pessimal stable regret, and its decentralized adaptation incurs only a constant regret increase. A novel lower bound for binary stable regret is also derived.

Conclusion: The Extended GS algorithm is superior for stable matching under incomplete information. The work provides theoretical insights into the complexity of stable matching with bandit feedback, highlighting the roles of the admissible gap and super-stable matching.

Abstract: We study bandit learning in matching markets with two-sided reward
uncertainty, extending prior research primarily focused on single-sided
uncertainty. Leveraging the concept of `super-stability' from Irving (1994), we
demonstrate the advantage of the Extended Gale-Shapley (GS) algorithm over the
standard GS algorithm in achieving true stable matchings under incomplete
information. By employing the Extended GS algorithm, our centralized algorithm
attains a logarithmic pessimal stable regret dependent on an instance-dependent
admissible gap parameter. This algorithm is further adapted to a decentralized
setting with a constant regret increase. Finally, we establish a novel
centralized instance-dependent lower bound for binary stable regret,
elucidating the roles of the admissible gap and super-stable matching in
characterizing the complexity of stable matching with bandit feedback.

*Esther Rodriguez,Monica Welfert,Samuel McDowell,Nathan Stromberg,Julian Antolin Camarena,Lalitha Sankar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates why diffusion models perform poorly on long-tailed datasets, identifies overlapping latent representations as the cause, and proposes CORAL, a contrastive regularization method, to improve tail-class generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models struggle with long-tailed data distributions, producing low-quality samples for tail classes. The underlying cause of this degradation is not well understood.

Method: The study analyzes latent representations in diffusion models and introduces CORAL, a contrastive latent alignment framework using supervised contrastive losses to separate class representations.

Result: CORAL significantly enhances the diversity and visual quality of tail-class samples compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed CORAL framework effectively addresses the issue of overlapping latent representations in long-tailed datasets, improving generation quality for tail classes.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive performance in generating
high-quality and diverse synthetic data. However, their success typically
assumes a class-balanced training distribution. In real-world settings,
multi-class data often follow a long-tailed distribution, where standard
diffusion models struggle -- producing low-diversity and lower-quality samples
for tail classes. While this degradation is well-documented, its underlying
cause remains poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the behavior of
diffusion models trained on long-tailed datasets and identify a key issue: the
latent representations (from the bottleneck layer of the U-Net) for tail class
subspaces exhibit significant overlap with those of head classes, leading to
feature borrowing and poor generation quality. Importantly, we show that this
is not merely due to limited data per class, but that the relative class
imbalance significantly contributes to this phenomenon. To address this, we
propose COntrastive Regularization for Aligning Latents (CORAL), a contrastive
latent alignment framework that leverages supervised contrastive losses to
encourage well-separated latent class representations. Experiments demonstrate
that CORAL significantly improves both the diversity and visual quality of
samples generated for tail classes relative to state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Stochastic linear bandits are a fundamental model for sequential decision
making, where an agent selects a vector-valued action and receives a noisy
reward with expected value given by an unknown linear function. Although well
studied in the single-agent setting, many real-world scenarios involve multiple
agents solving heterogeneous bandit problems, each with a different unknown
parameter. Applying single agent algorithms independently ignores cross-agent
similarity and learning opportunities. This paper investigates the optimal
regret achievable in collaborative personalized linear bandits. We provide an
information-theoretic lower bound that characterizes how the number of agents,
the interaction rounds, and the degree of heterogeneity jointly affect regret.
We then propose a new two-stage collaborative algorithm that achieves the
optimal regret. Our analysis models heterogeneity via a hierarchical Bayesian
framework and introduces a novel information-theoretic technique for bounding
regret. Our results offer a complete characterization of when and how
collaboration helps with a optimal regret bound $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{mn})$,
$\tilde{O}(dm^{1-\gamma}\sqrt{n})$, $\tilde{O}(dm\sqrt{n})$ for the number of
rounds $n$ in the range of $(0, \frac{d}{m \sigma^2})$, $[\frac{d}{m^{2\gamma}
\sigma^2}, \frac{d}{\sigma^2}]$ and $(\frac{d}{\sigma^2}, \infty)$
respectively, where $\sigma$ measures the level of heterogeneity, $m$ is the
number of agents, and $\gamma\in[0, 1/2]$ is an absolute constant. In contrast,
agents without collaboration achieve a regret bound $O(dm\sqrt{n})$ at best.

*Vinicius Yuiti Fukase,Heitor Gama,Barbara Bueno,Lucas Libanio,Anna Helena Reali Costa,Artur Jordao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to identify critical learning periods in deep neural network training, optimizing resource use and reducing costs without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing works confirm critical learning periods but lack precise identification methods. This work aims to fill that gap.

Method: A systematic approach using generalization prediction to identify critical phases, halting resource-intensive recipes beyond these periods.

Result: Achieves up to 59.67% faster training, 59.47% lower CO$_2$ emissions, and 60% cost reduction without performance compromise.

Conclusion: Enhances understanding of training dynamics and promotes sustainable, efficient deep learning, especially in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Critical Learning Periods comprehend an important phenomenon involving deep
learning, where early epochs play a decisive role in the success of many
training recipes, such as data augmentation. Existing works confirm the
existence of this phenomenon and provide useful insights. However, the
literature lacks efforts to precisely identify when critical periods occur. In
this work, we fill this gap by introducing a systematic approach for
identifying critical periods during the training of deep neural networks,
focusing on eliminating computationally intensive regularization techniques and
effectively applying mechanisms for reducing computational costs, such as data
pruning. Our method leverages generalization prediction mechanisms to pinpoint
critical phases where training recipes yield maximum benefits to the predictive
ability of models. By halting resource-intensive recipes beyond these periods,
we significantly accelerate the learning phase and achieve reductions in
training time, energy consumption, and CO$_2$ emissions. Experiments on
standard architectures and benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our method.
Specifically, we achieve significant milestones by reducing the training time
of popular architectures by up to 59.67%, leading to a 59.47% decrease in
CO$_2$ emissions and a 60% reduction in financial costs, without compromising
performance. Our work enhances understanding of training dynamics and paves the
way for more sustainable and efficient deep learning practices, particularly in
resource-constrained environments. In the era of the race for foundation
models, we believe our method emerges as a valuable framework. The repository

### [301] [On the Theoretical Understanding of Identifiable Sparse Autoencoders and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15963)
*Jingyi Cui,Qi Zhang,Yifei Wang,Yisen Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies conditions for sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to recover monosemantic features from polysemantic ones and proposes a reweighting strategy to improve identifiability when conditions aren't met.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify under what conditions SAEs can uniquely and accurately recover ground truth monosemantic features from polysemantic ones in large language models.

Method: Theoretical analysis to derive necessary and sufficient conditions for identifiable SAEs, followed by a reweighting strategy to narrow the loss gap between SAE and monosemantic feature reconstruction.

Result: Validated theoretical findings show weighted SAEs improve feature monosemanticity and interpretability.

Conclusion: The study provides theoretical and practical insights for improving SAEs' ability to recover interpretable monosemantic features.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful tool for interpreting
features learned by large language models (LLMs). It aims to recover complex
superposed polysemantic features into interpretable monosemantic ones through
feature reconstruction via sparsely activated neural networks. Despite the wide
applications of SAEs, it remains unclear under what conditions an SAE can fully
recover the ground truth monosemantic features from the superposed polysemantic
ones. In this paper, through theoretical analysis, we for the first time
propose the necessary and sufficient conditions for identifiable SAEs (SAEs
that learn unique and ground truth monosemantic features), including 1) extreme
sparsity of the ground truth feature, 2) sparse activation of SAEs, and 3)
enough hidden dimensions of SAEs. Moreover, when the identifiable conditions
are not fully met, we propose a reweighting strategy to improve the
identifiability. Specifically, following the theoretically suggested weight
selection principle, we prove that the gap between the loss functions of SAE
reconstruction and monosemantic feature reconstruction can be narrowed, so that
the reweighted SAEs have better reconstruction of the ground truth monosemantic
features than the uniformly weighted ones. In experiments, we validate our
theoretical findings and show that our weighted SAE significantly improves
feature monosemanticity and interpretability.

*Haoyue Zhang,Hualei Zhang,Xiaosong Ma,Jie Zhang,Song Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LazyEviction reduces KV cache size by 50% while maintaining accuracy in long reasoning tasks by preserving recurring tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KV cache compression methods struggle with long reasoning tasks, failing to capture Token Importance Recurrence, leading to performance issues.

Method: Proposes LazyEviction, a lagged KV eviction framework with Recurrence Interval Tracking and a Maximum Recurrence Interval-Centric Eviction Policy.

Result: LazyEviction reduces KV cache size by 50% with comparable accuracy on math reasoning datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Preserving recurring tokens is critical for knowledge continuity in multi-step reasoning tasks, as demonstrated by LazyEviction.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit enhanced reasoning capabilities by
employing Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, the extended reasoning sequences
introduce significant GPU memory overhead due to increased key-value (KV) cache
size, particularly in tasks requiring long reasoning sequences, such as
mathematics and programming. Existing KV cache compression methods mitigate
memory bottlenecks but struggle in long reasoning tasks. In this paper, we
analyze attention patterns in reasoning tasks and reveal a Token Importance
Recurrence phenomenon: a large proportion of tokens receive renewed attention
after multiple decoding steps, which is failed to capture by existing works and
may lead to unpredictable eviction on such periodically critical tokens. To
address this, we propose LazyEviction, a lagged KV eviction framework designed
to maintain reasoning performance while reducing KV memory. LazyEviction is an
Observation Window-based Lagged Eviction Mechanism retaining latent recurring
tokens by performing lagged evictions across decoding steps, which contains two
key components: (1) Recurrence Interval Tracking for capturing temporal
variations in token importance, and (2) an Maximum Recurrence Interval-Centric
Eviction Policy that prioritizes eviction based on tokens' recurrence patterns.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that LazyEviction reduces KV cache size by
50% while maintaining comparable accuracy on mathematics reasoning datasets,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our findings highlight the importance
of preserving recurring tokens, which are critical for maintaining knowledge
continuity in multi-step reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoHFormer is a hierarchical autoregressive transformer for time series forecasting, addressing temporal causality, scalability, and multi-scale pattern recognition with innovations like hierarchical modeling, dynamic windowed attention, and adaptive temporal encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in time series forecasting: strict temporal causality, sub-quadratic complexity, and multi-scale pattern recognition.

Method: Uses hierarchical temporal modeling, dynamic windowed attention, and adaptive temporal encoding.

Result: Achieves 10.76X faster training, 6.06X memory reduction vs. PatchTST, with consistent accuracy across long horizons.

Conclusion: AutoHFormer sets new benchmarks for efficient and precise time series modeling.

Abstract: Time series forecasting requires architectures that simultaneously achieve
three competing objectives: (1) strict temporal causality for reliable
predictions, (2) sub-quadratic complexity for practical scalability, and (3)
multi-scale pattern recognition for accurate long-horizon forecasting. We
introduce AutoHFormer, a hierarchical autoregressive transformer that addresses
these challenges through three key innovations: 1) Hierarchical Temporal
Modeling: Our architecture decomposes predictions into segment-level blocks
processed in parallel, followed by intra-segment sequential refinement. This
dual-scale approach maintains temporal coherence while enabling efficient
computation. 2) Dynamic Windowed Attention: The attention mechanism employs
learnable causal windows with exponential decay, reducing complexity while
preserving precise temporal relationships. This design avoids both the
anti-causal violations of standard transformers and the sequential bottlenecks
of RNN hybrids. 3) Adaptive Temporal Encoding: a novel position encoding system
is adopted to capture time patterns at multiple scales. It combines fixed
oscillating patterns for short-term variations with learnable decay rates for
long-term trends. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that AutoHFormer 10.76X
faster training and 6.06X memory reduction compared to PatchTST on PEMS08,
while maintaining consistent accuracy across 96-720 step horizons in most of
cases. These breakthroughs establish new benchmarks for efficient and precise
time series modeling. Implementations of our method and all baselines in
hierarchical autoregressive mechanism are available at

Motivation: Traditional supervised learning struggles with limited labeled neural data, while SSL offers a solution by learning from unlabeled data, making it promising for brain signal analysis.

Method: The paper reviews SSL techniques, brain-specific FMs, their adaptation to tasks, and multimodal SSL frameworks, along with evaluation metrics and datasets.

Result: The survey provides a structured understanding of SSL's application in brain signal analysis and highlights its potential for generalizable models.

Conclusion: The work serves as a roadmap for future research in developing brain foundation models using SSL, addressing current challenges in the field.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs), powered by self-supervised learning (SSL), have
redefined the capabilities of artificial intelligence, demonstrating
exceptional performance in domains like natural language processing and
computer vision. These advances present a transformative opportunity for brain
signal analysis. Unlike traditional supervised learning, which is limited by
the scarcity of labeled neural data, SSL offers a promising solution by
enabling models to learn meaningful representations from unlabeled data. This
is particularly valuable in addressing the unique challenges of brain signals,
including high noise levels, inter-subject variability, and low signal-to-noise
ratios. This survey systematically reviews the emerging field of bridging brain
signals with foundation models through the innovative application of SSL. It
explores key SSL techniques, the development of brain-specific foundation
models, their adaptation to downstream tasks, and the integration of brain
signals with other modalities in multimodal SSL frameworks. The review also
covers commonly used evaluation metrics and benchmark datasets that support
comparative analysis. Finally, it highlights key challenges and outlines future
research directions. This work aims to provide researchers with a structured
understanding of this rapidly evolving field and a roadmap for developing

*Jina Kim,Youjin Jang,Jeongjin Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VRAIL is a bi-level RL framework combining deep learning and reward shaping for interpretable learning, improving stability and interpretability without environment changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance interpretability and stability in reinforcement learning by attributing importance to state features and their interactions.

Method: Uses a two-stage approach: deep learning for value function estimation and RL with potential-based reward transformations. Supports linear or quadratic modeling for feature attribution.

Result: Improves training stability and convergence in Taxi-v3, identifies meaningful subgoals (e.g., passenger possession), and enhances interpretability.

Conclusion: VRAIL is a model-agnostic framework that improves learning and interpretability in RL through reward shaping.

Abstract: We propose VRAIL (Vectorized Reward-based Attribution for Interpretable
Learning), a bi-level framework for value-based reinforcement learning (RL)
that learns interpretable weight representations from state features. VRAIL
consists of two stages: a deep learning (DL) stage that fits an estimated value
function using state features, and an RL stage that uses this to shape learning
via potential-based reward transformations. The estimator is modeled in either
linear or quadratic form, allowing attribution of importance to individual
features and their interactions. Empirical results on the Taxi-v3 environment
demonstrate that VRAIL improves training stability and convergence compared to
standard DQN, without requiring environment modifications. Further analysis
shows that VRAIL uncovers semantically meaningful subgoals, such as passenger
possession, highlighting its ability to produce human-interpretable behavior.
Our findings suggest that VRAIL serves as a general, model-agnostic framework
for reward shaping that enhances both learning and interpretability.

*Zhen Qin,Michael B. Wakin,Zhihui Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified framework for tensor decomposition using Riemannian gradient descent (RGD) on orthonormal factors, achieving linear convergence to ground-truth tensors with polynomial scaling in tensor order.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tensor decompositions reduce parameters for high-order tensors but face nonconvex optimization challenges. The paper aims to provide a scalable and efficient solution.

Method: Leverages canonical tensor forms with orthonormal constraints and applies RGD on the Stiefel manifold. Analyzes convergence under mild loss function conditions.

Result: Proves linear convergence of RGD to ground-truth tensors with polynomial scaling in tensor order, improving upon existing methods.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable and efficient approach for tensor decomposition, with theoretical guarantees for convergence and recovery.

Abstract: Tensor decompositions, which represent an $N$-order tensor using
approximately $N$ factors of much smaller dimensions, can significantly reduce
the number of parameters. This is particularly beneficial for high-order
tensors, as the number of entries in a tensor grows exponentially with the
order. Consequently, they are widely used in signal recovery and data analysis
across domains such as signal processing, machine learning, and quantum
physics. A computationally and memory-efficient approach to these problems is
to optimize directly over the factors using local search algorithms such as
gradient descent, a strategy known as the factorization approach in matrix and
tensor optimization. However, the resulting optimization problems are highly
nonconvex due to the multiplicative interactions between factors, posing
significant challenges for convergence analysis and recovery guarantees.
  In this paper, we present a unified framework for the factorization approach
to solving various tensor decomposition problems. Specifically, by leveraging
the canonical form of tensor decompositions--where most factors are constrained
to be orthonormal to mitigate scaling ambiguity--we apply Riemannian gradient
descent (RGD) to optimize these orthonormal factors on the Stiefel manifold.
Under a mild condition on the loss function, we establish a Riemannian
regularity condition for the factorized objective and prove that RGD converges
to the ground-truth tensor at a linear rate when properly initialized. Notably,
both the initialization requirement and the convergence rate scale polynomially
rather than exponentially with $N$, improving upon existing results for Tucker
and tensor-train format tensors.

Motivation: Traditional text-based chunking in RAG systems struggles with complex document structures, multi-page tables, and contextual dependencies, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: The approach uses LMMs to process PDF documents in batches, preserving cross-batch context and semantic coherence, enabling accurate handling of multi-page tables and visual elements.

Result: The method shows improved chunk quality and downstream RAG performance, with better accuracy and superior preservation of document structure compared to traditional systems.

Conclusion: The vision-guided multimodal chunking approach enhances RAG systems by effectively addressing the limitations of text-based methods.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have revolutionized information
retrieval and question answering, but traditional text-based chunking methods
struggle with complex document structures, multi-page tables, embedded figures,
and contextual dependencies across page boundaries. We present a novel
multimodal document chunking approach that leverages Large Multimodal Models
(LMMs) to process PDF documents in batches while maintaining semantic coherence
and structural integrity. Our method processes documents in configurable page
batches with cross-batch context preservation, enabling accurate handling of
tables spanning multiple pages, embedded visual elements, and procedural
content. We evaluate our approach on a curated dataset of PDF documents with
manually crafted queries, demonstrating improvements in chunk quality and
downstream RAG performance. Our vision-guided approach achieves better accuracy
compared to traditional vanilla RAG systems, with qualitative analysis showing
superior preservation of document structure and semantic coherence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address fragmentation and lack of transparency in ML workflows, hindering reproducibility and adaptability.

Method: Introduces six artifacts (Dataset, Feature, Workflow, Execution, Asset, Controlled Vocabulary) to formalize relationships between data, code, and decisions.

Result: Demonstrated in a clinical ML use case (glaucoma detection), improving reproducibility and decision provenance.

Conclusion: The framework enhances reproducibility and supports iterative exploration in collaborative ML projects.

Abstract: Reproducibility remains a central challenge in machine learning (ML),
especially in collaborative eScience projects where teams iterate over data,
features, and models. Current ML workflows are often dynamic yet fragmented,
relying on informal data sharing, ad hoc scripts, and loosely connected tools.
This fragmentation impedes transparency, reproducibility, and the adaptability
of experiments over time. This paper introduces a data-centric framework for
lifecycle-aware reproducibility, centered around six structured artifacts:
Dataset, Feature, Workflow, Execution, Asset, and Controlled Vocabulary. These
artifacts formalize the relationships between data, code, and decisions,
enabling ML experiments to be versioned, interpretable, and traceable over
time. The approach is demonstrated through a clinical ML use case of glaucoma
detection, illustrating how the system supports iterative exploration, improves
reproducibility, and preserves the provenance of collaborative decisions across

TL;DR: CRIA is a novel EEG representation learning framework that integrates temporal, spectral, and spatial views using cross-attention and masking strategies, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EEG pre-training methods lack the ability to capture complex interactions across multiple views, limiting representation expressiveness and generalization.

Method: CRIA uses variable-length and variable-channel coding, cross-attention for feature fusion, and an attention matrix masking strategy with viewpoint masking pre-training.

Result: CRIA achieves 57.02% balanced accuracy for multi-class event classification and 80.03% for anomaly detection, demonstrating strong generalization.

Conclusion: CRIA effectively addresses the limitations of single-view methods by integrating multi-view EEG data, improving performance and generalization.

Abstract: The difficulty of extracting deep features from EEG data and effectively
integrating information from multiple views presents significant challenges for
developing a generalizable pretraining framework for EEG representation
learning. However, most existing pre-training methods rely solely on the
contextual semantics of a single view, failing to capture the complex and
synergistic interactions among different perspectives, limiting the
expressiveness and generalization of learned representations. To address these
issues, this paper proposes CRIA, an adaptive framework that utilizes
variable-length and variable-channel coding to achieve a unified representation
of EEG data across different datasets. In this work, we define cross-view
information as the integrated representation that emerges from the interaction
among temporal, spectral, and spatial views of EEG signals. The model employs a
cross-attention mechanism to fuse temporal, spectral, and spatial features
effectively, and combines an attention matrix masking strategy based on the
information bottleneck principle with a novel viewpoint masking pre-training
scheme. Experimental results on the Temple University EEG corpus and the
CHB-MIT dataset show that CRIA outperforms existing methods with the same
pre-training conditions, achieving a balanced accuracy of 57.02% for
multi-class event classification and 80.03% for anomaly detection, highlighting
its strong generalization ability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the first interval universal approximation (IUA) theorem for floating-point neural networks, proving their ability to perfectly approximate the direct image map of any rounded target function, unlike the unrealistic real-number assumption in classical UA theorems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap between theoretical neural network approximation theorems (assuming infinite precision) and practical implementations (using finite-precision floating-point numbers), exploring whether the IUA theorem holds in the floating-point setting.

Method: The paper introduces a novel IUA theorem specifically for floating-point neural networks, analyzing their ability to approximate the direct image map of rounded target functions.

Result: The result shows that floating-point neural networks can perfectly capture the direct image map of any rounded target function, with no expressiveness limits. The theorem also reveals material differences from the real-valued setting and implies surprising corollaries, such as provably robust floating-point networks and computational completeness.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the IUA theorem holds in the floating-point setting, demonstrating the expressive power of floating-point neural networks and highlighting fundamental distinctions from the real-valued model.

Abstract: The classical universal approximation (UA) theorem for neural networks
establishes mild conditions under which a feedforward neural network can
approximate a continuous function $f$ with arbitrary accuracy. A recent result
shows that neural networks also enjoy a more general interval universal
approximation (IUA) theorem, in the sense that the abstract interpretation
semantics of the network using the interval domain can approximate the direct
image map of $f$ (i.e., the result of applying $f$ to a set of inputs) with
arbitrary accuracy. These theorems, however, rest on the unrealistic assumption
that the neural network computes over infinitely precise real numbers, whereas
their software implementations in practice compute over finite-precision
floating-point numbers. An open question is whether the IUA theorem still holds
in the floating-point setting.
  This paper introduces the first IUA theorem for floating-point neural
networks that proves their remarkable ability to perfectly capture the direct
image map of any rounded target function $f$, showing no limits exist on their
expressiveness. Our IUA theorem in the floating-point setting exhibits material
differences from the real-valued setting, which reflects the fundamental
distinctions between these two computational models. This theorem also implies
surprising corollaries, which include (i) the existence of provably robust
floating-point neural networks; and (ii) the computational completeness of the
class of straight-line programs that use only floating-point additions and
multiplications for the class of all floating-point programs that halt.

*Kexuan Wang,An Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a lightweight RL-driven deep unfolding network (RLDDU-Net) to improve the WMMSE precoding algorithm for massive MU-MIMO OFDM systems, addressing imperfect CSI and high complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practical deployment of WMMSE precoding in massive MU-MIMO OFDM systems is limited by perfect CSI assumptions and high computational complexity.

Method: Develops a stochastic WMMSE (SWMMSE) algorithm for imperfect CSI, then introduces RLDDU-Net, mapping SWMMSE iterations to network layers with RL for adaptive adjustments.

Result: RLDDU-Net outperforms baselines in ergodic weighted sum-rate (EWSR) under imperfect CSI, with improved computational and convergence efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed RLDDU-Net effectively addresses WMMSE limitations, offering better performance and efficiency in practical scenarios.

Abstract: Weighted Minimum Mean Square Error (WMMSE) precoding is widely recognized for
its near-optimal weighted sum rate performance. However, its practical
deployment in massive multi-user (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems is hindered by the
assumption of perfect channel state information (CSI) and high computational
complexity. To address these issues, we first develop a wideband stochastic
WMMSE (SWMMSE) algorithm that iteratively maximizes the ergodic weighted
sum-rate (EWSR) under imperfect CSI. Building on this, we propose a lightweight
reinforcement learning (RL)-driven deep unfolding (DU) network (RLDDU-Net),
where each SWMMSE iteration is mapped to a network layer. Specifically, its DU
module integrates approximation techniques and leverages beam-domain sparsity
as well as frequency-domain subcarrier correlation, significantly accelerating
convergence and reducing computational overhead. Furthermore, the RL module
adaptively adjusts the network depth and generates compensation matrices to
mitigate approximation errors. Simulation results under imperfect CSI
demonstrate that RLDDU-Net outperforms existing baselines in EWSR performance
while offering superior computational and convergence efficiency.

*Kexuan Wang,An Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel CRL algorithm, CAAC, dynamically optimizes user priorities and power for WMMSE precoding in 6G networks, outperforming baselines in energy efficiency and QoS satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional WMMSE precoding lacks flexibility for user-specific QoS and dynamic channels, necessitating adaptive solutions.

Method: CAAC integrates CSSCA for policy optimization and uses attention-enhanced Q-networks for efficient learning without prior environment knowledge.

Result: CAAC achieves better energy efficiency and QoS satisfaction than existing methods.

Conclusion: CAAC offers a flexible, efficient solution for 6G networks, addressing dynamic QoS and energy efficiency challenges.

Abstract: 6G wireless networks are expected to support diverse quality-of-service (QoS)
demands while maintaining high energy efficiency. Weighted Minimum Mean Square
Error (WMMSE) precoding with fixed user priorities and transmit power is widely
recognized for enhancing overall system performance but lacks flexibility to
adapt to user-specific QoS requirements and time-varying channel conditions. To
address this, we propose a novel constrained reinforcement learning (CRL)
algorithm, Constrained-Actor Attentive-Critic (CAAC), which uses a policy
network to dynamically allocate user priorities and power for WMMSE precoding.
Specifically, CAAC integrates a Constrained Stochastic Successive Convex
Approximation (CSSCA) method to optimize the policy, enabling more effective
handling of energy efficiency goals and satisfaction of stochastic non-convex
QoS constraints compared to traditional and existing CRL methods. Moreover,
CAAC employs lightweight attention-enhanced Q-networks to evaluate policy
updates without prior environment model knowledge. The network architecture not
only enhances representational capacity but also boosts learning efficiency.
Simulation results show that CAAC outperforms baselines in both energy
efficiency and QoS satisfaction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies flaws in current safety alignment methods for AI, showing minor latent shifts can trigger unsafe responses. It introduces a probing method (ASA) and a training strategy (LAPT) to improve robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety alignment methods are shallow, focusing on surface-level behaviors, making models vulnerable to latent shifts that re-trigger harmful behaviors.

Method: The paper introduces a probing method (ASA) to measure latent sensitivity and a training strategy (LAPT) to inject controlled perturbations into hidden representations.

Result: LAPT improves alignment robustness without compromising general capabilities, demonstrating the need for deeper representation-level training.

Conclusion: Current alignment paradigms are flawed; representation-level strategies like LAPT are essential for robust safety alignment.

Abstract: Safety alignment is a key requirement for building reliable Artificial
General Intelligence. Despite significant advances in safety alignment, we
observe that minor latent shifts can still trigger unsafe responses in aligned
models. We argue that this stems from the shallow nature of existing alignment
methods, which focus on surface-level refusal behaviors without sufficiently
altering internal representations. Consequently, small shifts in hidden
activations can re-trigger harmful behaviors embedded in the latent space. To
explore the robustness of safety alignment to latent perturbations, we
introduce a probing method that measures the Negative Log-Likelihood of the
original response generated by the model. This probe quantifies local
sensitivity in the latent space, serving as a diagnostic tool for identifying
vulnerable directions. Based on this signal, we construct effective jailbreak
trajectories, giving rise to the Activation Steering Attack (ASA). More
importantly, these insights offer a principled foundation for improving
alignment robustness. To this end, we introduce Layer-wise Adversarial Patch
Training~(LAPT), a fine-tuning strategy that inject controlled perturbations
into hidden representations during training. Experimental results highlight
that LAPT strengthen alignment robustness without compromising general
capabilities. Our findings reveal fundamental flaws in current alignment
paradigms and call for representation-level training strategies that move
beyond surface-level behavior supervision. Codes and results are available at

*Qianqian Liao,Wuque Cai,Hongze Sun,Dongze Liu,Duo Chen,Dezhong Yao,Daqing Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: B2P-GL framework improves brain disorder diagnosis by integrating brain atlas knowledge and phenotypic data, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on predefined brain atlases but ignore embedded information and confounding effects of site/phenotype variability.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) Brain representation learning using GPT-4 and adaptive graph attention, (2) Population disorder diagnosis with phenotypic data fusion.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ABIDE I, ADHD-200, and Rest-meta-MDD datasets in accuracy and interpretability.

Conclusion: B2P-GL provides a reliable, personalized approach for brain disorder diagnosis, enhancing clinical applicability.

Abstract: Recent developed graph-based methods for diagnosing brain disorders using
functional connectivity highly rely on predefined brain atlases, but overlook
the rich information embedded within atlases and the confounding effects of
site and phenotype variability. To address these challenges, we propose a
two-stage Brain-to-Population Graph Learning (B2P-GL) framework that integrates
the semantic similarity of brain regions and condition-based population graph
modeling. In the first stage, termed brain representation learning, we leverage
brain atlas knowledge from GPT-4 to enrich the graph representation and refine
the brain graph through an adaptive node reassignment graph attention network.
In the second stage, termed population disorder diagnosis, phenotypic data is
incorporated into population graph construction and feature fusion to mitigate
confounding effects and enhance diagnosis performance. Experiments on the ABIDE
I, ADHD-200, and Rest-meta-MDD datasets show that B2P-GL outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy while enhancing
interpretability. Overall, our proposed framework offers a reliable and
personalized approach to brain disorder diagnosis, advancing clinical
applicability.

*Langzhang Liang,Fanchen Bu,Zixing Song,Zenglin Xu,Shirui Pan,Kijung Shin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel graph rewiring method using spectrum-preserving sparsification to mitigate over-squashing in GNNs, balancing connectivity and property preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph rewiring techniques often compromise spectral properties or increase computational overhead, failing to balance bottleneck reduction and graph preservation.

Method: Proposes a spectrum-preserving graph sparsification method to rewire graphs, enhancing connectivity while maintaining sparsity and spectral properties.

Result: Outperforms baselines in classification accuracy and Laplacian spectrum retention, validating effectiveness.

Conclusion: The method successfully mitigates over-squashing while preserving critical graph properties, offering a balanced solution.

Abstract: The message-passing paradigm of Graph Neural Networks often struggles with
exchanging information across distant nodes typically due to structural
bottlenecks in certain graph regions, a limitation known as
\textit{over-squashing}. To reduce such bottlenecks, \textit{graph rewiring},
which modifies graph topology, has been widely used. However, existing graph
rewiring techniques often overlook the need to preserve critical properties of
the original graph, e.g., \textit{spectral properties}. Moreover, many
approaches rely on increasing edge count to improve connectivity, which
introduces significant computational overhead and exacerbates the risk of
over-smoothing. In this paper, we propose a novel graph rewiring method that
leverages \textit{spectrum-preserving} graph \textit{sparsification}, for
mitigating over-squashing. Our method generates graphs with enhanced
connectivity while maintaining sparsity and largely preserving the original
graph spectrum, effectively balancing structural bottleneck reduction and graph
property preservation. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our
approach, demonstrating its superiority over strong baseline methods in
classification accuracy and retention of the Laplacian spectrum.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study examines how knowledge distillation (KD) affects memorization in LLMs, showing that KD reduces memorization risks compared to standard fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about privacy and security due to LLMs memorizing training data, with limited understanding of KD's impact on memorization.

Method: Investigates how different KD methods influence memorization when distilling a large teacher model into smaller student variants.

Result: KD lowers computational costs, reduces model size, and significantly decreases memorization risks.

Conclusion: KD is a promising approach to mitigate memorization risks in LLMs while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to memorize parts of their training
data, raising important concerns around privacy and security. While previous
research has focused on studying memorization in pre-trained models, much less
is known about how knowledge distillation (KD) affects memorization.In this
study, we explore how different KD methods influence the memorization of
fine-tuned task data when a large teacher model is distilled into smaller
student variants.This study demonstrates that distilling a larger teacher
model, fine-tuned on a dataset, into a smaller variant not only lowers
computational costs and model size but also significantly reduces the
memorization risks compared to standard fine-tuning approaches.

TL;DR: The paper explores the challenge of translating Finnish rap lyrics using AI, comparing Faster Whisperer and YouTube's speech-to-text, with Mc Timo's lyrics as the reference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Finnish is complex, and artist pronunciation adds difficulty, making it a fun yet challenging test for AI translation.

Method: Compare Faster Whisperer and YouTube's speech-to-text using Finnish rap lyrics (Mc Timo's) as ground truth, measuring errors against the original.

Result: Hallucination and mishearing levels of AI are measured informally.

Conclusion: The study highlights AI's challenges in transcribing complex, artistic language like Finnish rap.

Abstract: All languages are peculiar. Some of them are considered more challenging to
understand than others. The Finnish Language is known to be a complex language.
Also, when languages are used by artists, the pronunciation and meaning might
be more tricky to understand. Therefore, we are putting AI to a fun, yet
challenging trial: translating a Finnish rap song to text. We will compare the
Faster Whisperer algorithm and YouTube's internal speech-to-text functionality.
The reference truth will be Finnish rap lyrics, which the main author's little
brother, Mc Timo, has written. Transcribing the lyrics will be challenging
because the artist raps over synth music player by Syntikka Janne. The
hallucination level and mishearing of AI speech-to-text extractions will be
measured by comparing errors made against the original Finnish lyrics. The
error function is informal but still works for our case.

*Xun Wang,Jing Xu,Franziska Boenisch,Michael Backes,Christopher A. Choquette-Choo,Adam Dziedzic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: POST enables private tuning of soft prompts on a small model and transfers them to a larger LLM, reducing costs and preserving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft prompts are efficient but lack generalization across LLMs, incur high computational costs, and risk privacy when shared with external providers.

Method: POST uses knowledge distillation to derive a small model from the large LLM, tunes soft prompts locally (with optional differential privacy), and transfers them back using a public dataset.

Result: POST reduces computational costs, preserves privacy, and effectively transfers high-utility soft prompts.

Conclusion: POST addresses efficiency and privacy issues in soft prompt tuning, offering a viable solution for LLM adaptation.

Abstract: Prompting has become a dominant paradigm for adapting large language models
(LLMs). While discrete (textual) prompts are widely used for their
interpretability, soft (parameter) prompts have recently gained traction in
APIs. This is because they can encode information from more training samples
while minimizing the user's token usage, leaving more space in the context
window for task-specific input. However, soft prompts are tightly coupled to
the LLM they are tuned on, limiting their generalization to other LLMs. This
constraint is particularly problematic for efficiency and privacy: (1) tuning
prompts on each LLM incurs high computational costs, especially as LLMs
continue to grow in size. Additionally, (2) when the LLM is hosted externally,
soft prompt tuning often requires sharing private data with the LLM provider.
For instance, this is the case with the NVIDIA NeMo API. To address these
issues, we propose POST (Privacy Of Soft prompt Transfer), a framework that
enables private tuning of soft prompts on a small model and subsequently
transfers these prompts to a larger LLM. POST uses knowledge distillation to
derive a small model directly from the large LLM to improve prompt
transferability, tunes the soft prompt locally, optionally with differential
privacy guarantees, and transfers it back to the larger LLM using a small
public dataset. Our experiments show that POST reduces computational costs,
preserves privacy, and effectively transfers high-utility soft prompts.

TL;DR: A novel ML technique optimizes radio resource management for a control system by jointly modeling control dynamics and wireless propagation in latent space, reducing transmit power by 50% without compromising control performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize radio resource management for a control system without degrading control task performance.

Method: Uses two coupled JEPAs (control and wireless) to model dynamics, trains a deep RL algorithm for control policy, and a power predictor for scheduling.

Result: Reduces transmit power by over 50% while maintaining control performance comparable to non-optimized baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively minimizes radio resource usage while preserving control task performance.

Abstract: In this work, we aim to optimize the radio resource management of a
communication system between a remote controller and its device, whose state is
represented through image frames, without compromising the performance of the
control task. We propose a novel machine learning (ML) technique to jointly
model and predict the dynamics of the control system as well as the wireless
propagation environment in latent space. Our method leverages two coupled
joint-embedding predictive architectures (JEPAs): a control JEPA models the
control dynamics and guides the predictions of a wireless JEPA, which captures
the dynamics of the device's channel state information (CSI) through
cross-modal conditioning. We then train a deep reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithm to derive a control policy from latent control dynamics and a power
predictor to estimate scheduling intervals with favorable channel conditions
based on latent CSI representations. As such, the controller minimizes the
usage of radio resources by utilizing the coupled JEPA networks to imagine the
device's trajectory in latent space. We present simulation results on synthetic
multimodal data and show that our proposed approach reduces transmit power by
over 50% while maintaining control performance comparable to baseline methods
that do not account for wireless optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BLANCE is a hybrid Bayesian framework combining batch data and LM-derived expert knowledge for causal discovery, addressing biases and outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data arrives in batches, and expert knowledge is scarce; LMs offer a surrogate but introduce issues like hallucinations and bias.

Method: BLANCE integrates batch data with LM-derived knowledge using a Bayesian framework, shifting from DAG to PAG representation and optimizing LM queries.

Result: BLANCE outperforms prior work in structural accuracy and extends to Bayesian parameter estimation, showing robustness to LM noise.

Conclusion: BLANCE effectively bridges gaps in causal discovery by adaptively combining batch data and LM knowledge while handling biases.

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data typically assumes full access to
data and availability of domain experts. In practice, data often arrive in
batches, and expert knowledge is scarce. Language Models (LMs) offer a
surrogate but come with their own issues-hallucinations, inconsistencies, and
bias. We present BLANCE (Bayesian LM-Augmented Causal Estimation)-a hybrid
Bayesian framework that bridges these gaps by adaptively integrating sequential
batch data with LM-derived noisy, expert knowledge while accounting for both
data-induced and LM-induced biases. Our proposed representation shift from
Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to Partial Ancestral Graph (PAG) accommodates
ambiguities within a coherent Bayesian framework, allowing grounding the global
LM knowledge in local observational data. To guide LM interaction, we use a
sequential optimization scheme that adaptively queries the most informative
edges. Across varied datasets, BLANCE outperforms prior work in structural
accuracy and extends to Bayesian parameter estimation, showing robustness to LM
noise.

*Jacopo Iollo,Geoffroy Oudoumanessah,Carole Lartizien,Michel Dojat,Florence Forbes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a sequential Bayesian experimental design (BED) method to optimize MRI acquisition by adaptively selecting informative measurements, balancing speed and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accelerating MRI acquisition without degrading image quality is challenging, requiring a balance between under-sampling and gathering sufficient data for high-fidelity reconstruction.

Method: Uses sequential BED with gradient-based optimization and diffusion-based generative models to select informative measurements adaptively.

Result: Demonstrates versatility and performance in optimizing both image reconstruction and analysis tasks on various MRI acquisitions.

Conclusion: The proposed active BED method effectively balances acquisition speed and image quality, enhancing MRI utility in clinical settings.

Abstract: A key challenge in maximizing the benefits of Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(MRI) in clinical settings is to accelerate acquisition times without
significantly degrading image quality. This objective requires a balance
between under-sampling the raw k-space measurements for faster acquisitions and
gathering sufficient raw information for high-fidelity image reconstruction and
analysis tasks. To achieve this balance, we propose to use sequential Bayesian
experimental design (BED) to provide an adaptive and task-dependent selection
of the most informative measurements. Measurements are sequentially augmented
with new samples selected to maximize information gain on a posterior
distribution over target images. Selection is performed via a gradient-based
optimization of a design parameter that defines a subsampling pattern. In this
work, we introduce a new active BED procedure that leverages diffusion-based
generative models to handle the high dimensionality of the images and employs
stochastic optimization to select among a variety of patterns while meeting the
acquisition process constraints and budget. So doing, we show how our setting
can optimize, not only standard image reconstruction, but also any associated
image analysis task. The versatility and performance of our approach are
demonstrated on several MRI acquisitions.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using a Conditional Wasserstein GAN (CWGAN) to generate synthetic EEG signals for ALS patients to address data scarcity and class imbalance, improving classifier training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data scarcity and severe class imbalance in ALS EEG recordings hinder reliable machine learning classifier training.

Method: A CWGAN is trained on a private EEG dataset to generate synthetic ALS EEG signals, with detailed preprocessing, normalization, and hyperparameter selection.

Result: Generated signals mimic real ALS EEG patterns, and CWGAN training converges successfully, indicating realistic synthetic data.

Conclusion: Synthetic EEG signals can augment training data, mitigate class imbalance, and enhance ALS detection accuracy, facilitating data sharing and diagnostic models.

Abstract: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a rare neurodegenerative disease, and
high-quality EEG data from ALS patients are scarce. This data scarcity, coupled
with severe class imbalance between ALS and healthy control recordings, poses a
challenge for training reliable machine learning classifiers. In this work, we
address these issues by generating synthetic EEG signals for ALS patients using
a Conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (CWGAN). We train
CWGAN on a private EEG dataset (ALS vs. non-ALS) to learn the distribution of
ALS EEG signals and produce realistic synthetic samples. We preprocess and
normalize EEG recordings, and train a CWGAN model to generate synthetic ALS
signals. The CWGAN architecture and training routine are detailed, with key
hyperparameters chosen for stable training. Qualitative evaluation of generated
signals shows that they closely mimic real ALS EEG patterns. The CWGAN training
converged with generator and discriminator loss curves stabilizing, indicating
successful learning. The synthetic EEG signals appear realistic and have
potential use as augmented data for training classifiers, helping to mitigate
class imbalance and improve ALS detection accuracy. We discuss how this
approach can facilitate data sharing and enhance diagnostic models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how bookmakers can dynamically adjust odds to maximize profit while minimizing loss, ensuring fairness and financial safety.

Method: Characterizes the bookmaker's optimal loss via a polynomial root and develops an efficient algorithm for dynamic odds adjustment, leveraging Bellman-Pareto frontier concepts.

Result: The bookmaker's optimal loss is the largest polynomial root, and the algorithm achieves optimal loss against optimal gamblers while reducing loss for suboptimal ones.

Conclusion: Bookmakers can balance fairness and risk, with the solution revealing a connection to Hermite polynomials and subgame perfect Nash equilibrium.

Abstract: We study the Online Bookmaking problem, where a bookmaker dynamically updates
betting odds on the possible outcomes of an event. In each betting round, the
bookmaker can adjust the odds based on the cumulative betting behavior of
gamblers, aiming to maximize profit while mitigating potential loss. We show
that for any event and any number of betting rounds, in a worst-case setting
over all possible gamblers and outcome realizations, the bookmaker's optimal
loss is the largest root of a simple polynomial. Our solution shows that
bookmakers can be as fair as desired while avoiding financial risk, and the
explicit characterization reveals an intriguing relation between the
bookmaker's regret and Hermite polynomials. We develop an efficient algorithm
that computes the optimal bookmaking strategy: when facing an optimal gambler,
the algorithm achieves the optimal loss, and in rounds where the gambler is
suboptimal, it reduces the achieved loss to the optimal opportunistic loss, a
notion that is related to subgame perfect Nash equilibrium. The key technical
contribution to achieve these results is an explicit characterization of the
Bellman-Pareto frontier, which unifies the dynamic programming updates for
Bellman's value function with the multi-criteria optimization framework of the
Pareto frontier in the context of vector repeated games.

*Leo Gagnon,Eric Elmoznino,Sarthak Mittal,Tom Marty,Tejas Kasetty,Dhanya Sridhar,Guillaume Lajoie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the limitations of auto-regressive models in high-ambiguity scenarios, proposing a method inspired by cognitive science to improve predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Auto-regressive models struggle with high-ambiguity predictions due to computational intractability, despite their adaptability. Cognitive science suggests heuristics as a solution.

Method: Introduces MetaHMM, a synthetic benchmark, and converts pre-trained models into Monte Carlo predictors to decouple task inference from token prediction.

Result: Transformers perform poorly in high-ambiguity contexts, but the proposed method shows significant improvement in ambiguous scenarios.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for ambiguity-aware methods in next-token prediction, offering a promising approach with remaining challenges.

Abstract: The rapid adaptation ability of auto-regressive foundation models is often
attributed to the diversity of their pre-training data. This is because, from a
Bayesian standpoint, minimizing prediction error in such settings requires
integrating over all plausible latent hypotheses consistent with observations.
While this behavior is desirable in principle, it often proves too ambitious in
practice: under high ambiguity, the number of plausible latent alternatives
makes Bayes-optimal prediction computationally intractable. Cognitive science
has long recognized this limitation, suggesting that under such conditions,
heuristics or information-seeking strategies are preferable to exhaustive
inference. Translating this insight to next-token prediction, we hypothesize
that low- and high-ambiguity predictions pose different computational demands,
making ambiguity-agnostic next-token prediction a detrimental inductive bias.
To test this, we introduce MetaHMM, a synthetic sequence meta-learning
benchmark with rich compositional structure and a tractable Bayesian oracle. We
show that Transformers indeed struggle with high-ambiguity predictions across
model sizes. Motivated by cognitive theories, we propose a method to convert
pre-trained models into Monte Carlo predictors that decouple task inference
from token prediction. Preliminary results show substantial gains in ambiguous
contexts through improved capacity allocation and test-time scalable inference,
though challenges remain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TTS systems struggle with multilingual accents and context-relevant emotions due to cultural nuances, especially for Indic languages.

Method: Extends Parler-TTS with a hybrid encoder-decoder, culture-sensitive emotion layers, and dynamic accent code switching.

Result: Achieves 23.7% better accent accuracy (WER reduction to 11.8%) and 85.3% emotion recognition, with a MOS of 4.2/5 for cultural correctness.

Conclusion: The system enables scalable accent-emotion disentanglement, benefiting South Asian EdTech and accessibility.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-speech (TTS) systems realize high naturalness in
monolingual environments, synthesizing speech with correct multilingual accents
(especially for Indic languages) and context-relevant emotions still poses
difficulty owing to cultural nuance discrepancies in current frameworks. This
paper introduces a new TTS architecture integrating accent along with
preserving transliteration with multi-scale emotion modelling, in particularly
tuned for Hindi and Indian English accent. Our approach extends the Parler-TTS
model by integrating A language-specific phoneme alignment hybrid
encoder-decoder architecture, and culture-sensitive emotion embedding layers
trained on native speaker corpora, as well as incorporating a dynamic accent
code switching with residual vector quantization. Quantitative tests
demonstrate 23.7% improvement in accent accuracy (Word Error Rate reduction
from 15.4% to 11.8%) and 85.3% emotion recognition accuracy from native
listeners, surpassing METTS and VECL-TTS baselines. The novelty of the system
is that it can mix code in real time - generating statements such as "Namaste,
let's talk about <Hindi phrase>" with uninterrupted accent shifts while
preserving emotional consistency. Subjective evaluation with 200 users reported
a mean opinion score (MOS) of 4.2/5 for cultural correctness, much better than
existing multilingual systems (p<0.01). This research makes cross-lingual
synthesis more feasible by showcasing scalable accent-emotion disentanglement,
with direct application in South Asian EdTech and accessibility software.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ENN-GFN-Enhanced, integrating epistemic neural networks (ENN) with GFlowNets for better uncertainty-driven exploration and trajectory identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently identifying optimal trajectories in GFlowNets is challenging due to insufficient exploration in poorly learned reward regions.

Method: Combines ENN with GFlowNets for improved joint predictions and uncertainty quantification.

Result: ENN-GFN-Enhanced outperforms baseline methods in grid environments and structured sequence generation.

Conclusion: The integration of ENN enhances exploration and trajectory identification in GFlowNets.

Abstract: Efficiently identifying the right trajectories for training remains an open
problem in GFlowNets. To address this, it is essential to prioritize
exploration in regions of the state space where the reward distribution has not
been sufficiently learned. This calls for uncertainty-driven exploration, in
other words, the agent should be aware of what it does not know. This attribute
can be measured by joint predictions, which are particularly important for
combinatorial and sequential decision problems. In this research, we integrate
epistemic neural networks (ENN) with the conventional architecture of GFlowNets
to enable more efficient joint predictions and better uncertainty
quantification, thereby improving exploration and the identification of optimal
trajectories. Our proposed algorithm, ENN-GFN-Enhanced, is compared to the
baseline method in GFlownets and evaluated in grid environments and structured
sequence generation in various settings, demonstrating both its efficacy and
efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'anomaly signatures' to improve interpretability in machine learning-based anomaly detection by highlighting contributing features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning's lack of interpretability, especially in anomaly detection, leaves users to independently analyze why events are flagged as anomalies.

Method: Proposes the concept of 'anomaly signatures' to highlight features influencing anomaly decisions.

Result: Enhances interpretability by clarifying which features contribute to anomaly tagging.

Conclusion: Anomaly signatures offer a practical solution to improve understanding of machine learning outputs in anomaly detection.

Abstract: Machine learning is often viewed as a black box when it comes to
understanding its output, be it a decision or a score. Automatic anomaly
detection is no exception to this rule, and quite often the astronomer is left
to independently analyze the data in order to understand why a given event is
tagged as an anomaly. We introduce here idea of anomaly signature, whose aim is
to help the interpretability of anomalies by highlighting which features
contributed to the decision.

Result: Empirical evidence shows exponential eigendecay and superior performance in optimization tasks.

Conclusion: The Beta kernel is robust and outperforms traditional kernels in bounded domain problems.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes (GP) is commonly used to
optimize black-box functions. The Mat\'ern and the Radial Basis Function (RBF)
covariance functions are used frequently, but they do not make any assumptions
about the domain of the function, which may limit their applicability in
bounded domains. To address the limitation, we introduce the Beta kernel, a
non-stationary kernel induced by a product of Beta distribution density
functions. Such a formulation allows our kernel to naturally model functions on
bounded domains. We present statistical evidence supporting the hypothesis that
the kernel exhibits an exponential eigendecay rate, based on empirical analyses
of its spectral properties across different settings. Our experimental results
demonstrate the robustness of the Beta kernel in modeling functions with optima
located near the faces or vertices of the unit hypercube. The experiments show
that our kernel consistently outperforms a wide range of kernels, including the
well-known Mat\'ern and RBF, in different problems, including synthetic
function optimization and the compression of vision and language models.

*Nikola Jovanović,Ismail Labiad,Tomáš Souček,Martin Vechev,Pierre Fernandez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First token-level watermarking for autoregressive image models, addressing reverse cycle-consistency and robustness to attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Track provenance of generative model outputs, especially autoregressive image models, which lack prior watermarking solutions.

Method: Adapt language model watermarking, improve reverse cycle-consistency via tokenizer-detokenizer finetuning, and add a watermark synchronization layer.

Result: Reliable and robust watermark detection with theoretically grounded p-values.

Conclusion: Successful adaptation of watermarking to autoregressive image models, overcoming key challenges.

Abstract: Watermarking the outputs of generative models has emerged as a promising
approach for tracking their provenance. Despite significant interest in
autoregressive image generation models and their potential for misuse, no prior
work has attempted to watermark their outputs at the token level. In this work,
we present the first such approach by adapting language model watermarking
techniques to this setting. We identify a key challenge: the lack of reverse
cycle-consistency (RCC), wherein re-tokenizing generated image tokens
significantly alters the token sequence, effectively erasing the watermark. To
address this and to make our method robust to common image transformations,
neural compression, and removal attacks, we introduce (i) a custom
tokenizer-detokenizer finetuning procedure that improves RCC, and (ii) a
complementary watermark synchronization layer. As our experiments demonstrate,
our approach enables reliable and robust watermark detection with theoretically
grounded p-values.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing scalability, adaptability, and safety challenges in building energy management due to rising global energy demand and renewable integration complexity.

Method: 1. Cluster non-shiftable load profiles for policy generalization. 2. Use LSTM forecasting for dynamic responsiveness. 3. Apply domain-informed action masking for safe operation.

Result: Reduces operating costs by up to 15%, maintains stable environmental performance, and adapts to new buildings and tariff changes without retraining.

Conclusion: The framework provides scalable, robust, and cost-effective energy management for buildings.

Abstract: Increasing global energy demand and renewable integration complexity have
placed buildings at the center of sustainable energy management. We present a
three-step reinforcement learning(RL)-based Building Energy Management System
(BEMS) that combines clustering, forecasting, and constrained policy learning
to address scalability, adaptability, and safety challenges. First, we cluster
non-shiftable load profiles to identify common consumption patterns, enabling
policy generalization and transfer without retraining for each new building.
Next, we integrate an LSTM based forecasting module to anticipate future
states, improving the RL agents' responsiveness to dynamic conditions. Lastly,
domain-informed action masking ensures safe exploration and operation,
preventing harmful decisions. Evaluated on real-world data, our approach
reduces operating costs by up to 15% for certain building types, maintains
stable environmental performance, and quickly classifies and optimizes new
buildings with limited data. It also adapts to stochastic tariff changes
without retraining. Overall, this framework delivers scalable, robust, and
cost-effective building energy management.

Motivation: To provide a scalable, low-cost solution for precision livestock monitoring, especially in resource-constrained areas.

Method: Deployed Bluetooth collars with accelerometer and gyroscope sensors, synced data to the cloud, and used SVM, RF, CNN for behavior classification, and LSTM for estrus detection.

Result: Achieved 93% behavior classification accuracy and 96% estrus detection accuracy.

Conclusion: The system is effective and scalable for livestock monitoring, particularly in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel system for monitoring cattle behavior and
detecting estrus (heat) periods using sensor data and machine learning. We
designed and deployed a low-cost Bluetooth-based neck collar equipped with
accelerometer and gyroscope sensors to capture real-time behavioral data from
real cows, which was synced to the cloud. A labeled dataset was created using
synchronized CCTV footage to annotate behaviors such as feeding, rumination,
lying, and others. We evaluated multiple machine learning models -- Support
Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests (RF), and Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN) -- for behavior classification. Additionally, we implemented a Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for estrus detection using behavioral patterns
and anomaly detection. Our system achieved over 93% behavior classification
accuracy and 96% estrus detection accuracy on a limited test set. The approach
offers a scalable and accessible solution for precision livestock monitoring,
especially in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: SS-KAN integrates Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks into a state-space framework for interpretable nonlinear system identification, balancing accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Black-box models lack interpretability of system dynamics, prompting the need for a more transparent approach.

Method: Proposes SS-KAN, combining Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with state-space modeling, validated on Silverbox and Wiener-Hammerstein benchmarks.

Result: SS-KAN offers enhanced interpretability via sparsity-promoting regularization and visualization of learned functions, though with slightly reduced accuracy compared to black-box models.

Conclusion: SS-KAN is a promising method for interpretable nonlinear system identification, balancing accuracy and interpretability.

Abstract: While accurate, black-box system identification models lack interpretability
of the underlying system dynamics. This paper proposes State-Space
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (SS-KAN) to address this challenge by integrating
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks within a state-space framework. The proposed model
is validated on two benchmark systems: the Silverbox and the Wiener-Hammerstein
benchmarks. Results show that SS-KAN provides enhanced interpretability due to
sparsity-promoting regularization and the direct visualization of its learned
univariate functions, which reveal system nonlinearities at the cost of
accuracy when compared to state-of-the-art black-box models, highlighting
SS-KAN as a promising approach for interpretable nonlinear system
identification, balancing accuracy and interpretability of nonlinear system
dynamics.

### [333] [GoalLadder: Incremental Goal Discovery with Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16396)
*Alexey Zakharov,Shimon Whiteson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GoalLadder uses vision-language models (VLMs) to train RL agents from a single language instruction in visual environments, outperforming competitors with a 95% success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural language can specify RL tasks concisely, but extracting rewards from language in visual environments is challenging due to noisy feedback and large data requirements.

Method: GoalLadder incrementally discovers task-progress states by querying a VLM to rank states using pairwise comparisons and an ELO-based system, minimizing distance to top-ranked goals in a learned embedding space.

Result: GoalLadder achieves a 95% success rate, significantly outperforming competitors (45%).

Conclusion: GoalLadder effectively trains RL agents from language instructions in visual environments, reducing reliance on abundant feedback and handling noisy VLM outputs.

Abstract: Natural language can offer a concise and human-interpretable means of
specifying reinforcement learning (RL) tasks. The ability to extract rewards
from a language instruction can enable the development of robotic systems that
can learn from human guidance; however, it remains a challenging problem,
especially in visual environments. Existing approaches that employ large,
pretrained language models either rely on non-visual environment
representations, require prohibitively large amounts of feedback, or generate
noisy, ill-shaped reward functions. In this paper, we propose a novel method,
$\textbf{GoalLadder}$, that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to train RL
agents from a single language instruction in visual environments. GoalLadder
works by incrementally discovering states that bring the agent closer to
completing a task specified in natural language. To do so, it queries a VLM to
identify states that represent an improvement in agent's task progress and to
rank them using pairwise comparisons. Unlike prior work, GoalLadder does not
trust VLM's feedback completely; instead, it uses it to rank potential goal
states using an ELO-based rating system, thus reducing the detrimental effects
of noisy VLM feedback. Over the course of training, the agent is tasked with
minimising the distance to the top-ranked goal in a learned embedding space,
which is trained on unlabelled visual data. This key feature allows us to
bypass the need for abundant and accurate feedback typically required to train
a well-shaped reward function. We demonstrate that GoalLadder outperforms
existing related methods on classic control and robotic manipulation
environments with the average final success rate of $\sim$95% compared to only
$\sim$45% of the best competitor.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Directo, a generative model for directed graphs, addressing challenges like complex dependency spaces and lack of benchmarks. It combines positional encodings, dual-attention, and a discrete framework, showing strong performance across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Directed graphs are crucial in various fields, but their generation is underexplored due to challenges like large dependency spaces and missing benchmarks.

Method: Proposes Directo, a model using discrete flow matching with positional encodings, dual-attention for dependencies, and a robust generative framework.

Result: Directo performs strongly across synthetic and real-world datasets, even competing with specialized models.

Conclusion: The approach is effective and general, setting a foundation for future directed graph generation research.

Abstract: Directed graphs naturally model systems with asymmetric, ordered
relationships, essential to applications in biology, transportation, social
networks, and visual understanding. Generating such graphs enables tasks such
as simulation, data augmentation and novel instance discovery; however,
directed graph generation remains underexplored. We identify two key factors
limiting progress in this direction: first, modeling edge directionality
introduces a substantially larger dependency space, making the underlying
distribution harder to learn; second, the absence of standardized benchmarks
hinders rigorous evaluation. Addressing the former requires more expressive
models that are sensitive to directional topologies. We propose Directo, the
first generative model for directed graphs built upon the discrete flow
matching framework. Our approach combines: (i) principled positional encodings
tailored to asymmetric pairwise relations, (ii) a dual-attention mechanism
capturing both incoming and outgoing dependencies, and (iii) a robust, discrete
generative framework. To support evaluation, we introduce a benchmark suite
covering synthetic and real-world datasets. It shows that our method performs
strongly across diverse settings and even competes with specialized models for
particular classes, such as directed acyclic graphs. Our results highlight the
effectiveness and generality of our approach, establishing a solid foundation
for future research in directed graph generation.

TL;DR: DnD introduces a prompt-conditioned parameter generator to create LoRA weight updates without per-task training, reducing overhead and improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate the need for separate optimization runs for each downstream dataset in PEFT methods like LoRA.

Method: Uses a lightweight text encoder and hyper-convolutional decoder to map task prompts directly to LoRA matrices.

Result: Achieves up to 12,000x lower overhead, 30% performance gains over LoRA, and robust cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: Prompt-conditioned parameter generation is a viable alternative to gradient-based adaptation for LLMs.

Abstract: Modern Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) reduce the cost of customizing large language models (LLMs),
yet still require a separate optimization run for every downstream dataset. We
introduce \textbf{Drag-and-Drop LLMs (\textit{DnD})}, a prompt-conditioned
parameter generator that eliminates per-task training by mapping a handful of
unlabeled task prompts directly to LoRA weight updates. A lightweight text
encoder distills each prompt batch into condition embeddings, which are then
transformed by a cascaded hyper-convolutional decoder into the full set of LoRA
matrices. Once trained in a diverse collection of prompt-checkpoint pairs, DnD
produces task-specific parameters in seconds, yielding i) up to
\textbf{12,000$\times$} lower overhead than full fine-tuning, ii) average gains
up to \textbf{30\%} in performance over the strongest training LoRAs on unseen
common-sense reasoning, math, coding, and multimodal benchmarks, and iii)
robust cross-domain generalization despite never seeing the target data or
labels. Our results demonstrate that prompt-conditioned parameter generation is
a viable alternative to gradient-based adaptation for rapidly specializing
LLMs. Our project is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of bad routing in MoE architectures, which can lead to load imbalance and reduced accuracy, by designing and testing different router variants.

Method: Implemented six router architectures (Linear, Attention, MLP, Hybrid, Hash, and MLP-Hadamard) within Transformer models, evaluated using BERT and Qwen1.5-MoE, focusing on parameter efficiency, inference latency, routing entropy, and expert utilization.

Result: Found trade-offs: Linear routers are faster, MLP and Attention routers are more expressive, and MLP-Hadamard excels in structured, sparse routing. Successfully fine-tuned custom routers in Qwen1.5-MoE.

Conclusion: Provides a comparative analysis of MoE router designs, offering insights for optimizing performance in large-scale model deployment.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures increase large language model
scalability, yet their performance depends on the router module that moves
tokens to specialized experts. Bad routing can load imbalance and reduced
accuracy. This project designed and implemented different router architectures
within Transformer models to fix these limitations. We experimented with six
distinct router variants Linear, Attention, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP),
Hybrid, Hash, and our new MLP-Hadamard. We characterized these routers using
BERT and the Qwen1.5-MoE model, looking at parameter efficiency, inference
latency, routing entropy, and expert utilization patterns. Our evaluations
showed distinct trade-offs: Linear routers offer speed, while MLP and Attention
routers provide greater expressiveness. The MLP-Hadamard router shows a unique
capability for structured, sparse routing. We successfully replaced and
fine-tuned custom routers within the complex, quantized Qwen1.5-MoE model. This
work provides a comparative analysis of MoE router designs and offers insights
into optimizing their performance for efficient and effective large-scale model
deployment.

*Dian Meng,Zhiguang Cao,Yaoxin Wu,Yaqing Hou,Hongwei Ge,Qiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EFormer, an Edge-based Transformer model, improves VRP solutions by using edge inputs and parallel encoding, outperforming baselines on synthetic and real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural heuristics for VRP rely on node coordinates, which may not reflect real-world edge-based costs. EFormer addresses this by focusing on edge inputs.

Method: EFormer uses a precoder module with mixed-score attention to convert edges into node embeddings, parallel encoding for graph and node embeddings, and reinforcement learning for training.

Result: EFormer outperforms baselines on TSP and CVRP synthetic datasets and generalizes well to real-world instances from TSPLib and CVRPLib.

Conclusion: EFormer's edge-based design and parallel encoding strategy effectively solve VRPs, demonstrating strong performance and generalization.

Abstract: Recent neural heuristics for the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) primarily rely
on node coordinates as input, which may be less effective in practical
scenarios where real cost metrics-such as edge-based distances-are more
relevant. To address this limitation, we introduce EFormer, an Edge-based
Transformer model that uses edge as the sole input for VRPs. Our approach
employs a precoder module with a mixed-score attention mechanism to convert
edge information into temporary node embeddings. We also present a parallel
encoding strategy characterized by a graph encoder and a node encoder, each
responsible for processing graph and node embeddings in distinct feature
spaces, respectively. This design yields a more comprehensive representation of
the global relationships among edges. In the decoding phase, parallel context
embedding and multi-query integration are used to compute separate attention
mechanisms over the two encoded embeddings, facilitating efficient path
construction. We train EFormer using reinforcement learning in an
autoregressive manner. Extensive experiments on the Traveling Salesman Problem
(TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) reveal that EFormer
outperforms established baselines on synthetic datasets, including large-scale
and diverse distributions. Moreover, EFormer demonstrates strong generalization
on real-world instances from TSPLib and CVRPLib. These findings confirm the
effectiveness of EFormer's core design in solving VRPs.

TL;DR: Transformers in LLMs use latent concepts during in-context learning (ICL) for tasks, showing step-by-step reasoning and low-dimensional subspaces for continuous concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether transformers represent latent structures or take shortcuts in ICL tasks, especially in multi-step reasoning and continuous latent concepts.

Method: Examined transformers in 2-hop reasoning tasks with discrete latent concepts and tasks with continuous latent concepts, analyzing representation subspaces.

Result: Transformers successfully identify and compose latent concepts step-by-step in discrete tasks and mimic continuous parameterization in low-dimensional subspaces.

Conclusion: Transformers disentangle and use latent concepts in ICL, revealing localized structures for concept representation.

Abstract: When large language models (LLMs) use in-context learning (ICL) to solve a
new task, they seem to grasp not only the goal of the task but also core,
latent concepts in the demonstration examples. This begs the question of
whether transformers represent latent structures as part of their computation
or whether they take shortcuts to solve the problem. Prior mechanistic work on
ICL does not address this question because it does not sufficiently examine the
relationship between the learned representation and the latent concept, and the
considered problem settings often involve only single-step reasoning. In this
work, we examine how transformers disentangle and use latent concepts. We show
that in 2-hop reasoning tasks with a latent, discrete concept, the model
successfully identifies the latent concept and does step-by-step concept
composition. In tasks parameterized by a continuous latent concept, we find
low-dimensional subspaces in the representation space where the geometry mimics
the underlying parameterization. Together, these results refine our
understanding of ICL and the representation of transformers, and they provide
evidence for highly localized structures in the model that disentangle latent
concepts in ICL tasks.

Motivation: To improve the training efficiency and prediction accuracy of PINNs by leveraging explainable AI methods like influence functions for targeted data sampling.

Method: Apply influence function-based sampling to identify and prioritize impactful training points in PINNs.

Result: Targeted resampling using influence functions improves prediction accuracy in PINNs.

Conclusion: Influence function-based sampling is a practical XAI method to enhance PINN training and performance.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a powerful approach to solving
partial differential equations (PDEs), which are ubiquitous in the quantitative
sciences. Applied to both forward and inverse problems across various
scientific domains, PINNs have recently emerged as a valuable tool in the field
of scientific machine learning. A key aspect of their training is that the data
-- spatio-temporal points sampled from the PDE's input domain -- are readily
available. Influence functions, a tool from the field of explainable AI (XAI),
approximate the effect of individual training points on the model, enhancing
interpretability. In the present work, we explore the application of influence
function-based sampling approaches for the training data. Our results indicate
that such targeted resampling based on data attribution methods has the
potential to enhance prediction accuracy in physics-informed neural networks,
demonstrating a practical application of an XAI method in PINN training.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAMD and SAMI, methods to interpret and control transformer models by mapping complex concepts to attention heads and adjusting their effects with a scalar parameter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance interpretability and behavioral control of transformers by addressing gaps in current attribution methods, which overlook attention mechanisms and lack unified approaches for complex concepts.

Method: SAMD maps concepts to attention heads using cosine similarity, while SAMI adjusts concept effects via a scalar parameter.

Result: SAMD identifies stable concept-associated modules; SAMI improves jailbreaking (+72.7%) and reasoning (+1.6%) and suppresses vision transformer accuracy.

Conclusion: The methods offer domain-agnostic tools for interpreting and controlling transformer behavior, validated across language and vision tasks.

Abstract: Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance across language and
vision tasks. This success drives the imperative to interpret their internal
mechanisms with the dual goals of enhancing performance and improving
behavioral control. Attribution methods help advance interpretability by
assigning model outputs associated with a target concept to specific model
components. Current attribution research primarily studies multi-layer
perceptron neurons and addresses relatively simple concepts such as factual
associations (e.g., Paris is located in France). This focus tends to overlook
the impact of the attention mechanism and lacks a unified approach for
analyzing more complex concepts. To fill these gaps, we introduce Scalable
Attention Module Discovery (SAMD), a concept-agnostic method for mapping
arbitrary, complex concepts to specific attention heads of general transformer
models. We accomplish this by representing each concept as a vector,
calculating its cosine similarity with each attention head, and selecting the
TopK-scoring heads to construct the concept-associated attention module. We
then propose Scalar Attention Module Intervention (SAMI), a simple strategy to
diminish or amplify the effects of a concept by adjusting the attention module
using only a single scalar parameter. Empirically, we demonstrate SAMD on
concepts of varying complexity, and visualize the locations of their
corresponding modules. Our results demonstrate that module locations remain
stable before and after LLM post-training, and confirm prior work on the
mechanics of LLM multilingualism. Through SAMI, we facilitate jailbreaking on
HarmBench (+72.7%) by diminishing "safety" and improve performance on the GSM8K
benchmark (+1.6%) by amplifying "reasoning". Lastly, we highlight the
domain-agnostic nature of our approach by suppressing the image classification
accuracy of vision transformers on ImageNet.

Motivation: To develop a deep learning model for EEG-based emotion recognition in real-life contexts, leveraging recent EEG technology advancements.

Method: Utilizes multi-scale CNNs with feature extraction kernels of varying ratios and a new kernel type learning from four brain areas.

Result: The model consistently outperforms TSception in predicting valence, arousal, and dominance scores across multiple metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is effective for EEG-based emotion recognition, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: EEG is a non-invasive, safe, and low-risk method to record
electrophysiological signals inside the brain. Especially with recent
technology developments like dry electrodes, consumer-grade EEG devices, and
rapid advances in machine learning, EEG is commonly used as a resource for
automatic emotion recognition. With the aim to develop a deep learning model
that can perform EEG-based emotion recognition in a real-life context, we
propose a novel approach to utilize multi-scale convolutional neural networks
to accomplish such tasks. By implementing feature extraction kernels with many
ratio coefficients as well as a new type of kernel that learns key information
from four separate areas of the brain, our model consistently outperforms the
state-of-the-art TSception model in predicting valence, arousal, and dominance
scores across many performance evaluation metrics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TensorGuide improves LoRA by using a tensor-train-guided framework to create correlated low-rank matrices, enhancing expressivity and efficiency without extra parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LoRA's independent optimization of low-rank matrices limits expressivity and generalization, while classical TT decomposition fails to improve efficiency or performance.

Method: TensorGuide generates correlated low-rank LoRA matrices via a unified TT structure driven by controlled Gaussian noise, ensuring structured adaptations.

Result: TensorGuide outperforms standard LoRA and TT-LoRA in benchmarks, improving accuracy and scalability with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: TensorGuide offers a superior, parameter-efficient adaptation framework with enhanced expressivity and generalization, validated theoretically and empirically.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is widely recognized for its parameter-efficient
fine-tuning of large-scale neural models. However, standard LoRA independently
optimizes low-rank matrices, which inherently limits its expressivity and
generalization capabilities. While classical tensor-train (TT) decomposition
can be separately employed on individual LoRA matrices, this work demonstrates
that the classical TT-based approach neither significantly improves parameter
efficiency nor achieves substantial performance gains. This paper proposes
TensorGuide, a novel tensor-train-guided adaptation framework to overcome these
limitations. TensorGuide generates two correlated low-rank LoRA matrices
through a unified TT structure driven by controlled Gaussian noise. The
resulting joint TT representation inherently provides structured, low-rank
adaptations, significantly enhancing expressivity, generalization, and
parameter efficiency without increasing the number of trainable parameters.
Theoretically, we justify these improvements through neural tangent kernel
analyses, demonstrating superior optimization dynamics and enhanced
generalization. Extensive experiments on quantum dot classification and GPT-2
fine-tuning benchmarks demonstrate that TensorGuide-based LoRA consistently
outperforms standard LoRA and TT-LoRA, achieving improved accuracy and
scalability with fewer parameters.

TL;DR: The paper investigates privacy risks in multitask learning (MTL) by analyzing shared representations, proposing a black-box task-inference attack, and demonstrating its effectiveness across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MTL's shared representations, while efficient, may leak sensitive task information, raising privacy concerns.

Method: A novel black-box task-inference attack is developed, exploiting dependencies in embeddings without shadow models or labeled data.

Result: The attack successfully infers task inclusion in training across vision and language domains, even with fresh samples.

Conclusion: Shared representations in MTL pose privacy risks, and theoretical analysis highlights vulnerabilities even with fresh task samples.

Abstract: Multitask learning (MTL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm that leverages
similarities among multiple learning tasks, each with insufficient samples to
train a standalone model, to solve them simultaneously while minimizing data
sharing across users and organizations. MTL typically accomplishes this goal by
learning a shared representation that captures common structure among the tasks
by embedding data from all tasks into a common feature space. Despite being
designed to be the smallest unit of shared information necessary to effectively
learn patterns across multiple tasks, these shared representations can
inadvertently leak sensitive information about the particular tasks they were
trained on.
  In this work, we investigate what information is revealed by the shared
representations through the lens of inference attacks. Towards this, we propose
a novel, black-box task-inference threat model where the adversary, given the
embedding vectors produced by querying the shared representation on samples
from a particular task, aims to determine whether that task was present when
training the shared representation. We develop efficient, purely black-box
attacks on machine learning models that exploit the dependencies between
embeddings from the same task without requiring shadow models or labeled
reference data. We evaluate our attacks across vision and language domains for
multiple use cases of MTL and demonstrate that even with access only to fresh
task samples rather than training data, a black-box adversary can successfully
infer a task's inclusion in training. To complement our experiments, we provide
theoretical analysis of a simplified learning setting and show a strict
separation between adversaries with training samples and fresh samples from the
target task's distribution.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PITA introduces a novel framework combining annealing and diffusion smoothing for efficient sampling from unnormalized densities, enabling equilibrium sampling of complex systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient sampling from unnormalized densities is a core challenge in scientific applications, but existing diffusion-based samplers fail at scale.

Method: PITA combines annealing of the Boltzmann distribution and diffusion smoothing, training diffusion models sequentially from high to low temperatures.

Result: PITA achieves equilibrium sampling of N-body systems, Alanine Dipeptide, and tripeptides with fewer energy evaluations.

Conclusion: PITA advances diffusion-based sampling, enabling scalable and efficient sampling for complex molecular systems.

Abstract: Sampling efficiently from a target unnormalized probability density remains a
core challenge, with relevance across countless high-impact scientific
applications. A promising approach towards this challenge is the design of
amortized samplers that borrow key ideas, such as probability path design, from
state-of-the-art generative diffusion models. However, all existing
diffusion-based samplers remain unable to draw samples from distributions at
the scale of even simple molecular systems. In this paper, we propose
Progressive Inference-Time Annealing (PITA), a novel framework to learn
diffusion-based samplers that combines two complementary interpolation
techniques: I.) Annealing of the Boltzmann distribution and II.) Diffusion
smoothing. PITA trains a sequence of diffusion models from high to low
temperatures by sequentially training each model at progressively higher
temperatures, leveraging engineered easy access to samples of the
temperature-annealed target density. In the subsequent step, PITA enables
simulating the trained diffusion model to procure training samples at a lower
temperature for the next diffusion model through inference-time annealing using
a novel Feynman-Kac PDE combined with Sequential Monte Carlo. Empirically, PITA
enables, for the first time, equilibrium sampling of N-body particle systems,
Alanine Dipeptide, and tripeptides in Cartesian coordinates with dramatically
lower energy function evaluations. Code available at:

*Amir Reza Vazifeh,Jason W. Fleischer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NLDR techniques like t-SNE and UMAP effectively identify medically relevant ECG features without training, achieving high accuracy in arrhythmia classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual ECG analysis is error-prone, and existing machine learning methods struggle with signal variability and label inconsistencies.

Method: Nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) techniques (t-SNE and UMAP) were applied to ECG signals from the MIT-BIH dataset to identify features without training.

Result: NLDR achieved >=90% accuracy in discriminating recordings and 98.96% median accuracy in arrhythmia classification.

Conclusion: NLDR shows promise for automated ECG analysis, even in challenging cases like single-lead or 12-lead ECGs, and broader healthcare applications.

Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) provide direct, non-invasive measurements of heart
activity and are well-established tools for detecting and monitoring
cardiovascular disease. However, manual ECG analysis can be time-consuming and
prone to errors. Machine learning has emerged as a promising approach for
automated heartbeat recognition and classification, but substantial variations
in ECG signals make it challenging to develop generalizable models. ECG signals
can vary widely across individuals and leads, while datasets often follow
different labeling standards and may be biased, all of which greatly hinder
supervised methods. Conventional unsupervised methods, e.g. principal component
analysis, prioritize large (and often obvious) variances in the data and
typically overlook subtle yet clinically relevant patterns. If labels are
missing and/or variations are significant but small, both approaches fail.
Here, we show that nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) can accommodate
these issues and identify medically relevant features in ECG signals, with no
need for training or prior information. Using the MLII and V1 leads of the
MIT-BIH dataset, we demonstrate that t-distributed stochastic neighbor
embedding and uniform manifold approximation and projection can discriminate
individual recordings in mixed populations with >= 90% accuracy and distinguish
different arrhythmias in individual patients with a median accuracy of 98.96%
and a median F1-score of 91.02%. The results show that NLDR holds much promise
for cardiac monitoring, including the limiting cases of single-lead ECG and the
current 12-lead standard of care, and for personalized health care beyond
cardiology.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SparseLoRA accelerates LLM fine-tuning by using contextual sparsity and a lightweight SVD sparsity estimator, reducing computational costs and maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning LLMs is resource-intensive, and existing methods like QLoRA and DoRA don't reduce computational costs. SparseLoRA aims to address this gap.

Method: Uses a training-free SVD sparsity estimator to dynamically select sparse weights for loss and gradient computation, addressing sensitivity across layers, tokens, and steps.

Result: Reduces computational cost by up to 2.2x and achieves a speedup of up to 1.6x while maintaining accuracy across tasks.

Conclusion: SparseLoRA is an efficient method for LLM fine-tuning, balancing computational savings with performance.

Abstract: Fine-tuning LLMs is both computationally and memory-intensive. While
parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, such as QLoRA and DoRA, reduce the
number of trainable parameters and lower memory usage, they do not decrease
computational cost. In some cases, they may even slow down fine-tuning. In this
paper, we introduce SparseLoRA, a method that accelerates LLM fine-tuning
through contextual sparsity. We propose a lightweight, training-free SVD
sparsity estimator that dynamically selects a sparse subset of weights for loss
and gradient computation. Also, we systematically analyze and address
sensitivity across layers, tokens, and training steps. Our experimental results
show that SparseLoRA reduces computational cost by up to 2.2 times and a
measured speedup of up to 1.6 times while maintaining accuracy across various
downstream tasks, including commonsense and arithmetic reasoning, code
generation, and instruction following.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Model merging combines expert models but faces diminishing returns due to rank collapse in task vector space. Subspace Boosting mitigates this, improving merging efficacy by over 10% for up to 20 models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address diminishing performance gains in merging multiple expert models by analyzing and mitigating rank collapse in task vector space.

Method: Introduces Subspace Boosting, which maintains task vector ranks using singular value decomposition, and employs Higher-Order Generalized SVD for task similarity analysis.

Result: Subspace Boosting improves merging efficacy by over 10% for up to 20 expert models on vision benchmarks.

Conclusion: Subspace Boosting effectively mitigates rank collapse, enhancing model merging performance and providing interpretable insights into task similarity.

Abstract: Model merging enables the combination of multiple specialized expert models
into a single model capable of performing multiple tasks. However, the benefits
of merging an increasing amount of specialized experts generally lead to
diminishing returns and reduced overall performance gains. In this work, we
offer an explanation and analysis from a task arithmetic perspective; revealing
that as the merging process (across numerous existing merging methods)
continues for more and more experts, the associated task vector space
experiences rank collapse. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Subspace
Boosting, which operates on the singular value decomposed task vector space and
maintains task vector ranks. Subspace Boosting raises merging efficacy for up
to 20 expert models by large margins of more than 10% when evaluated on vision
benchmarks. Moreover, we propose employing Higher-Order Generalized Singular
Value Decomposition to further quantify task similarity, offering a new
interpretable perspective on model merging.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Crome (Causally Robust Reward Modeling) is a new framework to mitigate reward hacking in reward models (RMs) by using causal and neutral augmentations during training, improving accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward models often suffer from reward hacking, focusing on superficial attributes like response length instead of true quality drivers (e.g., factuality). Standard training fails to disentangle these factors, leading to misalignment.

Method: Crome introduces causal augmentations (to enforce sensitivity to causal attributes) and neutral augmentations (to enforce invariance to spurious attributes), generated via answer interventions without prior knowledge of spurious factors.

Result: Crome outperforms baselines on RewardBench, improving average accuracy by up to 5.4%, with gains of 13.2% and 7.2% in specific categories. It shows consistent robustness across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Crome effectively addresses reward hacking by leveraging causal modeling, demonstrating significant improvements in reward model accuracy and robustness across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are fundamental to aligning Large Language Models (LLMs)
via human feedback, yet they often suffer from reward hacking. They tend to
latch on to superficial or spurious attributes, such as response length or
formatting, mistaking these cues learned from correlations in training data for
the true causal drivers of quality (e.g., factuality, relevance). This occurs
because standard training objectives struggle to disentangle these factors,
leading to brittle RMs and misaligned policies. We introduce Crome (Causally
Robust Reward Modeling), a novel framework grounded in an explicit causal model
designed to mitigate reward hacking. Crome employs the following synthetic
targeted augmentations during training: (1) Causal Augmentations, which are
pairs that differ along specific causal attributes, to enforce sensitivity
along each causal attribute individually, and (2) Neutral Augmentations, which
are tie-label pairs varying primarily in spurious attributes, to enforce
invariance along spurious attributes. Notably, our augmentations are produced
without any knowledge of spurious factors, via answer interventions only along
causal rubrics, that are identified by querying an oracle LLM. Empirically,
Crome significantly outperforms standard baselines on RewardBench, improving
average accuracy by up to 5.4% and achieving gains of up to 13.2% and 7.2% in
specific categories. The robustness of Crome is further testified by the
consistent gains obtained in a Best-of-N inference setting across increasing N,
across various benchmarks, including the popular RewardBench (covering chat,
chat-hard, safety, and reasoning tasks), the safety-focused WildGuardTest, and
the reasoning-specific GSM8k.

*Bornali Phukon,Xiuwen Zheng,Mark Hasegawa-Johnson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new metric combining NLI scores, semantic similarity, and phonetic similarity outperforms traditional ASR metrics like WER and CER in capturing intelligibility for dysarthric speech.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ASR metrics (WER, CER) inadequately measure intelligibility for dysarthric and dysphonic speech, where semantic alignment is more critical than exact word matches.

Method: Proposed a novel metric integrating Natural Language Inference (NLI) scores, semantic similarity, and phonetic similarity to evaluate ASR output for dysarthric speech.

Result: The new metric achieved a 0.890 correlation with human judgments, outperforming traditional methods.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need to prioritize intelligibility over error-based metrics in ASR evaluations, especially for dysarthric speech.

Abstract: Traditional ASR metrics like WER and CER fail to capture intelligibility,
especially for dysarthric and dysphonic speech, where semantic alignment
matters more than exact word matches. ASR systems struggle with these speech
types, often producing errors like phoneme repetitions and imprecise
consonants, yet the meaning remains clear to human listeners. We identify two
key challenges: (1) Existing metrics do not adequately reflect intelligibility,
and (2) while LLMs can refine ASR output, their effectiveness in correcting ASR
transcripts of dysarthric speech remains underexplored. To address this, we
propose a novel metric integrating Natural Language Inference (NLI) scores,
semantic similarity, and phonetic similarity. Our ASR evaluation metric
achieves a 0.890 correlation with human judgments on Speech Accessibility
Project data, surpassing traditional methods and emphasizing the need to
prioritize intelligibility over error-based measures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Adaptive Representation Misdirection Unlearning (RMU) technique to remove sensitive information from LLMs, addressing privacy and security concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs' tendency to memorize training data poses privacy and security risks, especially with PII, necessitating effective unlearning methods.

Method: The study applies RMU to unlearn sensitive data, analyzing its effects across decoder layers to identify optimal removal regions.

Result: The technique ranked 4th on official leaderboards for both 1B and 7B parameter models.

Conclusion: RMU is a promising approach for mitigating privacy risks in LLMs, though further development is needed.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
natural language understanding and generation. However, their tendency to
memorize training data raises concerns regarding privacy, copyright compliance,
and security, particularly in cases involving Personally Identifiable
Information (PII). Effective machine unlearning techniques are essential to
mitigate these risks, yet existing methods remain underdeveloped for LLMs due
to their open-ended output space. In this work, we apply the Adaptive
Representation Misdirection Unlearning (RMU) technique to unlearn sensitive
information from LLMs. Through extensive experiments, we analyze the effects of
unlearning across different decoder layers to determine the most effective
regions for sensitive information removal. Our technique ranked 4th on the
official leaderboard of both 1B parameter and 7B parameter models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a principled analysis of transformer models by leveraging non-commutative harmonic analysis and free probability theory.

Method: Represent token embeddings and attention mechanisms as self-adjoint operators in a free probability space, reinterpreting attention as non-commutative convolution and layer-wise propagation as free additive convolution.

Result: The framework reveals a spectral dynamical system in transformers, offers insights into inductive biases and generalization, and derives a generalization bound based on free entropy.

Conclusion: The approach bridges neural architecture with non-commutative harmonic analysis, enabling deeper understanding of information flow and structural complexity in large language models.

Abstract: We outline an operator-theoretic framework for analyzing transformer-based
language models using the tools of free probability theory. By representing
token embeddings and attention mechanisms as self-adjoint operators in a racial
probability space, we reinterpret attention as a non-commutative convolution
and view the layer-wise propagation of representations as an evolution governed
by free additive convolution. This formalism reveals a spectral dynamical
system underpinning deep transformer stacks and offers insight into their
inductive biases, generalization behavior, and entropy dynamics. We derive a
generalization bound based on free entropy and demonstrate that the spectral
trace of transformer layers evolves predictably with depth. Our approach
bridges neural architecture with non-commutative harmonic analysis, enabling
principled analysis of information flow and structural complexity in large
language models

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RCP1 introduces a single-sample robust conformal prediction method, reducing computational cost while maintaining robustness and smaller prediction sets compared to SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robust conformal prediction (RCP) methods using randomized smoothing are computationally expensive due to multiple model forward passes per input.

Method: Proposes RCP1, which certifies the conformal prediction procedure itself using a single perturbed input and any binary certificate, applicable to classification and regression.

Result: RCP1 achieves robust prediction sets with smaller average size compared to methods requiring many forward passes (e.g., 100).

Conclusion: RCP1 is a computationally efficient and versatile approach for robust conformal prediction, extendable to robust conformal risk control.

Abstract: Given any model, conformal prediction (CP) returns prediction sets guaranteed
to include the true label with high adjustable probability. Robust CP (RCP)
extends this to inputs with worst-case noise. A well-established approach is to
use randomized smoothing for RCP since it is applicable to any black-box model
and provides smaller sets compared to deterministic methods. However, current
smoothing-based RCP requires many model forward passes per each input which is
computationally expensive. We show that conformal prediction attains some
robustness even with a forward pass on a single randomly perturbed input. Using
any binary certificate we propose a single sample robust CP (RCP1). Our
approach returns robust sets with smaller average set size compared to SOTA
methods which use many (e.g. around 100) passes per input. Our key insight is
to certify the conformal prediction procedure itself rather than individual
scores. Our approach is agnostic to the setup (classification and regression).
We further extend our approach to smoothing-based robust conformal risk
control.

TL;DR: Proposes an energy-based transfer learning method using out-of-distribution detection to improve sample efficiency in reinforcement learning by selectively issuing teacher guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning suffers from poor sample efficiency, especially in multi-task or continual learning, and transferred teacher guidance can be sub-optimal if tasks differ.

Method: Energy-based transfer learning with out-of-distribution detection to selectively apply teacher guidance in states within its training distribution.

Result: Theoretical proof that energy scores reflect teacher's state-visitation density; empirical improvement in sample efficiency and performance in single-task and multi-task settings.

Conclusion: Selective teacher guidance via energy-based transfer learning enhances efficiency and performance in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms often suffer from poor sample efficiency,
making them challenging to apply in multi-task or continual learning settings.
Efficiency can be improved by transferring knowledge from a previously trained
teacher policy to guide exploration in new but related tasks. However, if the
new task sufficiently differs from the teacher's training task, the transferred
guidance may be sub-optimal and bias exploration toward low-reward behaviors.
We propose an energy-based transfer learning method that uses
out-of-distribution detection to selectively issue guidance, enabling the
teacher to intervene only in states within its training distribution. We
theoretically show that energy scores reflect the teacher's state-visitation
density and empirically demonstrate improved sample efficiency and performance
across both single-task and multi-task settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FLAME introduces a federated learning framework using Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) to retain full global LoRA matrices, addressing resource adaptability without compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods compress global LoRA matrices for resource adaptation, leading to suboptimal performance due to information loss.

Method: FLAME uses SMoE, varying activated experts per client, and includes rescaling and activation-aware aggregation to address challenges.

Result: FLAME outperforms existing methods across diverse computational settings.

Conclusion: FLAME provides a robust, effective solution for resource-adaptive federated learning.

Abstract: Existing resource-adaptive LoRA federated fine-tuning methods enable clients
to fine-tune models using compressed versions of global LoRA matrices, in order
to accommodate various compute resources across clients. This compression
requirement will lead to suboptimal performance due to information loss. To
address this, we propose FLAME, a novel federated learning framework based on
the Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architecture. Unlike prior approaches,
FLAME retains full (uncompressed) global LoRA matrices and achieves client-side
adaptability by varying the number of activated experts per client. However,
incorporating SMoE into federated learning introduces unique challenges,
specifically, the mismatch in output magnitude from partial expert activation
and the imbalance in expert training quality across clients. FLAME tackles
these challenges through a lightweight rescaling mechanism and an
activation-aware aggregation scheme. Empirical results across diverse
computational settings demonstrate that FLAME consistently outperforms existing
methods, providing a robust and effective solution for resource-adaptive
federated learning.

TL;DR: SlepNet, a novel GCN using Slepian bases, outperforms traditional GNNs in representing and decoding spatiotemporal signal patterns on graphs, especially in neuroscience and traffic dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNNs and graph signal processing methods struggle with localized signal patterning on graphs, which is crucial in domains like neuroscience.

Method: SlepNet employs Slepian bases to optimally concentrate signal energy on relevant subgraphs, learned via a mask, enabling canonical and high-resolution representations.

Result: SlepNet outperforms baselines in fMRI and traffic datasets, offering better resolution for distinguishing similar patterns and representing brain signaling trajectories.

Conclusion: SlepNet is effective for both prediction and representation learning in spatiotemporal data, with potential for downstream tasks.

Abstract: Graph neural networks have been useful in machine learning on
graph-structured data, particularly for node classification and some types of
graph classification tasks. However, they have had limited use in representing
patterning of signals over graphs. Patterning of signals over graphs and in
subgraphs carries important information in many domains including neuroscience.
Neural signals are spatiotemporally patterned, high dimensional and difficult
to decode. Graph signal processing and associated GCN models utilize the graph
Fourier transform and are unable to efficiently represent spatially or
spectrally localized signal patterning on graphs. Wavelet transforms have shown
promise here, but offer non-canonical representations and cannot be tightly
confined to subgraphs. Here we propose SlepNet, a novel GCN architecture that
uses Slepian bases rather than graph Fourier harmonics. In SlepNet, the Slepian
harmonics optimally concentrate signal energy on specifically relevant
subgraphs that are automatically learned with a mask. Thus, they can produce
canonical and highly resolved representations of neural activity, focusing
energy of harmonics on areas of the brain which are activated. We evaluated
SlepNet across three fMRI datasets, spanning cognitive and visual tasks, and
two traffic dynamics datasets, comparing its performance against conventional
GNNs and graph signal processing constructs. SlepNet outperforms the baselines
in all datasets. Moreover, the extracted representations of signal patterns
from SlepNet offers more resolution in distinguishing between similar patterns,
and thus represent brain signaling transients as informative trajectories. Here
we have shown that these extracted trajectory representations can be used for
other downstream untrained tasks. Thus we establish that SlepNet is useful both
for prediction and representation learning in spatiotemporal data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in RL with diverse action types (discrete, continuous, mixed) by reparameterizing actions as distribution parameters, simplifying the action space and improving gradient estimation.

Method: Introduces DPPG, a generalized deterministic policy gradient estimator, and DPAC, an actor-critic algorithm based on TD3, enhanced by interpolated critic learning (ICL) for better performance.

Result: DPAC outperforms TD3 in MuJoCo tasks and shows competitive performance in discretized action spaces.

Conclusion: The framework and DPAC algorithm effectively generalize RL to diverse action spaces, offering improved performance and lower gradient variance.

Abstract: We introduce a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework that treats
distribution parameters as actions, redefining the boundary between agent and
environment. This reparameterization makes the new action space continuous,
regardless of the original action type (discrete, continuous, mixed, etc.).
Under this new parameterization, we develop a generalized deterministic policy
gradient estimator, Distribution Parameter Policy Gradient (DPPG), which has
lower variance than the gradient in the original action space. Although
learning the critic over distribution parameters poses new challenges, we
introduce interpolated critic learning (ICL), a simple yet effective strategy
to enhance learning, supported by insights from bandit settings. Building on
TD3, a strong baseline for continuous control, we propose a practical
DPPG-based actor-critic algorithm, Distribution Parameter Actor-Critic (DPAC).
Empirically, DPAC outperforms TD3 in MuJoCo continuous control tasks from
OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control Suite, and demonstrates competitive performance
on the same environments with discretized action spaces.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DEBIAS algorithm optimizes outcome definitions to maximize causal identifiability in psychiatric longitudinal data, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in causal inference due to symptom heterogeneity and latent confounding in psychiatry.

Method: DEBIAS learns non-negative, interpretable weights for outcome aggregation, leveraging time-limited treatment effects to minimize confounding.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in depression and schizophrenia experiments.

Conclusion: DEBIAS provides a robust solution for causal inference in psychiatry with verifiable unconfoundedness.

Abstract: Causal inference in longitudinal biomedical data remains a central challenge,
especially in psychiatry, where symptom heterogeneity and latent confounding
frequently undermine classical estimators. Most existing methods for treatment
effect estimation presuppose a fixed outcome variable and address confounding
through observed covariate adjustment. However, the assumption of
unconfoundedness may not hold for a fixed outcome in practice. To address this
foundational limitation, we directly optimize the outcome definition to
maximize causal identifiability. Our DEBIAS (Durable Effects with
Backdoor-Invariant Aggregated Symptoms) algorithm learns non-negative,
clinically interpretable weights for outcome aggregation, maximizing durable
treatment effects and empirically minimizing both observed and latent
confounding by leveraging the time-limited direct effects of prior treatments
in psychiatric longitudinal data. The algorithm also furnishes an empirically
verifiable test for outcome unconfoundedness. DEBIAS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in recovering causal effects for clinically
interpretable composite outcomes across comprehensive experiments in depression
and schizophrenia.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SORE (Semantic Outlier Removal) is a cost-effective method using multilingual sentence embeddings and nearest-neighbor search to remove unwanted text segments, achieving near-LLM precision at lower cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional text processing methods fail in multilingual and context-sensitive settings, while LLMs are costly. SORE aims to bridge this gap.

Method: SORE uses metadata embedding to identify core content and flags segments matching outlier groups or deviating from the core.

Result: SORE outperforms structural methods and achieves high precision in diverse scenarios, processing millions of documents daily.

Conclusion: SORE offers an efficient, accurate alternative to LLMs for text processing, with released implementation for reproducibility.

Abstract: Modern text processing pipelines demand robust methods to remove extraneous
content while preserving a document's core message. Traditional approaches such
as HTML boilerplate extraction or keyword filters often fail in multilingual
settings and struggle with context-sensitive nuances, whereas Large Language
Models (LLMs) offer improved quality at high computational cost. We introduce
SORE (Semantic Outlier Removal), a cost-effective, transparent method that
leverages multilingual sentence embeddings and approximate nearest-neighbor
search to identify and excise unwanted text segments. By first identifying core
content via metadata embedding and then flagging segments that either closely
match predefined outlier groups or deviate significantly from the core, SORE
achieves near-LLM extraction precision at a fraction of the cost. Experiments
on HTML datasets demonstrate that SORE outperforms structural methods and yield
high precision in diverse scenarios. Our system is currently deployed in
production, processing millions of documents daily across multiple languages
while maintaining both efficiency and accuracy. To facilitate reproducibility
and further research, we release our implementation and evaluation datasets.

### [360] [A Distributional-Lifting Theorem for PAC Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16651)
*Guy Blanc,Jane Lange,Carmen Strassle,Li-Yang Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a distributional-lifting theorem to extend efficient learning from limited distribution families to any distribution, improving on prior work by avoiding the need for strong access or learning the target distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient distribution-free PAC learning is challenging, leading to reliance on distribution-specific assumptions, which limits algorithm applicability. The goal is to generalize learning without such constraints.

Method: The paper proves a distributional-lifting theorem, upgrading a learner for a limited distribution family to work for any distribution, with efficiency tied to the complexity of expressing the target distribution as a mixture. It contrasts with prior work requiring strong access (conditional sample oracle) and instead avoids learning the target distribution directly.

Result: The proposed lifter works in the standard PAC model, applies to all base distribution families, preserves noise tolerance, improves sample complexity, and simplifies the process compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: The new approach overcomes limitations of prior work by providing a more general, efficient, and simpler solution for distribution-free learning, validated by theoretical and practical advantages.

Abstract: The apparent difficulty of efficient distribution-free PAC learning has led
to a large body of work on distribution-specific learning. Distributional
assumptions facilitate the design of efficient algorithms but also limit their
reach and relevance. Towards addressing this, we prove a distributional-lifting
theorem: This upgrades a learner that succeeds with respect to a limited
distribution family $\mathcal{D}$ to one that succeeds with respect to any
distribution $D^\star$, with an efficiency overhead that scales with the
complexity of expressing $D^\star$ as a mixture of distributions in
$\mathcal{D}$.
  Recent work of Blanc, Lange, Malik, and Tan considered the special case of
lifting uniform-distribution learners and designed a lifter that uses a
conditional sample oracle for $D^\star$, a strong form of access not afforded
by the standard PAC model. Their approach, which draws on ideas from
semi-supervised learning, first learns $D^\star$ and then uses this information
to lift.
  We show that their approach is information-theoretically intractable with
access only to random examples, thereby giving formal justification for their
use of the conditional sample oracle. We then take a different approach that
sidesteps the need to learn $D^\star$, yielding a lifter that works in the
standard PAC model and enjoys additional advantages: it works for all base
distribution families, preserves the noise tolerance of learners, has better
sample complexity, and is simpler.

*Vijay Prakash Dwivedi,Charilaos Kanatsoulis,Shenyang Huang,Jure Leskovec*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reviews Relational Deep Learning (RDL), which transforms relational databases into relational entity graphs for end-to-end learning, addressing challenges like multi-table integration and temporal dynamics while exploring unification opportunities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between graph machine learning and relational databases by introducing RDL, enabling representation learning without traditional feature engineering.

Method: Represent relational databases as relational entity graphs, review benchmark datasets, and survey GNN-based RDL models and architectural advances.

Result: Identifies challenges (e.g., multi-table integration, temporal dynamics) and opportunities for unifying graph machine learning sub-fields.

Conclusion: RDL can unify diverse challenges in graph machine learning, paving the way for foundation models to revolutionize relational data processing.

Abstract: Graph machine learning has led to a significant increase in the capabilities
of models that learn on arbitrary graph-structured data and has been applied to
molecules, social networks, recommendation systems, and transportation, among
other domains. Data in multi-tabular relational databases can also be
constructed as 'relational entity graphs' for Relational Deep Learning (RDL) -
a new blueprint that enables end-to-end representation learning without
traditional feature engineering. Compared to arbitrary graph-structured data,
relational entity graphs have key properties: (i) their structure is defined by
primary-foreign key relationships between entities in different tables, (ii)
the structural connectivity is a function of the relational schema defining a
database, and (iii) the graph connectivity is temporal and heterogeneous in
nature. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of RDL by first
introducing the representation of relational databases as relational entity
graphs, and then reviewing public benchmark datasets that have been used to
develop and evaluate recent GNN-based RDL models. We discuss key challenges
including large-scale multi-table integration and the complexities of modeling
temporal dynamics and heterogeneous data, while also surveying foundational
neural network methods and recent architectural advances specialized for
relational entity graphs. Finally, we explore opportunities to unify these
distinct modeling challenges, highlighting how RDL converges multiple
sub-fields in graph machine learning towards the design of foundation models
that can transform the processing of relational data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Mesh-Informed Neural Operator (MINO) to overcome limitations of current functional generative models, expanding their applicability to diverse domains and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current functional generative models, like the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), are limited to regular grids and rectangular domains, restricting their broader scientific and engineering applications.

Method: MINO leverages graph neural operators and cross-attention mechanisms to create a domain- and discretization-agnostic backbone for generative modeling in function spaces.

Result: MINO significantly broadens the applicability of functional generative models and provides a unified framework for integrating neural operators with advanced deep learning architectures.

Conclusion: The introduction of MINO and standardized evaluation metrics advances the field of functional generative modeling, enabling more diverse applications and objective comparisons.

Abstract: Generative models in function spaces, situated at the intersection of
generative modeling and operator learning, are attracting increasing attention
due to their immense potential in diverse scientific and engineering
applications. While functional generative models are theoretically domain- and
discretization-agnostic, current implementations heavily rely on the Fourier
Neural Operator (FNO), limiting their applicability to regular grids and
rectangular domains. To overcome these critical limitations, we introduce the
Mesh-Informed Neural Operator (MINO). By leveraging graph neural operators and
cross-attention mechanisms, MINO offers a principled, domain- and
discretization-agnostic backbone for generative modeling in function spaces.
This advancement significantly expands the scope of such models to more diverse
applications in generative, inverse, and regression tasks. Furthermore, MINO
provides a unified perspective on integrating neural operators with general
advanced deep learning architectures. Finally, we introduce a suite of
standardized evaluation metrics that enable objective comparison of functional
generative models, addressing another critical gap in the field.

### [363] [A Minimalist Optimizer Design for LLM Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16659)
*Athanasios Glentis,Jiaxiang Li,Andi Han,Mingyi Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SCALE, a new optimizer combining column-normalized SGD and last-layer momentum, matches or exceeds Adam's performance while using 35-45% less memory, outperforming other memory-efficient optimizers like GaLore and APOLLO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the minimal optimizer state needed for state-of-the-art LLM pretraining performance and reduce memory consumption.

Method: Systematic investigation using column-wise gradient normalization and first-order momentum only in the output layer, leading to the SCALE optimizer.

Result: SCALE matches or outperforms Adam and other optimizers in performance while using significantly less memory, especially for LLaMA models.

Conclusion: SCALE is an efficient, memory-saving optimizer for LLM pretraining and serves as a minimalist baseline for future optimizer designs.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) typically relies on adaptive optimizers
such as Adam, which require significant memory to maintain first- and
second-moment matrices, known as optimizer states. While recent works such as
GaLore, Fira, and APOLLO have proposed state-compressed variants to reduce
memory consumption, a fundamental question remains: What is the minimal amount
of optimizer state that is truly necessary to retain state-of-the-art
performance in LLM pretraining? In this work, we systematically investigate
this question using a bottom-up approach. We find that two memory- and
compute-efficient optimization techniques are particularly effective: (1)
column-wise gradient normalization significantly boosts the performance of
plain SGD without requiring momentum; and (2) adding first-order momentum only
to the output layer - where gradient variance is highest - yields performance
competitive with fully adaptive methods such as Muon. Based on these insights,
we propose SCALE (Stochastic Column-normalized Last-layer Momentum), a new
optimizer that combines column-normalized SGD with last-layer momentum, where
column normalization refers to normalizing the gradient along the output
dimension. Across multiple LLaMA models (60M-1B), SCALE matches or exceeds the
performance of Adam while using only 35-45% of the total memory. It also
consistently outperforms memory-efficient optimizers such as GaLore, Fira, and
APOLLO, making it a strong candidate for large-scale pretraining under memory
constraints. For the LLaMA 7B model, SCALE outperforms the state-of-the-art
method APOLLO in terms of both perplexity and memory consumption. In addition,
our method serves as a minimalist baseline for more sophisticated optimizer
design.

*Felix Zhou,Samson Zhou,Vahab Mirrokni,Alessandro Epasto,Vincent Cohen-Addad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel method for generating differentially private synthetic image embeddings using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) achieves SOTA classification accuracy and realistic image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns in deep learning by preventing sensitive data memorization and leakage through differential privacy (DP) and synthetic data.

Method: Privately fit a GMM in an embedding space using DP clustering, then train a simple neural network on synthetic embeddings.

Result: Achieves SOTA classification accuracy on benchmarks and generates realistic synthetic images.

Conclusion: The method is general, scalable, and effective for privacy-preserving deep learning.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often use large, high-quality datasets to achieve high
performance on many machine learning tasks. When training involves potentially
sensitive data, this process can raise privacy concerns, as large models have
been shown to unintentionally memorize and reveal sensitive information,
including reconstructing entire training samples. Differential privacy (DP)
provides a robust framework for protecting individual data and in particular, a
new approach to privately training deep neural networks is to approximate the
input dataset with a privately generated synthetic dataset, before any
subsequent training algorithm. We introduce a novel principled method for DP
synthetic image embedding generation, based on fitting a Gaussian Mixture Model
(GMM) in an appropriate embedding space using DP clustering. Our method
provably learns a GMM under separation conditions. Empirically, a simple
two-layer neural network trained on synthetically generated embeddings achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) classification accuracy on standard benchmark datasets.
Additionally, we demonstrate that our method can generate realistic synthetic
images that achieve downstream classification accuracy comparable to SOTA
methods. Our method is quite general, as the encoder and decoder modules can be
freely substituted to suit different tasks. It is also highly scalable,
consisting only of subroutines that scale linearly with the number of samples
and/or can be implemented efficiently in distributed systems.

*Zhiying Qiu,Tao Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an uncertainty-aware weighting function for diffusion models in offline RL, improving training efficiency and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models in offline RL face high training costs and slow convergence, especially with transformer-based backbones, due to ineffective loss weighting functions.

Method: The authors derive a variationally optimal uncertainty-aware weighting function and propose a closed-form polynomial approximation for online estimation, integrating it into a diffusion planning pipeline.

Result: Experiments on Maze2D and Kitchen benchmarks show the method achieves competitive performance with up to 10x fewer training steps.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances training efficiency and stability in diffusion-based offline RL, demonstrating practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promise in offline RL. However, these
methods often suffer from high training costs and slow convergence,
particularly when using transformer-based denoising backbones. While several
optimization strategies have been proposed -- such as modified noise schedules,
auxiliary prediction targets, and adaptive loss weighting -- challenges remain
in achieving stable and efficient training. In particular, existing loss
weighting functions typically rely on neural network approximators, which can
be ineffective in early training phases due to limited generalization capacity
of MLPs when exposed to sparse feedback in the early training stages. In this
work, we derive a variationally optimal uncertainty-aware weighting function
and introduce a closed-form polynomial approximation method for its online
estimation under the flow-based generative modeling framework. We integrate our
method into a diffusion planning pipeline and evaluate it on standard offline
RL benchmarks. Experimental results on Maze2D and Kitchen tasks show that our
method achieves competitive performance with up to 10 times fewer training
steps, highlighting its practical effectiveness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a novel method using vector quantization (VQ) to create compact Semantic IDs (SIDs) for efficient ad-recommendation systems, improving performance and reducing storage costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of scaling embeddings in real-time prediction models due to high storage and inference costs.

Method: Introduces VQ fusion for multi-task embedding fusion, SIDE for SID-to-embedding conversion, and DPCA for enhanced quantization.

Result: Achieves 2.4X improvement in normalized entropy gain and 3X reduction in data footprint.

Conclusion: The proposed innovations significantly enhance efficiency and performance in large-scale ad-recommendation systems.

Abstract: Sequence-based recommendations models are driving the state-of-the-art for
industrial ad-recommendation systems. Such systems typically deal with user
histories or sequence lengths ranging in the order of O(10^3) to O(10^4)
events. While adding embeddings at this scale is manageable in pre-trained
models, incorporating them into real-time prediction models is challenging due
to both storage and inference costs. To address this scaling challenge, we
propose a novel approach that leverages vector quantization (VQ) to inject a
compact Semantic ID (SID) as input to the recommendation models instead of a
collection of embeddings. Our method builds on recent works of SIDs by
introducing three key innovations: (i) a multi-task VQ-VAE framework, called VQ
fusion that fuses multiple content embeddings and categorical predictions into
a single Semantic ID; (ii) a parameter-free, highly granular SID-to-embedding
conversion technique, called SIDE, that is validated with two content embedding
collections, thereby eliminating the need for a large parameterized lookup
table; and (iii) a novel quantization method called Discrete-PCA (DPCA) which
generalizes and enhances residual quantization techniques. The proposed
enhancements when applied to a large-scale industrial ads-recommendation system
achieves 2.4X improvement in normalized entropy (NE) gain and 3X reduction in
data footprint compared to traditional SID methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the domain shattering dimension to quantify the number of domains needed for domain generalization, linking it to VC dimension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address how many domains are required to learn a model that generalizes well across seen and unseen domains.

Method: Model the problem in the PAC framework and introduce the domain shattering dimension.

Result: The domain shattering dimension characterizes domain sample complexity and relates to VC dimension.

Conclusion: Hypothesis classes learnable in PAC are also learnable in this domain generalization setting.

Abstract: We study a fundamental question of domain generalization: given a family of
domains (i.e., data distributions), how many randomly sampled domains do we
need to collect data from in order to learn a model that performs reasonably
well on every seen and unseen domain in the family? We model this problem in
the PAC framework and introduce a new combinatorial measure, which we call the
domain shattering dimension. We show that this dimension characterizes the
domain sample complexity. Furthermore, we establish a tight quantitative
relationship between the domain shattering dimension and the classic VC
dimension, demonstrating that every hypothesis class that is learnable in the
standard PAC setting is also learnable in our setting.

### [368] [TriCon-SF: A Triple-Shuffle and Contribution-Aware Serial Federated Learning Framework for Heterogeneous Healthcare Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16723)
*Yuping Yan,Yizhi Wang,Yuanshuai Li,Yaochu Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TriCon-SF is a serial federated learning framework with triple shuffling and contribution awareness, enhancing privacy and robustness in cross-silo settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy violations, gradient leakage, and malicious client behavior in serial pipeline federated learning, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare.

Method: Integrates triple shuffling (model layers, data segments, training sequences) and Shapley value-based contribution evaluation.

Result: Outperforms standard federated learning in accuracy and communication efficiency, with proven resilience against privacy attacks.

Conclusion: TriCon-SF effectively balances privacy, robustness, and efficiency in federated learning, making it suitable for sensitive applications.

Abstract: Serial pipeline training is an efficient paradigm for handling data
heterogeneity in cross-silo federated learning with low communication overhead.
However, even without centralized aggregation, direct transfer of models
between clients can violate privacy regulations and remain susceptible to
gradient leakage and linkage attacks. Additionally, ensuring resilience against
semi-honest or malicious clients who may manipulate or misuse received models
remains a grand challenge, particularly in privacy-sensitive domains such as
healthcare. To address these challenges, we propose TriCon-SF, a novel serial
federated learning framework that integrates triple shuffling and contribution
awareness. TriCon-SF introduces three levels of randomization by shuffling
model layers, data segments, and training sequences to break deterministic
learning patterns and disrupt potential attack vectors, thereby enhancing
privacy and robustness. In parallel, it leverages Shapley value methods to
dynamically evaluate client contributions during training, enabling the
detection of dishonest behavior and enhancing system accountability. Extensive
experiments on non-IID healthcare datasets demonstrate that TriCon-SF
outperforms standard serial and parallel federated learning in both accuracy
and communication efficiency. Security analysis further supports its resilience
against client-side privacy attacks.

### [369] [On Training-Test (Mis)alignment in Unsupervised Combinatorial Optimization: Observation, Empirical Exploration, and Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16732)
*Fanchen Bu,Kijung Shin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights a misalignment between training and testing in unsupervised combinatorial optimization (UCO) and proposes a preliminary idea to address it by integrating differentiable derandomization into training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UCO methods show a disconnect between training losses and post-derandomization performance, even without data distribution shifts.

Method: The study explores including a differentiable version of derandomization during training to better align training and testing phases.

Result: Empirical results indicate improved alignment but also introduce new training challenges.

Conclusion: The proposed idea shows promise for enhancing UCO methods but requires further refinement to address training difficulties.

Abstract: In unsupervised combinatorial optimization (UCO), during training, one aims
to have continuous decisions that are promising in a probabilistic sense for
each training instance, which enables end-to-end training on initially discrete
and non-differentiable problems. At the test time, for each test instance,
starting from continuous decisions, derandomization is typically applied to
obtain the final deterministic decisions. Researchers have developed more and
more powerful test-time derandomization schemes to enhance the empirical
performance and the theoretical guarantee of UCO methods. However, we notice a
misalignment between training and testing in the existing UCO methods.
Consequently, lower training losses do not necessarily entail better
post-derandomization performance, even for the training instances without any
data distribution shift. Empirically, we indeed observe such undesirable cases.
We explore a preliminary idea to better align training and testing in UCO by
including a differentiable version of derandomization into training. Our
empirical exploration shows that such an idea indeed improves training-test
alignment, but also introduces nontrivial challenges into training.

*John Lazarsfeld,Georgios Piliouras,Ryann Sim,Stratis Skoulakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Optimistic Fictitious Play achieves constant regret in two-strategy zero-sum games without regularization, outperforming Alternating Fictitious Play, which has a regret lower bound of Ω(√T).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether non-no-regret algorithms like Optimistic Fictitious Play can achieve fast learning rates in games, similar to regularized methods.

Method: Analyzes Optimistic Fictitious Play in the dual space of payoff vectors, using a geometric view and an energy function to bound iterates.

Result: Optimistic Fictitious Play achieves constant regret in two-strategy games, while Alternating Fictitious Play has a regret lower bound of Ω(√T).

Conclusion: Optimism enables fast learning in games without regularization, while alternation does not, highlighting a key difference in their performance.

Abstract: This paper studies the optimistic variant of Fictitious Play for learning in
two-player zero-sum games. While it is known that Optimistic FTRL -- a
regularized algorithm with a bounded stepsize parameter -- obtains constant
regret in this setting, we show for the first time that similar, optimal rates
are also achievable without regularization: we prove for two-strategy games
that Optimistic Fictitious Play (using any tiebreaking rule) obtains only
constant regret, providing surprising new evidence on the ability of
non-no-regret algorithms for fast learning in games. Our proof technique
leverages a geometric view of Optimistic Fictitious Play in the dual space of
payoff vectors, where we show a certain energy function of the iterates remains
bounded over time. Additionally, we also prove a regret lower bound of
$\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ for Alternating Fictitious Play. In the unregularized
regime, this separates the ability of optimism and alternation in achieving
$o(\sqrt{T})$ regret.

TL;DR: The paper compares fusion strategies for decoding hand gestures using multimodal biosignals, finding Hierarchical Transformer with attention-based fusion outperforms others. Cross-modal interactions contribute significantly to decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decoding neuromuscular signatures for hand gestures is crucial for neuroscience and prosthetics, but traditional methods rely on single modalities. Multimodal fusion can leverage complementary sensor data.

Method: Compares linear and attention-based fusion in three architectures (Multimodal MLP, Multimodal Transformer, Hierarchical Transformer) using datasets NinaPro DB2 and HD-sEMG 65-Gesture. Introduces an Isolation Network to study modality interactions.

Result: Hierarchical Transformer with attention-based fusion achieved highest accuracy (10% and 3.7% improvements). Cross-modal interactions contributed ~30% to decisions.

Conclusion: Attention-driven fusion enhances biosignal classification, providing insights for neurorobotic system design and human muscle activity understanding.

Abstract: Hand gestures are a primary output of the human motor system, yet the
decoding of their neuromuscular signatures remains a bottleneck for basic
neuroscience and assistive technologies such as prosthetics. Traditional
human-machine interface pipelines rely on a single biosignal modality, but
multimodal fusion can exploit complementary information from sensors. We
systematically compare linear and attention-based fusion strategies across
three architectures: a Multimodal MLP, a Multimodal Transformer, and a
Hierarchical Transformer, evaluating performance on scenarios with unimodal and
multimodal inputs. Experiments use two publicly available datasets: NinaPro DB2
(sEMG and accelerometer) and HD-sEMG 65-Gesture (high-density sEMG and force).
Across both datasets, the Hierarchical Transformer with attention-based fusion
consistently achieved the highest accuracy, surpassing the multimodal and best
single-modality linear-fusion MLP baseline by over 10% on NinaPro DB2 and 3.7%
on HD-sEMG. To investigate how modalities interact, we introduce an Isolation
Network that selectively silences unimodal or cross-modal attention pathways,
quantifying each group of token interactions' contribution to downstream
decisions. Ablations reveal that cross-modal interactions contribute
approximately 30% of the decision signal across transformer layers,
highlighting the importance of attention-driven fusion in harnessing
complementary modality information. Together, these findings reveal when and
how multimodal fusion would enhance biosignal classification and also provides
mechanistic insights of human muscle activities. The study would be beneficial
in the design of sensor arrays for neurorobotic systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel off-policy robust RL method addresses adversarial observations by reformulating adversarial learning as a softconstrained optimization problem, improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robust RL methods struggle with inefficiency due to mutual dependencies between agent and adversary, hindering offpolicy development.

Method: Proposes a softconstrained optimization approach, leveraging symmetric policy evaluation between agent and adversary.

Result: Eliminates need for additional environmental interactions, theoretically supported by symmetric properties.

Conclusion: The method offers an efficient solution for robust RL, with practical implementation available.

Abstract: Recently, robust reinforcement learning (RL) methods designed to handle
adversarial input observations have received significant attention, motivated
by RL's inherent vulnerabilities. While existing approaches have demonstrated
reasonable success, addressing worst-case scenarios over long time horizons
requires both minimizing the agent's cumulative rewards for adversaries and
training agents to counteract them through alternating learning. However, this
process introduces mutual dependencies between the agent and the adversary,
making interactions with the environment inefficient and hindering the
development of off-policy methods. In this work, we propose a novel off-policy
method that eliminates the need for additional environmental interactions by
reformulating adversarial learning as a soft-constrained optimization problem.
Our approach is theoretically supported by the symmetric property of policy
evaluation between the agent and the adversary. The implementation is available
at https://github.com/nakanakakosuke/VALT_SAC.

*Jongmin Park,Seunghoon Han,Won-Yong Shin,Sungsu Lim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes MHCL, a framework using multiple hyperbolic spaces to capture diverse structures in heterogeneous graphs, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hyperbolic embedding models for heterogeneous graphs use a single space, failing to capture diverse power-law structures.

Method: MHCL employs multiple hyperbolic spaces, contrastive learning, and metapath embeddings to improve discriminability.

Result: MHCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in graph tasks by effectively capturing complex structures.

Conclusion: MHCL successfully addresses the limitation of single-space models by leveraging multiple hyperbolic spaces and contrastive learning.

Abstract: The hyperbolic space, characterized by a constant negative curvature and
exponentially expanding space, aligns well with the structural properties of
heterogeneous graphs. However, although heterogeneous graphs inherently possess
diverse power-law structures, most hyperbolic heterogeneous graph embedding
models rely on a single hyperbolic space. This approach may fail to effectively
capture the diverse power-law structures within heterogeneous graphs. To
address this limitation, we propose a Metapath-based Hyperbolic Contrastive
Learning framework (MHCL), which uses multiple hyperbolic spaces to capture
diverse complex structures within heterogeneous graphs. Specifically, by
learning each hyperbolic space to describe the distribution of complex
structures corresponding to each metapath, it is possible to capture semantic
information effectively. Since metapath embeddings represent distinct semantic
information, preserving their discriminability is important when aggregating
them to obtain node representations. Therefore, we use a contrastive learning
approach to optimize MHCL and improve the discriminability of metapath
embeddings. In particular, our contrastive learning method minimizes the
distance between embeddings of the same metapath and maximizes the distance
between those of different metapaths in hyperbolic space, thereby improving the
separability of metapath embeddings with distinct semantic information. We
conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of MHCL. The
experimental results demonstrate that MHCL outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines in various graph machine learning tasks, effectively capturing the
complex structures of heterogeneous graphs.

*Youjin Kong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques the focus on distributive equality in fair-ML research, advocating for a broader egalitarian framework that addresses both allocative and representational harms by integrating distributive and relational equality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fair-ML research primarily relies on distributive equality, which inadequately addresses representational harms and structural inequalities perpetuated by ML systems.

Method: The paper proposes a multifaceted egalitarian framework, drawing on critical social and political philosophy, to integrate distributive and relational equality for a comprehensive ethical foundation.

Result: The framework offers a more holistic approach to fairness in ML, addressing both allocative and representational harms, and suggests practical implementation pathways.

Conclusion: A broader egalitarian approach is necessary to fully address the ethical challenges of ML fairness, moving beyond distributive equality to tackle structural inequalities and relational harms.

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning (ML) has become a rapidly growing area of
research. But why, in the first place, is unfairness in ML morally wrong? And
why should we care about improving fairness? Most fair-ML research implicitly
appeals to distributive equality: the idea that desirable goods and benefits,
such as opportunities (e.g., Barocas et al., 2023), should be equally
distributed across society. Unfair ML models, then, are seen as wrong because
they unequally distribute such benefits. This paper argues that this exclusive
focus on distributive equality offers an incomplete and potentially misleading
ethical foundation. Grounding ML fairness in egalitarianism -- the view that
equality is a fundamental moral and social ideal -- requires challenging
structural inequality: systematic, institutional, and durable arrangements that
privilege some groups while disadvantaging others. Structural inequality
manifests through ML systems in two primary forms: allocative harms (e.g.,
economic loss) and representational harms (e.g., stereotypes, erasure). While
distributive equality helps address allocative harms, it fails to explain why
representational harms are wrong -- why it is wrong for ML systems to reinforce
social hierarchies that stratify people into superior and inferior groups --
and why ML systems should aim to foster a society where people relate as equals
(i.e., relational equality). To address these limitations, the paper proposes a
multifaceted egalitarian framework for ML fairness that integrates both
distributive and relational equality. Drawing on critical social and political
philosophy, this framework offers a more comprehensive ethical foundation for
tackling the full spectrum of harms perpetuated by ML systems. The paper also
outlines practical pathways for implementing the framework across the ML
pipeline.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SeLoRA improves LoRA by reducing parameter redundancy using spectral bases, enhancing efficiency and performance without losing expressiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parameter redundancy in LoRA limits its capacity and efficiency, prompting the need for a more effective fine-tuning method.

Method: SeLoRA re-parameterizes LoRA using spectral bases from a sparse spectral subspace, integrating seamlessly with existing LoRA variants.

Result: SeLoRA achieves better efficiency and performance with fewer parameters across tasks like commonsense reasoning and code generation.

Conclusion: SeLoRA is a scalable, plug-and-play framework that outperforms baselines by leveraging spectral encoding for improved LoRA fine-tuning.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a prominent technique for
fine-tuning large foundation models. Despite its successes, the substantial
parameter redundancy, which limits the capacity and efficiency of LoRA, has
been recognized as a bottleneck. In this work, we systematically investigate
the impact of redundancy in fine-tuning LoRA and reveal that reducing density
redundancy does not degrade expressiveness. Based on this insight, we introduce
\underline{S}pectral-\underline{e}ncoding \underline{L}ow-\underline{R}ank
\underline{A}daptation (SeLoRA), which harnesses the robust expressiveness of

*Senmiao Wang,Yupeng Chen,Yushun Zhang,Ruoyu Sun,Tian Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPoGInit, a method to improve signal propagation in deep GNNs by optimizing initialization variances for three key metrics, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance degradation in deep GNNs by enhancing signal propagation through better initialization.

Method: Proposes SPoGInit, optimizing initialization variances for forward/backward propagation and graph embedding variation (GEV).

Result: SPoGInit outperforms common initialization methods, enabling better performance in deeper GNNs.

Conclusion: SPoGInit effectively addresses depth-related challenges in GNNs, validating the SP analysis framework.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often suffer from performance degradation as the
network depth increases. This paper addresses this issue by introducing
initialization methods that enhance signal propagation (SP) within GNNs. We
propose three key metrics for effective SP in GNNs: forward propagation,
backward propagation, and graph embedding variation (GEV). While the first two
metrics derive from classical SP theory, the third is specifically designed for
GNNs. We theoretically demonstrate that a broad range of commonly used
initialization methods for GNNs, which exhibit performance degradation with
increasing depth, fail to control these three metrics simultaneously. To deal
with this limitation, a direct exploitation of the SP analysis--searching for
weight initialization variances that optimize the three metrics--is shown to
significantly enhance the SP in deep GCNs. This approach is called Signal
Propagation on Graph-guided Initialization (SPoGInit). Our experiments
demonstrate that SPoGInit outperforms commonly used initialization methods on
various tasks and architectures. Notably, SPoGInit enables performance
improvements as GNNs deepen, which represents a significant advancement in
addressing depth-related challenges and highlights the validity and
effectiveness of the SP analysis framework.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TabArena introduces a continuously maintained benchmarking system for tabular data, addressing flaws in static benchmarks by curating datasets, models, and a public leaderboard.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for tabular data are static and not updated, leading to outdated evaluations. TabArena aims to provide a dynamic, reliable solution.

Method: TabArena manually curates datasets and models, conducts large-scale benchmarking, and establishes a public leaderboard with maintenance protocols.

Result: Gradient-boosted trees remain strong, but deep learning catches up with larger budgets. Foundation models excel on smaller datasets, and ensembles advance state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: TabArena offers a living benchmark with reproducible code and maintenance, improving evaluation standards for tabular machine learning.

Abstract: With the growing popularity of deep learning and foundation models for
tabular data, the need for standardized and reliable benchmarks is higher than
ever. However, current benchmarks are static. Their design is not updated even
if flaws are discovered, model versions are updated, or new models are
released. To address this, we introduce TabArena, the first continuously
maintained living tabular benchmarking system. To launch TabArena, we manually
curate a representative collection of datasets and well-implemented models,
conduct a large-scale benchmarking study to initialize a public leaderboard,
and assemble a team of experienced maintainers. Our results highlight the
influence of validation method and ensembling of hyperparameter configurations
to benchmark models at their full potential. While gradient-boosted trees are
still strong contenders on practical tabular datasets, we observe that deep
learning methods have caught up under larger time budgets with ensembling. At
the same time, foundation models excel on smaller datasets. Finally, we show
that ensembles across models advance the state-of-the-art in tabular machine
learning and investigate the contributions of individual models. We launch
TabArena with a public leaderboard, reproducible code, and maintenance
protocols to create a living benchmark available at https://tabarena.ai.

*Kai Yang,Shaoyu Dou,Pan Luo,Xin Wang,H. Vincent Poor*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes seq2GMM, a framework for identifying unusual quasi-periodic time series in networks, outperforming existing anomaly detection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To detect and understand anomalous quasi-periodic time series in networked sensor data, addressing variations in period and length.

Method: Develops seq2GMM, a sequence to Gaussian Mixture Model framework, with a surrogate-based optimization algorithm for efficient training.

Result: Seq2GMM outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods on benchmark datasets and includes theoretical convergence analysis.

Conclusion: Seq2GMM effectively identifies anomalies in quasi-periodic time series and provides interpretable results for human experts.

Abstract: Many real-world multivariate time series are collected from a network of
physical objects embedded with software, electronics, and sensors. The
quasi-periodic signals generated by these objects often follow a similar
repetitive and periodic pattern, but have variations in the period, and come in
different lengths caused by timing (synchronization) errors. Given a multitude
of such quasi-periodic time series, can we build machine learning models to
identify those time series that behave differently from the majority of the
observations? In addition, can the models help human experts to understand how
the decision was made? We propose a sequence to Gaussian Mixture Model
(seq2GMM) framework. The overarching goal of this framework is to identify
unusual and interesting time series within a network time series database. We
further develop a surrogate-based optimization algorithm that can efficiently
train the seq2GMM model. Seq2GMM exhibits strong empirical performance on a
plurality of public benchmark datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art anomaly
detection techniques by a significant margin. We also theoretically analyze the
convergence property of the proposed training algorithm and provide numerical
results to substantiate our theoretical claims.

TL;DR: LLMs extract concepts from materials science abstracts to suggest new research directions, outperforming keyword methods and inspiring experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The exponential growth of research makes it hard for scientists to keep up, necessitating tools to extract and link key concepts efficiently.

Method: Uses LLMs to build a concept graph from abstracts, trains a model to predict emerging concept combinations, and validates with expert interviews.

Result: LLMs outperform keyword extraction; integrating semantic info boosts prediction performance, inspiring new research ideas.

Conclusion: LLMs effectively aid creative research by predicting unexplored concept combinations, validated by expert feedback.

Abstract: Due to an exponential increase in published research articles, it is
impossible for individual scientists to read all publications, even within
their own research field. In this work, we investigate the use of large
language models (LLMs) for the purpose of extracting the main concepts and
semantic information from scientific abstracts in the domain of materials
science to find links that were not noticed by humans and thus to suggest
inspiring near/mid-term future research directions. We show that LLMs can
extract concepts more efficiently than automated keyword extraction methods to
build a concept graph as an abstraction of the scientific literature. A machine
learning model is trained to predict emerging combinations of concepts, i.e.
new research ideas, based on historical data. We demonstrate that integrating
semantic concept information leads to an increased prediction performance. The
applicability of our model is demonstrated in qualitative interviews with
domain experts based on individualized model suggestions. We show that the
model can inspire materials scientists in their creative thinking process by
predicting innovative combinations of topics that have not yet been
investigated.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedFitTech, a federated learning baseline for wearable fitness tracking, addressing privacy and efficiency challenges while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional centralized learning for fitness activity detection faces privacy, regulatory, and communication issues. Federated Learning (FL) offers a decentralized alternative but presents challenges like data imbalance and personalization-generalization trade-offs.

Method: The authors propose the FedFitTech baseline under the Flower framework, incorporating a client-side early stopping strategy. A case study demonstrates its usage, optimizing communication and performance.

Result: The system reduces redundant communications by 13% with only a 1% recognition performance cost, balancing common activity patterns and individual nuances.

Conclusion: FedFitTech provides a scalable, efficient foundation for privacy-aware fitness tracking applications, fostering new research opportunities. It is open-source and widely accessible.

Abstract: Rapid evolution of sensors and resource-efficient machine learning models
have spurred the widespread adoption of wearable fitness tracking devices.
Equipped with inertial sensors, such devices can continuously capture physical
movements for fitness technology (FitTech), enabling applications from sports
optimization to preventive healthcare. Traditional centralized learning
approaches to detect fitness activities struggle with privacy concerns,
regulatory constraints, and communication inefficiencies. In contrast,
Federated Learning (FL) enables a decentralized model training by communicating
model updates rather than private wearable sensor data. Applying FL to FitTech
presents unique challenges, such as data imbalance, lack of labelled data,
heterogeneous user activity patterns, and trade-offs between personalization
and generalization. To simplify research on FitTech in FL, we present the
FedFitTech baseline, under the Flower framework, which is publicly available
and widely used by both industry and academic researchers. Additionally, to
illustrate its usage, this paper presents a case study that implements a system
based on the FedFitTech baseline, incorporating a client-side early stopping
strategy and comparing the results. For instance, this system allows wearable
devices to optimize the trade-off between capturing common fitness activity
patterns and preserving individuals' nuances, thereby enhancing both the
scalability and efficiency of privacy-aware fitness tracking applications.
Results show that this reduces overall redundant communications by 13 percent,
while maintaining the overall recognition performance at a negligible
recognition cost by 1 percent. Thus, FedFitTech baseline creates a foundation
for a wide range of new research and development opportunities in FitTech, and
it is available as open-source at:

### [381] [Bandwidth Selectors on Semiparametric Bayesian Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16844)
*Victor Alejandre,Concha Bielza,Pedro Larrañaga*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores advanced bandwidth selectors for semiparametric Bayesian networks (SPBNs) to improve density estimation and predictive performance, outperforming the traditional normal rule.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data often deviates from normality, making the normal rule suboptimal for bandwidth selection in SPBNs. The study aims to enhance SPBN performance with better bandwidth selectors.

Method: Theoretical framework for state-of-the-art bandwidth selectors (cross-validation and plug-in) is established and evaluated. The open-source PyBNesian package is extended to include these techniques.

Result: Advanced bandwidth selectors, especially unbiased cross-validation, outperform the normal rule, particularly with larger datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed bandwidth selectors improve SPBN learning and applicability, with unbiased cross-validation being the most effective for high sample sizes.

Abstract: Semiparametric Bayesian networks (SPBNs) integrate parametric and
non-parametric probabilistic models, offering flexibility in learning complex
data distributions from samples. In particular, kernel density estimators
(KDEs) are employed for the non-parametric component. Under the assumption of
data normality, the normal rule is used to learn the bandwidth matrix for the
KDEs in SPBNs. This matrix is the key hyperparameter that controls the
trade-off between bias and variance. However, real-world data often deviates
from normality, potentially leading to suboptimal density estimation and
reduced predictive performance. This paper first establishes the theoretical
framework for the application of state-of-the-art bandwidth selectors and
subsequently evaluates their impact on SPBN performance. We explore the
approaches of cross-validation and plug-in selectors, assessing their
effectiveness in enhancing the learning capability and applicability of SPBNs.
To support this investigation, we have extended the open-source package
PyBNesian for SPBNs with the additional bandwidth selection techniques and
conducted extensive experimental analyses. Our results demonstrate that the
proposed bandwidth selectors leverage increasing information more effectively
than the normal rule, which, despite its robustness, stagnates with more data.
In particular, unbiased cross-validation generally outperforms the normal rule,
highlighting its advantage in high sample size scenarios.

### [382] [Soft decision trees for survival analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16846)
*Antonio Consoloa,Edoardo Amaldi,Emilio Carrizosa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new soft survival tree model (SST) is proposed, offering interpretability and flexibility by using soft splitting rules and optimizing via nonlinear decomposition. It outperforms benchmarks on 15 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve survival analysis by combining interpretability of decision trees with global optimization, addressing limitations of heuristic approaches.

Method: SST uses soft splitting rules and nonlinear optimization, allowing any smooth survival function (parametric, semiparametric, or nonparametric) via maximum likelihood.

Result: SST outperforms three benchmark survival trees on 15 datasets in discrimination and calibration measures.

Conclusion: SST provides a flexible, interpretable, and high-performing alternative for survival analysis, with potential for fairness extensions.

Abstract: Decision trees are popular in survival analysis for their interpretability
and ability to model complex relationships. Survival trees, which predict the
timing of singular events using censored historical data, are typically built
through heuristic approaches. Recently, there has been growing interest in
globally optimized trees, where the overall tree is trained by minimizing the
error function over all its parameters. We propose a new soft survival tree
model (SST), with a soft splitting rule at each branch node, trained via a
nonlinear optimization formulation amenable to decomposition. Since SSTs
provide for every input vector a specific survival function associated to a
single leaf node, they satisfy the conditional computation property and inherit
the related benefits. SST and the training formulation combine flexibility with
interpretability: any smooth survival function (parametric, semiparametric, or
nonparametric) estimated through maximum likelihood can be used, and each leaf
node of an SST yields a cluster of distinct survival functions which are
associated to the data points routed to it. Numerical experiments on 15
well-known datasets show that SSTs, with parametric and spline-based
semiparametric survival functions, trained using an adaptation of the
node-based decomposition algorithm proposed by Consolo et al. (2024) for soft
regression trees, outperform three benchmark survival trees in terms of four
widely-used discrimination and calibration measures. SSTs can also be extended
to consider group fairness.

*Semin Kim,Yeonwoo Cha,Jaehoon Yoo,Seunghoon Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RATTPO is a reward-agnostic method for optimizing text-to-image prompts using LLMs and feedback hints, outperforming specialized baselines in efficiency and versatility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt engineering methods are limited to specific reward models, hindering adaptability to new scenarios.

Method: RATTPO iteratively optimizes prompts using LLMs and reward-aware feedback hints, without requiring reward-specific task descriptions.

Result: RATTPO improves prompts across diverse reward setups, uses fewer inference budgets, and matches fine-tuned baselines with sufficient budget.

Conclusion: RATTPO offers a flexible and efficient solution for prompt optimization in text-to-image models, adaptable to various reward scenarios.

Abstract: We investigate a general approach for improving user prompts in text-to-image
(T2I) diffusion models by finding prompts that maximize a reward function
specified at test-time. Although diverse reward models are used for evaluating
image generation, existing automated prompt engineering methods typically
target specific reward configurations. Consequently, these specialized designs
exhibit suboptimal performance when applied to new prompt engineering scenarios
involving different reward models. To address this limitation, we introduce
RATTPO (Reward-Agnostic Test-Time Prompt Optimization), a flexible test-time
optimization method applicable across various reward scenarios without
modification. RATTPO iteratively searches for optimized prompts by querying
large language models (LLMs) \textit{without} requiring reward-specific task
descriptions. Instead, it uses the optimization trajectory and a novel
reward-aware feedback signal (termed a "hint") as context. Empirical results
demonstrate the versatility of RATTPO, effectively enhancing user prompts
across diverse reward setups that assess various generation aspects, such as
aesthetics, general human preference, or spatial relationships between objects.
RATTPO surpasses other test-time search baselines in search efficiency, using
up to 3.5 times less inference budget, and, given sufficient inference budget,
achieves performance comparable to learning-based baselines that require
reward-specific fine-tuning. The code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an unsupervised learning framework for learning similarities in event-triggered time series, combining hierarchical autoencoders and GMM for improved performance in security tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing similarity metrics for event-triggered time series in cybersecurity tasks like anomaly detection are unclear, necessitating a robust unsupervised learning approach.

Method: The framework uses hierarchical multi-resolution sequential autoencoders and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to learn low-dimensional representations of time series.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in qualitative and quantitative experiments.

Conclusion: The framework provides a systematic approach to modeling similarities in event-triggered time series, with potential applications in cybersecurity.

Abstract: Time series analysis has achieved great success in cyber security such as
intrusion detection and device identification. Learning similarities among
multiple time series is a crucial problem since it serves as the foundation for
downstream analysis. Due to the complex temporal dynamics of the
event-triggered time series, it often remains unclear which similarity metric
is appropriate for security-related tasks, such as anomaly detection and
clustering. The overarching goal of this paper is to develop an unsupervised
learning framework that is capable of learning similarities among a set of
event-triggered time series. From the machine learning vantage point, the
proposed framework harnesses the power of both hierarchical multi-resolution
sequential autoencoders and the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to effectively
learn the low-dimensional representations from the time series. Finally, the
obtained similarity measure can be easily visualized for the explanation. The
proposed framework aspires to offer a stepping stone that gives rise to a
systematic approach to model and learn similarities among a multitude of
event-triggered time series. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments, it is revealed that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art methods considerably.

*Qian Qi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a theoretical framework to determine the optimal depth of neural networks by modeling the forward pass as an optimal stopping problem, ensuring finite stopping depth and introducing a practical regularization term for early exiting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of determining neural network depth through costly experimentation motivates a theoretical approach to balance accuracy and computational efficiency.

Method: The method recasts ResNet's forward pass as an optimal stopping problem, proves finite stopping depth under diminishing returns, and introduces a regularization term ($\mathcal{L}_{\rm depth}$) for early exiting.

Result: Empirical validation on ImageNet shows improved computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy, sometimes even enhancing it.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges theory and practice, offering a scalable solution for optimizing neural network depth.

Abstract: Determining the optimal depth of a neural network is a fundamental yet
challenging problem, typically resolved through resource-intensive
experimentation. This paper introduces a formal theoretical framework to
address this question by recasting the forward pass of a deep network,
specifically a Residual Network (ResNet), as an optimal stopping problem. We
model the layer-by-layer evolution of hidden representations as a sequential
decision process where, at each layer, a choice is made between halting
computation to make a prediction or continuing to a deeper layer for a
potentially more refined representation. This formulation captures the
intrinsic trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. Our primary
theoretical contribution is a proof that, under a plausible condition of
diminishing returns on the residual functions, the expected optimal stopping
depth is provably finite, even in an infinite-horizon setting. We leverage this
insight to propose a novel and practical regularization term, $\mathcal{L}_{\rm
depth}$, that encourages the network to learn representations amenable to
efficient, early exiting. We demonstrate the generality of our framework by
extending it to the Transformer architecture and exploring its connection to
continuous-depth models via free-boundary problems. Empirical validation on
ImageNet confirms that our regularizer successfully induces the theoretically
predicted behavior, leading to significant gains in computational efficiency
without compromising, and in some cases improving, final model accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reconciles contradictory findings on model scale in continual learning by distinguishing between lazy and rich training regimes, showing that wider models reduce feature learning and forgetting. It uses dynamical mean field theory to analyze infinite width dynamics and identifies a critical feature learning level for optimal performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of model scale and feature learning in continual learning, addressing contradictory observations and incomplete understanding of catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Systematic study using variable parameterization to differentiate lazy and rich regimes, dynamical mean field theory for infinite width dynamics, and analysis of task similarity and non-stationarity.

Result: Wider models reduce feature learning (laziness) and forgetting; high feature learning benefits similar tasks. A transition exists between lazy and rich regimes based on task similarity. Optimal performance occurs at a critical feature learning level.

Conclusion: The study unifies perspectives on scale and feature learning in continual learning, showing their interplay with task non-stationarity and forgetting.

Abstract: Despite recent efforts, neural networks still struggle to learn in
non-stationary environments, and our understanding of catastrophic forgetting
(CF) is far from complete. In this work, we perform a systematic study on the
impact of model scale and the degree of feature learning in continual learning.
We reconcile existing contradictory observations on scale in the literature, by
differentiating between lazy and rich training regimes through a variable
parameterization of the architecture. We show that increasing model width is
only beneficial when it reduces the amount of feature learning, yielding more
laziness. Using the framework of dynamical mean field theory, we then study the
infinite width dynamics of the model in the feature learning regime and
characterize CF, extending prior theoretical results limited to the lazy
regime. We study the intricate relationship between feature learning, task
non-stationarity, and forgetting, finding that high feature learning is only
beneficial with highly similar tasks. We identify a transition modulated by
task similarity where the model exits an effectively lazy regime with low
forgetting to enter a rich regime with significant forgetting. Finally, our
findings reveal that neural networks achieve optimal performance at a critical
level of feature learning, which depends on task non-stationarity and transfers
across model scales. This work provides a unified perspective on the role of
scale and feature learning in continual learning.

*Sebastian Hönel,Jonas Nordqvist*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in unsupervised machine learning for defect detection in industrial settings, focusing on robustness and practical metrics, and proposes solutions for real-world applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual inspection in industrial production is costly and error-prone, and existing machine learning methods often fail in real-world, low-quality data scenarios.

Method: The study evaluates two state-of-the-art models for anomaly detection on low-quality RGB images of metal parts, focusing on robustness and practical improvements without new data.

Result: The work identifies common pitfalls in likelihood-based methods and proposes a framework for better empirical risk estimation in real-world applications.

Conclusion: The paper provides practical guidelines for practitioners to improve defect detection in industrial settings and highlights the limitations of traditional metrics like AUROC.

Abstract: The detection and localization of quality-related problems in industrially
mass-produced products has historically relied on manual inspection, which is
costly and error-prone. Machine learning has the potential to replace manual
handling. As such, the desire is to facilitate an unsupervised (or
self-supervised) approach, as it is often impossible to specify all conceivable
defects ahead of time. A plethora of prior works have demonstrated the aptitude
of common reconstruction-, embedding-, and synthesis-based methods in
laboratory settings. However, in practice, we observe that most methods do not
handle low data quality well or exude low robustness in unfavorable, but
typical real-world settings. For practitioners it may be very difficult to
identify the actual underlying problem when such methods underperform. Worse,
often-reported metrics (e.g., AUROC) are rarely suitable in practice and may
give misleading results. In our setting, we attempt to identify subtle
anomalies on the surface of blasted forged metal parts, using rather
low-quality RGB imagery only, which is a common industrial setting. We
specifically evaluate two types of state-of-the-art models that allow us to
identify and improve quality issues in production data, without having to
obtain new data. Our contribution is to provide guardrails for practitioners
that allow them to identify problems related to, e.g., (lack of) robustness or
invariance, in either the chosen model or the data reliably in similar
scenarios. Furthermore, we exemplify common pitfalls in and shortcomings of
likelihood-based approaches and outline a framework for proper empirical risk
estimation that is more suitable for real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine learning and deep learning models were used to predict neonatal mortality, with LSTM achieving the highest accuracy (99%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce neonatal deaths by enabling early prediction of at-risk newborns.

Method: Used historical data of 1.4 million newborns to train models like logistic regression, KNN, random forest, XGBoost, CNN, and LSTM.

Result: XGBoost and random forest achieved 94% accuracy; LSTM outperformed with 99%.

Conclusion: LSTM is the most suitable model for predicting neonatal mortality and guiding precautionary measures.

Abstract: Neonatal death is still a concerning reality for underdeveloped and even some
developed countries. Worldwide data indicate that 26.693 babies out of 1,000
births die, according to Macro Trades. To reduce this number, early prediction
of endangered babies is crucial. Such prediction enables the opportunity to
take ample care of the child and mother so that early child death can be
avoided. In this context, machine learning was used to determine whether a
newborn baby is at risk. To train the predictive model, historical data of 1.4
million newborns was used. Machine learning and deep learning techniques such
as logical regression, K-nearest neighbor, random forest classifier, extreme
gradient boosting (XGBoost), convolutional neural network, and long short-term
memory (LSTM) were implemented using the dataset to identify the most accurate
model for predicting neonatal mortality. Among the machine learning algorithms,
XGBoost and random forest classifier achieved the best accuracy with 94%, while
among the deep learning models, LSTM delivered the highest accuracy with 99%.
Therefore, using LSTM appears to be the most suitable approach to predict
whether precautionary measures for a child are necessary.

*Çağatay Demirel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RocketStack introduces a level-aware recursive ensemble framework for deep stacking, addressing challenges like model complexity and feature redundancy through pruning and feature compression, achieving improved accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in deep stacking (e.g., complexity, redundancy, computational burden) and explore deeper ensemble architectures beyond existing designs.

Method: Proposes RocketStack, a recursive framework with incremental pruning of weaker learners, mild Gaussian noise for OOF scores, and feature compression techniques (attention-based, SFE filter, autoencoders). Evaluated on 33 datasets.

Result: Improved accuracy with depth; binary subset achieved 97.08% (level 10), multi-class subset 98.60% (level 10). Reduced runtime and feature dimensionality significantly.

Conclusion: Mild randomization and periodic compression are effective for deep recursive ensembling, balancing performance and complexity.

Abstract: Ensemble learning remains a cornerstone of machine learning, with stacking
used to integrate predictions from multiple base learners through a meta-model.
However, deep stacking remains rare, as most designs prioritize horizontal
diversity over recursive depth due to model complexity, feature redundancy, and
computational burden. To address these challenges, RocketStack, a level-aware
recursive ensemble framework, is introduced and explored up to ten stacking
levels, extending beyond prior architectures. The framework incrementally
prunes weaker learners at each level, enabling deeper stacking without
excessive complexity. To mitigate early performance saturation, mild Gaussian
noise is added to out-of-fold (OOF) scores before pruning, and compared against
strict OOF pruning. Further both per-level and periodic feature compressions
are explored using attention-based selection, Simple, Fast, Efficient (SFE)
filter, and autoencoders. Across 33 datasets (23 binary, 10 multi-class),
linear-trend tests confirmed rising accuracy with depth in most variants, and
the top performing meta-model at each level increasingly outperformed the
strongest standalone ensemble. In the binary subset, periodic SFE with mild
OOF-score randomization reached 97.08% at level 10, 5.14% above the
strict-pruning configuration and cut runtime by 10.5% relative to no
compression. In the multi-class subset, periodic attention selection reached
98.60% at level 10, exceeding the strongest baseline by 6.11%, while reducing
runtime by 56.1% and feature dimensionality by 74% compared to no compression.
These findings highlight mild randomization as an effective regularizer and
periodic compression as a stabilizer. Echoing the design of multistage rockets
in aerospace (prune, compress, propel) RocketStack achieves deep recursive
ensembling with tractable complexity.

Result: Their method outperforms existing approaches, yielding higher-quality and more diverse candidates in synthetic and real-world tasks.

Conclusion: The work provides a flexible perspective for discrete compositional generation tasks, with practical improvements demonstrated.

Abstract: A major bottleneck in scientific discovery involves narrowing a large
combinatorial set of objects, such as proteins or molecules, to a small set of
promising candidates. While this process largely relies on expert knowledge,
recent methods leverage reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance this filtering.
They achieve this by estimating proxy reward functions from available datasets
and using regularization to generate more diverse candidates. These reward
functions are inherently uncertain, raising a particularly salient challenge
for scientific discovery. In this work, we show that existing methods, often
framed as sampling proportional to a reward function, are inadequate and yield
suboptimal candidates, especially in large search spaces. To remedy this issue,
we take a robust RL approach and introduce a unified operator that seeks
robustness to the uncertainty of the proxy reward function. This general
operator targets peakier sampling distributions while encompassing known soft
RL operators. It also leads us to a novel algorithm that identifies
higher-quality, diverse candidates in both synthetic and real-world tasks.
Ultimately, our work offers a new, flexible perspective on discrete
compositional generation tasks. Code: https://github.com/marcojira/tgm.

### [391] [The Hidden Cost of an Image: Quantifying the Energy Consumption of AI Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17016)
*Giulia Bertazzini,Chiara Albisani,Daniele Baracchi,Dasara Shullani,Roberto Verdecchia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the environmental impact of AI image generation by comparing energy consumption across 17 models, analyzing factors like resolution, quantization, and prompt length. Results reveal significant energy disparities and trade-offs with image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the environmental impact of AI image generation, given its growing adoption and resource demands.

Method: A comprehensive empirical experiment comparing 17 state-of-the-art models, evaluating energy consumption influenced by quantization, resolution, prompt length, and image quality metrics.

Result: Energy consumption varies up to 46x between models. Resolution inconsistently affects energy (1.3x-4.7x increase). U-Net models are more efficient than Transformer-based ones. Quantization reduces efficiency, while prompt length has no impact. High-quality images don't always require more energy.

Conclusion: AI image generation's energy impact varies widely, with efficiency not always tied to quality. Optimizing model choice and settings can reduce environmental costs.

Abstract: With the growing adoption of AI image generation, in conjunction with the
ever-increasing environmental resources demanded by AI, we are urged to answer
a fundamental question: What is the environmental impact hidden behind each
image we generate? In this research, we present a comprehensive empirical
experiment designed to assess the energy consumption of AI image generation.
Our experiment compares 17 state-of-the-art image generation models by
considering multiple factors that could affect their energy consumption, such
as model quantization, image resolution, and prompt length. Additionally, we
consider established image quality metrics to study potential trade-offs
between energy consumption and generated image quality. Results show that image
generation models vary drastically in terms of the energy they consume, with up
to a 46x difference. Image resolution affects energy consumption
inconsistently, ranging from a 1.3x to 4.7x increase when doubling resolution.
U-Net-based models tend to consume less than Transformer-based one. Model
quantization instead results to deteriorate the energy efficiency of most
models, while prompt length and content have no statistically significant
impact. Improving image quality does not always come at the cost of a higher
energy consumption, with some of the models producing the highest quality
images also being among the most energy efficient ones.

*Leizhen Wang,Peibo Duan,Cheng Lyu,Zewen Wang,Zhiqiang He,Nan Zheng,Zhenliang Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MARL-OD-DA, a scalable and reliable MARL framework for traffic assignment, outperforms traditional methods by redefining agents as OD pair routers and improving convergence efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address scalability and reliability challenges of MARL in large-scale traffic assignment problems due to increasing travel demands in metropolitan cities.

Method: Introduces MARL-OD-DA, where agents are OD pair routers, uses Dirichlet-based action space with pruning, and a reward function based on local relative gap.

Result: Achieves 94.99% lower relative gap than conventional methods in the SiouxFalls network, handling medium-sized networks effectively.

Conclusion: MARL-OD-DA enhances scalability and reliability, making it practical for large-scale traffic assignment problems.

Abstract: The evolution of metropolitan cities and the increase in travel demands
impose stringent requirements on traffic assignment methods. Multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches outperform traditional methods in
modeling adaptive routing behavior without requiring explicit system dynamics,
which is beneficial for real-world deployment. However, MARL frameworks face
challenges in scalability and reliability when managing extensive networks with
substantial travel demand, which limiting their practical applicability in
solving large-scale traffic assignment problems. To address these challenges,
this study introduces MARL-OD-DA, a new MARL framework for the traffic
assignment problem, which redefines agents as origin-destination (OD) pair
routers rather than individual travelers, significantly enhancing scalability.
Additionally, a Dirichlet-based action space with action pruning and a reward
function based on the local relative gap are designed to enhance solution
reliability and improve convergence efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that
the proposed MARL framework effectively handles medium-sized networks with
extensive and varied city-level OD demand, surpassing existing MARL methods.
When implemented in the SiouxFalls network, MARL-OD-DA achieves better
assignment solutions in 10 steps, with a relative gap that is 94.99% lower than
that of conventional methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A scoping review identifies 62 fairness metrics for clinical predictive AI, revealing fragmentation, limited validation, and gaps in clinical relevance and real-world applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unclear definition of fairness in clinical predictive AI and mitigate biases in healthcare outcomes.

Method: Conducted a scoping review of five databases (2014-2024), screening 820 records to include 41 studies and extract 62 fairness metrics. Metrics were classified by performance-dependency, model output level, and base performance metric.

Result: Identified a fragmented landscape with limited clinical validation, overreliance on threshold-dependent measures, and only one clinical utility metric.

Conclusion: Highlights conceptual challenges in fairness quantification and calls for prioritizing clinically meaningful metrics in future work.

Abstract: Predictive artificial intelligence (AI) offers an opportunity to improve
clinical practice and patient outcomes, but risks perpetuating biases if
fairness is inadequately addressed. However, the definition of "fairness"
remains unclear. We conducted a scoping review to identify and critically
appraise fairness metrics for clinical predictive AI. We defined a "fairness
metric" as a measure quantifying whether a model discriminates (societally)
against individuals or groups defined by sensitive attributes. We searched five
databases (2014-2024), screening 820 records, to include 41 studies, and
extracted 62 fairness metrics. Metrics were classified by
performance-dependency, model output level, and base performance metric,
revealing a fragmented landscape with limited clinical validation and
overreliance on threshold-dependent measures. Eighteen metrics were explicitly
developed for healthcare, including only one clinical utility metric. Our
findings highlight conceptual challenges in defining and quantifying fairness
and identify gaps in uncertainty quantification, intersectionality, and
real-world applicability. Future work should prioritise clinically meaningful
metrics.

*Elizabeth Fons,Alejandro Sztrajman,Yousef El-Laham,Luciana Ferrer,Svitlana Vyetrenko,Manuela Veloso*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A differentiable Lomb-Scargle layer is introduced for accurate power spectrum computation of irregularly sampled data, integrated into a score-based diffusion model (LSCD) for improved time series imputation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of missing or irregularly sampled data in machine learning, where traditional methods like FFT require uniform sampling and interpolation, potentially distorting spectra.

Method: Proposes a differentiable Lomb-Scargle layer for reliable power spectrum computation and integrates it into a score-based diffusion model (LSCD) for time series imputation, conditioned on the full signal spectrum.

Result: Outperforms time-domain baselines in recovering missing data and provides consistent frequency estimates, validated on synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method enables spectral guidance in machine learning for incomplete or irregular data, offering a practical and accurate solution for time series imputation.

Abstract: Time series with missing or irregularly sampled data are a persistent
challenge in machine learning. Many methods operate on the frequency-domain,
relying on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) which assumes uniform sampling,
therefore requiring prior interpolation that can distort the spectra. To
address this limitation, we introduce a differentiable Lomb--Scargle layer that
enables a reliable computation of the power spectrum of irregularly sampled
data. We integrate this layer into a novel score-based diffusion model (LSCD)
for time series imputation conditioned on the entire signal spectrum.
Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method
recovers missing data more accurately than purely time-domain baselines, while
simultaneously producing consistent frequency estimates. Crucially, our method
can be easily integrated into learning frameworks, enabling broader adoption of
spectral guidance in machine learning approaches involving incomplete or
irregular data.

*Joshua Schraven,Alexander Windmann,Oliver Niggemann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAWIFlow is a flow-based benchmark from MAWILAB v1.1 for realistic anomaly detection evaluation, showing deep learning outperforms traditional methods over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing synthetic datasets lack realism and temporal variability, limiting accurate evaluation of anomaly detection methods.

Method: A reproducible pipeline converts raw packet data to flow representations (CICFlowMeter format) with anomaly labels. Baselines include traditional ML (Decision Trees, Random Forests, etc.) and a CNN-BiLSTM model.

Result: Tree-based methods degrade over time, while CNN-BiLSTM maintains performance, highlighting the need for realistic datasets with temporal structure.

Conclusion: Realistic benchmarks like MAWIFlow and deep learning models improve generalization and reproducibility in anomaly detection.

Abstract: Benchmark datasets for network intrusion detection commonly rely on
synthetically generated traffic, which fails to reflect the statistical
variability and temporal drift encountered in operational environments. This
paper introduces MAWIFlow, a flow-based benchmark derived from the MAWILAB v1.1
dataset, designed to enable realistic and reproducible evaluation of anomaly
detection methods. A reproducible preprocessing pipeline is presented that
transforms raw packet captures into flow representations conforming to the
CICFlowMeter format, while preserving MAWILab's original anomaly labels. The
resulting datasets comprise temporally distinct samples from January 2011,
2016, and 2021, drawn from trans-Pacific backbone traffic.
  To establish reference baselines, traditional machine learning methods,
including Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression, are
compared to a deep learning model based on a CNN-BiLSTM architecture. Empirical
results demonstrate that tree-based classifiers perform well on temporally
static data but experience significant performance degradation over time. In
contrast, the CNN-BiLSTM model maintains better performance, thus showing
improved generalization. These findings underscore the limitations of synthetic
benchmarks and static models, and motivate the adoption of realistic datasets
with explicit temporal structure. All datasets, pipeline code, and model
implementations are made publicly available to foster transparency and
reproducibility.

*Haolin Liu,Adrien Siproudhis,Samuel Experton,Peter Lorenz,Christina Boura,Thomas Peyrin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper refines neural network signature extraction, addressing limitations like rank deficiency and noise propagation, enabling deeper network extraction with higher accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods for neural network model extraction, like Carlini et al.'s, had limitations restricting applicability to shallow networks. This work aims to overcome these challenges.

Method: The authors propose algorithmic solutions to address rank deficiency and noise propagation, improving signature extraction efficiency for deeper networks.

Result: Experiments show their method extracts deeper networks (e.g., 8 layers on CIFAR-10) with 95% accuracy, outperforming prior work limited to 3 layers.

Conclusion: This work advances practical attacks on complex neural networks by significantly improving extraction depth and accuracy.

Abstract: Neural network model extraction has emerged in recent years as an important
security concern, as adversaries attempt to recover a network's parameters via
black-box queries. A key step in this process is signature extraction, which
aims to recover the absolute values of the network's weights layer by layer.
Prior work, notably by Carlini et al. (2020), introduced a technique inspired
by differential cryptanalysis to extract neural network parameters. However,
their method suffers from several limitations that restrict its applicability
to networks with a few layers only. Later works focused on improving sign
extraction, but largely relied on the assumption that signature extraction
itself was feasible.
  In this work, we revisit and refine the signature extraction process by
systematically identifying and addressing for the first time critical
limitations of Carlini et al.'s signature extraction method. These limitations
include rank deficiency and noise propagation from deeper layers. To overcome
these challenges, we propose efficient algorithmic solutions for each of the
identified issues, greatly improving the efficiency of signature extraction.
Our approach permits the extraction of much deeper networks than was previously
possible. We validate our method through extensive experiments on ReLU-based
neural networks, demonstrating significant improvements in extraction depth and
accuracy. For instance, our extracted network matches the target network on at
least 95% of the input space for each of the eight layers of a neural network
trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, while previous works could barely extract the
first three layers. Our results represent a crucial step toward practical
attacks on larger and more complex neural network architectures.

### [397] [Flow-Based Non-stationary Temporal Regime Causal Structure Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17065)
*Abdellah Rahmani,Pascal Frossard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FANTOM is a framework for causal discovery in non-stationary, non-Gaussian, and heteroscedastic multivariate time series, identifying regime shifts and causal structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal relationships in multivariate time series with multiple regimes and complex noise distributions are challenging for existing methods, which assume stationarity or Gaussian noise.

Method: FANTOM uses a Bayesian Expectation Maximization algorithm to infer regimes, their boundaries, and Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) for each regime.

Result: Theoretical proofs show identifiability under mild assumptions, and experiments confirm FANTOM outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: FANTOM effectively addresses non-stationarity and complex noise in causal discovery, offering a robust solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships in multivariate time series is crucial in
many scenarios, such as those dealing with financial or neurological data. Many
such time series exhibit multiple regimes, i.e., consecutive temporal segments
with a priori unknown boundaries, with each regime having its own causal
structure. Inferring causal dependencies and regime shifts is critical for
analyzing the underlying processes. However, causal structure learning in this
setting is challenging due to (1) non stationarity, i.e., each regime can have
its own causal graph and mixing function, and (2) complex noise distributions,
which may be non Gaussian or heteroscedastic. Existing causal discovery
approaches cannot address these challenges, since generally assume stationarity
or Gaussian noise with constant variance. Hence, we introduce FANTOM, a unified
framework for causal discovery that handles non stationary processes along with
non Gaussian and heteroscedastic noises. FANTOM simultaneously infers the
number of regimes and their corresponding indices and learns each regime's
Directed Acyclic Graph. It uses a Bayesian Expectation Maximization algorithm
that maximizes the evidence lower bound of the data log likelihood. On the
theoretical side, we prove, under mild assumptions, that temporal
heteroscedastic causal models, introduced in FANTOM's formulation, are
identifiable in both stationary and non stationary settings. In addition,
extensive experiments on synthetic and real data show that FANTOM outperforms
existing methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the identifiability of deep Polynomial Neural Networks (PNNs), revealing connections between activation degrees, layer widths, and identifiability. It provides conditions for generic identifiability and resolves open conjectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the identifiability of PNNs is crucial for interpretability, but it remains poorly understood. This work aims to fill this gap.

Method: The study connects deep PNNs to low-rank tensor decompositions and uses Kruskal-type uniqueness theorems to analyze identifiability.

Result: Architectures with non-increasing layer widths are generically identifiable under mild conditions, and encoder-decoder networks are identifiable if decoder widths don't grow too rapidly.

Conclusion: The work provides theoretical insights into PNN identifiability, resolves conjectures, and offers practical conditions for achieving it.

Abstract: Polynomial Neural Networks (PNNs) possess a rich algebraic and geometric
structure. However, their identifiability -- a key property for ensuring
interpretability -- remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a
comprehensive analysis of the identifiability of deep PNNs, including
architectures with and without bias terms. Our results reveal an intricate
interplay between activation degrees and layer widths in achieving
identifiability. As special cases, we show that architectures with
non-increasing layer widths are generically identifiable under mild conditions,
while encoder-decoder networks are identifiable when the decoder widths do not
grow too rapidly. Our proofs are constructive and center on a connection
between deep PNNs and low-rank tensor decompositions, and Kruskal-type
uniqueness theorems. This yields both generic conditions determined by the
architecture, and effective conditions that depend on the network's parameters.
We also settle an open conjecture on the expected dimension of PNN's
neurovarieties, and provide new bounds on the activation degrees required for
it to reach its maximum.

*Botao Zhu,Xianbin Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Siamese-enabled framework (SRCTE) for rapid and continuous trust evaluation in collaborative systems, using ACFGs and a Siamese model to assess trustworthiness dynamically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trust evaluation in collaborative systems is challenging due to distributed devices, dynamic environments, and changing resources. Existing methods lack speed and adaptability.

Method: SRCTE uses ACFGs to represent trust-related data and a Siamese model (Structure2vec networks) to learn deep semantics and generate embeddings for trust evaluation.

Result: Experiments show SRCTE converges quickly with minimal data and outperforms baseline algorithms in anomaly trust detection.

Conclusion: SRCTE effectively addresses the challenge of dynamic trust evaluation in collaborative systems, offering rapid and accurate results.

Abstract: Trust is emerging as an effective tool to ensure the successful completion of
collaborative tasks within collaborative systems. However, rapidly and
continuously evaluating the trustworthiness of collaborators during task
execution is a significant challenge due to distributed devices, complex
operational environments, and dynamically changing resources. To tackle this
challenge, this paper proposes a Siamese-enabled rapid and continuous trust
evaluation framework (SRCTE) to facilitate effective task collaboration. First,
the communication and computing resource attributes of the collaborator in a
trusted state, along with historical collaboration data, are collected and
represented using an attributed control flow graph (ACFG) that captures
trust-related semantic information and serves as a reference for comparison
with data collected during task execution. At each time slot of task execution,
the collaborator's communication and computing resource attributes, as well as
task completion effectiveness, are collected in real time and represented with
an ACFG to convey their trust-related semantic information. A Siamese model,
consisting of two shared-parameter Structure2vec networks, is then employed to
learn the deep semantics of each pair of ACFGs and generate their embeddings.
Finally, the similarity between the embeddings of each pair of ACFGs is
calculated to determine the collaborator's trust value at each time slot. A
real system is built using two Dell EMC 5200 servers and a Google Pixel 8 to
test the effectiveness of the proposed SRCTE framework. Experimental results
demonstrate that SRCTE converges rapidly with only a small amount of data and
achieves a high anomaly trust detection rate compared to the baseline
algorithm.

TL;DR: Diffusion models in biochemistry show inconsistencies in generated samples and forces. A new energy-based model with Fokker-Planck regularization improves consistency and sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inconsistencies in diffusion models when used for coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, particularly at small timesteps.

Method: Propose an energy-based diffusion model with a Fokker-Planck-derived regularization term to enforce consistency.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on toy systems and alanine dipeptide, introducing a state-of-the-art transferable Boltzmann emulator.

Conclusion: The proposed model enhances consistency and sampling efficiency in simulations.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently gained significant attention due to their
effectiveness in various scientific domains, including biochemistry. When
trained on equilibrium molecular distributions, diffusion models provide both:
a generative procedure to sample equilibrium conformations and associated
forces derived from the model's scores. However, using the forces for
coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations uncovers inconsistencies in the
samples generated via classical diffusion inference and simulation, despite
both originating from the same model. Particularly at the small diffusion
timesteps required for simulations, diffusion models fail to satisfy the
Fokker-Planck equation, which governs how the score should evolve over time. We
interpret this deviation as an indication of the observed inconsistencies and
propose an energy-based diffusion model with a Fokker-Planck-derived
regularization term enforcing consistency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach on toy systems, alanine dipeptide, and introduce a
state-of-the-art transferable Boltzmann emulator for dipeptides that supports
simulation and demonstrates enhanced consistency and efficient sampling.

TL;DR: The paper explores offline RL with small datasets, introduces "Sparse-Reg" to prevent overfitting, and shows improved performance over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many offline RL applications use small datasets, but current benchmarks focus on large datasets, leading to overfitting issues.

Method: Proposes "Sparse-Reg," a sparsity-based regularization technique, to mitigate overfitting in small datasets.

Result: Sparse-Reg outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in continuous control tasks with limited data.

Conclusion: Sparse-Reg effectively addresses overfitting in small datasets, enhancing offline RL performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the use of small datasets in the context of
offline reinforcement learning (RL). While many common offline RL benchmarks
employ datasets with over a million data points, many offline RL applications
rely on considerably smaller datasets. We show that offline RL algorithms can
overfit on small datasets, resulting in poor performance. To address this
challenge, we introduce "Sparse-Reg": a regularization technique based on
sparsity to mitigate overfitting in offline reinforcement learning, enabling
effective learning in limited data settings and outperforming state-of-the-art
baselines in continuous control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a cohesive theoretical framework for understanding diverse generative models, enabling cross-architecture improvements and universal methodologies.

Method: Analyzes various generative models (autoencoders, autoregressive models, GANs, normalizing flows, diffusion models, flow matching) as transformations of simple distributions into complex data distributions.

Result: Demonstrates that all generative models fundamentally perform probability transformations, enabling methodological transfer and theoretical unification.

Conclusion: This perspective fosters more efficient and effective generative modeling by unifying diverse approaches under a single theoretical lens.

Abstract: This paper introduces a unified theoretical perspective that views deep
generative models as probability transformation functions. Despite the apparent
differences in architecture and training methodologies among various types of
generative models - autoencoders, autoregressive models, generative adversarial
networks, normalizing flows, diffusion models, and flow matching - we
demonstrate that they all fundamentally operate by transforming simple
predefined distributions into complex target data distributions. This unifying
perspective facilitates the transfer of methodological improvements between
model architectures and provides a foundation for developing universal
theoretical approaches, potentially leading to more efficient and effective
generative modeling techniques.

*Yuli Slavutsky,Ozgur Beker,David Blei,Bianca Dumitrascu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DISCoVeR is a new variational framework for disentangling condition-invariant and condition-specific factors in data, improving generalization in multi-condition settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address leakage in latent representations of existing VAE extensions, which limits generalization to unseen conditions, especially in biomedical data analysis.

Method: Introduces DISCoVeR with a dual-latent architecture, parallel reconstructions, and a max-min objective for clean separation without handcrafted priors.

Result: Achieves improved disentanglement on synthetic datasets, natural images, and single-cell RNA-seq data.

Conclusion: DISCoVeR is a principled approach for learning disentangled representations in multi-condition settings.

Abstract: Disentangled representations enable models to separate factors of variation
that are shared across experimental conditions from those that are
condition-specific. This separation is essential in domains such as biomedical
data analysis, where generalization to new treatments, patients, or species
depends on isolating stable biological signals from context-dependent effects.
While extensions of the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework have been
proposed to address this problem, they frequently suffer from leakage between
latent representations, limiting their ability to generalize to unseen
conditions. Here, we introduce DISCoVeR, a new variational framework that
explicitly separates condition-invariant and condition-specific factors.
DISCoVeR integrates three key components: (i) a dual-latent architecture that
models shared and specific factors separately; (ii) two parallel
reconstructions that ensure both representations remain informative; and (iii)
a novel max-min objective that encourages clean separation without relying on
handcrafted priors, while making only minimal assumptions. Theoretically, we
show that this objective maximizes data likelihood while promoting
disentanglement, and that it admits a unique equilibrium. Empirically, we
demonstrate that DISCoVeR achieves improved disentanglement on synthetic
datasets, natural images, and single-cell RNA-seq data. Together, these results
establish DISCoVeR as a principled approach for learning disentangled
representations in multi-condition settings.

*Kanumuri Nithin Varma,Babak Hassibi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the implicit bias of optimization algorithms in over-parameterized linear regression, identifying the optimal bias for best generalization performance under specific conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the implicit bias that yields the best generalization performance in over-parameterized learning problems.

Method: Asymptotic analysis of generalization performance for interpolators from convex potential minimization in non-isotropic Gaussian data settings.

Result: A tight lower bound on the best generalization error is derived, and the optimal convex implicit bias achieving this bound is identified under log-concavity conditions.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into the optimal implicit bias for generalization in over-parameterized linear regression, with implications for algorithm design.

Abstract: Most modern learning problems are over-parameterized, where the number of
learnable parameters is much greater than the number of training data points.
In this over-parameterized regime, the training loss typically has infinitely
many global optima that completely interpolate the data with varying
generalization performance. The particular global optimum we converge to
depends on the implicit bias of the optimization algorithm. The question we
address in this paper is, ``What is the implicit bias that leads to the best
generalization performance?". To find the optimal implicit bias, we provide a
precise asymptotic analysis of the generalization performance of interpolators
obtained from the minimization of convex functions/potentials for
over-parameterized linear regression with non-isotropic Gaussian data. In
particular, we obtain a tight lower bound on the best generalization error
possible among this class of interpolators in terms of the
over-parameterization ratio, the variance of the noise in the labels, the
eigenspectrum of the data covariance, and the underlying distribution of the
parameter to be estimated. Finally, we find the optimal convex implicit bias
that achieves this lower bound under certain sufficient conditions involving
the log-concavity of the distribution of a Gaussian convolved with the prior of
the true underlying parameter.

*Guozheng Ma,Lu Li,Zilin Wang,Li Shen,Pierre-Luc Bacon,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introducing static network sparsity via one-shot random pruning improves scaling and performance in deep reinforcement learning, outperforming dense networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling deep reinforcement learning is challenging due to network pathologies; sparse networks offer a simpler solution than complex interventions.

Method: One-shot random pruning removes a fixed percentage of weights before training, creating sparse networks.

Result: Sparse networks achieve higher parameter efficiency, better expressivity, and resistance to optimization issues like plasticity loss.

Conclusion: Network sparsity is a simple yet effective method for scaling deep reinforcement learning, with consistent benefits across scenarios.

Abstract: Effectively scaling up deep reinforcement learning models has proven
notoriously difficult due to network pathologies during training, motivating
various targeted interventions such as periodic reset and architectural
advances such as layer normalization. Instead of pursuing more complex
modifications, we show that introducing static network sparsity alone can
unlock further scaling potential beyond their dense counterparts with
state-of-the-art architectures. This is achieved through simple one-shot random
pruning, where a predetermined percentage of network weights are randomly
removed once before training. Our analysis reveals that, in contrast to naively
scaling up dense DRL networks, such sparse networks achieve both higher
parameter efficiency for network expressivity and stronger resistance to
optimization challenges like plasticity loss and gradient interference. We
further extend our evaluation to visual and streaming RL scenarios,
demonstrating the consistent benefits of network sparsity.

*Xuechen Zhang,Zijian Huang,Yingcong Li,Chenshun Ni,Jiasi Chen,Samet Oymak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BREAD, a GRPO variant, unifies SFT and RL stages with expert guidance and branched rollouts, improving SLM reasoning efficiency and success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small language models (SLMs) struggle with complex reasoning due to limitations in the SFT + RL paradigm, especially when expert traces are hard to express or initializations are poor.

Method: Introduces BREAD, which uses partial expert guidance and branched rollouts to densify rewards and create a learning curriculum, requiring fewer expert traces.

Result: BREAD outperforms standard GRPO, speeds up training by 3x, and solves problems unsolvable by SFT + RL alone.

Conclusion: BREAD demonstrates the effectiveness of expert guidance and branched rollouts in enhancing SLM reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) struggle to learn complex reasoning behaviors,
especially when high-quality traces are scarce or difficult to learn from. The
standard training approach combines a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, often
to distill capabilities of a larger model, followed by a reinforcement learning
(RL)stage such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this paper, we
investigate the fundamental limitations of this SFT + RL paradigm and propose
methods to overcome them. Under a suitable theoretical model, we demonstrate
that the SFT + RL strategy can fail completely when (1) the expert's traces are
too difficult for the small model to express, or (2) the small model's
initialization has exponentially small likelihood of success. To address these,
we introduce BREAD: a GRPO variant that unifies the SFT and RL stages via
partial expert guidance and branched rollouts. When self-generated traces fail,
BREAD adaptively inserts short expert prefixes/hints, allowing the small model
to complete the rest of the reasoning path, and ensuring that each update
includes at least one successful trace. This mechanism both densifies the
reward signal and induces a natural learning curriculum. BREAD requires fewer
than 40% of ground-truth traces, consistently outperforming standard GRPO while
speeding up the training by about 3 times. Importantly, we demonstrate that
BREAD helps the model solve problems that are otherwise unsolvable by the SFT +
RL strategy, highlighting how branched rollouts and expert guidance can
substantially boost SLM reasoning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLIF (Reinforcement Learning from Internal Feedback) uses intrinsic signals like token-level entropy to improve LLM reasoning, showing early gains but degrading later, especially for instruction-tuned models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore alternatives to externally supervised methods like RLHF and RLVR by leveraging intrinsic model-derived signals for LLM post-training.

Method: Proposes RLIF, using unsupervised reward proxies (token-level entropy, trajectory-level entropy, self-certainty) and evaluates on math reasoning benchmarks.

Result: RLIF boosts early reasoning performance but degrades later, even below pre-training levels, and shows minimal improvement for instruction-tuned models.

Conclusion: RLIF has potential but limitations, especially post-instruction-tuning, suggesting the need for careful integration of internal feedback signals.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for post-training
large language models (LLMs) to improve reasoning. Approaches like
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have shown strong results, but they require
extensive external supervision. We investigate an alternative class of methods,
Reinforcement Learning from Internal Feedback (RLIF), which relies solely on
intrinsic model-derived signals instead of external rewards. In particular, we
leverage unsupervised reward proxies such as token-level entropy,
trajectory-level entropy, and self-certainty. Our theoretical analysis shows
these internal objectives are partially equivalent, and we empirically evaluate
various RLIF strategies on challenging math reasoning benchmarks. Experimental
results demonstrate that RLIF can boost the reasoning performance of base LLMs
at the beginning phase of the training, matching or surpassing RLVR techniques
on these tasks. However, when training progresses, performance degrades even
below the model before training. Moreover, we find that RLIF yields little
improvement for instruction-tuned models, indicating diminishing returns of
intrinsic feedback once an LLM is already instruction-tuned. We further analyze
this limitation by mixing model weights and explain the reason of RLIF's
training behaviors, providing practical guidelines for integrating internal
feedback signals into LLM training. We hope our analysis of internal feedback
will inform more principled and effective strategies for LLM post-training.

*Yilin Zhang,Xinran Zhao,Zora Zhiruo Wang,Chenyang Yang,Jiayi Wei,Tongshuang Wu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a structure-aware chunking method for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines using Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) to improve code generation quality by preserving semantic coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing line-based chunking heuristics in RAG pipelines often disrupt semantic structures, degrading code generation quality.

Method: The proposed method, chunking via ASTs, recursively breaks large AST nodes into smaller chunks and merges sibling nodes while respecting size limits, ensuring self-contained, semantically coherent units.

Result: The approach improves performance, e.g., boosting Recall@5 by 4.3 points on RepoEval retrieval and Pass@1 by 2.67 points on SWE-bench generation.

Conclusion: Structure-aware chunking is crucial for enhancing retrieval-augmented code intelligence, as demonstrated by the proposed AST-based method.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become essential for large-scale
code generation, grounding predictions in external code corpora to improve
actuality. However, a critical yet underexplored aspect of RAG pipelines is
chunking -- the process of dividing documents into retrievable units. Existing
line-based chunking heuristics often break semantic structures, splitting
functions or merging unrelated code, which can degrade generation quality. We
propose chunking via Abstract Syntax Trees (\ourwork), a structure-aware method
that recursively breaks large AST nodes into smaller chunks and merges sibling
nodes while respecting size limits. This approach generates self-contained,
semantically coherent units across programming languages and tasks, improving
performance on diverse code generation tasks, e.g., boosting Recall@5 by 4.3
points on RepoEval retrieval and Pass@1 by 2.67 points on SWE-bench generation.
Our work highlights the importance of structure-aware chunking for scaling
retrieval-enhanced code intelligence.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes submissions to SWE-Bench Lite and Verified leaderboards, revealing trends in LLM usage, system designs, and contributor diversity in Automated Program Repair (APR).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the architectural designs and origins of solutions in APR, given the lack of detailed documentation in SWE-Bench submissions.

Method: Comprehensive study of 68 SWE-Bench Lite and 79 Verified submissions, analyzing 67 unique approaches across dimensions like submitter type, LLM usage, and system architecture.

Result: Dominance of proprietary LLMs (e.g., Claude 3.5/3.7), mix of agentic and non-agentic designs, and diverse contributors from individuals to large tech companies.

Conclusion: The study highlights the evolving landscape of APR, driven by LLMs and diverse contributors, while emphasizing the need for better documentation of solutions.

Abstract: The rapid progress in Automated Program Repair (APR) has been driven by
advances in AI, particularly large language models (LLMs) and agent-based
systems. SWE-Bench is a recent benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based repair
systems using real issues and pull requests mined from 12 popular open-source
Python repositories. Its public leaderboards, SWE-Bench Lite and SWE-Bench
Verified, have become central platforms for tracking progress and comparing
solutions. However, because the submission process does not require detailed
documentation, the architectural design and origin of many solutions remain
unclear. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of all
submissions to the SWE-Bench Lite (68 entries) and Verified (79 entries)
leaderboards, analyzing 67 unique approaches across dimensions such as
submitter type, product availability, LLM usage, and system architecture. Our
findings reveal the dominance of proprietary LLMs (especially Claude 3.5/3.7),
the presence of both agentic and non-agentic designs, and a contributor base
spanning from individual developers to large tech companies.

TL;DR: The paper explores integrating AI tools into QA for modern software, showing promise but highlighting challenges like explainability and verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of traditional QA methods in handling modern software complexity and rapid iterations.

Method: Comprehensive analysis of AI tools in QA processes, including test generation and execution, with a proof-of-concept implementation.

Result: AI tools showed potential (8.3% flaky tests) but faced challenges like lack of explainability and semantic coverage.

Conclusion: AI can transform QA but requires strategic implementation and verification methodologies to address limitations.

Abstract: Traditional quality assurance (QA) methods face significant challenges in
addressing the complexity, scale, and rapid iteration cycles of modern software
systems and are strained by limited resources available, leading to substantial
costs associated with poor quality. The object of this research is the Quality
Assurance processes for modern distributed software applications. The subject
of the research is the assessment of the benefits, challenges, and prospects of
integrating modern AI-oriented tools into quality assurance processes. We
performed comprehensive analysis of implications on both verification and
validation processes covering exploratory test analyses, equivalence
partitioning and boundary analyses, metamorphic testing, finding
inconsistencies in acceptance criteria (AC), static analyses, test case
generation, unit test generation, test suit optimization and assessment, end to
end scenario execution. End to end regression of sample enterprise application
utilizing AI-agents over generated test scenarios was implemented as a proof of
concept highlighting practical use of the study. The results, with only 8.3%
flaky executions of generated test cases, indicate significant potential for
the proposed approaches. However, the study also identified substantial
challenges for practical adoption concerning generation of semantically
identical coverage, "black box" nature and lack of explainability from
state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), the tendency to correct mutated
test cases to match expected results, underscoring the necessity for thorough
verification of both generated artifacts and test execution results. The
research demonstrates AI's transformative potential for QA but highlights the
importance of a strategic approach to implementing these technologies,
considering the identified limitations and the need for developing appropriate
verification methodologies.

*Anvith Pabba,Alex Mathai,Anindya Chakraborty,Baishakhi Ray*

TL;DR: SemAgent improves Automated Program Repair (APR) by leveraging issue, code, and execution semantics, outperforming existing methods with a 44.66% solve rate on SWEBench-Lite.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing APR systems hyper-localize fixes, lacking deeper semantic understanding, leading to overfitted patches.

Method: SemAgent uses a workflow with execution semantics for context, issue-semantics abstraction, code-semantics isolation, and a two-stage repair-reviewer architecture.

Result: Achieves 44.66% solve rate on SWEBench-Lite, with a 7.66% improvement over baselines, excelling in multi-line reasoning and edge-case handling.

Conclusion: Incorporating deeper semantics into APR pipelines enhances robustness and consistency in repairs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in downstream
software engineering tasks such as Automated Program Repair (APR). In
particular, there has been a lot of research on repository-level
issue-resolution benchmarks such as SWE-Bench. Although there has been
significant progress on this topic, we notice that in the process of solving
such issues, existing agentic systems tend to hyper-localize on immediately
suspicious lines of code and fix them in isolation, without a deeper
understanding of the issue semantics, code semantics, or execution semantics.
Consequently, many existing systems generate patches that overfit to the user
issue, even when a more general fix is preferable. To address this limitation,
we introduce SemAgent, a novel workflow-based procedure that leverages issue,
code, and execution semantics to generate patches that are complete -
identifying and fixing all lines relevant to the issue. We achieve this through
a novel pipeline that (a) leverages execution semantics to retrieve relevant
context, (b) comprehends issue-semantics via generalized abstraction, (c)
isolates code-semantics within the context of this abstraction, and (d)
leverages this understanding in a two-stage architecture: a repair stage that
proposes fine-grained fixes, followed by a reviewer stage that filters relevant
fixes based on the inferred issue-semantics. Our evaluations show that our
methodology achieves a solve rate of 44.66% on the SWEBench-Lite benchmark
beating all other workflow-based approaches, and an absolute improvement of
7.66% compared to our baseline, which lacks such deep semantic understanding.
We note that our approach performs particularly well on issues requiring
multi-line reasoning (and editing) and edge-case handling, suggesting that
incorporating issue and code semantics into APR pipelines can lead to robust
and semantically consistent repairs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Highlight the dangers of mainstream AI coding tools, including privacy leaks, security flaws, and sycophantic behavior.

Method: Propose measures like tagging/reviewing AI code, securing deployments, adhering to regulations, and testing for sycophancy.

Result: Identified risks: 10% prompts leak data, 42% snippets have flaws, models exhibit sycophancy.

Conclusion: Firms must balance speed with security by implementing strict oversight and testing for AI-generated code.

Abstract: Large-language-model coding tools are now mainstream in software engineering.
But as these same tools move human effort up the development stack, they
present fresh dangers: 10% of real prompts leak private data, 42% of generated
snippets hide security flaws, and the models can even ``agree'' with wrong
ideas, a trait called sycophancy. We argue that firms must tag and review every
AI-generated line of code, keep prompts and outputs inside private or
on-premises deployments, obey emerging safety regulations, and add tests that
catch sycophantic answers -- so they can gain speed without losing security and
accuracy.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper explores PSO and GAs as alternatives to SGD for training ANNs, proposing a hybrid PSO-SGD method that reduces training MSE significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SGD's limitations, such as high computational cost and local optima convergence, drive the investigation of population-based MHOs like PSO and GAs.

Method: A hybrid PSO-SGD strategy is developed to enhance local search efficiency, tested against GA, PSO, and other methods.

Result: The hybrid PSO-SGD reduces median training MSE by 90-95% compared to GA and PSO, with RMHC also showing improvements (85-90% MSE reduction). RS performs poorly.

Conclusion: Hybrid and evolutionary methods outperform conventional optimization, suggesting the BBH may hold, retaining beneficial weight structures during evolution.

Abstract: Training Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with Stochastic Gradient Descent
(SGD) frequently encounters difficulties, including substantial computing
expense and the risk of converging to local optima, attributable to its
dependence on partial weight gradients. Therefore, this work investigates
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithms (GAs) - two
population-based Metaheuristic Optimizers (MHOs) - as alternatives to SGD to
mitigate these constraints. A hybrid PSO-SGD strategy is developed to improve
local search efficiency. The findings indicate that the hybrid PSO-SGD
technique decreases the median training MSE by 90 to 95 percent relative to
conventional GA and PSO across various network sizes (e.g., from around 0.02 to
approximately 0.001 in the Sphere function). RMHC attains substantial
enhancements, reducing MSE by roughly 85 to 90 percent compared to GA.
Simultaneously, RS consistently exhibits errors exceeding 0.3, signifying
subpar performance. These findings underscore that hybrid and evolutionary
procedures significantly improve training efficiency and accuracy compared to
conventional optimization methods and imply that the Building Block Hypothesis
(BBH) may still be valid, indicating that advantageous weight structures are
retained during evolutionary search.

TL;DR: The paper proposes ACERL, an adaptive constrained evolutionary reinforcement learning approach, to address dynamic material handling challenges like sparse rewards and constraint violations, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic material handling (DMH) requires adaptability due to dynamic events like new tasks, and historical task records enable policy training. Reinforcement learning is applied, but challenges like sparse rewards and constraint satisfaction persist.

Method: ACERL maintains a population of actors for diverse exploration, tackles sparse rewards and constraint violations, and adaptively selects beneficial training instances.

Result: ACERL outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on training and test instances, satisfies constraints, and shows robustness in noisy scenarios. Cross-validation and ablation studies confirm its effectiveness.

Conclusion: ACERL is a robust and effective solution for DMH, addressing key challenges and demonstrating superior performance in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Dynamic material handling (DMH) involves the assignment of dynamically
arriving material transporting tasks to suitable vehicles in real time for
minimising makespan and tardiness. In real-world scenarios, historical task
records are usually available, which enables the training of a decision policy
on multiple instances consisting of historical records. Recently, reinforcement
learning has been applied to solve DMH. Due to the occurrence of dynamic events
such as new tasks, adaptability is highly required. Solving DMH is challenging
since constraints including task delay should be satisfied. A feedback is
received only when all tasks are served, which leads to sparse reward. Besides,
making the best use of limited computational resources and historical records
for training a robust policy is crucial. The time allocated to different
problem instances would highly impact the learning process. To tackle those
challenges, this paper proposes a novel adaptive constrained evolutionary
reinforcement learning (ACERL) approach, which maintains a population of actors
for diverse exploration. ACERL accesses each actor for tackling sparse rewards
and constraint violation to restrict the behaviour of the policy. Moreover,
ACERL adaptively selects the most beneficial training instances for improving
the policy. Extensive experiments on eight training and eight unseen test
instances demonstrate the outstanding performance of ACERL compared with
several state-of-the-art algorithms. Policies trained by ACERL can schedule the
vehicles while fully satisfying the constraints. Additional experiments on 40
unseen noised instances show the robust performance of ACERL. Cross-validation
further presents the overall effectiveness of ACREL. Besides, a rigorous
ablation study highlights the coordination and benefits of each ingredient of
ACERL.

Result: Achieves 92% accuracy on ten sequential MNIST tasks, with only 4% performance degradation on the first task after learning nine more.

Conclusion: CoLaNET demonstrates efficient continual learning with low forgetting, highlighting the importance of hyperparameter tuning for stability and plasticity.

Abstract: This study investigates columnar-organized spiking neural networks (SNNs) for
continual learning and catastrophic forgetting. Using CoLaNET (Columnar Layered
Network), we show that microcolumns adapt most efficiently to new tasks when
they lack shared structure with prior learning. We demonstrate how CoLaNET
hyperparameters govern the trade-off between retaining old knowledge

configuration learns ten sequential MNIST tasks effectively, maintaining 92%

on the first task after training on nine subsequent tasks.

TL;DR: A federated semantic communication framework reduces bandwidth usage in IoT networks by transmitting only semantic features, balancing reconstruction quality, efficiency, and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing bandwidth constraints and privacy in IoT networks, the paper tackles challenges of client selection and data heterogeneity in federated learning.

Method: Proposes a federated SC framework with semantic bottlenecks and loss-based aggregation, testing three client selection strategies.

Result: Utilitarian selection yields the best reconstruction quality, while Proportional Fairness reduces inequality and improves efficiency.

Conclusion: Federated SC effectively balances quality, efficiency, and fairness, enabling sustainable edge intelligence.

Abstract: The exponential growth of IoT devices presents critical challenges in
bandwidth-constrained wireless networks, particularly regarding efficient data
transmission and privacy preservation. This paper presents a novel federated
semantic communication (SC) framework that enables collaborative training of
bandwidth-efficient models for image reconstruction across heterogeneous IoT
devices. By leveraging SC principles to transmit only semantic features, our
approach dramatically reduces communication overhead while preserving
reconstruction quality. We address the fundamental challenge of client
selection in federated learning environments where devices exhibit significant
disparities in dataset sizes and data distributions. Our framework implements
three distinct client selection strategies that explore different trade-offs
between system performance and fairness in resource allocation. The system
employs an end-to-end SC architecture with semantic bottlenecks, coupled with a
loss-based aggregation mechanism that naturally adapts to client heterogeneity.
Experimental evaluation on image data demonstrates that while Utilitarian
selection achieves the highest reconstruction quality, Proportional Fairness
maintains competitive performance while significantly reducing participation
inequality and improving computational efficiency. These results establish that
federated SC can successfully balance reconstruction quality, resource
efficiency, and fairness in heterogeneous IoT deployments, paving the way for
sustainable and privacy-preserving edge intelligence applications.

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: A wavelet-based method for unoriented surface reconstruction is proposed, improving performance on sparse point clouds by leveraging mollified indicator functions and divergence-free fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing wavelet methods struggle with unoriented points and sparse point clouds, prompting the need for a more robust solution.

Method: The method uses wavelet basis functions and a modifying kernel to smoothen discontinuities, accelerates computation via convolutional kernel properties, and introduces divergence-free fields for stability.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in orientation and reconstruction for sparse models, with efficient CPU performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses limitations of prior work, offering improved accuracy and speed for unoriented surface reconstruction.

Abstract: Unoriented surface reconstruction is an important task in computer graphics
and has extensive applications. Based on the compact support of wavelet and
orthogonality properties, classic wavelet surface reconstruction achieves good
and fast reconstruction. However, this method can only handle oriented points.
Despite some improved attempts for unoriented points, such as iWSR, these
methods perform poorly on sparse point clouds. To address these shortcomings,
we propose a wavelet-based method to represent the mollified indicator function
and complete both the orientation and surface reconstruction tasks. We use the
modifying kernel function to smoothen out discontinuities on the surface,
aligning with the continuity of the wavelet basis function. During the
calculation of coefficient, we fully utilize the properties of the
convolutional kernel function to shift the modifying computation onto wavelet
basis to accelerate. In addition, we propose a novel method for constructing
the divergence-free function field and using them to construct the additional
homogeneous constraints to improve the effectiveness and stability. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
in both orientation and reconstruction for sparse models. We align the matrix
construction with the compact support property of wavelet basis functions to
further accelerate our method, resulting in efficient performance on CPU. Our
source codes will be released on GitHub.

TL;DR: GalCatDiff, a diffusion model framework, integrates galaxy image features and astrophysical properties, outperforming VAEs and GANs in quality and diversity for galaxy generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional galaxy generation methods depend on physical assumptions and tuning, while data-driven models like GalCatDiff learn from observational data without predefined parameters.

Method: GalCatDiff uses an enhanced U-Net and Astro-RAB block to combine attention and convolution, ensuring global and local feature fidelity, along with category embeddings for class-specific generation.

Result: GalCatDiff surpasses existing methods in sample color/size consistency and produces visually realistic, physically consistent galaxies.

Conclusion: GalCatDiff enhances galaxy simulation reliability and can support future galaxy classification algorithm development as a data augmentor.

Abstract: Conventional galaxy generation methods rely on semi-analytical models and
hydrodynamic simulations, which are highly dependent on physical assumptions
and parameter tuning. In contrast, data-driven generative models do not have
explicit physical parameters pre-determined, and instead learn them efficiently
from observational data, making them alternative solutions to galaxy
generation. Among these, diffusion models outperform Variational Autoencoders
(VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in quality and diversity.
Leveraging physical prior knowledge to these models can further enhance their
capabilities. In this work, we present GalCatDiff, the first framework in
astronomy to leverage both galaxy image features and astrophysical properties
in the network design of diffusion models. GalCatDiff incorporates an enhanced
U-Net and a novel block entitled Astro-RAB (Residual Attention Block), which
dynamically combines attention mechanisms with convolution operations to ensure
global consistency and local feature fidelity. Moreover, GalCatDiff uses
category embeddings for class-specific galaxy generation, avoiding the high
computational costs of training separate models for each category. Our
experimental results demonstrate that GalCatDiff significantly outperforms
existing methods in terms of the consistency of sample color and size
distributions, and the generated galaxies are both visually realistic and
physically consistent. This framework will enhance the reliability of galaxy
simulations and can potentially serve as a data augmentor to support future
galaxy classification algorithm development.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a universal feature coding method for large models, addressing distributional heterogeneity in features by transforming skewed distributions into a balanced target space, improving compression and cross-model generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior studies focused on task- or model-specific feature coding, leaving universal feature coding for diverse large models unexplored. The challenge lies in the incompatible distributions of features from different models.

Method: Proposes a learned peaky-to-balanced distribution transformation to align heterogeneous feature distributions into a common target space, enabling a universal codec.

Result: Validated on LLaMA3, DINOv2, and SD3, the method shows improved compression efficiency and cross-model generalization over task-specific baselines.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses distributional heterogeneity, enabling universal feature coding for diverse large models, with potential for broader applications.

Abstract: Like image coding in visual data transmission, feature coding is essential
for the distributed deployment of large models by significantly reducing
transmission and storage overhead. However, prior studies have mostly targeted
task- or model-specific scenarios, leaving the challenge of universal feature
coding across diverse large models largely unaddressed. In this paper, we
present the first systematic study on universal feature coding for large
models. The key challenge lies in the inherently diverse and distributionally
incompatible nature of features extracted from different models. For example,
features from DINOv2 exhibit highly peaky, concentrated distributions, while
those from Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3) are more dispersed and uniform. This
distributional heterogeneity severely hampers both compression efficiency and
cross-model generalization. To address this, we propose a learned
peaky-to-balanced distribution transformation, which reshapes highly skewed
feature distributions into a common, balanced target space. This transformation
is non-uniform, data-driven, and plug-and-play, enabling effective alignment of
heterogeneous distributions without modifying downstream codecs. With this
alignment, a universal codec trained on the balanced target distribution can
effectively generalize to features from different models and tasks. We validate
our approach on three representative large models-LLaMA3, DINOv2, and
SD3-across multiple tasks and modalities. Extensive experiments show that our
method achieves notable improvements in both compression efficiency and
cross-model generalization over task-specific baselines. All source code will
be released for future research.

*Oliver Schön,Sofie Haesaert,Sadegh Soudjani*

Main category: cs.SY

TL;DR: Proposes a scalable abstraction-based technique for probabilistic simulation relations, eliminating direct error-bound computation, demonstrated on a high-dimensional vehicle intersection case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of complex system representations that hinder scalability and decision-making in formal methods.

Method: Uses probabilistic simulation relations and surrogate models to avoid direct error-bound computation, focusing on nonlinear agent-environment interactions.

Result: Enhances scalability and applicability, trading conservatism for scalability, with infinite-horizon temporal logic guarantees.

Conclusion: The approach effectively scales to higher dimensions and complex scenarios, as validated by a vehicle intersection case study.

Abstract: The requirement for identifying accurate system representations has not only
been a challenge to fulfill, but it has compromised the scalability of formal
methods, as the resulting models are often too complex for effective decision
making with formal correctness and performance guarantees. Focusing on
probabilistic simulation relations and surrogate models of stochastic systems,
we propose an approach that significantly enhances the scalability and
practical applicability of such simulation relations by eliminating the need to
compute error bounds directly. As a result, we provide an abstraction-based
technique that scales effectively to higher dimensions while addressing complex
nonlinear agent-environment interactions with infinite-horizon temporal logic
guarantees amidst uncertainty. Our approach trades scalability for conservatism
favorably, as demonstrated on a complex high-dimensional vehicle intersection
case study.

*Chenrui Ma,Zechang Sun,Tao Jing,Zheng Cai,Yuan-Sen Ting,Song Huang,Mingyu Li*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: A conditional diffusion model is proposed to generate realistic galaxy images for augmenting ML training data, improving classification and rare object detection in astronomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of limited representativeness in labeled datasets for rare astrophysical phenomena, which hinders ML generalization in large-scale surveys.

Method: Using the Galaxy Zoo 2 dataset, a conditional diffusion model synthesizes diverse, high-fidelity galaxy images adhering to specified morphological features, enabling generative extrapolation.

Result: Integration of synthesized images improved ML performance by up to 30% in classification metrics and doubled rare object detection (from 352 to 872 instances).

Conclusion: Generative models can bridge gaps in scarce labeled data, enhancing ML applications in astronomy and informing future astrophysical foundation models.

Abstract: Observational astronomy relies on visual feature identification to detect
critical astrophysical phenomena. While machine learning (ML) increasingly
automates this process, models often struggle with generalization in
large-scale surveys due to the limited representativeness of labeled datasets
-- whether from simulations or human annotation -- a challenge pronounced for
rare yet scientifically valuable objects. To address this, we propose a
conditional diffusion model to synthesize realistic galaxy images for
augmenting ML training data. Leveraging the Galaxy Zoo 2 dataset which contains
visual feature -- galaxy image pairs from volunteer annotation, we demonstrate
that our model generates diverse, high-fidelity galaxy images closely adhere to
the specified morphological feature conditions. Moreover, this model enables
generative extrapolation to project well-annotated data into unseen domains and
advancing rare object detection. Integrating synthesized images into ML
pipelines improves performance in standard morphology classification, boosting
completeness and purity by up to 30\% across key metrics. For rare object
detection, using early-type galaxies with prominent dust lane features (
$\sim$0.1\% in GZ2 dataset) as a test case, our approach doubled the number of
detected instances from 352 to 872, compared to previous studies based on
visual inspection. This study highlights the power of generative models to
bridge gaps between scarce labeled data and the vast, uncharted parameter space
of observational astronomy and sheds insight for future astrophysical
foundation model developments. Our project homepage is available at

Abstract: Navigation is a very crucial aspect of autonomous vehicle ecosystem which
heavily relies on collecting and processing large amounts of data in various

Artificial Intelligence by enabling quantum and AI at various levels of
navigation decision making and communication process in Autonomous vehicles :
Quantum Neural Networks for multimodal sensor fusion, Nav-Q for Quantum
reinforcement learning for navigation policy optimization and finally
post-quantum cryptographic protocols for secure communication. Quantum neural
networks uses quantum amplitude encoding to fuse data from various sensors like
LiDAR, radar, camera, GPS and weather etc., This approach gives a unified
quantum state representation between heterogeneous sensor modalities. Nav-Q
module processes the fused quantum states through variational quantum circuits
to learn optimal navigation policies under swift dynamic and complex
conditions. Finally, post quantum cryptographic protocols are used to secure
communication channels for both within vehicle communication and V2X (Vehicle
to Everything) communications and thus secures the autonomous vehicle
communication from both classical and quantum security threats. Thus, the
proposed framework addresses fundamental challenges in autonomous vehicles
navigation by providing quantum performance and future proof security. Index

*Bohan Yang,Gang Liu,Rirao Dao,Yujia Qian,Ke Shi,Anke Tang,Yong Luo,Jingnan Liu*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes an unsupervised deep learning framework (SPArcdl) for fast and effective energy layer pre-selection in proton arc therapy, improving plan quality and delivery efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Proton arc therapy (PAT) offers advantages over conventional methods but optimizing energy layer sequences is computationally intensive. This study aims to streamline the process.

Method: A novel spot-count representation is used as input for a UNet-based model (SPArcdl), optimizing target coverage, OAR exposure, and energy switching time.

Result: SPArcdl outperforms SPArc particle swarm, improving conformity, homogeneity, and reducing switching time and brainstem dose. Inference time is under 1 second.

Conclusion: SPArcdl is a fast and effective tool for high-quality PAT plans, reducing delivery time while maintaining dosimetric performance.

Abstract: Objective. Proton arc therapy (PAT) is an emerging and promising modality in
radiotherapy, offering several advantages over conventional intensitymodulated
proton therapy (IMPT). However, identifying the optimal energy layer (EL)
sequence remains computationally intensive due to the large number of possible
energy layer transitions. This study proposes an unsupervised deep learning
framework for fast and effective EL pre-selection, aiming to minimize energy
layer switch time while preserving high plan quality. Approach. We introduce a
novel data representation method, spot-count representation, which encodes the
number of proton spots intersecting the target and organs at risk (OARs) in a
matrix structured by sorted gantry angles and energy layers. This
representation is the input of a UNet-based architecture, SPArcdl, which is
trained to optimize a tri-objective function: maximizing target coverage,
minimizing OAR exposure, and reducing energy switching time. The model is
evaluated on 54 nasopharyngeal cancer cases, and its performance is benchmarked
against plans generated by SPArcparticle swarm. Main results. SPArcdl produces
EL pre-selection that significantly improves both plan quality and delivery
efficiency. Compared to SPArc particle swarm, it enhances the conformity index
by 0.16 (p < 0.01), reduces the homogeneity index by 0.71 (p < 0.01), shortens
the energy switching time by 38.4% (p < 0.01), and lowers the mean dose to
brainstem by 0.21 (p < 0.01). The results unintentionally reveal employing
unchanged ELS is more time-wise efficient than descended ELS. SPArcdl's
inference time is within 1 second. Significance. SPArcdl is a fast and
effective tool for generating high-quality PAT plans by strategically
pre-selecting energy layers to reduce delivery time while maintaining excellent
dosimetric performance.

*Aditya Sengar,Ali Hariri,Daniel Probst,Patrick Barth,Pierre Vandergheynst*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: LD-FPG is a framework for generating diverse, all-atom protein structures from MD trajectories using latent diffusion and ChebNet embeddings, achieving high structural fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding dynamic proteins like GPCRs requires diverse all-atom conformational ensembles, but existing models often lack atomic detail or diversity.

Method: LD-FPG uses ChebNet for latent embeddings, three pooling strategies (blind, sequential, residue-based), and a diffusion model with optional dihedral-angle regularization.

Result: Sequential and residue-based pooling achieve high fidelity (all-atom lDDT ~0.7) and recover dihedral-angle distributions (Jensen-Shannon divergence <0.03).

Conclusion: LD-FPG provides a practical tool for generating all-atom ensembles of large proteins, aiding structure-based therapeutic design.

Abstract: Generating diverse, all-atom conformational ensembles of dynamic proteins
such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is critical for understanding their
function, yet most generative models simplify atomic detail or ignore
conformational diversity altogether. We present latent diffusion for full
protein generation (LD-FPG), a framework that constructs complete all-atom
protein structures, including every side-chain heavy atom, directly from
molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. LD-FPG employs a Chebyshev graph neural
network (ChebNet) to obtain low-dimensional latent embeddings of protein
conformations, which are processed using three pooling strategies: blind,
sequential and residue-based. A diffusion model trained on these latent
representations generates new samples that a decoder, optionally regularized by
dihedral-angle losses, maps back to Cartesian coordinates. Using D2R-MD, a
2-microsecond MD trajectory (12 000 frames) of the human dopamine D2 receptor
in a membrane environment, the sequential and residue-based pooling strategy
reproduces the reference ensemble with high structural fidelity (all-atom lDDT
of approximately 0.7; C-alpha-lDDT of approximately 0.8) and recovers backbone
and side-chain dihedral-angle distributions with a Jensen-Shannon divergence of
less than 0.03 compared to the MD data. LD-FPG thereby offers a practical route
to system-specific, all-atom ensemble generation for large proteins, providing
a promising tool for structure-based therapeutic design on complex, dynamic
targets. The D2R-MD dataset and our implementation are freely available to
facilitate further research.

Main category: eess.SP

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The low-altitude economy (LAE) aligns with near-field communications in XL-MIMO systems, but challenges like signal processing complexity and user distinction arise. LLMs offer a potential solution due to their problem-solving capabilities.

Method: The paper introduces LLM and near-field communication fundamentals, analyzes challenges, and proposes an LLM-based scheme, including a case study for user distinction and precoding.

Result: The study presents a framework for applying LLMs to near-field communications in LAE, demonstrating their potential to tackle existing challenges.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for enhancing near-field communications in LAE, with future research needed to explore open issues and directions.

Abstract: The low-altitude economy (LAE) is gaining significant attention from academia
and industry. Fortunately, LAE naturally aligns with near-field communications
in extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) systems. By leveraging near-field
beamfocusing, LAE can precisely direct beam energy to unmanned aerial vehicles,
while the additional distance dimension boosts overall spectrum efficiency.
However, near-field communications in LAE still face several challenges, such
as the increase in signal processing complexity and the necessity of
distinguishing between far and near-field users. Inspired by the large language
models (LLM) with powerful ability to handle complex problems, we apply LLM to
solve challenges of near-field communications in LAE. The objective of this
article is to provide a comprehensive analysis and discussion on LLM-empowered
near-field communications in LAE. Specifically, we first introduce fundamentals
of LLM and near-field communications, including the key advantages of LLM and
key characteristics of near-field communications. Then, we reveal the
opportunities and challenges of near-field communications in LAE. To address
these challenges, we present a LLM-based scheme for near-field communications
in LAE, and provide a case study which jointly distinguishes far and near-field
users and designs multi-user precoding matrix. Finally, we outline and
highlight several future research directions and open issues.

*Dhananjeyan Jeyaraj,Hamidreza Eivazi,Jendrik-Alexander Tröger,Stefan Wittek,Stefan Hartmann,Andreas Rausch*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid model combining deep learning (neural operators) and physics-based methods to accelerate multiscale simulations in material behavior analysis, achieving high accuracy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the impact of microstructure on macroscopic material behavior requires computationally intensive multiscale modeling. The challenge is to reduce computational costs while maintaining accuracy.

Method: The authors integrate neural operators into computational homogenization frameworks to predict microscale physics, combining data-driven and physics-based approaches. This hybrid model is applied to viscoelastic material problems.

Result: The method achieves high accuracy (homogenized stresses with <6% error) and significant computational efficiency (~100x faster).

Conclusion: The hybrid approach successfully balances accuracy and efficiency, offering a flexible solution for multiscale simulations in material science.

Abstract: The behavior of materials is influenced by a wide range of phenomena
occurring across various time and length scales. To better understand the
impact of microstructure on macroscopic response, multiscale modeling
strategies are essential. Numerical methods, such as the $\text{FE}^2$
approach, account for micro-macro interactions to predict the global response
in a concurrent manner. However, these methods are computationally intensive
due to the repeated evaluations of the microscale. This challenge has led to
the integration of deep learning techniques into computational homogenization
frameworks to accelerate multiscale simulations. In this work, we employ neural
operators to predict the microscale physics, resulting in a hybrid model that
combines data-driven and physics-based approaches. This allows for
physics-guided learning and provides flexibility for different materials and
spatial discretizations. We apply this method to time-dependent solid mechanics
problems involving viscoelastic material behavior, where the state is
represented by internal variables only at the microscale. The constitutive
relations of the microscale are incorporated into the model architecture and
the internal variables are computed based on established physical principles.
The results for homogenized stresses ($<6\%$ error) show that the approach is
computationally efficient ($\sim 100 \times$ faster).

*João G. Ribeiro,Yaniv Oren,Alberto Sardinha,Matthijs Spaan,Francisco S. Melo*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: RecBayes is a novel method for ad hoc teamwork under partial observability, identifying teams and tasks without needing environment states or teammate actions, outperforming existing approaches in scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of ad hoc teamwork in partially observable environments without relying on environment states or teammate actions, unlike prior methods.

Method: Uses a recurrent Bayesian classifier trained on past experiences to identify teams and tasks from observations alone, handling large state spaces.

Result: Effective in benchmark domains with up to 1M states and 2^125 observations, successfully assisting teams in task completion.

Conclusion: RecBayes is a scalable and effective solution for ad hoc teamwork under partial observability, surpassing existing methods in flexibility and performance.

Abstract: This paper proposes RecBayes, a novel approach for ad hoc teamwork under
partial observability, a setting where agents are deployed on-the-fly to
environments where pre-existing teams operate, that never requires, at any
stage, access to the states of the environment or the actions of its teammates.
We show that by relying on a recurrent Bayesian classifier trained using past
experiences, an ad hoc agent is effectively able to identify known teams and
tasks being performed from observations alone. Unlike recent approaches such as
PO-GPL (Gu et al., 2021) and FEAT (Rahman et al., 2023), that require at some
stage fully observable states of the environment, actions of teammates, or
both, or approaches such as ATPO (Ribeiro et al., 2023) that require the
environments to be small enough to be tabularly modelled (Ribeiro et al.,
2023), in their work up to 4.8K states and 1.7K observations, we show RecBayes
is both able to handle arbitrarily large spaces while never relying on either
states and teammates' actions. Our results in benchmark domains from the
multi-agent systems literature, adapted for partial observability and scaled up
to 1M states and 2^125 observations, show that RecBayes is effective at
identifying known teams and tasks being performed from partial observations
alone, and as a result, is able to assist the teams in solving the tasks
effectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of adapting a single agent to new multi-agent systems with diverse tasks, environments, and unknown teammates/opponents is complex. Existing simplified scenarios (zero-shot learning and Ad-Hoc Teamwork) are insufficient.

Method: Proposes MRDG, which models teammates and opponents using behavioral trajectories, includes a positional encoder for team size variation, a hypernetwork module for learning, and a viewpoint alignment module.

Result: MRDG outperforms baselines in benchmarks (SMAC, Overcooked-AI, Melting Pot), demonstrating robust collaboration and competition with unseen agents.

Conclusion: ACCA and MRDG provide a more comprehensive and effective approach for agent adaptation in multi-agent systems, with promising results in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Adapting a single agent to a new multi-agent system brings challenges,
necessitating adjustments across various tasks, environments, and interactions
with unknown teammates and opponents. Addressing this challenge is highly
complex, and researchers have proposed two simplified scenarios, Multi-agent
reinforcement learning for zero-shot learning and Ad-Hoc Teamwork. Building on
these foundations, we propose a more comprehensive setting, Agent
Collaborative-Competitive Adaptation (ACCA), which evaluates an agent to
generalize across diverse scenarios, tasks, and interactions with both
unfamiliar opponents and teammates. In ACCA, agents adjust to task and
environmental changes, collaborate with unseen teammates, and compete against
unknown opponents. We introduce a new modeling approach, Multi-Retrieval and
Dynamic Generation (MRDG), that effectively models both teammates and opponents
using their behavioral trajectories. This method incorporates a positional
encoder for varying team sizes and a hypernetwork module to boost agents'
learning and adaptive capabilities. Additionally, a viewpoint alignment module
harmonizes the observational perspectives of retrieved teammates and opponents
with the learning agent. Extensive tests in benchmark scenarios like SMAC,
Overcooked-AI, and Melting Pot show that MRDG significantly improves robust
collaboration and competition with unseen teammates and opponents, surpassing
established baselines. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: The study analyzes stakeholder perceptions of Generative AI (GAI) in education using social media data, proposing a modular LLM-based framework that outperforms classical NLP models. It reveals contrasting student and teacher concerns and suggests policy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how students and educators perceive GAI tools in education, given their rapid adoption and transformative potential.

Method: Analyzed 1,199 Reddit posts and 13,959 comments using sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and author classification. Proposed a GPT-4o-based framework and compared it to classical NLP models.

Result: GPT-4o achieved 90.6% accuracy in sentiment analysis. Identified 12 latent topics, with students optimistic about personalized learning but distressed by cheating accusations, while teachers worried about job security and integrity.

Conclusion: Clearer policies, transparent GAI integration, and support mechanisms are needed. The study highlights LLM frameworks' potential for analyzing online discourse.

Abstract: Generative AI (GAI) technologies are quickly reshaping the educational
landscape. As adoption accelerates, understanding how students and educators
perceive these tools is essential. This study presents one of the most
comprehensive analyses to date of stakeholder discourse dynamics on GAI in
education using social media data. Our dataset includes 1,199 Reddit posts and
13,959 corresponding top-level comments. We apply sentiment analysis, topic
modeling, and author classification. To support this, we propose and validate a
modular framework that leverages prompt-based large language models (LLMs) for
analysis of online social discourse, and we evaluate this framework against
classical natural language processing (NLP) models. Our GPT-4o pipeline
consistently outperforms prior approaches across all tasks. For example, it
achieved 90.6% accuracy in sentiment analysis against gold-standard human
annotations. Topic extraction uncovered 12 latent topics in the public
discourse with varying sentiment and author distributions. Teachers and
students convey optimism about GAI's potential for personalized learning and
productivity in higher education. However, key differences emerged: students
often voice distress over false accusations of cheating by AI detectors, while
teachers generally express concern about job security, academic integrity, and
institutional pressures to adopt GAI tools. These contrasting perspectives
highlight the tension between innovation and oversight in GAI-enabled learning
environments. Our findings suggest a need for clearer institutional policies,
more transparent GAI integration practices, and support mechanisms for both
educators and students. More broadly, this study demonstrates the potential of
LLM-based frameworks for modeling stakeholder discourse within online
communities.

TL;DR: AI-based method for non-destructive estimation of chemical potential and temperature in ultracold Bose gases using single-shot density profiles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome challenges in thermodynamic parameter measurement due to destructive techniques and experimental uncertainties.

Method: Convolutional neural network trained on quasi-2D condensates in harmonic traps, generalizing to other geometries and dynamics.

Result: Accurate parameter extraction in seconds, with errors of a few nanokelvin, even for untrained geometries and non-equilibrium states.

Conclusion: Supervised learning can enhance ultracold atom thermometry, enabling real-time analysis and improved experimental workflows.

Abstract: Precise determination of thermodynamic parameters in ultracold Bose gases
remains challenging due to the destructive nature of conventional measurement
techniques and inherent experimental uncertainties. We demonstrate an
artificial intelligence approach for rapid, non-destructive estimation of the
chemical potential and temperature from single-shot, in situ imaged density
profiles of finite-temperature Bose gases. Our convolutional neural network is
trained exclusively on quasi-2D `pancake' condensates in harmonic trap
configurations. It achieves parameter extraction within fractions of a second.
The model also demonstrates zero-shot generalisation across both trap geometry
and thermalisation dynamics, successfully estimating thermodynamic parameters
for toroidally trapped condensates with errors of only a few nanokelvin despite
no prior exposure to such geometries during training, and maintaining
predictive accuracy during dynamic thermalisation processes after a relatively
brief evolution without explicit training on non-equilibrium states. These
results suggest that supervised learning can overcome traditional limitations
in ultracold atom thermometry, with extension to broader geometric
configurations, temperature ranges, and additional parameters potentially
enabling comprehensive real-time analysis of quantum gas experiments. Such
capabilities could significantly streamline experimental workflows whilst
improving measurement precision across a range of quantum fluid systems.

TL;DR: The paper reviews machine learning approaches for interpretable property market models in Russia's Primorye region, addressing challenges like noisy data and proposing solutions like linear regression with geostatistics for land and RuleFit for flats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle the gap between noisy real-world property data and idealized machine learning tutorial data, focusing on interpretability for practical applications like legal matters.

Method: The paper outlines stages from data collection to model evaluation, using linear regression with geostatistics for land parcels and RuleFit (decision tree-based) for flats.

Result: Effective interpretable models are built despite noisy data, demonstrating the feasibility of combining classical and advanced methods.

Conclusion: Interpretable models for property markets are achievable with tailored methods, balancing practicality and effectiveness.

Abstract: In this article, we review modern approaches to building interpretable models
of property markets using machine learning on the base of mass valuation of
property in the Primorye region, Russia. The researcher, lacking expertise in
this topic, encounters numerous difficulties in the effort to build a good
model. The main source of this is the huge difference between noisy real market
data and ideal data which is very common in all types of tutorials on machine
learning. This paper covers all stages of modeling: the collection of initial
data, identification of outliers, the search and analysis of patterns in data,
the formation and final choice of price factors, the building of the model, and
the evaluation of its efficiency. For each stage, we highlight potential issues
and describe sound methods for overcoming emerging difficulties on actual
examples. We show that the combination of classical linear regression with
interpolation methods of geostatistics allows to build an effective model for
land parcels. For flats, when many objects are attributed to one spatial point
the application of geostatistical methods is difficult. Therefore we suggest
linear regression with automatic generation and selection of additional rules
on the base of decision trees, so called the RuleFit method. Thus we show, that
despite the strong restriction as the requirement of interpretability which is
important in practical aspects, for example, legal matters, it is still
possible to build effective models of real property markets.

*Yi Liu,Hongji Zhang,Yunhao Zhou,Zhengyuan Shi,Changran Xu,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: DeepRTL2 is a versatile LLM addressing both generation- and embedding-based tasks in EDA, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work focused on generation-based tasks in EDA, neglecting embedding-based tasks critical for hardware design.

Method: DeepRTL2 unifies generation- and embedding-based tasks, offering a comprehensive solution.

Result: DeepRTL2 achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated tasks.

Conclusion: DeepRTL2 provides a unified and effective approach for diverse EDA challenges.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into electronic design
automation (EDA) has significantly advanced the field, offering transformative
benefits, particularly in register transfer level (RTL) code generation and
understanding. While previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of
fine-tuning LLMs for these generation-based tasks, embedding-based tasks, which
are equally critical to EDA workflows, have been largely overlooked. These
tasks, including natural language code search, RTL code functionality
equivalence checking, and performance prediction, are essential for
accelerating and optimizing the hardware design process. To address this gap,
we present DeepRTL2, a family of versatile LLMs that unifies both generation-
and embedding-based tasks related to RTL. By simultaneously tackling a broad
range of tasks, DeepRTL2 represents the first model to provide a comprehensive
solution to the diverse challenges in EDA. Through extensive experiments, we
show that DeepRTL2 achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated
tasks.

### [436] [RCNet: $ΔΣ$ IADCs as Recurrent AutoEncoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16903)
*Arnaud Verdant,William Guicquero,Jérôme Chossat*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: Proposes RCNet, a deep learning model for Delta-Sigma ADCs, using RNNs to optimize SNR under hardware constraints like area and capacitor size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage deep learning for optimizing Delta-Sigma ADCs, addressing hardware design constraints while improving SNR.

Method: Uses RNNs to model modulators and filters, applies high-end optimizers and custom losses for hardware constraints (quantized weights, noise injection, area).

Result: Achieves SNR >13bit under area constraints (<14pF capacitor) at OSR=80, showing best architectures don't require high-order modulators.

Conclusion: RCNet offers effective tradeoffs between SNR and hardware constraints, enabling topology exploration beyond traditional high-order modulators.

Abstract: This paper proposes a deep learning model (RCNet) for Delta-Sigma
($\Delta\Sigma$) ADCs. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) allow to describe both
modulators and filters. This analogy is applied to Incremental ADCs (IADC).
High-end optimizers combined with full-custom losses are used to define
additional hardware design constraints: quantized weights, signal saturation,
temporal noise injection, devices area. Focusing on DC conversion, our early
results demonstrate that $SNR$ defined as an Effective Number Of Bits (ENOB)
can be optimized under a certain hardware mapping complexity. The proposed
RCNet succeeded to provide design tradeoffs in terms of $SNR$ ($>$13bit) versus
area constraints ($<$14pF total capacitor) at a given $OSR$ (80 samples).
Interestingly, it appears that the best RCNet architectures do not necessarily
rely on high-order modulators, leveraging additional topology exploration
degrees of freedom.

### [437] [Context Matters! Relaxing Goals with LLMs for Feasible 3D Scene Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15828)
*Emanuele Musumeci,Michele Brienza,Francesco Argenziano,Vincenzo Suriani,Daniele Nardi,Domenico D. Bloisi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper integrates classical planning with LLMs to address limitations in robot adaptability and perception, proposing a hierarchical method for relaxed planning in complex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical planning methods often fail in real-world robot scenarios due to limited perception and hard-coded behaviors, while LLMs generate unfeasible or unsafe plans.

Method: A hierarchical approach combining classical planning with LLMs, leveraging commonsense reasoning and gradual goal relaxation for adaptability.

Result: The method effectively adapts and executes tasks in complex environments, outperforming benchmark approaches.

Conclusion: The integration of classical planning and LLMs offers a robust solution for adaptable robot task execution, supported by empirical evaluations.

Abstract: Classical planning in AI and Robotics addresses complex tasks by shifting
from imperative to declarative approaches (e.g., PDDL). However, these methods
often fail in real scenarios due to limited robot perception and the need to
ground perceptions to planning predicates. This often results in heavily
hard-coded behaviors that struggle to adapt, even with scenarios where goals
can be achieved through relaxed planning. Meanwhile, Large Language Models
(LLMs) lead to planning systems that leverage commonsense reasoning but often
at the cost of generating unfeasible and/or unsafe plans. To address these
limitations, we present an approach integrating classical planning with LLMs,
leveraging their ability to extract commonsense knowledge and ground actions.
We propose a hierarchical formulation that enables robots to make unfeasible
tasks tractable by defining functionally equivalent goals through gradual
relaxation. This mechanism supports partial achievement of the intended
objective, suited to the agent's specific context. Our method demonstrates its
ability to adapt and execute tasks effectively within environments modeled
using 3D Scene Graphs through comprehensive qualitative and quantitative
evaluations. We also show how this method succeeds in complex scenarios where
other benchmark methods are more likely to fail. Code, dataset, and additional
material are released to the community.

### [438] [SafeMimic: Towards Safe and Autonomous Human-to-Robot Imitation for Mobile Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15847)
*Arpit Bahety,Arnav Balaji,Ben Abbatematteo,Roberto Martín-Martín*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SafeMimic enables robots to learn mobile manipulation tasks safely and autonomously from a single human video demonstration, adapting actions to the robot's morphology and ensuring safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce dependency on human monitoring and enable robots to learn tasks efficiently by observing humans.

Method: Parse human video into segments, infer semantic changes and motions, adapt actions to robot's morphology, and verify safety using an ensemble of Q-functions.

Result: SafeMimic successfully learns multi-step tasks from single demonstrations, improving over baselines in seven tasks.

Conclusion: SafeMimic provides a robust framework for autonomous and safe learning of mobile manipulation tasks from human demonstrations.

Abstract: For robots to become efficient helpers in the home, they must learn to
perform new mobile manipulation tasks simply by watching humans perform them.
Learning from a single video demonstration from a human is challenging as the
robot needs to first extract from the demo what needs to be done and how,
translate the strategy from a third to a first-person perspective, and then
adapt it to be successful with its own morphology. Furthermore, to mitigate the
dependency on costly human monitoring, this learning process should be
performed in a safe and autonomous manner. We present SafeMimic, a framework to
learn new mobile manipulation skills safely and autonomously from a single
third-person human video. Given an initial human video demonstration of a
multi-step mobile manipulation task, SafeMimic first parses the video into
segments, inferring both the semantic changes caused and the motions the human
executed to achieve them and translating them to an egocentric reference. Then,
it adapts the behavior to the robot's own morphology by sampling candidate
actions around the human ones, and verifying them for safety before execution
in a receding horizon fashion using an ensemble of safety Q-functions trained
in simulation. When safe forward progression is not possible, SafeMimic
backtracks to previous states and attempts a different sequence of actions,
adapting both the trajectory and the grasping modes when required for its
morphology. As a result, SafeMimic yields a strategy that succeeds in the
demonstrated behavior and learns task-specific actions that reduce exploration
in future attempts. Our experiments show that our method allows robots to
safely and efficiently learn multi-step mobile manipulation behaviors from a
single human demonstration, from different users, and in different
environments, with improvements over state-of-the-art baselines across seven
tasks

Motivation: To explore the untapped potential of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in endoscopy robotics, aiming to improve diagnostic and treatment outcomes through intuitive human-device interaction.

Method: Developed CapsDT, a model processing visual and textual inputs to infer robotic control signals, and built a capsule endoscopy robot system with a magnet-controlled capsule for task-specific datasets.

Result: CapsDT achieved state-of-the-art performance in endoscopy tasks, with a 26.25% success rate in real-world simulations.

Conclusion: CapsDT proves to be a robust vision-language generalist, enhancing endoscopy robotics with improved interaction and task performance.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a prominent research
area, showcasing significant potential across a variety of applications.
However, their performance in endoscopy robotics, particularly endoscopy
capsule robots that perform actions within the digestive system, remains
unexplored. The integration of VLA models into endoscopy robots allows more
intuitive and efficient interactions between human operators and medical
devices, improving both diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcomes. In this
work, we design CapsDT, a Diffusion Transformer model for capsule robot
manipulation in the stomach. By processing interleaved visual inputs, and
textual instructions, CapsDT can infer corresponding robotic control signals to
facilitate endoscopy tasks. In addition, we developed a capsule endoscopy robot
system, a capsule robot controlled by a robotic arm-held magnet, addressing
different levels of four endoscopy tasks and creating corresponding capsule
robot datasets within the stomach simulator. Comprehensive evaluations on
various robotic tasks indicate that CapsDT can serve as a robust
vision-language generalist, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various
levels of endoscopy tasks while achieving a 26.25% success rate in real-world
simulation manipulation.

### [440] [PRISM-Loc: a Lightweight Long-range LiDAR Localization in Urban Environments with Topological Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15849)
*Kirill Muravyev,Vasily Yuryev,Oleg Bulichev,Dmitry Yudin,Konstantin Yakovlev*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PRISM-Loc is a topological map-based localization method for large environments, combining global place recognition and local pose estimation, outperforming state-of-the-art competitors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Localization in dense global lidar maps is memory-intensive and computationally challenging for long-range routes, prompting the need for efficient alternatives like topological maps.

Method: PRISM-Loc uses a twofold pipeline: global place recognition and local pose estimation via a novel 2D feature-based lidar scan matching algorithm.

Result: Evaluated on a 3 km route (ITLP-Campus dataset), PRISM-Loc surpasses competitors in quality and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a scalable and efficient solution for localization in large environments.

Abstract: Localization in the environment is one of the crucial tasks of navigation of
a mobile robot or a self-driving vehicle. For long-range routes, performing
localization within a dense global lidar map in real time may be difficult, and
the creation of such a map may require much memory. To this end, leveraging
topological maps may be useful. In this work, we propose PRISM-Loc -- a
topological map-based approach for localization in large environments. The
proposed approach leverages a twofold localization pipeline, which consists of
global place recognition and estimation of the local pose inside the found
location. For local pose estimation, we introduce an original lidar scan
matching algorithm, which is based on 2D features and point-based optimization.
We evaluate the proposed method on the ITLP-Campus dataset on a 3 km route, and
compare it against the state-of-the-art metric map-based and place
recognition-based competitors. The results of the experiments show that the
proposed method outperforms its competitors both quality-wise and
computationally-wise.

### [441] [Semantic and Feature Guided Uncertainty Quantification of Visual Localization for Autonomous Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15851)
*Qiyuan Wu,Mark Campbell*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for uncertainty quantification in visual localization for autonomous driving, using a lightweight sensor error model to predict non-Gaussian measurement errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate uncertainty quantification is vital for safety-critical robotics applications like self-driving cars, especially under varying environmental conditions.

Method: A lightweight sensor error model maps image features and semantic information to a 2D error distribution, capturing contextual factors implicitly.

Result: The Gaussian Mixture model outperforms Gaussian assumptions, especially in poor weather and lighting conditions, as validated on the Ithaca365 dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively quantifies uncertainty in visual localization, improving robustness for autonomous driving in diverse conditions.

Abstract: The uncertainty quantification of sensor measurements coupled with deep
learning networks is crucial for many robotics systems, especially for
safety-critical applications such as self-driving cars. This paper develops an
uncertainty quantification approach in the context of visual localization for
autonomous driving, where locations are selected based on images. Key to our
approach is to learn the measurement uncertainty using light-weight sensor
error model, which maps both image feature and semantic information to
2-dimensional error distribution. Our approach enables uncertainty estimation
conditioned on the specific context of the matched image pair, implicitly
capturing other critical, unannotated factors (e.g., city vs highway, dynamic
vs static scenes, winter vs summer) in a latent manner. We demonstrate the
accuracy of our uncertainty prediction framework using the Ithaca365 dataset,
which includes variations in lighting and weather (sunny, night, snowy). Both
the uncertainty quantification of the sensor+network is evaluated, along with
Bayesian localization filters using unique sensor gating method. Results show
that the measurement error does not follow a Gaussian distribution with poor
weather and lighting conditions, and is better predicted by our Gaussian
Mixture model.

*Jiawen Yu,Jieji Ren,Yang Chang,Qiaojun Yu,Xuan Tong,Boyang Wang,Yan Song,You Li,Xinji Mai,Wenqiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel anomaly detection method (HetNet) improves industrial defect detection in complex environments by 10% over benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with defect detection in unstructured industrial settings due to varying conditions.

Method: Uses a collaborative distillation heterogeneous teacher network (HetNet), adaptive feature fusion, and noise generation.

Result: 10% improvement on MSC-AD benchmark; state-of-the-art on other datasets.

Conclusion: HetNet enhances reliability and real-time detection in diverse industrial scenarios.

Abstract: Anomaly detection and localization in automated industrial manufacturing can
significantly enhance production efficiency and product quality. Existing
methods are capable of detecting surface defects in pre-defined or controlled
imaging environments. However, accurately detecting workpiece defects in
complex and unstructured industrial environments with varying views, poses and
illumination remains challenging. We propose a novel anomaly detection and
localization method specifically designed to handle inputs with perturbative
patterns. Our approach introduces a new framework based on a collaborative
distillation heterogeneous teacher network (HetNet), an adaptive local-global
feature fusion module, and a local multivariate Gaussian noise generation
module. HetNet can learn to model the complex feature distribution of normal
patterns using limited information about local disruptive changes. We conducted
extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks. HetNet demonstrates superior
performance with approximately 10% improvement across all evaluation metrics on
MSC-AD under industrial conditions, while achieving state-of-the-art results on
other datasets, validating its resilience to environmental fluctuations and its
capability to enhance the reliability of industrial anomaly detection systems
across diverse scenarios. Tests in real-world environments further confirm that
HetNet can be effectively integrated into production lines to achieve robust
and real-time anomaly detection. Codes, images and videos are published on the
project website at: https://zihuatanejoyu.github.io/HetNet/

*Sen Wang,Le Wang,Sanping Zhou,Jingyi Tian,Jiayi Li,Haowen Sun,Wei Tang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FlowRAM is a novel framework using generative models for efficient robotic manipulation, improving precision and speed over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based policy learning methods are computationally inefficient and lack exploration of generative models for 3D environments.

Method: FlowRAM employs a Dynamic Radius Schedule for adaptive perception, state space models for multimodal integration, and conditional flow matching for action pose learning.

Result: FlowRAM achieves a 12.0% higher success rate in high-precision tasks and generates actions in under 4 time steps.

Conclusion: FlowRAM outperforms existing methods in precision and speed, demonstrating its effectiveness for robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in high-precision tasks is essential for numerous
industrial and real-world applications where accuracy and speed are required.
Yet current diffusion-based policy learning methods generally suffer from low
computational efficiency due to the iterative denoising process during
inference. Moreover, these methods do not fully explore the potential of
generative models for enhancing information exploration in 3D environments. In
response, we propose FlowRAM, a novel framework that leverages generative
models to achieve region-aware perception, enabling efficient multimodal
information processing. Specifically, we devise a Dynamic Radius Schedule,
which allows adaptive perception, facilitating transitions from global scene
comprehension to fine-grained geometric details. Furthermore, we integrate
state space models to integrate multimodal information, while preserving linear
computational complexity. In addition, we employ conditional flow matching to
learn action poses by regressing deterministic vector fields, simplifying the
learning process while maintaining performance. We verify the effectiveness of
the FlowRAM in the RLBench, an established manipulation benchmark, and achieve
state-of-the-art performance. The results demonstrate that FlowRAM achieves a
remarkable improvement, particularly in high-precision tasks, where it
outperforms previous methods by 12.0% in average success rate. Additionally,
FlowRAM is able to generate physically plausible actions for a variety of
real-world tasks in less than 4 time steps, significantly increasing inference
speed.

Motivation: Equipping quadrupedal robots with scalable autonomous manipulation skills is challenging.

Method: Developed a teleoperation and data collection pipeline, proposed a modularized architecture for co-training, and constructed a manipulation dataset.

Result: Achieved 41.9% average success rate improvement overall and 79.7% under OOD settings. Pretraining with human data added 38.6% and 82.7% improvements, respectively.

Conclusion: The system enhances manipulation performance, especially with limited robot data, and is open-sourced for broader use.

Abstract: Quadrupedal robots have demonstrated impressive locomotion capabilities in
complex environments, but equipping them with autonomous versatile manipulation
skills in a scalable way remains a significant challenge. In this work, we
introduce a cross-embodiment imitation learning system for quadrupedal
manipulation, leveraging data collected from both humans and LocoMan, a
quadruped equipped with multiple manipulation modes. Specifically, we develop a
teleoperation and data collection pipeline, which unifies and modularizes the
observation and action spaces of the human and the robot. To effectively
leverage the collected data, we propose an efficient modularized architecture
that supports co-training and pretraining on structured modality-aligned data
across different embodiments. Additionally, we construct the first manipulation
dataset for the LocoMan robot, covering various household tasks in both
unimanual and bimanual modes, supplemented by a corresponding human dataset. We
validate our system on six real-world manipulation tasks, where it achieves an
average success rate improvement of 41.9% overall and 79.7% under
out-of-distribution (OOD) settings compared to the baseline. Pretraining with
human data contributes a 38.6% success rate improvement overall and 82.7% under
OOD settings, enabling consistently better performance with only half the
amount of robot data. Our code, hardware, and data are open-sourced at:

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A framework integrating Semantic Digital Twins (SDTs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) for adaptive robotic task execution in dynamic environments, tested on ALFRED benchmark tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robots to interpret natural language instructions and adaptively execute tasks in dynamic environments by leveraging semantic grounding and real-time feedback.

Method: Decomposes instructions into structured action triplets grounded in SDT data, uses LLMs for planning and recovery, and iteratively revises plans based on feedback.

Result: Demonstrated robust performance in household scenarios, achieving reliable task completion despite uncertainty and failures.

Conclusion: The framework successfully combines high-level reasoning with semantic understanding for adaptive robotic task execution.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework that integrates Semantic Digital Twins (SDTs)
with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable adaptive and goal-driven robotic
task execution in dynamic environments. The system decomposes natural language
instructions into structured action triplets, which are grounded in contextual
environmental data provided by the SDT. This semantic grounding allows the
robot to interpret object affordances and interaction rules, enabling action
planning and real-time adaptability. In case of execution failures, the LLM
utilizes error feedback and SDT insights to generate recovery strategies and
iteratively revise the action plan. We evaluate our approach using tasks from
the ALFRED benchmark, demonstrating robust performance across various household
scenarios. The proposed framework effectively combines high-level reasoning
with semantic environment understanding, achieving reliable task completion in
the face of uncertainty and failure.

### [446] [Reimagination with Test-time Observation Interventions: Distractor-Robust World Model Predictions for Visual Model Predictive Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16565)
*Yuxin Chen,Jianglan Wei,Chenfeng Xu,Boyi Li,Masayoshi Tomizuka,Andrea Bajcsy,Ran Tian*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Reimagination with Observation Intervention (ReOI) improves world model robustness by detecting and removing visual distractors during test-time, enhancing action outcome predictions in open-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: World models are brittle when encountering novel visual distractors, leading to corrupted predictions and downstream failures in robot planning and action verification.

Method: ReOI detects distractors, modifies observations to remove them, reimagines outcomes, and reintroduces distractors post-hoc for visual consistency.

Result: ReOI improves task success rates by up to 3x in the presence of novel distractors, outperforming methods without intervention.

Conclusion: ReOI is a simple yet effective strategy for enhancing world model reliability in open-world robotic tasks.

Abstract: World models enable robots to "imagine" future observations given current
observations and planned actions, and have been increasingly adopted as
generalized dynamics models to facilitate robot learning. Despite their
promise, these models remain brittle when encountering novel visual distractors
such as objects and background elements rarely seen during training.
Specifically, novel distractors can corrupt action outcome predictions, causing
downstream failures when robots rely on the world model imaginations for
planning or action verification. In this work, we propose Reimagination with
Observation Intervention (ReOI), a simple yet effective test-time strategy that
enables world models to predict more reliable action outcomes in open-world
scenarios where novel and unanticipated visual distractors are inevitable.
Given the current robot observation, ReOI first detects visual distractors by
identifying which elements of the scene degrade in physically implausible ways
during world model prediction. Then, it modifies the current observation to
remove these distractors and bring the observation closer to the training
distribution. Finally, ReOI "reimagines" future outcomes with the modified
observation and reintroduces the distractors post-hoc to preserve visual
consistency for downstream planning and verification. We validate our approach
on a suite of robotic manipulation tasks in the context of action verification,
where the verifier needs to select desired action plans based on predictions
from a world model. Our results show that ReOI is robust to both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution visual distractors. Notably, it
improves task success rates by up to 3x in the presence of novel distractors,
significantly outperforming action verification that relies on world model
predictions without imagination interventions.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a bi-level interaction decision-making algorithm (BIDA) combining interactive MCTS with DRL to improve AV decision-making in dynamic traffic scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the unpredictability of human behaviors in dynamic traffic environments like multi-lane highways and unsignalized T-intersections.

Method: Integrates interactive MCTS with DRL, using three DRL algorithms to guide MCTS via value and policy networks, and implements a dynamic trajectory planner in CARLA.

Result: BIDA enhances interaction rationality, efficiency, and safety, outperforming benchmarks with reduced computational costs.

Conclusion: BIDA is effective for AV decision-making in dynamic traffic, demonstrating superior performance in safety and interaction rationality.

Abstract: In complex real-world traffic environments, autonomous vehicles (AVs) need to
interact with other traffic participants while making real-time and
safety-critical decisions accordingly. The unpredictability of human behaviors
poses significant challenges, particularly in dynamic scenarios, such as
multi-lane highways and unsignalized T-intersections. To address this gap, we
design a bi-level interaction decision-making algorithm (BIDA) that integrates
interactive Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) with deep reinforcement learning
(DRL), aiming to enhance interaction rationality, efficiency and safety of AVs
in dynamic key traffic scenarios. Specifically, we adopt three types of DRL
algorithms to construct a reliable value network and policy network, which
guide the online deduction process of interactive MCTS by assisting in value
update and node selection. Then, a dynamic trajectory planner and a trajectory
tracking controller are designed and implemented in CARLA to ensure smooth
execution of planned maneuvers. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our
BIDA not only enhances interactive deduction and reduces computational costs,
but also outperforms other latest benchmarks, which exhibits superior safety,
efficiency and interaction rationality under varying traffic conditions.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel robotic framework uses a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to interpret ambiguous natural language instructions, generating executable code and 3D attention maps to resolve ambiguities and improve task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address ambiguity and vagueness in natural language instructions for robotic manipulation, overcoming limitations of end-to-end models lacking modularity and interpretability.

Method: Employ a VLM to interpret instructions and generate task-specific code, integrating spatial and semantic information via 3D attention maps.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in tasks with language ambiguity, contact-rich manipulation, and multi-object interactions.

Conclusion: The framework effectively resolves instruction ambiguities and enhances robotic manipulation performance, highlighting limitations of current imitation learning methods.

Abstract: Natural language instructions for robotic manipulation tasks often exhibit
ambiguity and vagueness. For instance, the instruction "Hang a mug on the mug
tree" may involve multiple valid actions if there are several mugs and branches
to choose from. Existing language-conditioned policies typically rely on
end-to-end models that jointly handle high-level semantic understanding and
low-level action generation, which can result in suboptimal performance due to
their lack of modularity and interpretability. To address these challenges, we
introduce a novel robotic manipulation framework that can accomplish tasks
specified by potentially ambiguous natural language. This framework employs a
Vision-Language Model (VLM) to interpret abstract concepts in natural language
instructions and generates task-specific code - an interpretable and executable
intermediate representation. The generated code interfaces with the perception
module to produce 3D attention maps that highlight task-relevant regions by
integrating spatial and semantic information, effectively resolving ambiguities
in instructions. Through extensive experiments, we identify key limitations of
current imitation learning methods, such as poor adaptation to language and
environmental variations. We show that our approach excels across challenging
manipulation tasks involving language ambiguity, contact-rich manipulation, and
multi-object interactions.

*Teng Guo,Baichuan Huang,Jingjin Yu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MOMA is a novel framework for accurate metric depth estimation from a single RGB image, addressing limitations of existing methods and demonstrating strong generalization in robotic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 6D pose estimation methods rely on expensive, noisy depth sensors or fail to generalize with monocular depth estimation models.

Method: MOMA uses one-shot adaptation with scale-rotation-shift alignments during calibration, guided by sparse ground-truth depth points.

Result: MOMA achieves high success rates in real-world robotic tasks like grasping and bin-picking.

Conclusion: MOMA provides an effective solution for metric depth estimation without additional data or retraining, with strong generalization.

Abstract: Accurate 6D object pose estimation is a prerequisite for successfully
completing robotic prehensile and non-prehensile manipulation tasks. At
present, 6D pose estimation for robotic manipulation generally relies on depth
sensors based on, e.g., structured light, time-of-flight, and stereo-vision,
which can be expensive, produce noisy output (as compared with RGB cameras),
and fail to handle transparent objects. On the other hand, state-of-the-art
monocular depth estimation models (MDEMs) provide only affine-invariant depths
up to an unknown scale and shift. Metric MDEMs achieve some successful
zero-shot results on public datasets, but fail to generalize. We propose a
novel framework, Monocular One-shot Metric-depth Alignment (MOMA), to recover
metric depth from a single RGB image, through a one-shot adaptation building on
MDEM techniques. MOMA performs scale-rotation-shift alignments during camera
calibration, guided by sparse ground-truth depth points, enabling accurate
depth estimation without additional data collection or model retraining on the
testing setup. MOMA supports fine-tuning the MDEM on transparent objects,
demonstrating strong generalization capabilities. Real-world experiments on
tabletop 2-finger grasping and suction-based bin-picking applications show MOMA
achieves high success rates in diverse tasks, confirming its effectiveness.

Method: The framework employs dynamic, history-aware prompting to provide VLM with action history context, generating semantic guidance scores and avoiding decision loops. It also includes a VLM-assisted waypoint generation mechanism.

Result: Achieves 46% Success Rate (SR) and 24.8% SPL on HM3D dataset, comparable to state-of-the-art zero-shot methods.

Conclusion: The history-augmented VLM prompting strategy shows significant potential for robust, context-aware robotic navigation.

Abstract: Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) challenges robots to find objects in
unseen environments, demanding sophisticated reasoning. While Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) show potential, current ObjectNav methods often employ them
superficially, primarily using vision-language embeddings for object-scene
similarity checks rather than leveraging deeper reasoning. This limits
contextual understanding and leads to practical issues like repetitive
navigation behaviors. This paper introduces a novel zero-shot ObjectNav
framework that pioneers the use of dynamic, history-aware prompting to more
deeply integrate VLM reasoning into frontier-based exploration. Our core
innovation lies in providing the VLM with action history context, enabling it
to generate semantic guidance scores for navigation actions while actively
avoiding decision loops. We also introduce a VLM-assisted waypoint generation
mechanism for refining the final approach to detected objects. Evaluated on the
HM3D dataset within Habitat, our approach achieves a 46% Success Rate (SR) and
24.8% Success weighted by Path Length (SPL). These results are comparable to
state-of-the-art zero-shot methods, demonstrating the significant potential of
our history-augmented VLM prompting strategy for more robust and context-aware
robotic navigation.

TL;DR: Dex1B is a large-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset for dexterous hand manipulation tasks, generated using a novel generative model with geometric constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of creating large-scale demonstrations for dexterous hand manipulation, which is difficult due to the complexity and diversity required.

Method: Proposes a generative model integrating geometric constraints for feasibility and additional conditions for diversity, applied to generate one billion demonstrations for grasping and articulation tasks.

Result: Outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in simulation benchmarks and shows effectiveness in real-world robot experiments.

Conclusion: Dex1B and the proposed generative model provide a robust solution for generating diverse and feasible dexterous manipulation demonstrations.

Abstract: Generating large-scale demonstrations for dexterous hand manipulation remains
challenging, and several approaches have been proposed in recent years to
address this. Among them, generative models have emerged as a promising
paradigm, enabling the efficient creation of diverse and physically plausible
demonstrations. In this paper, we introduce Dex1B, a large-scale, diverse, and
high-quality demonstration dataset produced with generative models. The dataset
contains one billion demonstrations for two fundamental tasks: grasping and
articulation. To construct it, we propose a generative model that integrates
geometric constraints to improve feasibility and applies additional conditions
to enhance diversity. We validate the model on both established and newly
introduced simulation benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms prior
state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate its effectiveness and
robustness through real-world robot experiments. Our project page is at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates RL for dexterous object handover between multi-finger hands, using a dual quaternion-based reward function to outperform other rotation representations. The policy achieves 94% success rate and shows robustness to novel objects and perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robots to perform safe and efficient object handovers in collaborative settings, a crucial skill for real-world deployment.

Method: Uses Reinforcement Learning with a novel dual quaternion-based reward function to minimize rotation distance, tested on novel objects and perturbations.

Result: Achieves 94% success rate in best-case scenarios, with only a 13.8% performance drop under perturbations.

Conclusion: The RL-based policy is robust for object handovers, handling novel objects and real-world perturbations effectively.

Abstract: Object handover is an important skill that we use daily when interacting with
other humans. To deploy robots in collaborative setting, like houses, being
able to receive and handing over objects safely and efficiently becomes a
crucial skill. In this work, we demonstrate the use of Reinforcement Learning
(RL) for dexterous object handover between two multi-finger hands. Key to this
task is the use of a novel reward function based on dual quaternions to
minimize the rotation distance, which outperforms other rotation
representations such as Euler and rotation matrices. The robustness of the
trained policy is experimentally evaluated by testing w.r.t. objects that are
not included in the training distribution, and perturbations during the
handover process. The results demonstrate that the trained policy successfully
perform this task, achieving a total success rate of 94% in the best-case
scenario after 100 experiments, thereby showing the robustness of our policy
with novel objects. In addition, the best-case performance of the policy
decreases by only 13.8% when the other robot moves during the handover, proving
that our policy is also robust to this type of perturbation, which is common in
real-world object handovers.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DSRL enables efficient autonomous improvement of BC-trained policies via RL in latent-noise space, avoiding costly human demonstrations and policy weight modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving BC-learned policies traditionally requires expensive human demonstrations, while RL lacks sample efficiency. DSRL bridges this gap.

Method: DSRL adapts BC policies by running RL over their latent-noise space, requiring only black-box access and no weight modifications.

Result: DSRL is highly sample-efficient and effective for real-world policy improvement, demonstrated in simulations and robotic tasks.

Conclusion: DSRL offers a practical solution for autonomous policy adaptation, combining the strengths of BC and RL without their drawbacks.

Abstract: Robotic control policies learned from human demonstrations have achieved
impressive results in many real-world applications. However, in scenarios where
initial performance is not satisfactory, as is often the case in novel
open-world settings, such behavioral cloning (BC)-learned policies typically
require collecting additional human demonstrations to further improve their
behavior -- an expensive and time-consuming process. In contrast, reinforcement
learning (RL) holds the promise of enabling autonomous online policy
improvement, but often falls short of achieving this due to the large number of
samples it typically requires. In this work we take steps towards enabling fast
autonomous adaptation of BC-trained policies via efficient real-world RL.
Focusing in particular on diffusion policies -- a state-of-the-art BC
methodology -- we propose diffusion steering via reinforcement learning (DSRL):
adapting the BC policy by running RL over its latent-noise space. We show that
DSRL is highly sample efficient, requires only black-box access to the BC
policy, and enables effective real-world autonomous policy improvement.
Furthermore, DSRL avoids many of the challenges associated with finetuning
diffusion policies, obviating the need to modify the weights of the base policy
at all. We demonstrate DSRL on simulated benchmarks, real-world robotic tasks,
and for adapting pretrained generalist policies, illustrating its sample
efficiency and effective performance at real-world policy improvement.

*Prakrut Kotecha,Aditya Shirwatkar,Shishir Kolathaya*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LNNs improve sample efficiency (10x) and prediction accuracy (2-10x) for quadrupedal robots, enabling real-time control and better locomotion planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional dynamics models suffer from compounding errors; LNNs preserve physical laws for accurate, stable predictions.

Method: Evaluated four LNN-based dynamics models: full-order FD, diagonalized FD, full-order ID with FD inference, and reduced-order CoM dynamics.

Result: LNNs outperform baselines in efficiency and accuracy, with diagonalization reducing computational complexity.

Conclusion: LNNs effectively capture system dynamics, enhancing locomotion planning and control, and are suitable for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Lagrangian Neural Networks (LNNs) present a principled and interpretable
framework for learning the system dynamics by utilizing inductive biases. While
traditional dynamics models struggle with compounding errors over long
horizons, LNNs intrinsically preserve the physical laws governing any system,
enabling accurate and stable predictions essential for sustainable locomotion.
This work evaluates LNNs for infinite horizon planning in quadrupedal robots
through four dynamics models: (1) full-order forward dynamics (FD) training and
inference, (2) diagonalized representation of Mass Matrix in full order FD, (3)
full-order inverse dynamics (ID) training with FD inference, (4) reduced-order
modeling via torso centre-of-mass (CoM) dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that
LNNs bring improvements in sample efficiency (10x) and superior prediction
accuracy (up to 2-10x) compared to baseline methods. Notably, the
diagonalization approach of LNNs reduces computational complexity while
retaining some interpretability, enabling real-time receding horizon control.
These findings highlight the advantages of LNNs in capturing the underlying
structure of system dynamics in quadrupeds, leading to improved performance and
efficiency in locomotion planning and control. Additionally, our approach
achieves a higher control frequency than previous LNN methods, demonstrating
its potential for real-world deployment on quadrupeds.

*Ziv Aharoni,Bashar Huleihel,Henry D Pfister,Haim H Permuter*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper introduces neural polar decoders (NPDs) to optimize communication code rates, especially for unknown channel models, by estimating mutual information (MI) and optimizing input distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address scenarios where the channel model is unknown and improve code rates by optimizing input distributions using polar codes and NPDs.

Method: A two-phase process: training (MI estimation and input distribution optimization) and inference (constructing polar codes using the HY scheme and list decoding).

Result: Significant improvements in MI and BER for non-uniform input distributions, validated for block lengths up to 1024.

Conclusion: The scalable method bridges theory and practice, showing promise for real-world communication systems.

Abstract: This paper proposes a method to optimize communication code rates via the
application of neural polar decoders (NPDs). Employing this approach enables
simultaneous optimization of code rates over input distributions while
providing a practical coding scheme within the framework of polar codes. The
proposed approach is designed for scenarios where the channel model is unknown,
treating the channel as a black box that produces output samples from input
samples. We employ polar codes to achieve our objectives, using NPDs to
estimate mutual information (MI) between the channel inputs and outputs, and
optimize a parametric model of the input distribution. The methodology involves
a two-phase process: a training phase and an inference phase. In the training
phase, two steps are repeated interchangeably. First, the estimation step
estimates the MI of the channel inputs and outputs via NPDs. Second, the
improvement step optimizes the input distribution parameters to maximize the MI
estimate obtained by the NPDs. In the inference phase, the optimized model is
used to construct polar codes. This involves incorporating the Honda-Yamamoto
(HY) scheme to accommodate the optimized input distributions and list decoding
to enhance decoding performance. Experimental results on memoryless and
finite-state channels (FSCs) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
particularly in cases where the channel's capacity-achieving input distribution
is non-uniform. For these cases, we show significant improvements in MI and bit
error rates (BERs) over those achieved by uniform and independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.) input distributions, validating our method for
block lengths up to 1024. This scalable approach has potential applications in
real-world communication systems, bridging theoretical capacity estimation and
practical coding performance.

*Ziv Aharoni,Henry D. Pfister*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper proposes neural polar decoders (NPDs) for low-complexity decoding in DNA data storage systems, addressing synchronization errors like insertions and deletions. NPDs achieve near-optimal performance with reduced complexity and no explicit channel model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synchronization errors in DNA-based data storage systems, modeled as IDS channels, pose a challenge due to high computational costs of maximum-likelihood decoders.

Method: A data-driven approach using neural polar decoders (NPDs) is introduced, requiring only sample access to the channel and offering reduced complexity (O(AN log N)).

Result: NPDs achieve near-optimal decoding performance and accurate mutual information estimation, outperforming existing methods with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: NPDs show promise for efficient and robust decoding in DNA data storage, with potential applications in real-world sequencing data.

Abstract: Synchronization errors, such as insertions and deletions, present a
fundamental challenge in DNA-based data storage systems, arising from both
synthesis and sequencing noise. These channels are often modeled as
insertion-deletion-substitution (IDS) channels, for which designing
maximum-likelihood decoders is computationally expensive. In this work, we
propose a data-driven approach based on neural polar decoders (NPDs) to design
low-complexity decoders for channels with synchronization errors. The proposed
architecture enables decoding over IDS channels with reduced complexity $O(AN
log N )$, where $A$ is a tunable parameter independent of the channel. NPDs
require only sample access to the channel and can be trained without an
explicit channel model. Additionally, NPDs provide mutual information (MI)
estimates that can be used to optimize input distributions and code design. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of NPDs on both synthetic deletion and IDS
channels. For deletion channels, we show that NPDs achieve near-optimal
decoding performance and accurate MI estimation, with significantly lower
complexity than trellis-based decoders. We also provide numerical estimates of
the channel capacity for the deletion channel. We extend our evaluation to
realistic DNA storage settings, including channels with multiple noisy reads
and real-world Nanopore sequencing data. Our results show that NPDs match or
surpass the performance of existing methods while using significantly fewer
parameters than the state-of-the-art. These findings highlight the promise of
NPDs for robust and efficient decoding in DNA data storage systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between interpretability and predictive accuracy in regression trees, addressing the limitations of existing models like CART and Lasso.

Method: TRUST integrates Random Forest-like accuracy with shallow decision trees and sparse linear models, using LLMs for user-friendly explanations.

Result: TRUST outperforms interpretable models (CART, Lasso, Node Harvest) in accuracy, matches Random Forest, and improves interpretability over M5'.

Conclusion: TRUST successfully balances accuracy and interpretability, offering a robust alternative to both black-box and traditional interpretable models.

Abstract: Piecewise-constant regression trees remain popular for their
interpretability, yet often lag behind black-box models like Random Forest in
predictive accuracy. In this work, we introduce TRUST (Transparent, Robust, and
Ultra-Sparse Trees), a novel regression tree model that combines the accuracy
of Random Forests with the interpretability of shallow decision trees and
sparse linear models. TRUST further enhances transparency by leveraging Large
Language Models to generate tailored, user-friendly explanations. Extensive
validation on synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets demonstrates that
TRUST consistently outperforms other interpretable models -- including CART,
Lasso, and Node Harvest -- in predictive accuracy, while matching the accuracy
of Random Forest and offering substantial gains in both accuracy and
interpretability over M5', a well-established model that is conceptually
related.

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: A unified Bayesian framework integrates multi-sensor time-series and failure mode data for accurate RUL prediction with uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models ignore relationships between failure modes and RUL prediction or lack statistical rigor.

Method: Combines Cox proportional hazards, Convolved Multi-output Gaussian Process, and multinomial failure mode distributions in a hierarchical Bayesian framework.

Result: Validated with numerical and case studies on jet-engine datasets.

Conclusion: Proposed model improves accuracy and uncertainty quantification in RUL prediction.

Abstract: Modern industrial systems are often subject to multiple failure modes, and
their conditions are monitored by multiple sensors, generating multiple
time-series signals. Additionally, time-to-failure data are commonly available.
Accurately predicting a system's remaining useful life (RUL) requires
effectively leveraging multi-sensor time-series data alongside multi-mode
failure event data. In most existing models, failure modes and RUL prediction
are performed independently, ignoring the inherent relationship between these
two tasks. Some models integrate multiple failure modes and event prediction
using black-box machine learning approaches, which lack statistical rigor and
cannot characterize the inherent uncertainty in the model and data. This paper
introduces a unified approach to jointly model the multi-sensor time-series
data and failure time concerning multiple failure modes. This proposed model
integrate a Cox proportional hazards model, a Convolved Multi-output Gaussian
Process, and multinomial failure mode distributions in a hierarchical Bayesian
framework with corresponding priors, enabling accurate prediction with robust
uncertainty quantification. Posterior distributions are effectively obtained by
Variational Bayes, and prediction is performed with Monte Carlo sampling. The
advantages of the proposed model is validated through extensive numerical and
case studies with jet-engine dataset.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Dual Watermarking reduces false positives in detecting AI-generated text by separating detection and identification watermarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the false detection problem in digital watermarking when the same embedding is used for both detection and user identification.

Method: Propose Dual Watermarking, which jointly encodes detection and identification watermarks.

Result: Significantly reduces false positives while maintaining high detection accuracy.

Conclusion: Dual Watermarking is effective in mitigating misuse of AI-generated text.

Abstract: Digital watermarking is a promising solution for mitigating some of the risks
arising from the misuse of automatically generated text. These approaches
either embed non-specific watermarks to allow for the detection of any text
generated by a particular sampler, or embed specific keys that allow the
identification of the LLM user. However, simultaneously using the same
embedding for both detection and user identification leads to a false detection
problem, whereby, as user capacity grows, unwatermarked text is increasingly
likely to be falsely detected as watermarked. Through theoretical analysis, we
identify the underlying causes of this phenomenon. Building on these insights,
we propose Dual Watermarking which jointly encodes detection and identification
watermarks into generated text, significantly reducing false positives while
maintaining high detection accuracy. Our experimental results validate our
theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: BEAT is a black-box defense method for detecting backdoor attacks in LLMs by measuring output distribution distortion when concatenating inputs with probes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backdoor attacks compromise LLM safety alignment stealthily, posing threats in black-box LLMaaS settings. BEAT addresses this by leveraging the probe concatenate effect.

Method: BEAT detects triggered samples by measuring distortion in output distribution before and after concatenating inputs with malicious probes, using multiple sampling for approximation.

Result: BEAT effectively defends against various backdoor attacks and LLMs, including GPT-3.5-turbo, and shows promise against jailbreak attacks.

Conclusion: BEAT provides a robust, efficient defense against backdoor attacks in black-box LLM settings, with potential applicability to jailbreak attacks.

Abstract: Backdoor unalignment attacks against Large Language Models (LLMs) enable the
stealthy compromise of safety alignment using a hidden trigger while evading
normal safety auditing. These attacks pose significant threats to the
applications of LLMs in the real-world Large Language Model as a Service
(LLMaaS) setting, where the deployed model is a fully black-box system that can
only interact through text. Furthermore, the sample-dependent nature of the
attack target exacerbates the threat. Instead of outputting a fixed label, the
backdoored LLM follows the semantics of any malicious command with the hidden
trigger, significantly expanding the target space. In this paper, we introduce
BEAT, a black-box defense that detects triggered samples during inference to
deactivate the backdoor. It is motivated by an intriguing observation (dubbed
the probe concatenate effect), where concatenated triggered samples
significantly reduce the refusal rate of the backdoored LLM towards a malicious
probe, while non-triggered samples have little effect. Specifically, BEAT
identifies whether an input is triggered by measuring the degree of distortion
in the output distribution of the probe before and after concatenation with the
input. Our method addresses the challenges of sample-dependent targets from an
opposite perspective. It captures the impact of the trigger on the refusal
signal (which is sample-independent) instead of sample-specific successful
attack behaviors. It overcomes black-box access limitations by using multiple
sampling to approximate the output distribution. Extensive experiments are
conducted on various backdoor attacks and LLMs (including the closed-source
GPT-3.5-turbo), verifying the effectiveness and efficiency of our defense.
Besides, we also preliminarily verify that BEAT can effectively defend against
popular jailbreak attacks, as they can be regarded as 'natural backdoors'.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in understanding and quantifying LLMs' criminal capabilities in realistic social contexts.

Method: Propose PRISON framework with five dimensions, evaluate using crime scenarios via role-play.

Result: LLMs show criminal tendencies (e.g., misleading statements) and detect deception poorly (41% accuracy).

Conclusion: Urgent need for adversarial robustness and safety mechanisms in LLM deployment.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, concerns about their misconduct in
complex social contexts intensify. Existing research overlooked the systematic
understanding and assessment of their criminal capability in realistic
interactions. We propose a unified framework PRISON, to quantify LLMs' criminal
potential across five dimensions: False Statements, Frame-Up, Psychological
Manipulation, Emotional Disguise, and Moral Disengagement. Using structured
crime scenarios adapted from classic films, we evaluate both criminal potential
and anti-crime ability of LLMs via role-play. Results show that
state-of-the-art LLMs frequently exhibit emergent criminal tendencies, such as
proposing misleading statements or evasion tactics, even without explicit
instructions. Moreover, when placed in a detective role, models recognize
deceptive behavior with only 41% accuracy on average, revealing a striking
mismatch between conducting and detecting criminal behavior. These findings
underscore the urgent need for adversarial robustness, behavioral alignment,
and safety mechanisms before broader LLM deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual evaluation of SAST tool reports is resource-intensive due to numerous false positives, reducing effectiveness.

Method: LLMs are used to assess SAST findings, tested on datasets from OWASP Benchmark and a real-world project with advanced prompting techniques.

Result: LLMs identified ~62.5% of FPs in OWASP Benchmark and ~33.85% in real-world datasets without missing true positives; combining LLMs improved detection further.

Conclusion: LLMs can complement SAST tools, enhancing automation and reducing false alarms.

Abstract: A key challenge in security analysis is the manual evaluation of potential
security weaknesses generated by static application security testing (SAST)
tools. Numerous false positives (FPs) in these reports reduce the effectiveness
of security analysis. We propose using Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve
the assessment of SAST findings. We investigate the ability of LLMs to reduce
FPs while trying to maintain a perfect true positive rate, using datasets
extracted from the OWASP Benchmark (v1.2) and a real-world software project.
Our results indicate that advanced prompting techniques, such as
Chain-of-Thought and Self-Consistency, substantially improve FP detection.
Notably, some LLMs identified approximately 62.5% of FPs in the OWASP Benchmark
dataset without missing genuine weaknesses. Combining detections from different
LLMs would increase this FP detection to approximately 78.9%. Additionally, we
demonstrate our approach's generalizability using a real-world dataset covering
five SAST tools, three programming languages, and infrastructure files. The
best LLM detected 33.85% of all FPs without missing genuine weaknesses, while
combining detections from different LLMs would increase this detection to
38.46%. Our findings highlight the potential of LLMs to complement traditional
SAST tools, enhancing automation and reducing resources spent addressing false
alarms.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Mixture of retrievers dynamically combines multiple retrievers for better performance without manual selection, outperforming individual and larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems rely on a single retriever, limiting generalization across diverse queries. Dynamic integration of multiple retrievers could improve effectiveness.

Method: Introduces a zero-shot, weighted combination of heterogeneous retrievers (e.g., BM25 and dense retrievers) to dynamically select and integrate them per query.

Result: The mixture outperforms individual retrievers (+10.8%) and larger 7B models (+3.9%), and improves collaboration with human sources by 58.9%.

Conclusion: Dynamic integration of multiple retrievers is effective and efficient, enhancing RAG performance without manual intervention.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) is powerful, but its effectiveness
hinges on which retrievers we use and how. Different retrievers offer distinct,
often complementary signals: BM25 captures lexical matches; dense retrievers,
semantic similarity. Yet in practice, we typically fix a single retriever based
on heuristics, which fails to generalize across diverse information needs. Can
we dynamically select and integrate multiple retrievers for each individual
query, without the need for manual selection? In our work, we validate this
intuition with quantitative analysis and introduce mixture of retrievers: a
zero-shot, weighted combination of heterogeneous retrievers. Extensive
experiments show that such mixtures are effective and efficient: Despite
totaling just 0.8B parameters, this mixture outperforms every individual
retriever and even larger 7B models by +10.8% and +3.9% on average,
respectively. Further analysis also shows that this mixture framework can help
incorporate specialized non-oracle human information sources as retrievers to
achieve good collaboration, with a 58.9% relative performance improvement over

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Revela is a self-supervised retriever learning framework that leverages language modeling to train dense retrievers, outperforming prior methods on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost of annotated query-document pairs in specialized domains motivates self-supervised retriever learning, inspired by language modeling.

Method: Revela models semantic dependencies among documents by conditioning next-token prediction on local and cross-document context using in-batch attention weighted by retriever similarity scores.

Result: Revela achieves absolute improvements of 5.2% and 5.6% on NDCG@10 benchmarks, with performance scaling with model size.

Conclusion: Revela demonstrates effectiveness and scalability for self-supervised retriever learning, promising for specialized domains.

Abstract: Dense retrievers play a vital role in accessing external and specialized
knowledge to augment language models (LMs). Training dense retrievers typically
requires annotated query-document pairs, which are costly and hard to obtain in
specialized domains such as code-motivating growing interest in self-supervised
retriever learning. Since LMs are trained to capture token-level dependencies
through a self-supervised learning objective (i.e., next-token prediction), we
can analogously cast retrieval as learning dependencies among chunks of tokens.
This analogy naturally leads to the question: How can we adapt self-supervised
learning objectives in the spirit of language modeling to train retrievers?
  To answer this question, we introduce Revela, a unified and scalable training
framework for self-supervised retriever learning via language modeling. Revela
models semantic dependencies among documents by conditioning next-token
prediction on both local and cross-document context through an in-batch
attention mechanism. This attention is weighted by retriever-computed
similarity scores, enabling the retriever to be optimized as part of language
modeling. We evaluate Revela on both general-domain (BEIR) and domain-specific
(CoIR) benchmarks across various retriever backbones. At a comparable parameter
scale, Revela outperforms the previous best method with absolute improvements
of 5.2 % (18.3 % relative) and 5.6 % (14.4 % relative) on NDCG@10,
respectively, underscoring its effectiveness. Performance increases with model
size, highlighting both the scalability of our approach and its promise for
self-supervised retriever learning.

*Yejing Wang,Shengyu Zhou,Jinyu Lu,Qidong Liu,Xinhang Li,Wenlin Zhang,Feng Li,Pengjie Wang,Jian Xu,Bo Zheng,Xiangyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces GFlowGR, a GFlowNets-based fine-tuning framework for generative recommendations, addressing exposure bias by leveraging collaborative knowledge and diverse generation properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fine-tuning methods in generative recommendations ignore exposure bias, limiting performance. The paper aims to mitigate this by exploring unobserved positive samples.

Method: Proposes GFlowGR, integrating collaborative knowledge for adaptive trajectory sampling and reward modeling, using GFlowNets' diverse generation and heuristic weighting.

Result: GFlowGR shows effectiveness and robustness on two real-world datasets with different generative recommendation backbones.

Conclusion: GFlowGR successfully mitigates exposure bias, offering a promising approach for fine-tuning in generative recommendations.

Abstract: Generative recommendations (GR), which usually include item tokenizers and
generative Large Language Models (LLMs), have demonstrated remarkable success
across a wide range of scenarios. The majority of existing research efforts
primarily concentrate on developing powerful item tokenizers or advancing LLM
decoding strategies to attain superior performance. However, the critical
fine-tuning step in GR frameworks, which is essential for adapting LLMs to
recommendation data, remains largely unexplored. Current approaches
predominantly rely on either the next-token prediction loss of supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) or recommendationspecific direct preference optimization
(DPO) strategies. Both methods ignore the exploration of possible positive
unobserved samples, which is commonly referred to as the exposure bias problem.
To mitigate this problem, this paper treats the GR as a multi-step generation
task and constructs a GFlowNets-based fine-tuning framework (GFlowGR). The
proposed framework integrates collaborative knowledge from traditional
recommender systems to create an adaptive trajectory sampler and a
comprehensive reward model. Leveraging the diverse generation property of
GFlowNets, along with sampling and heuristic weighting techniques, GFlowGR
emerges as a promising approach to mitigate the exposure bias problem.
Extensive empirical results on two real-world datasets and with two different
GR backbones highlight the effectiveness and robustness of GFlowGR.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: SimCIT introduces a contrastive learning-based quantization method for generative retrieval, addressing redundancy and scale issues in large-scale recommendation systems by integrating multi-modal knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative retrieval methods struggle with token space redundancy and scale, while reconstructive quantization conflicts with retrieval goals. Multi-modal side information is underutilized.

Method: SimCIT uses a learnable residual quantization module aligned with multi-modal signals, combining knowledge alignment and semantic tokenization via contrastive learning.

Result: Experiments on public and industrial datasets show SimCIT's effectiveness in LLM-based generative recommendation.

Conclusion: SimCIT successfully integrates multi-modal knowledge and improves generative retrieval, offering a scalable solution for large-scale recommendations.

Abstract: Generative retrieval-based recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm
aiming at directly generating the identifiers of the target candidates.
However, in large-scale recommendation systems, this approach becomes
increasingly cumbersome due to the redundancy and sheer scale of the token
space. To overcome these limitations, recent research has explored the use of
semantic tokens as an alternative to ID tokens, which typically leveraged
reconstruction-based strategies, like RQ-VAE, to quantize content embeddings
and significantly reduce the embedding size. However, reconstructive
quantization aims for the precise reconstruction of each item embedding
independently, which conflicts with the goal of generative retrieval tasks
focusing more on differentiating among items. Moreover, multi-modal side
information of items, such as descriptive text and images, geographical
knowledge in location-based recommendation services, has been shown to be
effective in improving recommendations by providing richer contexts for
interactions. Nevertheless, effectively integrating such complementary
knowledge into existing generative recommendation frameworks remains
challenging. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel unsupervised deep
quantization exclusively based on contrastive learning, named SimCIT (a Simple
Contrastive Item Tokenization framework). Specifically, different from existing
reconstruction-based strategies, SimCIT propose to use a learnable residual
quantization module to align with the signals from different modalities of the
items, which combines multi-modal knowledge alignment and semantic tokenization
in a mutually beneficial contrastive learning framework. Extensive experiments
across public datasets and a large-scale industrial dataset from various
domains demonstrate SimCIT's effectiveness in LLM-based generative
recommendation.

*Md Sakibur Sajal,Hunter Guthrie,Marc Dandin*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: A 64x64 array of pgSPADs in 0.35μm CMOS is used for entropy generation, achieving <1% BV and passing NIST tests after Von Neumann debiasing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address bias variation (BV) in entropy source arrays by developing a hardware-friendly solution with wide BV tolerance.

Method: Utilize a 64x64 pgSPAD array with gate voltage adjustments based on dark count rates, followed by Von Neumann debiasing.

Result: Achieved <1% BV at 2 kHz/pixel, with debiased bits passing all 16 NIST tests.

Conclusion: The pgSPAD array with BV compensation is effective for high-quality random number generation.

Abstract: Random number generators that utilize arrays of entropy source elements
suffer from bias variation (BV). Despite the availability of efficient
debiasing algorithms, optimized implementations of hardware friendly options
depend on the bit bias in the raw bit streams and cannot accommodate a wide BV.
In this work, we present a 64 x 64 array of perimeter gated single photon
avalanche diodes (pgSPADs), fabricated in a 0.35 {\mu}m standard CMOS
technology, as a source of entropy to generate random binary strings with a BV
compensation technique. By applying proper gate voltages based on the devices'
native dark count rates, we demonstrate less than 1% BV for a raw-bit
generation rate of 2 kHz/pixel at room temperature. The raw bits were debiased
using the classical iterative Von Neumann's algorithm and the debiased bits
were found to pass all of the 16 tests from NIST's Statistical Test Suite.

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: A neural network with attention improves radionuclide detection by 2x over traditional methods using arrival time data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance detection limits for radionuclides by leveraging temporal and spectral data.

Method: Uses a neural network with attention, focusing on arrival times and spectral features to adapt detection thresholds.

Result: Demonstrated a 2x improvement in detection sensitivity for Cesium releases.

Conclusion: The method is broadly applicable, scalable to complex decay chains, and can integrate additional detection event data.

Abstract: We present a method to improve the detection limit for radionuclides using
spectroscopic radiation detectors and the arrival time of each detected
radiation quantum. We enable this method using a neural network with an
attention mechanism. We illustrate the method on the detection of Cesium
release from a nuclear facility during an upset, and our method shows $2\times$
improvement over the traditional spectroscopic method. We hypothesize that our
method achieves this performance increase by modulating its detection
probability by the overall rate of probable detections, specifically by
adapting detection thresholds based on temporal event distributions and local
spectral features, and show evidence to this effect. We believe this method is
applicable broadly and may be more successful for radionuclides with more
complicated decay chains than Cesium; we also note that our method can
generalize beyond the addition of arrival time and could integrate other data
about each detection event, such as pulse quality, location in detector, or
even combining the energy and time from detections in different detectors.

*Peizhi Wu,Rong Kang,Tieying Zhang,Jianjun Chen,Ryan Marcus,Zachary G. Ives*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: GRASP is a data-agnostic cardinality estimation system that outperforms existing query-driven models on imperfect workloads, achieving accuracy and latency comparable to traditional methods without data access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Organizational policies often restrict global data access, and existing query-driven models rely on unrealistic assumptions about training workloads.

Method: GRASP uses a compositional design, a per-table CardEst model for range predicates, and a learned count sketch model for join correlations.

Result: GRASP outperforms existing models on imperfect workloads and matches traditional methods on the CEB-IMDb-full benchmark with only 10% of join templates.

Conclusion: GRASP is robust to real-world constraints, offering a scalable and accurate solution for cardinality estimation without data access.

Abstract: Cardinality estimation (CardEst) is a critical aspect of query optimization.
Traditionally, it leverages statistics built directly over the data. However,
organizational policies (e.g., regulatory compliance) may restrict global data
access. Fortunately, query-driven cardinality estimation can learn CardEst
models using query workloads. However, existing query-driven models often
require access to data or summaries for best performance, and they assume
perfect training workloads with complete and balanced join templates (or join
graphs). Such assumptions rarely hold in real-world scenarios, in which join
templates are incomplete and imbalanced. We present GRASP, a data-agnostic
cardinality learning system designed to work under these real-world
constraints. GRASP's compositional design generalizes to unseen join templates
and is robust to join template imbalance. It also introduces a new per-table
CardEst model that handles value distribution shifts for range predicates, and
a novel learned count sketch model that captures join correlations across base
relations. Across three database instances, we demonstrate that GRASP
consistently outperforms existing query-driven models on imperfect workloads,
both in terms of estimation accuracy and query latency. Remarkably, GRASP
achieves performance comparable to, or even surpassing, traditional approaches
built over the underlying data on the complex CEB-IMDb-full benchmark --
despite operating without any data access and using only 10% of all possible
join templates.

*Wenlong Ji,Yihan Pan,Ruihao Zhu,Lihua Lei*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper introduces MLA-UCB, a bandit algorithm leveraging pre-trained ML models to use surrogate rewards from auxiliary data, improving regret even with biased predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional bandit algorithms rely on scarce online data, but auxiliary data (e.g., historical user covariates) is often available. This work aims to exploit such data despite potential biases in surrogate rewards.

Method: Proposes MLA-UCB, which integrates surrogate rewards from ML models into the UCB framework, handling bias without needing prior knowledge of reward covariance.

Result: MLA-UCB provably improves cumulative regret under joint Gaussian rewards, even with misaligned mean surrogate rewards, and shows efficiency gains in numerical studies.

Conclusion: MLA-UCB effectively utilizes auxiliary data and surrogate rewards, offering a practical solution for bandit problems with biased offline predictions.

Abstract: Multi-armed bandit (MAB) is a widely adopted framework for sequential
decision-making under uncertainty. Traditional bandit algorithms rely solely on
online data, which tends to be scarce as it must be gathered during the online
phase when the arms are actively pulled. However, in many practical settings,
rich auxiliary data, such as covariates of past users, is available prior to
deploying any arms. We introduce a new setting for MAB where pre-trained
machine learning (ML) models are applied to convert side information and
historical data into \emph{surrogate rewards}. A prominent feature of this
setting is that the surrogate rewards may exhibit substantial bias, as true
reward data is typically unavailable in the offline phase, forcing ML
predictions to heavily rely on extrapolation. To address the issue, we propose
the Machine Learning-Assisted Upper Confidence Bound (MLA-UCB) algorithm, which
can be applied to any reward prediction model and any form of auxiliary data.
When the predicted and true rewards are jointly Gaussian, it provably improves
the cumulative regret, provided that the correlation is non-zero -- even in
cases where the mean surrogate reward completely misaligns with the true mean
rewards. Notably, our method requires no prior knowledge of the covariance
matrix between true and surrogate rewards. We compare MLA-UCB with the standard
UCB on a range of numerical studies and show a sizable efficiency gain even
when the size of the offline data and the correlation between predicted and
true rewards are moderate.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper explores self-supervised learning (SSL) features and quantized representations for dysarthric-to-regular speech conversion, proposing a non-autoregressive method using Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) with Diffusion Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dysarthria severely impairs speech intelligibility, requiring effective conversion techniques to aid communication.

Method: Uses SSL features (WavLM) and proposes a non-autoregressive approach with CFM and Diffusion Transformers for direct mapping from dysarthric to clean speech.

Result: Discrete acoustic units improve intelligibility and enable faster convergence than mel-spectrogram methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective for dysarthric speech conversion, offering better intelligibility and efficiency.

Abstract: Dysarthria is a neurological disorder that significantly impairs speech
intelligibility, often rendering affected individuals unable to communicate
effectively. This necessitates the development of robust dysarthric-to-regular
speech conversion techniques. In this work, we investigate the utility and
limitations of self-supervised learning (SSL) features and their quantized
representations as an alternative to mel-spectrograms for speech generation.
Additionally, we explore methods to mitigate speaker variability by generating
clean speech in a single-speaker voice using features extracted from WavLM. To
this end, we propose a fully non-autoregressive approach that leverages
Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) with Diffusion Transformers to learn a direct
mapping from dysarthric to clean speech. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of discrete acoustic units in improving intelligibility while
achieving faster convergence compared to traditional mel-spectrogram-based
approaches.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates five audio foundation models across diverse musical traditions, revealing varying cross-cultural generalization. Larger models perform better on non-Western music, though results decline for culturally distant traditions. The study achieves state-of-the-art performance on most datasets and suggests foundation models already encode significant musical knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the generalization capabilities of foundation models across diverse musical traditions and understand their limitations in cross-cultural contexts.

Method: Three methodologies: probing inherent representations, targeted supervised fine-tuning of 1-2 layers, and multi-label few-shot learning for low-resource scenarios.

Result: Larger models generally outperform on non-Western music, but performance declines for culturally distant traditions. State-of-the-art results are achieved on five out of six datasets. Targeted fine-tuning does not consistently outperform probing.

Conclusion: Foundation models show promise for world music understanding but still face challenges with culturally distant traditions. The study provides a framework for evaluating future progress toward universal music representations.

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized music information retrieval, but
questions remain about their ability to generalize across diverse musical
traditions. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of five
state-of-the-art audio foundation models across six musical corpora spanning
Western popular, Greek, Turkish, and Indian classical traditions. We employ
three complementary methodologies to investigate these models' cross-cultural
capabilities: probing to assess inherent representations, targeted supervised
fine-tuning of 1-2 layers, and multi-label few-shot learning for low-resource
scenarios. Our analysis shows varying cross-cultural generalization, with
larger models typically outperforming on non-Western music, though results
decline for culturally distant traditions. Notably, our approaches achieve
state-of-the-art performance on five out of six evaluated datasets,
demonstrating the effectiveness of foundation models for world music
understanding. We also find that our targeted fine-tuning approach does not
consistently outperform probing across all settings, suggesting foundation
models already encode substantial musical knowledge. Our evaluation framework
and benchmarking results contribute to understanding how far current models are
from achieving universal music representations while establishing metrics for
future progress.

*Jiangnan Zhao,Hanbo Xu,Cifu Xu,Wenlong Yin,Laixin Luo,Gang Liu,Yan Wang*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: A portable RPA-CRISPR system with smartphone integration enables rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of potato late blight, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional plant disease detection methods (e.g., PCR, LAMP) are impractical for field use due to equipment and complexity. A portable, efficient solution is needed.

Method: Developed a system combining RPA-CRISPR-Cas12a isothermal assay with a PVA microneedle patch for sample extraction and smartphone-based fluorescent image analysis.

Result: Achieved 56 ug/mg DNA extraction efficiency (3x traditional methods), 2 pg/uL detection limit, and 80-100% early-stage detection before symptoms appear.

Conclusion: The system offers a practical, sensitive, and early-stage solution for field diagnosis of potato late blight, reducing reliance on lab equipment.

Abstract: Potato late blight, caused by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans,
is one of the most devastating diseases affecting potato crops in the history.
Although conventional detection methods of plant diseases such as PCR and LAMP
are highly sensitive and specific, they rely on bulky and expensive laboratory
equipment and involve complex operations, making them impracticable for
point-of care diagnosis in the field. Here in this study, we report a portable
RPA-CRISPR based diagnosis system for plant disease, integrating smartphone for
acquisition and analysis of fluorescent images. A polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)
microneedle patch was employed for sample extraction on the plant leaves within
one minute, the DNA extraction efficiency achieved 56 ug/mg, which is
approximately 3 times to the traditional CTAB methods (18 ug/mg). The system of
RPA-CRISPR-Cas12a isothermal assay was established to specifically target P.
infestans with no cross-reactivity observed against closely-related species (P.
sojae, P. capsici). The system demonstrated a detection limit of 2 pg/uL for P.
infestans genomic DNA, offering sensitivity comparable to that of benchtop
laboratory equipment. The system demonstrates the early-stage diagnosis
capability by achieving a approximately 80% and 100% detection rate on the
third and fourth day post-inoculation respectively, before visible symptoms
observed on the leaves. The smartphone-based "sample-to-result" system
decouples the limitations of traditional methods that rely heavily on
specialized equipment, offering a promising way for early-stage plant disease
detection and control in the field.

TL;DR: A framework for achieving fairness in multi-agent systems using adaptive contracts, balancing equity and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing hidden heterogeneity in agents' abilities that leads to unfair wealth distribution, inspired by real-world examples.

Method: Repeated principal-agent games with adaptive contracts, focusing on homogeneous linear contracts.

Result: Fairness-aware principals can equalize outcomes without sacrificing system efficiency.

Conclusion: Fairness and efficiency can coexist in multi-agent systems through adaptive contract design.

Abstract: Fairness is desirable yet challenging to achieve within multi-agent systems,
especially when agents differ in latent traits that affect their abilities.
This hidden heterogeneity often leads to unequal distributions of wealth, even
when agents operate under the same rules. Motivated by real-world examples, we
propose a framework based on repeated principal-agent games, where a principal,
who also can be seen as a player of the game, learns to offer adaptive
contracts to agents. By leveraging a simple yet powerful contract structure, we
show that a fairness-aware principal can learn homogeneous linear contracts
that equalize outcomes across agents in a sequential social dilemma.
Importantly, this fairness does not come at the cost of efficiency: our results
demonstrate that it is possible to promote equity and stability in the system
while preserving overall performance.

TL;DR: First provable guarantees for global convergence to Nash equilibria in two-player zero-sum convex Markov games using independent policy gradient methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in convex Markov games, such as nonconvexity and lack of Bellman consistency, to model strategic interactions.

Method: Two-step approach: transforming the min-max problem into a nonconvex-proximal Polyak-Lojasiewicz objective via regularization, then solving constrained min-max problems under NC-pPL conditions.

Result: Global convergence guarantees for stochastic nested and alternating gradient descent-ascent methods.

Conclusion: The method stabilizes policy gradient iterates and ensures convergence to equilibria, with potential broader applications.

Abstract: We contribute the first provable guarantees of global convergence to Nash
equilibria (NE) in two-player zero-sum convex Markov games (cMGs) by using
independent policy gradient methods. Convex Markov games, recently defined by
Gemp et al. (2024), extend Markov decision processes to multi-agent settings
with preferences that are convex over occupancy measures, offering a broad
framework for modeling generic strategic interactions. However, even the
fundamental min-max case of cMGs presents significant challenges, including
inherent nonconvexity, the absence of Bellman consistency, and the complexity
of the infinite horizon.
  We follow a two-step approach. First, leveraging properties of
hidden-convex--hidden-concave functions, we show that a simple nonconvex
regularization transforms the min-max optimization problem into a
nonconvex-proximal Polyak-Lojasiewicz (NC-pPL) objective. Crucially, this
regularization can stabilize the iterates of independent policy gradient
methods and ultimately lead them to converge to equilibria. Second, building on
this reduction, we address the general constrained min-max problems under
NC-pPL and two-sided pPL conditions, providing the first global convergence
guarantees for stochastic nested and alternating gradient descent-ascent
methods, which we believe may be of independent interest.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contactless manipulation of small objects is crucial for biomedical and chemical applications, but trapping multiple particles in fluid remains challenging.

Method: The system uses rotating disks to generate flow fields, with disk rotations controlled by a feedback policy based on the ODIL framework, combining fluid dynamics and path objectives.

Result: Experiments in simulations and with a physical device show the system can transport two beads simultaneously to predefined locations.

Conclusion: The approach enhances robust contactless particle manipulation, benefiting biomedical applications.

Abstract: Contactless manipulation of small objects is essential for biomedical and
chemical applications, such as cell analysis, assisted fertilisation, and
precision chemistry. Established methods, including optical, acoustic, and
magnetic tweezers, are now complemented by flow control techniques that use
flow-induced motion to enable precise and versatile manipulation. However,
trapping multiple particles in fluid remains a challenge. This study introduces
a novel control algorithm capable of steering multiple particles in flow. The
system uses rotating disks to generate flow fields that transport particles to
precise locations. Disk rotations are governed by a feedback control policy
based on the Optimising a Discrete Loss (ODIL) framework, which combines fluid
dynamics equations with path objectives into a single loss function. Our
experiments, conducted in both simulations and with the physical device,
demonstrate the capability of the approach to transport two beads
simultaneously to predefined locations, advancing robust contactless particle

TL;DR: The study compares emotionally supportive conversations between robots and humans with traditional therapy sessions, finding strong thematic and semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if robot-led support conversations resemble human therapy sessions and if robot responses mirror those of human therapists.

Method: Analyzed datasets of human therapy sessions and robot interactions using sentence embeddings, K-means clustering, and distance-based methods to assess thematic and semantic alignment.

Result: 90.88% of robot disclosures mapped to human therapy clusters, showing strong thematic and semantic overlap in subjects and responses.

Conclusion: Robot-led support conversations share parallels with human therapy, suggesting potential for augmenting mental health interventions.

Abstract: As conversational agents increasingly engage in emotionally supportive
dialogue, it is important to understand how closely their interactions resemble
those in traditional therapy settings. This study investigates whether the
concerns shared with a robot align with those shared in human-to-human (H2H)
therapy sessions, and whether robot responses semantically mirror those of
human therapists. We analyzed two datasets: one of interactions between users
and professional therapists (Hugging Face's NLP Mental Health Conversations),
and another involving supportive conversations with a social robot (QTrobot
from LuxAI) powered by a large language model (LLM, GPT-3.5). Using sentence
embeddings and K-means clustering, we assessed cross-agent thematic alignment
by applying a distance-based cluster-fitting method that evaluates whether
responses from one agent type map to clusters derived from the other, and
validated it using Euclidean distances. Results showed that 90.88% of robot
conversation disclosures could be mapped to clusters from the human therapy
dataset, suggesting shared topical structure. For matched clusters, we compared
the subjects as well as therapist and robot responses using Transformer,
Word2Vec, and BERT embeddings, revealing strong semantic overlap in subjects'
disclosures in both datasets, as well as in the responses given to similar
human disclosure themes across agent types (robot vs. human therapist). These
findings highlight both the parallels and boundaries of robot-led support
conversations and their potential for augmenting mental health interventions.

  However, the journey is not as straightforward as it was for Computer Vision
(CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Applying AI to real-world EEG-based
BCIs, particularly in building powerful foundational models, presents unique
and intricate hurdles that could affect their reliability.
  Here, we unfold a guided exploration of this dynamic and rapidly evolving
research area. Rather than barely outlining a map of current endeavors and
results, the goal is to provide a principled navigation of this hot and
cutting-edge research landscape. We consider the basic paradigms that emerge
from a causal perspective and the attendant challenges presented to AI-based
models. Looking ahead, we then discuss promising research avenues that could
overcome today's technological, methodological, and ethical limitations. Our
aim is to lay out a clear roadmap for creating truly practical and effective
EEG-based BCI solutions that can thrive in everyday environments.

### [481] [CP$^2$: Leveraging Geometry for Conformal Prediction via Canonicalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16189)
*Putri A. van der Linden,Alexander Timans,Erik J. Bekkers*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes integrating geometric information into conformal prediction to address robustness under geometric data shifts, leveraging pose canonicalization for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conformal prediction (CP) provides uncertainty quantification but fails under geometric data shifts, necessitating a solution to maintain its guarantees.

Method: The approach combines geometric information (e.g., pose) with CP, using pose canonicalization to extract relevant features.

Result: The method outperforms equivariant and augmentation-based baselines, maintaining robustness across discrete and continuous geometric shifts.

Conclusion: Integrating geometric information with CP offers a principled solution for handling geometric shifts while preserving broad applicability to black-box predictors.

Abstract: We study the problem of conformal prediction (CP) under geometric data
shifts, where data samples are susceptible to transformations such as rotations
or flips. While CP endows prediction models with post-hoc uncertainty
quantification and formal coverage guarantees, their practicality breaks under
distribution shifts that deteriorate model performance. To address this issue,
we propose integrating geometric information--such as geometric pose--into the
conformal procedure to reinstate its guarantees and ensure robustness under
geometric shifts. In particular, we explore recent advancements on pose
canonicalization as a suitable information extractor for this purpose.
Evaluating the combined approach across discrete and continuous shifts and
against equivariant and augmentation-based baselines, we find that integrating
geometric information with CP yields a principled way to address geometric
shifts while maintaining broad applicability to black-box predictors.

### [482] [Latent Noise Injection for Private and Statistically Aligned Synthetic Data Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16636)
*Rex Shen,Lu Tian*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes Latent Noise Injection with Masked Autoregressive Flows (MAF) to improve synthetic data generation, addressing slow convergence in high-dimensional settings and ensuring privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard generative models like Normalizing Flows struggle with slow convergence in high dimensions and privacy concerns. The goal is to enhance efficiency and privacy in synthetic data generation.

Method: The method injects noise in the latent space of MAF, perturbing data points before mapping them back to the data domain, preserving a one-to-one correspondence between real and synthetic data.

Result: The approach achieves strong statistical alignment with original data, robustness against attacks, and restores efficiency via meta-analysis across multiple synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: Latent Noise Injection is a promising alternative for privacy-sensitive domains like biomedical research, balancing privacy and utility effectively.

Abstract: Synthetic Data Generation has become essential for scalable,
privacy-preserving statistical analysis. While standard approaches based on
generative models, such as Normalizing Flows, have been widely used, they often
suffer from slow convergence in high-dimensional settings, frequently
converging more slowly than the canonical $1/\sqrt{n}$ rate when approximating
the true data distribution.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose a Latent Noise Injection method
using Masked Autoregressive Flows (MAF). Instead of directly sampling from the
trained model, our method perturbs each data point in the latent space and maps
it back to the data domain. This construction preserves a one to one
correspondence between observed and synthetic data, enabling synthetic outputs
that closely reflect the underlying distribution, particularly in challenging
high-dimensional regimes where traditional sampling struggles.
  Our procedure satisfies local $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy and
introduces a single perturbation parameter to control the privacy-utility
trade-off. Although estimators based on individual synthetic datasets may
converge slowly, we show both theoretically and empirically that aggregating
across $K$ studies in a meta analysis framework restores classical efficiency
and yields consistent, reliable inference. We demonstrate that with a
well-calibrated perturbation parameter, Latent Noise Injection achieves strong
statistical alignment with the original data and robustness against membership
inference attacks. These results position our method as a compelling
alternative to conventional flow-based sampling for synthetic data sharing in
decentralized and privacy-sensitive domains, such as biomedical research.

TL;DR: An algorithm for sampling stochastic differential equations under general constraints, demonstrated in various applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of sampling stochastic paths under diverse constraints like integral, endpoint, and stochastic integral constraints.

Method: A pathspace Metropolis-adjusted manifold sampling scheme, sampling paths on a submanifold adhering to constraints.

Result: Effective sampling demonstrated in dynamical condensation, random walks, stochastic nonlinear waves, and turbulent pipe flow.

Conclusion: The algorithm successfully samples constrained stochastic paths, proving versatile in multiple scenarios.

Abstract: We present an algorithm to sample stochastic differential equations
conditioned on rather general constraints, including integral constraints,
endpoint constraints, and stochastic integral constraints. The algorithm is a
pathspace Metropolis-adjusted manifold sampling scheme, which samples
stochastic paths on the submanifold of realizations that adhere to the
conditioning constraint. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm by
sampling a dynamical condensation phase transition, conditioning a random walk
on a fixed Levy stochastic area, conditioning a stochastic nonlinear wave
equation on high amplitude waves, and sampling a stochastic partial
differential equation model of turbulent pipe flow conditioned on
relaminarization events.

### [484] [From Local Interactions to Global Operators: Scalable Gaussian Process Operator for Physical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15906)
*Sawan Kumar,Tapas Tripura,Rajdip Nayek,Souvik Chakraborty*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A scalable Gaussian Processes Operator (GPO) is introduced, leveraging sparsity, locality, and structured kernel design to address computational complexity and enable large-scale, high-dimensional PDE solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the scalability challenges of probabilistic neural operators like GPOs in high-dimensional, data-intensive regimes while maintaining accuracy.

Method: Uses nearest-neighbor-based local kernel approximations, sparse kernel approximation in parameter space, and structured Kronecker factorizations. Incorporates operator-aware kernel structures and neural operator-derived mean functions.

Result: Achieves high accuracy across various nonlinear PDEs (Navier-Stokes, wave advection, Darcy flow, Burgers' equations) at different discretization scales.

Conclusion: The framework successfully balances scalability and fidelity in GPO, providing a robust foundation for uncertainty-aware modeling in complex physical systems.

Abstract: Operator learning offers a powerful paradigm for solving parametric partial
differential equations (PDEs), but scaling probabilistic neural operators such
as the recently proposed Gaussian Processes Operators (GPOs) to
high-dimensional, data-intensive regimes remains a significant challenge. In
this work, we introduce a novel, scalable GPO, which capitalizes on sparsity,
locality, and structural information through judicious kernel design.
Addressing the fundamental limitation of cubic computational complexity, our
method leverages nearest-neighbor-based local kernel approximations in the
spatial domain, sparse kernel approximation in the parameter space, and
structured Kronecker factorizations to enable tractable inference on
large-scale datasets and high-dimensional input. While local approximations
often introduce accuracy trade-offs due to limited kernel interactions, we
overcome this by embedding operator-aware kernel structures and employing
expressive, task-informed mean functions derived from neural operator
architectures. Through extensive evaluations on a broad class of nonlinear PDEs
- including Navier-Stokes, wave advection, Darcy flow, and Burgers' equations -
we demonstrate that our framework consistently achieves high accuracy across
varying discretization scales. These results underscore the potential of our
approach to bridge the gap between scalability and fidelity in GPO, offering a
compelling foundation for uncertainty-aware modeling in complex physical
systems.

*Sean Moushegian,Taposh Banerjee,Vahid Tarokh*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper extends score-based hypothesis testing and change-point detection to diffusion-based methods, optimizing performance with a weight matrix and demonstrating advantages through simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Score-based methods are less powerful than likelihood-based ones; the paper aims to enhance them by generalizing the score-based Fisher divergence into a diffusion-divergence.

Method: Extends score-based tests to diffusion-based analogs, optimizes weight matrices numerically, and evaluates performance theoretically and via simulations.

Result: Theoretical quantification of diffusion-based algorithms' performance and numerical evidence of their advantages over score-based methods.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based algorithms outperform score-based methods in certain scenarios, with optimized weight matrices further enhancing their effectiveness.

Abstract: Score-based methods have recently seen increasing popularity in modeling and
generation. Methods have been constructed to perform hypothesis testing and
change-point detection with score functions, but these methods are in general
not as powerful as their likelihood-based peers. Recent works consider
generalizing the score-based Fisher divergence into a diffusion-divergence by
transforming score functions via multiplication with a matrix-valued function
or a weight matrix. In this paper, we extend the score-based hypothesis test
and change-point detection stopping rule into their diffusion-based analogs.
Additionally, we theoretically quantify the performance of these
diffusion-based algorithms and study scenarios where optimal performance is
achievable. We propose a method of numerically optimizing the weight matrix and
present numerical simulations to illustrate the advantages of diffusion-based
algorithms.

TL;DR: The paper extends the analysis of random feature methods' generalization properties to a broad class of spectral regularization techniques, including implicit schemes like gradient descent, and applies this to neural networks via the NTK approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To theoretically analyze the generalization properties of random feature methods beyond Tikhonov regularization, including implicit and accelerated algorithms, and apply this to neural networks.

Method: Extends previous results to spectral regularization techniques, including gradient descent and accelerated methods, and applies the NTK framework to neural networks.

Result: Optimal learning rates are achieved over regularity classes, even those not in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space, improving or completing prior results.

Conclusion: The framework enables a unified theoretical analysis of random feature methods and neural networks, providing optimal learning rates and broader applicability.

Abstract: Random feature approximation is arguably one of the most widely used
techniques for kernel methods in large-scale learning algorithms. In this work,
we analyze the generalization properties of random feature methods, extending
previous results for Tikhonov regularization to a broad class of spectral
regularization techniques. This includes not only explicit methods but also
implicit schemes such as gradient descent and accelerated algorithms like the
Heavy-Ball and Nesterov method. Through this framework, we enable a theoretical
analysis of neural networks and neural operators through the lens of the Neural
Tangent Kernel (NTK) approach trained via gradient descent. For our estimators
we obtain optimal learning rates over regularity classes (even for classes that
are not included in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space), which are defined
through appropriate source conditions. This improves or completes previous
results obtained in related settings for specific kernel algorithms.

### [487] [The Condition Number as a Scale-Invariant Proxy for Information Encoding in Neural Units](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16289)
*Oswaldo Ludwig*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper links a neural network's weight tensor condition number to information encoding efficiency, showing high condition numbers indicate selective amplification and compression. It applies this to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in multimodal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the condition number of a neural network's weight tensor relates to information encoding and use this insight to address catastrophic forgetting in cross-modal adaptation.

Method: Formalizes the relationship between condition number and information transfer for linear units with Gaussian inputs, and applies it to selective fine-tuning of a multimodal Large Language Model.

Result: High condition numbers correspond to reduced overall information transfer, indicating specialized encoding. Selective fine-tuning mitigates catastrophic forgetting without pre-training statistics.

Conclusion: The condition number is a useful indicator of information encoding efficiency, and selective fine-tuning based on this principle can effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: This paper explores the relationship between the condition number of a neural
network's weight tensor and the extent of information encoded by the associated
processing unit, viewed through the lens of information theory. We argue that a
high condition number, though not sufficient for effective knowledge encoding,
may indicate that the unit has learned to selectively amplify and compress
information. We formalize this intuition, particularly for linear units with
Gaussian inputs, linking the condition number and the transformation's
log-volume scaling factor to the characteristics of the output entropy and the
geometric properties of the learned transformation. Our analysis demonstrates
that for a fixed weight norm, a concentrated distribution of singular values
(high condition number) corresponds to reduced overall information transfer,
indicating a specialized and efficient encoding strategy. Furthermore, we
present a practical case study where these principles are applied to guide
selective fine-tuning of a multimodal Large Language Model, aiming to mitigate
catastrophic forgetting during cross-modal adaptation. Unlike many existing
catastrophic forgetting mitigation methods that rely on access to pre-training
statistics, which are often unavailable, our selective fine-tuning approach
offers a way to bypass this common requirement.

### [488] [Identifying Heterogeneity in Distributed Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16394)
*Zelin Xiao,Jia Gu,Song Xi Chen*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes two methods for identifying heterogeneous parameter components in distributed M-estimation with minimal data transmission: a re-normalized Wald test for dense heterogeneity and an extreme contrast test (ECT) for sparse heterogeneity. A combination of both tests is suggested for robustness. Numerical experiments and a case study validate the methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of identifying heterogeneous parameter components in distributed M-estimation efficiently, with minimal data transmission.

Method: 1. Re-normalized Wald test for dense heterogeneity (works when the number of data blocks is smaller than the minimum block sample size). 2. Extreme contrast test (ECT) for sparse heterogeneity (avoids bias accumulation via sample splitting and works for larger data blocks). A combination of both tests is also proposed.

Result: The Wald test is consistent for dense heterogeneity, while the ECT is consistent for sparse heterogeneity and larger data blocks. The combined method offers robust power under varying sparsity levels. Numerical experiments confirm the methods' effectiveness in controlling FWER and power.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively identify heterogeneous parameters in distributed M-estimation, with the ECT being communication-efficient and easy to operate. The combination of Wald and ECT tests enhances robustness.

Abstract: We study methods for identifying heterogeneous parameter components in
distributed M-estimation with minimal data transmission. One is based on a
re-normalized Wald test, which is shown to be consistent as long as the number
of distributed data blocks $K$ is of a smaller order of the minimum block
sample size {and the level of heterogeneity is dense}. The second one is an
extreme contrast test (ECT) based on the difference between the largest and
smallest component-wise estimated parameters among data blocks. By introducing
a sample splitting procedure, the ECT can avoid the bias accumulation arising
from the M-estimation procedures, and exhibits consistency for $K$ being much
larger than the sample size while the heterogeneity is sparse. The ECT
procedure is easy to operate and communication-efficient. A combination of the
Wald and the extreme contrast tests is formulated to attain more robust power
under varying levels of sparsity of the heterogeneity. We also conduct
intensive numerical experiments to compare the family-wise error rate (FWER)
and the power of the proposed methods. Additionally, we conduct a case study to
present the implementation and validity of the proposed methods.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A framework for real-time risk monitoring in dynamic ML deployments, using sequential hypothesis testing to detect risk violations with controlled false alarms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of maintaining statistical safety assurances under unpredictable distribution shifts in ML systems.

Method: Proposes a sequential hypothesis testing procedure based on 'testing by betting' to monitor bounded risks in evolving data streams.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness in outlier detection and set prediction under various shifts.

Conclusion: The framework is broadly applicable with minimal assumptions, ensuring reliable risk monitoring in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Machine learning systems deployed in the real world must operate under
dynamic and often unpredictable distribution shifts. This challenges the
validity of statistical safety assurances on the system's risk established
beforehand. Common risk control frameworks rely on fixed assumptions and lack
mechanisms to continuously monitor deployment reliability. In this work, we
propose a general framework for the real-time monitoring of risk violations in
evolving data streams. Leveraging the 'testing by betting' paradigm, we propose
a sequential hypothesis testing procedure to detect violations of bounded risks
associated with the model's decision-making mechanism, while ensuring control
on the false alarm rate. Our method operates under minimal assumptions on the
nature of encountered shifts, rendering it broadly applicable. We illustrate
the effectiveness of our approach by monitoring risks in outlier detection and
set prediction under a variety of shifts.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper extends the Iterative Markovian Fitting (IMF) procedure to solve the tree-structured Schrödinger Bridge (SB) problem, offering advantages over traditional methods like Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize optimal transport to multi-marginal cases, particularly tree-structured costs, and improve upon existing methods like IPF.

Method: Extends the IMF procedure to solve the tree-structured SB problem, leveraging its advantages over IPF.

Result: A new algorithm for tree-structured SB problems, applicable to Wasserstein barycentres, combining flow-based entropic OT solvers with fixed-point approaches.

Conclusion: The extended IMF procedure provides a practical and efficient solution for tree-structured SB problems, outperforming traditional methods like IPF.

Abstract: Recent advances in flow-based generative modelling have provided scalable
methods for computing the Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) between distributions, a
dynamic form of entropy-regularised Optimal Transport (OT) for the quadratic
cost. The successful Iterative Markovian Fitting (IMF) procedure solves the SB
problem via sequential bridge-matching steps, presenting an elegant and
practical approach with many favourable properties over the more traditional
Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) procedure. Beyond the standard setting,
optimal transport can be generalised to the multi-marginal case in which the
objective is to minimise a cost defined over several marginal distributions. Of
particular importance are costs defined over a tree structure, from which
Wasserstein barycentres can be recovered as a special case. In this work, we
extend the IMF procedure to solve for the tree-structured SB problem. Our
resulting algorithm inherits the many advantages of IMF over IPF approaches in
the tree-based setting. In the specific case of Wasserstein barycentres, our
approach can be viewed as extending fixed-point approaches for barycentre
computation to the case of flow-based entropic OT solvers.

### [491] [From Prompts to Constructs: A Dual-Validity Framework for LLM Research in Psychology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16697)
*Zhicheng Lin*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper discusses the challenges of applying human measurement tools to large language models (LLMs) in psychology, warning of potential measurement phantoms. It proposes a dual-validity framework to integrate reliable measurement and causal inference for robust AI psychology research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid adoption of LLMs in psychology raises concerns about contradictory results and measurement artifacts, necessitating a framework to ensure valid claims.

Method: The authors propose a dual-validity framework that scales evidence requirements based on the scientific ambition of claims, distinguishing between basic accuracy checks and rigorous validation for simulating psychological phenomena.

Result: Current practices often fail to meet these requirements, treating statistical patterns as psychological evidence without proper validation.

Conclusion: The paper calls for developing computational analogues of psychological constructs and clear standards of evidence to avoid uncritical use of human measurement tools in AI psychology.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted across psychology,
serving as research tools, experimental subjects, human simulators, and
computational models of cognition. However, the application of human
measurement tools to these systems can produce contradictory results, raising
concerns that many findings are measurement phantoms--statistical artifacts
rather than genuine psychological phenomena. In this Perspective, we argue that
building a robust science of AI psychology requires integrating two of our
field's foundational pillars: the principles of reliable measurement and the
standards for sound causal inference. We present a dual-validity framework to
guide this integration, which clarifies how the evidence needed to support a
claim scales with its scientific ambition. Using an LLM to classify text may
require only basic accuracy checks, whereas claiming it can simulate anxiety
demands a far more rigorous validation process. Current practice systematically
fails to meet these requirements, often treating statistical pattern matching
as evidence of psychological phenomena. The same model output--endorsing "I am
anxious"--requires different validation strategies depending on whether
researchers claim to measure, characterize, simulate, or model psychological
constructs. Moving forward requires developing computational analogues of
psychological constructs and establishing clear, scalable standards of evidence
rather than the uncritical application of human measurement tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide methodological guidance for leveraging LLMs in psychological and behavioral research, addressing gaps in current practices.

Method: Proposes a framework with two applications: simulating roles/personas for diverse contexts and cognitive modeling. Includes validation strategies and case studies.

Result: Synthesizes approaches for probing LLMs, highlights challenges (e.g., prompt sensitivity, biases), and offers solutions for ethical and methodological issues.

Conclusion: Emphasizes transparency about LLM capabilities/limitations and integrates empirical evidence to help researchers effectively use LLMs in psychology.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer emerging opportunities for psychological
and behavioral research, but methodological guidance is lacking. This article
provides a framework for using LLMs as psychological simulators across two
primary applications: simulating roles and personas to explore diverse
contexts, and serving as computational models to investigate cognitive
processes. For simulation, we present methods for developing psychologically
grounded personas that move beyond demographic categories, with strategies for
validation against human data and use cases ranging from studying inaccessible
populations to prototyping research instruments. For cognitive modeling, we
synthesize emerging approaches for probing internal representations,
methodological advances in causal interventions, and strategies for relating
model behavior to human cognition. We address overarching challenges including
prompt sensitivity, temporal limitations from training data cutoffs, and
ethical considerations that extend beyond traditional human subjects review.
Throughout, we emphasize the need for transparency about model capabilities and
constraints. Together, this framework integrates emerging empirical evidence
about LLM performance--including systematic biases, cultural limitations, and
prompt brittleness--to help researchers wrangle these challenges and leverage
the unique capabilities of LLMs in psychological research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods lack deep semantic understanding and contextual map integration in GPS trajectory analysis.

Method: TrajSceneLLM combines map images and LLM-generated text to create multimodal embeddings, paired with an MLP classifier.

Result: The framework achieves significant performance gains in Travel Mode Identification, capturing spatio-temporal dependencies better than traditional methods.

Conclusion: TrajSceneLLM's semantic enhancement shows promise for geospatial AI applications, with code and data publicly available.

Abstract: GPS trajectory data reveals valuable patterns of human mobility and urban
dynamics, supporting a variety of spatial applications. However, traditional
methods often struggle to extract deep semantic representations and incorporate
contextual map information. We propose TrajSceneLLM, a multimodal perspective
for enhancing semantic understanding of GPS trajectories. The framework
integrates visualized map images (encoding spatial context) and textual
descriptions generated through LLM reasoning (capturing temporal sequences and
movement dynamics). Separate embeddings are generated for each modality and
then concatenated to produce trajectory scene embeddings with rich semantic
content which are further paired with a simple MLP classifier. We validate the
proposed framework on Travel Mode Identification (TMI), a critical task for
analyzing travel choices and understanding mobility behavior. Our experiments
show that these embeddings achieve significant performance improvement,
highlighting the advantage of our LLM-driven method in capturing deep
spatio-temporal dependencies and reducing reliance on handcrafted features.
This semantic enhancement promises significant potential for diverse downstream
applications and future research in geospatial artificial intelligence. The

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: An LLM-based bot successfully broadens perspectives in online political discussions by introducing missing arguments, without negative effects from AI disclosure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited spectrum of views in online political discussions caused by self-selection and like-minded interactions, which can harm democratic participation.

Method: Two pre-registered randomized experiments in a chatroom setting, where an LLM bot monitors discussions, identifies missing arguments, and introduces them.

Result: The bot significantly expanded the range of arguments (measured objectively and subjectively), and AI disclosure did not alter these effects.

Conclusion: LLM-based moderation tools can positively influence online political discourse by diversifying perspectives.

Abstract: A wide range of participation is essential for democracy, as it helps prevent
the dominance of extreme views, erosion of legitimacy, and political
polarization. However, engagement in online political discussions often
features a limited spectrum of views due to high levels of self-selection and
the tendency of online platforms to facilitate exchanges primarily among
like-minded individuals. This study examines whether an LLM-based bot can widen
the scope of perspectives expressed by participants in online discussions
through two pre-registered randomized experiments conducted in a chatroom. We
evaluate the impact of a bot that actively monitors discussions, identifies
missing arguments, and introduces them into the conversation. The results
indicate that our bot significantly expands the range of arguments, as measured
by both objective and subjective metrics. Furthermore, disclosure of the bot as
AI does not significantly alter these effects. These findings suggest that
LLM-based moderation tools can positively influence online political discourse.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine analytic Kähler potentials with associated approximately Ricci-flat metrics on Calabi-Yau manifolds, leveraging machine learning for numerical calculations.

Method: Numerically calculate Ricci-flat Kähler potentials via machine learning, fit results to Donaldson's Ansatz, and apply to the Dwork family of quintic hypersurfaces and bi-cubic CY hypersurfaces.

Result: Simple analytic expressions for approximately Ricci-flat Kähler potentials are obtained, showing dependence only on the modulus of the complex structure parameter.

Conclusion: The method successfully derives analytic Kähler potentials for specific Calabi-Yau manifolds, with potential applications in theoretical physics and geometry.

Abstract: We outline a method to determine analytic K\"ahler potentials with associated
approximately Ricci-flat K\"ahler metrics on Calabi-Yau manifolds. Key
ingredients are numerically calculating Ricci-flat K\"ahler potentials via
machine learning techniques and fitting the numerical results to Donaldson's
Ansatz. We apply this method to the Dwork family of quintic hypersurfaces in
$\mathbb{P}^4$ and an analogous one-parameter family of bi-cubic CY
hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{P}^2\times\mathbb{P}^2$. In each case, a relatively
simple analytic expression is obtained for the approximately Ricci-flat
K\"ahler potentials, including the explicit dependence on the complex structure
parameter. We find that these K\"ahler potentials only depend on the modulus of
the complex structure parameter.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a machine learning method using Vision Transformer (ViT) with transformed light curve data (GAFs and RPs) for exoplanet classification, achieving high recall and precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional exoplanet classification methods are resource-intensive, necessitating efficient machine learning solutions.

Method: Transform Kepler mission light curves into GAFs and RPs, then use ViT for classification, evaluated via 5-fold cross-validation.

Result: ViT with RPs achieves 89.46% recall and 85.09% precision, outperforming GAFs.

Conclusion: The method shows promise but requires further optimization for better generalization and performance.

Abstract: The classification of exoplanets has been a longstanding challenge in
astronomy, requiring significant computational and observational resources.
Traditional methods demand substantial effort, time, and cost, highlighting the
need for advanced machine learning techniques to enhance classification
efficiency. In this study, we propose a methodology that transforms raw light
curve data from NASA's Kepler mission into Gramian Angular Fields (GAFs) and
Recurrence Plots (RPs) using the Gramian Angular Difference Field and
recurrence plot techniques. These transformed images serve as inputs to the
Vision Transformer (ViT) model, leveraging its ability to capture intricate
temporal dependencies. We assess the performance of the model through recall,
precision, and F1 score metrics, using a 5-fold cross-validation approach to
obtain a robust estimate of the model's performance and reduce evaluation bias.
Our comparative analysis reveals that RPs outperform GAFs, with the ViT model
achieving an 89.46$\%$ recall and an 85.09$\%$ precision rate, demonstrating
its significant capability in accurately identifying exoplanetary transits.
Despite using under-sampling techniques to address class imbalance, dataset
size reduction remains a limitation. This study underscores the importance of
further research into optimizing model architectures to enhance automation,
performance, and generalization of the model.

*Robert Kent,Benjamin Lienhard,Gregory Lafyatis,Daniel J. Gauthier*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A reservoir computing-based method improves qubit-state discrimination with high fidelity, scalability, and reduced computational cost compared to traditional and neural network approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Superconducting qubits face readout bottlenecks, especially with crosstalk in frequency-multiplexed readout. Neural networks help but are computationally expensive and slow.

Method: Uses next-generation reservoir computing to construct polynomial features from measurement signals, avoiding costly nonlinear activations and enabling real-time training.

Result: Achieves up to 50% and 11% error reduction on single- and five-qubit datasets, respectively, with 2.5x crosstalk reduction and 100x fewer multiplications than neural networks.

Conclusion: Reservoir computing enhances qubit-state discrimination efficiently, offering scalability and adaptability for future quantum processors.

Abstract: Quantum processors require rapid and high-fidelity simultaneous measurements
of many qubits. While superconducting qubits are among the leading modalities
toward a useful quantum processor, their readout remains a bottleneck.
Traditional approaches to processing measurement data often struggle to account
for crosstalk present in frequency-multiplexed readout, the preferred method to
reduce the resource overhead. Recent approaches to address this challenge use
neural networks to improve the state-discrimination fidelity. However, they are
computationally expensive to train and evaluate, resulting in increased latency
and poor scalability as the number of qubits increases. We present an
alternative machine learning approach based on next-generation reservoir
computing that constructs polynomial features from the measurement signals and
maps them to the corresponding qubit states. This method is highly
parallelizable, avoids the costly nonlinear activation functions common in
neural networks, and supports real-time training, enabling fast evaluation,
adaptability, and scalability. Despite its lower computational complexity, our
reservoir approach is able to maintain high qubit-state-discrimination
fidelity. Relative to traditional methods, our approach achieves error
reductions of up to 50% and 11% on single- and five-qubit datasets,
respectively, and delivers up to 2.5x crosstalk reduction on the five-qubit
dataset. Compared with recent machine-learning methods, evaluating our model
requires 100x fewer multiplications for single-qubit and 2.5x fewer for
five-qubit models. This work demonstrates that reservoir computing can enhance
qubit-state discrimination while maintaining scalability for future quantum
processors.

*Lukas Gonon,Rodrigo Martínez-Peña,Juan-Pablo Ortega*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a recurrent quantum neural network architecture for feedback-based quantum reservoir computing, addressing theoretical gaps and proving universality with linear readouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of early quantum reservoir computing protocols (e.g., restarting and rewinding) and develop a theoretically grounded, real-time processing approach.

Method: Proposes a recurrent quantum neural network architecture extending feedforward models to a feedback-driven reservoir setting, with theoretical analysis of approximation bounds and universality.

Result: Demonstrates the model's universality with linear readouts, making it powerful and experimentally feasible.

Conclusion: The work advances practical, theoretically sound quantum reservoir computing with real-time capabilities.

Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing uses the dynamics of quantum systems to process
temporal data, making it particularly well-suited for learning with noisy
intermediate-scale quantum devices. Early experimental proposals, such as the
restarting and rewinding protocols, relied on repeating previous steps of the
quantum map to avoid backaction. However, this approach compromises real-time
processing and increases computational overhead. Recent developments have
introduced alternative protocols that address these limitations. These include
online, mid-circuit measurement, and feedback techniques, which enable
real-time computation while preserving the input history. Among these, the
feedback protocol stands out for its ability to process temporal information
with comparatively fewer components. Despite this potential advantage, the
theoretical foundations of feedback-based quantum reservoir computing remain
underdeveloped, particularly with regard to the universality and the
approximation capabilities of this approach. This paper addresses this issue by
presenting a recurrent quantum neural network architecture that extends a class
of existing feedforward models to a dynamic, feedback-driven reservoir setting.
We provide theoretical guarantees for variational recurrent quantum neural
networks, including approximation bounds and universality results. Notably, our
analysis demonstrates that the model is universal with linear readouts, making
it both powerful and experimentally accessible. These results pave the way for
practical and theoretically grounded quantum reservoir computing with real-time
processing capabilities.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores a quantum neural network (QNN) built from SWAP test circuits, showing its equivalence to a classical two-layer feedforward network with quadratic activations. It identifies expressivity limitations and proposes a circuit modification to enhance performance, particularly for tasks like parity checks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between quantum and classical neural networks by analyzing a QNN's mathematical equivalence and addressing its limitations.

Method: Examines a QNN using SWAP test circuits, compares it to classical networks, and introduces a modified circuit for improved expressivity.

Result: The original QNN struggles with tasks like parity checks, but the modified version succeeds, demonstrating broader representational capacity.

Conclusion: The study provides a framework for enhancing QNN expressivity and suggests potential for quantum learning tasks.

Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits represent promising architectures for machine
learning applications, yet many lack clear connections to classical models,
potentially limiting their ability to translate the wide success of classical
neural networks to the quantum realm. We examine a specific type of quantum
neural network (QNN) built exclusively from SWAP test circuits, and discuss its
mathematical equivalence to a classical two-layer feedforward network with
quadratic activation functions under amplitude encoding. Our analysis across
classical real-world and synthetic datasets reveals that while this
architecture can successfully learn many practical tasks, it exhibits
fundamental expressivity limitations due to violating the universal
approximation theorem, particularly failing on harder problems like the parity
check function. To address this limitation, we introduce a circuit modification
using generalized SWAP test circuits that effectively implements classical
neural networks with product layers. This enhancement enables successful
learning of parity check functions in arbitrary dimensions which we
analytically argue to be impossible for the original architecture beyond two
dimensions regardless of network size. Our results establish a framework for
enhancing QNN expressivity through classical task analysis and demonstrate that
our SWAP test-based architecture offers broad representational capacity,
suggesting potential promise also for quantum learning tasks.

TL;DR: RapFlow-TTS is a fast, high-quality TTS model using velocity consistency in flow matching to reduce synthesis steps without sacrificing quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between speech quality and inference speed in ODE-based TTS models by reducing the number of generation steps.

Method: Leverages velocity consistency constraints in flow matching, time interval scheduling, and adversarial learning for few-step synthesis.

Result: Achieves high-fidelity speech with 5-10x fewer steps than conventional FM- and score-based methods.

Conclusion: RapFlow-TTS efficiently balances speed and quality in TTS synthesis.

Abstract: We introduce RapFlow-TTS, a rapid and high-fidelity TTS acoustic model that
leverages velocity consistency constraints in flow matching (FM) training.
Although ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based TTS generation achieves
natural-quality speech, it typically requires a large number of generation
steps, resulting in a trade-off between quality and inference speed. To address
this challenge, RapFlow-TTS enforces consistency in the velocity field along
the FM-straightened ODE trajectory, enabling consistent synthetic quality with
fewer generation steps. Additionally, we introduce techniques such as time
interval scheduling and adversarial learning to further enhance the quality of
the few-step synthesis. Experimental results show that RapFlow-TTS achieves
high-fidelity speech synthesis with a 5- and 10-fold reduction in synthesis
steps than the conventional FM- and score-based approaches, respectively.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper introduces data-driven algorithms for spectral analysis of Koopman operators on RKHS, offering advantages like pointwise predictions, improved spectral properties, and efficiency in high dimensions. The methods are proven optimal and demonstrated on real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of traditional $L^2$ methods for spectral analysis of dynamical systems, the authors propose RKHS-based approaches for better flexibility, efficiency, and accuracy.

Method: The authors develop general, provably convergent algorithms for computing spectral properties of Koopman and Perron--Frobenius operators on RKHS, leveraging user-specified kernels and avoiding large-data limits.

Result: The algorithms efficiently compute spectra, pseudospectra, and spectral measures, demonstrating effectiveness on high-dimensional real-world datasets like turbulent flow and molecular dynamics.

Conclusion: The RKHS-based methods are optimal and outperform traditional approaches, with practical applications showcased in diverse fields. The algorithms are available in the $	exttt{SpecRKHS}$ software.

Abstract: Data-driven spectral analysis of Koopman operators is a powerful tool for
understanding numerous real-world dynamical systems, from neuronal activity to
variations in sea surface temperature. The Koopman operator acts on a function
space and is most commonly studied on the space of square-integrable functions.
However, defining it on a suitable reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS)
offers numerous practical advantages, including pointwise predictions with
error bounds, improved spectral properties that facilitate computations, and
more efficient algorithms, particularly in high dimensions. We introduce the
first general, provably convergent, data-driven algorithms for computing
spectral properties of Koopman and Perron--Frobenius operators on RKHSs. These
methods efficiently compute spectra and pseudospectra with error control and
spectral measures while exploiting the RKHS structure to avoid the large-data
limits required in the $L^2$ settings. The function space is determined by a
user-specified kernel, eliminating the need for quadrature-based sampling as in
$L^2$ and enabling greater flexibility with finite, externally provided
datasets. Using the Solvability Complexity Index hierarchy, we construct
adversarial dynamical systems for these problems to show that no algorithm can
succeed in fewer limits, thereby proving the optimality of our algorithms.
Notably, this impossibility extends to randomized algorithms and datasets. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms on challenging,
high-dimensional datasets arising from real-world measurements and
high-fidelity numerical simulations, including turbulent channel flow,
molecular dynamics of a binding protein, Antarctic sea ice concentration, and
Northern Hemisphere sea surface height. The algorithms are publicly available
in the software package $\texttt{SpecRKHS}$.

*Pham Khai Nguyen Do,Bao Nguyen Tran,Nam Nguyen,Duc Dung Nguyen*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: VEIGAR is a novel framework for efficient Novel View Synthesis (NVS) and 3D generation, eliminating the need for initial 3D reconstruction and improving cross-view consistency with a lightweight model and scale-invariant depth loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for NVS and 3D generation rely on computationally expensive initial 3D reconstruction phases, often yielding suboptimal results. VEIGAR aims to address these inefficiencies.

Method: VEIGAR uses a lightweight foundation model for explicit pixel-space alignment and introduces a scale-invariant depth loss to avoid traditional depth regularization.

Result: VEIGAR achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and cross-view consistency while reducing training time by threefold compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: VEIGAR offers a superior balance of efficiency and effectiveness in NVS and 3D generation, setting a new benchmark for the field.

Abstract: Recent advances in Novel View Synthesis (NVS) and 3D generation have
significantly improved editing tasks, with a primary emphasis on maintaining
cross-view consistency throughout the generative process. Contemporary methods
typically address this challenge using a dual-strategy framework: performing
consistent 2D inpainting across all views guided by embedded priors either
explicitly in pixel space or implicitly in latent space; and conducting 3D
reconstruction with additional consistency guidance. Previous strategies, in
particular, often require an initial 3D reconstruction phase to establish
geometric structure, introducing considerable computational overhead. Even with
the added cost, the resulting reconstruction quality often remains suboptimal.
In this paper, we present VEIGAR, a computationally efficient framework that
outperforms existing methods without relying on an initial reconstruction
phase. VEIGAR leverages a lightweight foundation model to reliably align priors
explicitly in the pixel space. In addition, we introduce a novel supervision
strategy based on scale-invariant depth loss, which removes the need for
traditional scale-and-shift operations in monocular depth regularization.
Through extensive experimentation, VEIGAR establishes a new state-of-the-art
benchmark in reconstruction quality and cross-view consistency, while achieving
a threefold reduction in training time compared to the fastest existing method,
highlighting its superior balance of efficiency and effectiveness.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A neural network-based method for efficient and accurate rendering of diffractive surfaces, reducing memory usage significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the heavy data dependency in current wave optics models for structural coloration by leveraging implicit neural representation.

Method: Uses a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) for data-driven rendering, focusing on data compression and avoiding over-fitting.

Result: Achieves high-quality reconstruction of ground-truth data with significant performance gains and memory reduction.

Conclusion: The method effectively balances accuracy and efficiency, offering a robust solution for diffractive surface rendering.

Abstract: Structural coloration is commonly modeled using wave optics for reliable and
photorealistic rendering of natural, quasi-periodic and complex nanostructures.
Such models often rely on dense, preliminary or preprocessed data to accurately
capture the nuanced variations in diffractive surface reflectances. This heavy
data dependency warrants implicit neural representation which has not been
addressed comprehensively in the current literature. In this paper, we present
a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) based method for data-driven rendering of
diffractive surfaces with high accuracy and efficiency. We primarily approach
this problem from a data compression perspective to devise a nuanced training
and modeling method which is attuned to the domain and range characteristics of
diffractive reflectance datasets. Importantly, our approach avoids over-fitting
and has robust resampling behavior. Using Peak-Signal-to-Noise (PSNR),
Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and a flipping difference evaluator
(FLIP) as evaluation metrics, we demonstrate the high-quality reconstruction of
the ground-truth. In comparison to a recent state-of-the-art offline,
wave-optical, forward modeling approach, our method reproduces subjectively
similar results with significant performance gains. We reduce the memory
footprint of the raw datasets by two orders of magnitude in general. Lastly, we
depict the working of our method with actual surface renderings.

*Haotian Yin,Aleksander Plocharski,Michal Jan Wlodarczyk,Mikolaj Kida,Przemyslaw Musialski*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A new curvature proxy for neural SDFs reduces computational costs while maintaining accuracy, enabling scalable CAD-style shape reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for enforcing developable behavior in neural SDFs rely on costly Gaussian curvature penalties involving full Hessian evaluation and second-order autodiff.

Method: Two proxies are introduced: (i) a finite-difference proxy using four forward SDF evaluations and a gradient, and (ii) an autodiff proxy using one Hessian-vector product, both avoiding full Hessian assembly.

Result: The proxies match or exceed Hessian-based baselines in reconstruction fidelity while halving GPU memory use and runtime on ABC benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method offers a practical, scalable solution for curvature-aware SDF learning in engineering-grade shape reconstruction.

Abstract: Neural signed-distance fields (SDFs) have become a versatile backbone for
geometric learning, yet enforcing developable, CAD-style behavior still hinges
on Gaussian curvature penalties that require full Hessian evaluation and
second-order automatic differentiation, both of which are costly in memory and
runtime. We present a curvature proxy that regularizes only the mixed
second-order term (Weingarten term), allowing the two principal curvatures to
adapt freely to data while suppressing unwanted warp. Two complementary
instantiations realize this idea: (i) a finite-difference proxy that replaces
each Hessian entry with four forward SDF evaluations and a single first-order
gradient, and (ii) an autodiff proxy that computes the same mixed derivative
via one Hessian-vector product, sidestepping explicit full Hessian assembly and
remaining faster in practice. Both variants converge to the exact mixed second
derivative, thus preserving the intended geometric bias without incurring full
second-order graphs. On the ABC benchmarks, the proxies match or exceed the
reconstruction fidelity of Hessian-based baselines while reducing GPU memory
use and wall-clock time by a factor of two. Because the method is drop-in and
framework-agnostic, it opens a practical path toward scalable, curvature-aware
SDF learning for engineering-grade shape reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge fluid dynamics and deep generative modeling by introducing a physically motivated PDE for image corruption, improving diversity and quality in generated images.

Method: Uses a GPU-accelerated Lattice Boltzmann solver to implement a PDE coupling advection-diffusion and noise, with stochastic velocity fields for turbulence. A neural network reverses the process for generation.

Result: The framework generalizes prior PDE-based techniques, with advection enhancing image diversity and quality without altering the color palette.

Conclusion: The work offers a new perspective on physically informed image corruption, integrating fluid dynamics and generative modeling.

Abstract: We propose a novel PDE-driven corruption process for generative image
synthesis based on advection-diffusion processes which generalizes existing
PDE-based approaches. Our forward pass formulates image corruption via a
physically motivated PDE that couples directional advection with isotropic
diffusion and Gaussian noise, controlled by dimensionless numbers (Peclet,
Fourier). We implement this PDE numerically through a GPU-accelerated custom
Lattice Boltzmann solver for fast evaluation. To induce realistic turbulence,
we generate stochastic velocity fields that introduce coherent motion and
capture multi-scale mixing. In the generative process, a neural network learns
to reverse the advection-diffusion operator thus constituting a novel
generative model. We discuss how previous methods emerge as specific cases of
our operator, demonstrating that our framework generalizes prior PDE-based
corruption techniques. We illustrate how advection improves the diversity and
quality of the generated images while keeping the overall color palette
unaffected. This work bridges fluid dynamics, dimensionless PDE theory, and
deep generative modeling, offering a fresh perspective on physically informed
image corruption processes for diffusion-based synthesis.

Result: Effective in panoramic image generation, depth estimation, and 3D scene generation.

Conclusion: DreamCube successfully reuses 2D priors for high-quality 3D panorama synthesis.

Abstract: 3D panorama synthesis is a promising yet challenging task that demands
high-quality and diverse visual appearance and geometry of the generated
omnidirectional content. Existing methods leverage rich image priors from
pre-trained 2D foundation models to circumvent the scarcity of 3D panoramic
data, but the incompatibility between 3D panoramas and 2D single views limits
their effectiveness. In this work, we demonstrate that by applying multi-plane
synchronization to the operators from 2D foundation models, their capabilities
can be seamlessly extended to the omnidirectional domain. Based on this design,
we further introduce DreamCube, a multi-plane RGB-D diffusion model for 3D
panorama generation, which maximizes the reuse of 2D foundation model priors to
achieve diverse appearances and accurate geometry while maintaining multi-view
consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in panoramic image generation, panoramic depth estimation, and 3D

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distributed training of LLMs is costly and prone to silent errors due to lack of verification, leading to wasted resources.

Method: TrainVerify uses shape-reduction techniques and a stage-wise parallel verification algorithm to verify equivalence between distributed execution and logical specifications.

Result: TrainVerify successfully verified training plans for large models like Llama3 (405B) and DeepSeek-V3 (671B).

Conclusion: TrainVerify provides a scalable solution for ensuring correctness in distributed LLM training, reducing computational waste.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) at scale requires parallel execution
across thousands of devices, incurring enormous computational costs. Yet, these
costly distributed trainings are rarely verified, leaving them prone to silent
errors and potentially wasting millions of GPU hours. We introduce TrainVerify,
a system for verifiable distributed training of LLMs. Given a deep learning
model's logical specification as the ground truth, TrainVerify formally
verifies that a distributed parallel execution plan is mathematically
equivalent to it. Direct verification is notoriously difficult due to the sheer
scale of LLMs which often involves billions of variables and highly intricate
computation graphs. Therefore, TrainVerify introduces shape-reduction
techniques and a stage-wise parallel verification algorithm that significantly
reduces complexity while preserving formal correctness. TrainVerify scales to
frontier LLMs, including the successful verification of the Llama3 (405B) and
DeepSeek-V3 (671B) training plans.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VSAs face computational bottlenecks in the clean-up step due to quadratic complexity.

Method: Uses Kroneker products of rotation-like matrices for efficient clean-up.

Result: Achieves linearithmic time complexity (O(N log N)) and O(N) space complexity, with codebook stored implicitly.

Conclusion: The method significantly enhances scalability, confirmed by experiments.

Abstract: A computational bottleneck in current Vector-Symbolic Architectures (VSAs) is
the ``clean-up'' step, which decodes the noisy vectors retrieved from the
architecture. Clean-up typically compares noisy vectors against a ``codebook''
of prototype vectors, incurring computational complexity that is quadratic or
similar. We present a new codebook representation that supports efficient
clean-up, based on Kroneker products of rotation-like matrices. The resulting
clean-up time complexity is linearithmic, i.e. $\mathcal{O}(N\,\text{log}\,N)$,
where $N$ is the vector dimension and also the number of vectors in the
codebook. Clean-up space complexity is $\mathcal{O}(N)$. Furthermore, the
codebook is not stored explicitly in computer memory: It can be represented in
$\mathcal{O}(\text{log}\,N)$ space, and individual vectors in the codebook can
be materialized in $\mathcal{O}(N)$ time and space. At the same time,
asymptotic memory capacity remains comparable to standard approaches. Computer
experiments confirm these results, demonstrating several orders of magnitude
more scalability than baseline VSA techniques.

TL;DR: MoNetV2 improves 3D ultrasound reconstruction by fusing image and motion data, using multi-level consistency constraints and self-supervised learning to reduce drift and enhance accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep-learning-based 3D ultrasound reconstruction struggles with cumulative drift and accuracy, especially in complex motion scenarios.

Method: Proposes MoNetV2 with sensor-based fusion, online multi-level consistency constraints, and self-supervised learning to improve reconstruction.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in reconstruction quality and generalizability across three datasets.

Conclusion: MoNetV2 effectively addresses drift and accuracy issues in 3D ultrasound reconstruction, offering superior performance.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound (US) aims to provide sonographers with the
spatial relationships of anatomical structures, playing a crucial role in
clinical diagnosis. Recently, deep-learning-based freehand 3D US has made
significant advancements. It reconstructs volumes by estimating transformations
between images without external tracking. However, image-only reconstruction
poses difficulties in reducing cumulative drift and further improving
reconstruction accuracy, particularly in scenarios involving complex motion
trajectories. In this context, we propose an enhanced motion network (MoNetV2)
to enhance the accuracy and generalizability of reconstruction under diverse
scanning velocities and tactics. First, we propose a sensor-based temporal and
multi-branch structure that fuses image and motion information from a velocity
perspective to improve image-only reconstruction accuracy. Second, we devise an
online multi-level consistency constraint that exploits the inherent
consistency of scans to handle various scanning velocities and tactics. This
constraint exploits both scan-level velocity consistency, path-level appearance
consistency, and patch-level motion consistency to supervise inter-frame
transformation estimation. Third, we distill an online multi-modal
self-supervised strategy that leverages the correlation between network
estimation and motion information to further reduce cumulative errors.

TL;DR: HistoStainAlign predicts IHC staining patterns from H&E images using deep learning, improving efficiency and reducing costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IHC staining is costly and time-consuming; this study aims to predict IHC patterns directly from H&E images to streamline workflows.

Method: A deep learning framework (HistoStainAlign) uses contrastive training to align H&E and IHC embeddings without patch-level annotations.

Result: Achieved weighted F1 scores of 0.735 (P53), 0.830 (PD-L1), and 0.723 (Ki-67), demonstrating robust cross-stain alignment.

Conclusion: HistoStainAlign shows promise as a pre-screening tool to prioritize IHC staining, enhancing diagnostic efficiency.

Abstract: Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining is a cornerstone of pathological
analysis, offering reliable visualization of cellular morphology and tissue
architecture for cancer diagnosis, subtyping, and grading. Immunohistochemistry
(IHC) staining provides molecular insights by detecting specific proteins
within tissues, enhancing diagnostic accuracy, and improving treatment
planning. However, IHC staining is costly, time-consuming, and
resource-intensive, requiring specialized expertise. To address these
limitations, this study proposes HistoStainAlign, a novel deep learning
framework that predicts IHC staining patterns directly from H&E whole-slide
images (WSIs) by learning joint representations of morphological and molecular
features. The framework integrates paired H&E and IHC embeddings through a
contrastive training strategy, capturing complementary features across staining
modalities without patch-level annotations or tissue registration. The model
was evaluated on gastrointestinal and lung tissue WSIs with three commonly used
IHC stains: P53, PD-L1, and Ki-67. HistoStainAlign achieved weighted F1 scores
of 0.735 [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.670-0.799], 0.830 [95% CI:
0.772-0.886], and 0.723 [95% CI: 0.607-0.836], respectively for these three IHC
stains. Embedding analyses demonstrated the robustness of the contrastive
alignment in capturing meaningful cross-stain relationships. Comparisons with a
baseline model further highlight the advantage of incorporating contrastive
learning for improved stain pattern prediction. This study demonstrates the
potential of computational approaches to serve as a pre-screening tool, helping
prioritize cases for IHC staining and improving workflow efficiency.

### [514] [InfiniPot-V: Memory-Constrained KV Cache Compression for Streaming Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15745)
*Minsoo Kim,Kyuhong Shim,Jungwook Choi,Simyung Chang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: InfiniPot-V is a training-free, query-agnostic framework for streaming video understanding, enforcing a hard memory cap by compressing the KV cache via temporal redundancy removal and semantic token retention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the linear growth of KV cache in MLLMs, which exceeds memory limits of edge devices, without requiring offline access or full-cache construction.

Method: Uses Temporal-axis Redundancy (TaR) and Value-Norm (VaN) ranking to compress the KV cache during video encoding, maintaining a fixed memory threshold.

Result: Reduces peak GPU memory by up to 94%, sustains real-time generation, and matches or surpasses full-cache accuracy.

Conclusion: InfiniPot-V enables efficient on-device streaming video understanding without retraining or query knowledge.

Abstract: Modern multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can reason over hour-long
video, yet their key-value (KV) cache grows linearly with time--quickly
exceeding the fixed memory of phones, AR glasses, and edge robots. Prior
compression schemes either assume the whole video and user query are available
offline or must first build the full cache, so memory still scales with stream
length. InfiniPot-V is the first training-free, query-agnostic framework that
enforces a hard, length-independent memory cap for streaming video
understanding. During video encoding it monitors the cache and, once a user-set
threshold is reached, runs a lightweight compression pass that (i) removes
temporally redundant tokens via Temporal-axis Redundancy (TaR) metric and (ii)
keeps semantically significant tokens via Value-Norm (VaN) ranking. Across four
open-source MLLMs and four long-video and two streaming-video benchmarks,
InfiniPot-V cuts peak GPU memory by up to 94%, sustains real-time generation,
and matches or surpasses full-cache accuracy--even in multi-turn dialogues. By
dissolving the KV cache bottleneck without retraining or query knowledge,
InfiniPot-V closes the gap for on-device streaming video assistants.

*Raghav Mehta,Fabio De Sousa Ribeiro,Tian Xia,Melanie Roschewitz,Ainkaran Santhirasekaram,Dominic C. Marshall,Ben Glocker*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Using counterfactual images to improve anatomical segmentation in medical images by simulating disease-free appearances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Disease patterns complicate accurate segmentation of anatomical structures, risking misdiagnosis. Counterfactual images can simulate healthy appearances without altering structure.

Method: Generate counterfactual images to show anatomy without disease, then use these for segmentation without modifying the model.

Result: Experiments on chest X-ray datasets show improved anatomical segmentation with counterfactual images.

Conclusion: Counterfactual images enhance segmentation accuracy, supporting better clinical decisions.

Abstract: Segmenting anatomical structures in medical images plays an important role in
the quantitative assessment of various diseases. However, accurate segmentation
becomes significantly more challenging in the presence of disease. Disease
patterns can alter the appearance of surrounding healthy tissues, introduce
ambiguous boundaries, or even obscure critical anatomical structures. As such,
segmentation models trained on real-world datasets may struggle to provide good
anatomical segmentation, leading to potential misdiagnosis. In this paper, we
generate counterfactual (CF) images to simulate how the same anatomy would
appear in the absence of disease without altering the underlying structure. We
then use these CF images to segment structures of interest, without requiring
any changes to the underlying segmentation model. Our experiments on two
real-world clinical chest X-ray datasets show that the use of counterfactual
images improves anatomical segmentation, thereby aiding downstream clinical
decision-making.

### [516] [Pixel-wise Modulated Dice Loss for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15744)
*Seyed Mohsen Hosseini*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Pixel-wise Modulated Dice loss (PM Dice loss) to address both class and difficulty imbalances in medical segmentation tasks, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class and difficulty imbalances in medical segmentation tasks hinder neural network performance, with existing solutions being computationally costly or ineffective.

Method: The study introduces a simple modification to Dice loss, adding a pixel-level modulating term to handle difficulty imbalance without significant computational overhead.

Result: PM Dice loss outperforms other methods on three medical segmentation tasks, effectively addressing both imbalances.

Conclusion: The proposed PM Dice loss is a computationally efficient and effective solution for handling class and difficulty imbalances in medical segmentation.

Abstract: Class imbalance and the difficulty imbalance are the two types of data
imbalance that affect the performance of neural networks in medical
segmentation tasks. In class imbalance the loss is dominated by the majority
classes and in difficulty imbalance the loss is dominated by easy to classify
pixels. This leads to an ineffective training. Dice loss, which is based on a
geometrical metric, is very effective in addressing the class imbalance
compared to the cross entropy (CE) loss, which is adopted directly from
classification tasks. To address the difficulty imbalance, the common approach
is employing a re-weighted CE loss or a modified Dice loss to focus the
training on difficult to classify areas. The existing modification methods are
computationally costly and with limited success. In this study we propose a
simple modification to the Dice loss with minimal computational cost. With a
pixel level modulating term, we take advantage of the effectiveness of Dice
loss in handling the class imbalance to also handle the difficulty imbalance.
Results on three commonly used medical segmentation tasks show that the
proposed Pixel-wise Modulated Dice loss (PM Dice loss) outperforms other
methods, which are designed to tackle the difficulty imbalance problem.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Diffusion-based Counterfactual Augmentation (DCA) to improve automated grading of Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) by enhancing model robustness and interpretability through targeted counterfactual examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing inter-observer variability and deep learning model limitations in KOA grading, especially near decision boundaries.

Method: Uses a diffusion model with a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) to generate counterfactuals, combined with a self-corrective learning strategy.

Result: Significant improvement in classification accuracy on OAI and MOST datasets, with interpretable visualizations of pathological changes.

Conclusion: DCA converts model uncertainty into a robust training signal, advancing accurate and trustworthy automated diagnostics.

Abstract: Automated grading of Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) from radiographs is challenged
by significant inter-observer variability and the limited robustness of deep
learning models, particularly near critical decision boundaries. To address
these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework, Diffusion-based
Counterfactual Augmentation (DCA), which enhances model robustness and
interpretability by generating targeted counterfactual examples. The method
navigates the latent space of a diffusion model using a Stochastic Differential
Equation (SDE), governed by balancing a classifier-informed boundary drive with
a manifold constraint. The resulting counterfactuals are then used within a
self-corrective learning strategy to improve the classifier by focusing on its
specific areas of uncertainty. Extensive experiments on the public
Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) and Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST)
datasets demonstrate that this approach significantly improves classification
accuracy across multiple model architectures. Furthermore, the method provides
interpretability by visualizing minimal pathological changes and revealing that
the learned latent space topology aligns with clinical knowledge of KOA
progression. The DCA framework effectively converts model uncertainty into a
robust training signal, offering a promising pathway to developing more
accurate and trustworthy automated diagnostic systems. Our code is available at

*Ziran Zhu,Tongda Xu,Minye Huang,Dailan He,Xingtong Ge,Xinjie Zhang,Ling Li,Yan Wang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A training-free algorithm improves perceptual quality of image codecs with fast decoding, outperforming previous methods in FID.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training-free perceptual image codecs are slow, relying on time-consuming methods like diffusion inversion. This paper aims to improve decoding speed and perceptual quality without training.

Method: Proposes a training-free algorithm with implementations for different decoding time budgets (≈0.1s, 0.1-10s, ≥10s). It enhances perceptual quality and works with non-differentiable codecs.

Result: Reduces decoding time from 1 min to 0.1-10s with comparable perceptual quality. Outperforms HiFiC and MS-ILLM in FID.

Conclusion: The approach is versatile, fast, and improves perceptual quality across various codecs, offering a practical solution for perception-distortion trade-offs.

Abstract: Training-free perceptual image codec adopt pre-trained unconditional
generative model during decoding to avoid training new conditional generative
model. However, they heavily rely on diffusion inversion or sample
communication, which take 1 min to intractable amount of time to decode a
single image. In this paper, we propose a training-free algorithm that improves
the perceptual quality of any existing codec with theoretical guarantee. We
further propose different implementations for optimal perceptual quality when
decoding time budget is $\approx 0.1$s, $0.1-10$s and $\ge 10$s. Our approach:
1). improves the decoding time of training-free codec from 1 min to $0.1-10$s
with comparable perceptual quality. 2). can be applied to non-differentiable
codec such as VTM. 3). can be used to improve previous perceptual codecs, such
as MS-ILLM. 4). can easily achieve perception-distortion trade-off.
Empirically, we show that our approach successfully improves the perceptual
quality of ELIC, VTM and MS-ILLM with fast decoding. Our approach achieves
comparable FID to previous training-free codec with significantly less decoding
time. And our approach still outperforms previous conditional generative model
based codecs such as HiFiC and MS-ILLM in terms of FID. The source code is

*Ignacio Hernández Montilla,Alfonso Medela,Paola Pasquali,Andy Aguilar,Taig Mac Carthy,Gerardo Fernández,Antonio Martorell,Enrique Onieva*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Cross-domain training of IQA models improves teledermatology image quality by leveraging larger datasets from both dermatology and non-dermatology domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Poor image quality in teledermatology reduces consultation effectiveness, but existing IQA research lacks dermatology-specific advancements.

Method: Created a new dermatology IQA database (Legit.Health-DIQA-Artificial) and trained models using cross-domain datasets.

Result: Cross-domain training enhances performance, addresses data scarcity, and improves image quality management.

Conclusion: Cross-domain IQA training is effective for teledermatology, overcoming data limitations and improving image quality.

Abstract: Teledermatology has become a widely accepted communication method in daily
clinical practice, enabling remote care while showing strong agreement with
in-person visits. Poor image quality remains an unsolved problem in
teledermatology and is a major concern to practitioners, as bad-quality images
reduce the usefulness of the remote consultation process. However, research on
Image Quality Assessment (IQA) in dermatology is sparse, and does not leverage
the latest advances in non-dermatology IQA, such as using larger image
databases with ratings from large groups of human observers. In this work, we
propose cross-domain training of IQA models, combining dermatology and
non-dermatology IQA datasets. For this purpose, we created a novel dermatology
IQA database, Legit.Health-DIQA-Artificial, using dermatology images from
several sources and having them annotated by a group of human observers. We
demonstrate that cross-domain training yields optimal performance across
domains and overcomes one of the biggest limitations in dermatology IQA, which
is the small scale of data, and leads to models trained on a larger pool of
image distortions, resulting in a better management of image quality in the
teledermatology process.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: PR-INR is a progressive refinement framework for motion-robust MRI, combining motion correction, structural refinement, and volumetric synthesis to address hierarchical disruptions in slice-to-volume reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in recovering 3D brain volumes from 2D MRI slices under motion or accelerated acquisitions, which causes local detail loss, global aliasing, and volumetric anisotropy.

Method: PR-INR uses a motion-aware diffusion module for coarse reconstruction, an implicit detail restoration module for local refinement, and a voxel continuous-aware module for inter-slice completion.

Result: PR-INR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction metrics and visual quality across diverse MRI datasets under motion and undersampling.

Conclusion: PR-INR is robust and generalizable, offering superior motion correction and detail recovery in MRI reconstruction.

Abstract: In motion-robust magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), slice-to-volume
reconstruction is critical for recovering anatomically consistent 3D brain
volumes from 2D slices, especially under accelerated acquisitions or patient
motion. However, this task remains challenging due to hierarchical structural
disruptions. It includes local detail loss from k-space undersampling, global
structural aliasing caused by motion, and volumetric anisotropy. Therefore, we
propose a progressive refinement implicit neural representation (PR-INR)
framework. Our PR-INR unifies motion correction, structural refinement, and
volumetric synthesis within a geometry-aware coordinate space. Specifically, a
motion-aware diffusion module is first employed to generate coarse volumetric
reconstructions that suppress motion artifacts and preserve global anatomical
structures. Then, we introduce an implicit detail restoration module that
performs residual refinement by aligning spatial coordinates with visual
features. It corrects local structures and enhances boundary precision.
Further, a voxel continuous-aware representation module represents the image as
a continuous function over 3D coordinates. It enables accurate inter-slice
completion and high-frequency detail recovery. We evaluate PR-INR on five
public MRI datasets under various motion conditions (3% and 5% displacement),
undersampling rates (4x and 8x) and slice resolutions (scale = 5). Experimental
results demonstrate that PR-INR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both
quantitative reconstruction metrics and visual quality. It further shows
generalization and robustness across diverse unseen domains.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: An interpretable deep learning method for automated gestational age calculation, using segmentation and distance maps, performs comparably to state-of-the-art models with reduced complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate gestational age estimation is crucial for fetal growth monitoring, but traditional methods (e.g., last menstrual period) are unreliable, and ultrasound-based approaches suffer from manual variability.

Method: A novel segmentation architecture and distance maps are used to automate gestational age calculation, addressing dataset limitations and scarce segmentation masks.

Result: The method matches state-of-the-art performance while simplifying complexity, proving effective in resource-limited settings and with sparse annotations. Distance maps excel in femur endpoint estimation.

Conclusion: The proposed deep learning approach offers a reliable, interpretable, and scalable solution for gestational age estimation, especially in constrained environments.

Abstract: Being born small carries significant health risks, including increased
neonatal mortality and a higher likelihood of future cardiac diseases. Accurate
estimation of gestational age is critical for monitoring fetal growth, but
traditional methods, such as estimation based on the last menstrual period, are
in some situations difficult to obtain. While ultrasound-based approaches offer
greater reliability, they rely on manual measurements that introduce
variability. This study presents an interpretable deep learning-based method
for automated gestational age calculation, leveraging a novel segmentation
architecture and distance maps to overcome dataset limitations and the scarcity
of segmentation masks. Our approach achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art models while reducing complexity, making it particularly
suitable for resource-constrained settings and with limited annotated data.
Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the use of distance maps is
particularly suitable for estimating femur endpoints.

TL;DR: VesselSDF introduces a novel framework using signed distance fields (SDFs) for accurate vessel segmentation from sparse CT scans, outperforming existing methods by preserving geometry and connectivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation of vascular networks from sparse CT scans is challenging due to thin, branching vessels and sparsity between imaging planes. Existing deep learning methods struggle with structural continuity and geometric fidelity.

Method: VesselSDF reformulates vessel segmentation as a continuous SDF regression problem, representing each point by its signed distance to the nearest vessel surface. An adaptive Gaussian regularizer ensures smoothness and precision.

Result: VesselSDF significantly outperforms existing methods, preserving vessel geometry and connectivity, and eliminating common SDF artifacts like floating segments.

Conclusion: VesselSDF enables more reliable vascular analysis in clinical settings by providing robust and accurate vessel reconstructions.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of vascular networks from sparse CT scan slices remains
a significant challenge in medical imaging, particularly due to the thin,
branching nature of vessels and the inherent sparsity between imaging planes.
Existing deep learning approaches, based on binary voxel classification, often
struggle with structural continuity and geometric fidelity. To address this
challenge, we present VesselSDF, a novel framework that leverages signed
distance fields (SDFs) for robust vessel reconstruction. Our method
reformulates vessel segmentation as a continuous SDF regression problem, where
each point in the volume is represented by its signed distance to the nearest
vessel surface. This continuous representation inherently captures the smooth,
tubular geometry of blood vessels and their branching patterns. We obtain
accurate vessel reconstructions while eliminating common SDF artifacts such as
floating segments, thanks to our adaptive Gaussian regularizer which ensures
smoothness in regions far from vessel surfaces while producing precise geometry
near the surface boundaries. Our experimental results demonstrate that
VesselSDF significantly outperforms existing methods and preserves vessel
geometry and connectivity, enabling more reliable vascular analysis in clinical
settings.

*Chanung Park,Joo Chan Lee,Jong Hwan Ko*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: DiffO is a single-step diffusion model for image compression, offering high perceptual quality and fast decoding at ultra-low bitrates by combining VQ Residual training and rate-adaptive noise modulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image compression methods degrade at low bitrates, and diffusion models suffer from slow decoding and limited perceptual quality.

Method: DiffO uses VQ Residual training to capture global geometry and high-frequency details, and rate-adaptive noise modulation to adjust denoising strength for desired bitrates.

Result: DiffO outperforms state-of-the-art methods in compression performance and improves decoding speed by 50x.

Conclusion: DiffO enhances the practicality of generative codecs by balancing quality and speed at ultra-low bitrates.

Abstract: Although image compression is fundamental to visual data processing and has
inspired numerous standard and learned codecs, these methods still suffer
severe quality degradation at extremely low bits per pixel. While recent
diffusion based models provided enhanced generative performance at low
bitrates, they still yields limited perceptual quality and prohibitive decoding
latency due to multiple denoising steps. In this paper, we propose the first
single step diffusion model for image compression (DiffO) that delivers high
perceptual quality and fast decoding at ultra low bitrates. DiffO achieves
these goals by coupling two key innovations: (i) VQ Residual training, which
factorizes a structural base code and a learned residual in latent space,
capturing both global geometry and high frequency details; and (ii) rate
adaptive noise modulation, which tunes denoising strength on the fly to match
the desired bitrate. Extensive experiments show that DiffO surpasses state of
the art compression performance while improving decoding speed by about 50x
compared to prior diffusion-based methods, greatly improving the practicality
of generative codecs. The code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated tumor segmentation in breast ultrasound is challenging due to noise, lesion scale variations, and fuzzy boundaries.

Method: Proposes a network with DenseNet121 encoder, attention-enhanced decoder (GSA, PE, SDPA), SFEB for spatial refinement, and hybrid loss (BCE + Jaccard).

Result: Outperforms existing approaches on public datasets, aiding early and accurate breast cancer diagnosis.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses segmentation challenges, showing promise for clinical use.

Abstract: Breast ultrasound imaging is a valuable tool for early breast cancer
detection, but automated tumor segmentation is challenging due to inherent
noise, variations in scale of lesions, and fuzzy boundaries. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel hybrid attention-based network for lesion
segmentation. Our proposed architecture integrates a pre-trained DenseNet121 in
the encoder part for robust feature extraction with a multi-branch
attention-enhanced decoder tailored for breast ultrasound images. The
bottleneck incorporates Global Spatial Attention (GSA), Position Encoding (PE),
and Scaled Dot-Product Attention (SDPA) to learn global context, spatial
relationships, and relative positional features. The Spatial Feature
Enhancement Block (SFEB) is embedded at skip connections to refine and enhance
spatial features, enabling the network to focus more effectively on tumor
regions. A hybrid loss function combining Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) and
Jaccard Index loss optimizes both pixel-level accuracy and region-level overlap
metrics, enhancing robustness to class imbalance and irregular tumor shapes.
Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
approaches, highlighting its potential to assist radiologists in early and
accurate breast cancer diagnosis.

TL;DR: Overfitting in deep learning for histopathology image analysis is addressed, showing that large natural image models underperform and simpler, domain-specific architectures work better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the issue of overfitting when using large-scale natural image models for histopathology tasks and the need for tailored solutions.

Method: Experiments with ResNet variants and Vision Transformers (ViT) on histopathology datasets, including the Oesophageal Adenocarcinomas dataset.

Result: Increasing model capacity doesn't improve performance; simpler, domain-specific architectures outperform and reduce overfitting.

Conclusion: Customized architectures for histopathology are essential, especially with limited datasets, to avoid overfitting and enhance performance.

Abstract: This study investigates the critical problem of overfitting in deep learning
models applied to histopathology image analysis. We show that simply adopting
and fine-tuning large-scale models designed for natural image analysis often
leads to suboptimal performance and significant overfitting when applied to
histopathology tasks. Through extensive experiments with various model
architectures, including ResNet variants and Vision Transformers (ViT), we show
that increasing model capacity does not necessarily improve performance on
histopathology datasets. Our findings emphasize the need for customized
architectures specifically designed for histopathology image analysis,
particularly when working with limited datasets. Using Oesophageal
Adenocarcinomas public dataset, we demonstrate that simpler, domain-specific
architectures can achieve comparable or better performance while minimizing
overfitting.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A prior-guided joint diffusion model (PJDM) transforms 18F-FDG PET images into 18F-DOPA PET images in the projection domain, improving sinogram quality and synthetic outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limitations of 18F-FDG PET for certain tumors and the challenges in 18F-DOPA synthesis and use motivate the development of a more efficient method for generating 18F-DOPA PET images.

Method: The study proposes PJDM, which includes a coarse estimation model and a prior refinement model, using a higher-order hybrid sampler and iterative refinement with learned prior.

Result: PJDM effectively improves sinogram quality and synthetic outcomes, demonstrating its potential for clinical applications.

Conclusion: The PJDM method offers a promising solution for generating 18F-DOPA PET images, addressing the limitations of current radiotracers and reconstruction processes.

Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) is widely used to assess metabolic
activity, but its application is limited by the availability of radiotracers.
18F-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) is the most commonly used tracer but
shows limited effectiveness for certain tumors. In contrast,
6-18F-fluoro-3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (18F-DOPA) offers higher specificity
for neuroendocrine tumors and neurological disorders. However, its complex
synthesis and limitations in transportation and clinical use hinder widespread
adoption. During PET imaging, the sinogram represents a form of raw data
acquired by the scanner. Therefore, modeling in projection domain enables more
direct utilization of the original information, potentially reducing the
accumulation of errors introduced during the image reconstruction process.
Inspired by these factors, this study proposes a prior-guided joint diffusion
model (PJDM) for transforming 18F-FDG PET images into 18F-DOPA PET images in
projection domain. Specifically, a coarse estimation model and a prior
refinement model are trained independently. During inference, an initial
synthetic 18F-DOPA PET sinogram is generated using a higher-order hybrid
sampler. This sinogram is then degraded and serves as an additional condition
to guide the iterative refinement process using learned prior. Experimental
results demonstrated that PJDM effectively improved both sinogram quality and
synthetic outcomes. The code is available at: https://github.com/yqx7150/PJDM.

TL;DR: A neural framework combines temperature correction and image enhancement for infrared thermography, addressing emissivity issues with a dual-constrained loss function and achieving accurate calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack joint optimization of radiometric calibration and image degradation, leading to temperature inaccuracies in infrared thermography.

Method: Uses a symmetric skip-CNN with an emissivity-aware attention module, ROI segmentation, and a dual-constrained loss function for mean-variance alignment and histogram matching.

Result: Validated on an industrial blower system, the method achieves accurate calibration and suppresses emissivity artifacts while recovering structural details.

Conclusion: The framework effectively unifies temperature correction and image enhancement, improving accuracy in industrial infrared thermography.

Abstract: Infrared thermography faces persistent challenges in temperature accuracy due
to material emissivity variations, where existing methods often neglect the
joint optimization of radiometric calibration and image degradation. This study
introduces a physically guided neural framework that unifies temperature
correction and image enhancement through a symmetric skip-CNN architecture and
an emissivity-aware attention module. The pre-processing stage segments the
ROIs of the image and and initially corrected the firing rate. A novel
dual-constrained loss function strengthens the statistical consistency between
the target and reference regions through mean-variance alignment and histogram
matching based on Kullback-Leibler dispersion. The method works by dynamically
fusing thermal radiation features and spatial context, and the model suppresses
emissivity artifacts while recovering structural details. After validating the
industrial blower system under different conditions, the improved network
realizes the dynamic fusion of thermal radiation characteristics and spatial
background, with accurate calibration results in various industrial conditions.

TL;DR: A novel model (MS-CDT) for PET tracer separation using texture masks and multi-latent space, outperforming existing methods in image quality and clinical relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-tracer PET imaging provides comprehensive physiological insights but faces challenges in distinguishing tracer signals due to identical gamma-photon energies.

Method: Proposes MS-CDT, integrating diffusion and transformer architectures with texture masks and multi-latent space for enhanced tracer separation.

Result: MS-CDT achieves competitive performance in image quality and clinical relevance on brain and chest PET datasets.

Conclusion: MS-CDT is a promising approach for accurate and robust PET tracer separation, leveraging texture guidance and multi-level features.

Abstract: In clinical practice, single-radiotracer positron emission tomography (PET)
is commonly used for imaging. Although multi-tracer PET imaging can provide
supplementary information of radiotracers that are sensitive to physiological
function changes, enabling a more comprehensive characterization of
physiological and pathological states, the gamma-photon pairs generated by
positron annihilation reactions of different tracers in PET imaging have the
same energy, making it difficult to distinguish the tracer signals. In this
study, a multi-latent space guided texture conditional diffusion transformer
model (MS-CDT) is proposed for PET tracer separation. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to use texture condition and multi-latent
space for tracer separation in PET imaging. The proposed model integrates
diffusion and transformer architectures into a unified optimization framework,
with the novel addition of texture masks as conditional inputs to enhance image
details. By leveraging multi-latent space prior derived from different tracers,
the model captures multi-level feature representations, aiming to balance
computational efficiency and detail preservation. The texture masks, serving as
conditional guidance, help the model focus on salient structural patterns,
thereby improving the extraction and utilization of fine-grained image
textures. When combined with the diffusion transformer backbone, this
conditioning mechanism contributes to more accurate and robust tracer
separation. To evaluate its effectiveness, the proposed MS-CDT is compared with
several advanced methods on two types of 3D PET datasets: brain and chest
scans. Experimental results indicate that MS-CDT achieved competitive
performance in terms of image quality and preservation of clinically relevant
information. Code is available at: https://github.com/yqx7150/MS-CDT.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposes RTDA, a robust training algorithm with data augmentation, to improve medical image classifier resilience against adversarial attacks and distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks in medical imaging are vulnerable to adversarial attacks and distribution shifts, undermining diagnostic reliability and trust.

Method: Introduces RTDA, benchmarking it against six baseline techniques (including adversarial training and data augmentation) across three imaging technologies (mammograms, X-rays, ultrasound).

Result: RTDA shows superior robustness against adversarial attacks and better generalization under distribution shifts while maintaining high clean accuracy.

Conclusion: RTDA effectively enhances the reliability of medical image classifiers by addressing adversarial and distribution shift vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are increasingly being used to detect and diagnose
medical conditions using medical imaging. Despite their utility, these models
are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks and distribution shifts, which can
affect diagnostic reliability and undermine trust among healthcare
professionals. In this study, we propose a robust training algorithm with data
augmentation (RTDA) to mitigate these vulnerabilities in medical image
classification. We benchmark classifier robustness against adversarial
perturbations and natural variations of RTDA and six competing baseline
techniques, including adversarial training and data augmentation approaches in
isolation and combination, using experimental data sets with three different
imaging technologies (mammograms, X-rays, and ultrasound). We demonstrate that
RTDA achieves superior robustness against adversarial attacks and improved
generalization performance in the presence of distribution shift in each image
classification task while maintaining high clean accuracy.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposes MeDi, a Metadata-guided generative Diffusion model, to mitigate biases in deep learning models for histopathology by augmenting underrepresented subpopulations with synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models in histopathology lack robustness to varying conditions (e.g., staining, demographics), leading to biased predictions due to shortcut learning. Foundation models haven't fully addressed this issue.

Method: Introduces MeDi, a framework that models metadata to generate synthetic data for underrepresented subpopulations, balancing training data and reducing biases.

Result: MeDi generates high-quality histopathology images for unseen subpopulations, improves image fidelity, and enhances downstream classifier performance on datasets with subpopulation shifts.

Conclusion: MeDi is a proof-of-concept for mitigating data biases in histopathology using generative models, demonstrating potential for clinical adaptation.

Abstract: Deep learning models have made significant advances in histological
prediction tasks in recent years. However, for adaptation in clinical practice,
their lack of robustness to varying conditions such as staining, scanner,
hospital, and demographics is still a limiting factor: if trained on
overrepresented subpopulations, models regularly struggle with less frequent
patterns, leading to shortcut learning and biased predictions. Large-scale
foundation models have not fully eliminated this issue. Therefore, we propose a
novel approach explicitly modeling such metadata into a Metadata-guided
generative Diffusion model framework (MeDi). MeDi allows for a targeted
augmentation of underrepresented subpopulations with synthetic data, which
balances limited training data and mitigates biases in downstream models. We
experimentally show that MeDi generates high-quality histopathology images for
unseen subpopulations in TCGA, boosts the overall fidelity of the generated
images, and enables improvements in performance for downstream classifiers on
datasets with subpopulation shifts. Our work is a proof-of-concept towards
better mitigating data biases with generative models.

TL;DR: GAN-generated brain tumor MRI images can augment limited datasets, improving CNN performance, but excessive synthetic data may reduce accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how varying ratios of GAN-generated and real MRI images affect CNN performance in classifying brain tumors.

Method: Used DCGAN to create synthetic images, mixed them with real images at different ratios, and trained a custom CNN. Evaluated performance on a real-world test set.

Result: High sensitivity and precision (95.2% accuracy) with small GAN additions, but performance declined with more synthetic data.

Conclusion: GANs are beneficial for dataset augmentation, but excessive synthetic data can harm generalization to real cases.

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have shown potential in expanding
limited medical imaging datasets. This study explores how different ratios of
GAN-generated and real brain tumor MRI images impact the performance of a CNN
in classifying healthy vs. tumorous scans. A DCGAN was used to create synthetic
images which were mixed with real ones at various ratios to train a custom CNN.
The CNN was then evaluated on a separate real-world test set. Our results
indicate that the model maintains high sensitivity and precision in tumor
classification, even when trained predominantly on synthetic data. When only a
small portion of GAN data was added, such as 900 real images and 100 GAN
images, the model achieved excellent performance, with test accuracy reaching
95.2%, and precision, recall, and F1-score all exceeding 95%. However, as the
proportion of GAN images increased further, performance gradually declined.
This study suggests that while GANs are useful for augmenting limited datasets
especially when real data is scarce, too much synthetic data can introduce
artifacts that affect the model's ability to generalize to real world cases.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an implicit neural representation (INR) framework for estimating Standard Model (SM) parameters in diffusion MRI, outperforming existing methods in accuracy, noise robustness, and spatial upsampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Standard Model (SM) for white matter in dMRI suffers from parameter degeneracies and noise sensitivity, requiring extensive acquisition protocols. The goal is to improve estimation accuracy and robustness.

Method: The proposed method uses implicit neural representations (INRs) with spatial regularization via sinusoidal encoding of input coordinates. It is unsupervised and evaluated on synthetic and in vivo data against cubic polynomials, supervised neural networks, and nonlinear least squares.

Result: The INR method shows superior accuracy, especially in low signal-to-noise conditions, and enables continuous spatial upsampling. It is fast (~6 minutes), robust to noise, and adaptable to varying acquisition protocols.

Conclusion: INRs are a promising tool for dMRI analysis, offering improved parameter estimation, noise robustness, and flexibility for other dMRI models.

Abstract: Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) enables non-invasive
investigation of tissue microstructure. The Standard Model (SM) of white matter
aims to disentangle dMRI signal contributions from intra- and extra-axonal
water compartments. However, due to the model its high-dimensional nature,
extensive acquisition protocols with multiple b-values and diffusion tensor
shapes are typically required to mitigate parameter degeneracies. Even then,
accurate estimation remains challenging due to noise. This work introduces a
novel estimation framework based on implicit neural representations (INRs),
which incorporate spatial regularization through the sinusoidal encoding of the
input coordinates. The INR method is evaluated on both synthetic and in vivo
datasets and compared to parameter estimates using cubic polynomials,
supervised neural networks, and nonlinear least squares. Results demonstrate
superior accuracy of the INR method in estimating SM parameters, particularly
in low signal-to-noise conditions. Additionally, spatial upsampling of the INR
can represent the underlying dataset anatomically plausibly in a continuous
way, which is unattainable with linear or cubic interpolation. The INR is fully
unsupervised, eliminating the need for labeled training data. It achieves fast
inference ($\sim$6 minutes), is robust to both Gaussian and Rician noise,
supports joint estimation of SM kernel parameters and the fiber orientation
distribution function with spherical harmonics orders up to at least 8 and
non-negativity constraints, and accommodates spatially varying acquisition
protocols caused by magnetic gradient non-uniformities. The combination of
these properties along with the possibility to easily adapt the framework to
other dMRI models, positions INRs as a potentially important tool for analyzing
and interpreting diffusion MRI data.

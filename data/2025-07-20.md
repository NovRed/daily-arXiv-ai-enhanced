### [1] [Spatially Grounded Explanations in Vision Language Models for Document Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12490)
*Maximiliano Hormazábal Lagos,Héctor Cerezo-Costas,Dimosthenis Karatzas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EaGERS is a training-free, model-agnostic pipeline for DocVQA that generates rationales, grounds them spatially, and restricts responses to relevant regions, improving accuracy and transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance transparency and reproducibility in DocVQA without requiring additional model fine-tuning.

Method: Generates rationales via a vision-language model, grounds them spatially using embedding similarities, and restricts responses to relevant regions.

Result: Outperforms the base model on accuracy and similarity metrics in DocVQA.

Conclusion: EaGERS improves performance and interpretability in DocVQA without fine-tuning.

Abstract: We introduce EaGERS, a fully training-free and model-agnostic pipeline that
(1) generates natural language rationales via a vision language model, (2)
grounds these rationales to spatial sub-regions by computing multimodal
embedding similarities over a configurable grid with majority voting, and (3)
restricts the generation of responses only from the relevant regions selected
in the masked image. Experiments on the DocVQA dataset demonstrate that our
best configuration not only outperforms the base model on exact match accuracy
and Average Normalized Levenshtein Similarity metrics but also enhances
transparency and reproducibility in DocVQA without additional model
fine-tuning.

### [2] [MindJourney: Test-Time Scaling with World Models for Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12508)
*Yuncong Yang,Jiageng Liu,Zheyuan Zhang,Siyuan Zhou,Reuben Tan,Jianwei Yang,Yilun Du,Chuang Gan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MindJourney enhances VLMs for 3D spatial reasoning by coupling them with a video diffusion-based world model, improving performance by 8% on benchmarks without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs lack 3D dynamics understanding, hindering tasks like egocentric motion anticipation.

Method: Couples VLMs with a controllable world model (video diffusion) for iterative scene exploration and multi-view reasoning.

Result: Achieves an 8% performance boost on the SAT benchmark and outperforms reinforcement learning-trained VLMs.

Conclusion: Pairing VLMs with world models offers a plug-and-play solution for robust 3D reasoning.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in 3D space is central to human cognition and indispensable
for embodied tasks such as navigation and manipulation. However,
state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) struggle frequently with tasks
as simple as anticipating how a scene will look after an egocentric motion:
they perceive 2D images but lack an internal model of 3D dynamics. We therefore
propose MindJourney, a test-time scaling framework that grants a VLM with this
missing capability by coupling it to a controllable world model based on video
diffusion. The VLM iteratively sketches a concise camera trajectory, while the
world model synthesizes the corresponding view at each step. The VLM then
reasons over this multi-view evidence gathered during the interactive
exploration. Without any fine-tuning, our MindJourney achieves over an average
8% performance boost on the representative spatial reasoning benchmark SAT,
showing that pairing VLMs with world models for test-time scaling offers a
simple, plug-and-play route to robust 3D reasoning. Meanwhile, our method also
improves upon the test-time inference VLMs trained through reinforcement
learning, which demonstrates the potential of our method that utilizes world
models for test-time scaling.

*Gen Luo,Wenhan Dou,Wenhao Li,Zhaokai Wang,Xue Yang,Changyao Tian,Hao Li,Weiyun Wang,Wenhai Wang,Xizhou Zhu,Yu Qiao,Jifeng Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mono-InternVL and Mono-InternVL-1.5, monolithic MLLMs addressing unstable optimization and catastrophic forgetting via visual parameter embedding and delta tuning. EViP and EViP++ enhance visual capabilities, achieving competitive performance with reduced costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing monolithic MLLMs face unstable optimization and catastrophic forgetting. The goal is to improve stability and efficiency while maintaining performance.

Method: Embed a visual parameter space into a pre-trained LLM using delta tuning. Introduce Mono-InternVL with a multimodal mixture-of-experts architecture and EViP for progressive learning. Mono-InternVL-1.5 adds visual attention experts and optimizes pre-training.

Result: Mono-InternVL outperforms existing MLLMs on 12/15 benchmarks (e.g., +114-point improvement on OCRBench). Mono-InternVL-1.5 reduces costs while maintaining performance, cutting first-token latency by 69%.

Conclusion: The proposed monolithic MLLMs with EViP/EViP++ achieve competitive performance efficiently, addressing key challenges in multimodal learning.

Abstract: This paper focuses on monolithic Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
which integrate visual encoding and language decoding into a single model.
Existing structures and pre-training strategies for monolithic MLLMs often
suffer from unstable optimization and catastrophic forgetting. To address these
challenges, our key idea is to embed a new visual parameter space into a
pre-trained LLM, enabling stable learning of visual knowledge from noisy data
via delta tuning. Based on this principle, we first introduce Mono-InternVL, an
advanced monolithic MLLM that incorporates a set of visual experts through a
multimodal mixture-of-experts architecture. In addition, we design an
innovative Endogenous Visual Pre-training (EViP) for Mono-InternVL to maximize
its visual capabilities via progressive learning. Mono-InternVL achieves
competitive performance against existing MLLMs but also leads to relatively
expensive data cost. Therefore, we further present Mono-InternVL-1.5, a cheaper
and stronger monolithic MLLM equipped with an improved EViP (EViP++). EViP++
introduces additional visual attention experts to Mono-InternVL-1.5 and
re-organizes the pre-training process in an efficient manner. During inference,
it includes a fused CUDA kernel to speed up its MoE operations. With these
designs, Mono-InternVL-1.5 significantly reduces training and inference costs,
while still maintaining competitive performance with Mono-InternVL. To evaluate
our approach, we conduct extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks. Results
demonstrate that Mono-InternVL outperforms existing monolithic MLLMs on 12 out
of 15 benchmarks, e.g., +114-point improvement over Emu3 on OCRBench. Compared
to its modular counterpart, i.e., InternVL-1.5, Mono-InternVL-1.5 achieves
similar multimodal performance while reducing first-token latency by up to 69%.

### [4] [Best Practices for Large-Scale, Pixel-Wise Crop Mapping and Transfer Learning Workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12590)
*Judy Long,Tao Liu,Sean Alexander Woznicki,Miljana Marković,Oskar Marko,Molly Sears*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper reviews large-scale, pixel-wise crop mapping workflows, comparing supervised methods and transfer learning. It identifies optimal preprocessing and models, emphasizing the role of sample size and domain shift in workflow choice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to identify the best workflows for crop mapping using remote sensing data, addressing the challenges of large-scale classification and domain adaptation.

Method: Systematic experiments compared six preprocessing methods and eleven classification models, alongside evaluating transfer learning techniques for domain shifts. Landsat 8 data and CDL labels were used.

Result: Fine-scale preprocessing with Transformer models performed best. RF was efficient for supervised learning. Transfer learning improved adaptability, with UDA for homogeneous classes and fine-tuning for diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: Workflow choice depends on labeled sample availability. Supervised training excels with sufficient samples, while transfer learning is viable for limited data, matching domain shift levels.

Abstract: Crop mapping involves identifying and classifying crop types using spatial
data, primarily derived from remote sensing imagery. This study presents the
first comprehensive review of large-scale, pixel-wise crop mapping workflows,
encompassing both conventional supervised methods and emerging transfer
learning approaches. To identify the optimal supervised crop mapping workflows,
we conducted systematic experiments, comparing six widely adopted satellite
image-based preprocessing methods, alongside eleven supervised pixel-wise
classification models. Additionally, we assessed the synergistic impact of
varied training sample sizes and variable combinations. Moreover, we identified
optimal transfer learning techniques for different magnitudes of domain shift.
The evaluation of best methods was conducted across five diverse agricultural
sites. Landsat 8 served as the primary satellite data source. Labels come from
CDL trusted pixels and field surveys.
  Our findings reveal three key insights. First, fine-scale interval
preprocessing paired with Transformer models consistently delivered optimal
performance for both supervised and transferable workflows. RF offered rapid
training and competitive performance in conventional supervised learning and
direct transfer to similar domains. Second, transfer learning techniques
enhanced workflow adaptability, with UDA being effective for homogeneous crop
classes while fine-tuning remains robust across diverse scenarios. Finally,
workflow choice depends heavily on the availability of labeled samples. With a
sufficient sample size, supervised training typically delivers more accurate
and generalizable results. Below a certain threshold, transfer learning that
matches the level of domain shift is a viable alternative to achieve crop
mapping. Repository:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CT-ScanGaze, the first public eye-tracking dataset for CT, and CT-Searcher, a 3D scanpath predictor for radiologist-like fixation sequences, pretrained using converted 2D gaze data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding radiologists' eye movements during CT reading is key for interpretable computer-aided diagnosis, but limited by lack of public datasets and 3D complexity.

Method: Developed CT-ScanGaze dataset and CT-Searcher, a 3D scanpath predictor, pretrained using a pipeline converting 2D gaze data to 3D.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative evaluations on CT-ScanGaze show the approach's effectiveness and provide a framework for 3D scanpath prediction.

Conclusion: The work addresses gaps in CT eye-tracking research and offers tools for improving medical imaging analysis.

Abstract: Understanding radiologists' eye movement during Computed Tomography (CT)
reading is crucial for developing effective interpretable computer-aided
diagnosis systems. However, CT research in this area has been limited by the
lack of publicly available eye-tracking datasets and the three-dimensional
complexity of CT volumes. To address these challenges, we present the first
publicly available eye gaze dataset on CT, called CT-ScanGaze. Then, we
introduce CT-Searcher, a novel 3D scanpath predictor designed specifically to
process CT volumes and generate radiologist-like 3D fixation sequences,
overcoming the limitations of current scanpath predictors that only handle 2D
inputs. Since deep learning models benefit from a pretraining step, we develop
a pipeline that converts existing 2D gaze datasets into 3D gaze data to
pretrain CT-Searcher. Through both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on
CT-ScanGaze, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and provide a
comprehensive assessment framework for 3D scanpath prediction in medical
imaging.

### [6] [MS-DGCNN++: A Multi-Scale Fusion Dynamic Graph Neural Network with Biological Knowledge Integration for LiDAR Tree Species Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12602)
*Said Ohamouddou,Abdellatif El Afia,Hanaa El Afia,Raddouane Chiheb*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MS-DGCNN++ improves tree species classification from LiDAR point clouds by hierarchically fusing multi-scale features, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-scale approaches fail to capture semantic relationships in tree structures, limiting classification accuracy.

Method: MS-DGCNN++ uses hierarchical multi-scale fusion with scale-specific feature engineering (local, branch, canopy) and cross-scale propagation.

Result: Achieves 94.96% accuracy on STPCTLS, 67.25% on FOR-species20K, and outperforms DGCNN/MS-DGCNN on ModelNet40/10.

Conclusion: The method is versatile, efficient, and generalizes to 3D object recognition, offering a resource-constrained solution.

Abstract: Tree species classification from terrestrial LiDAR point clouds is
challenging because of the complex multi-scale geometric structures in forest
environments. Existing approaches using multi-scale dynamic graph convolutional
neural networks (MS-DGCNN) employ parallel multi-scale processing, which fails
to capture the semantic relationships between the hierarchical levels of the
tree architecture. We present MS-DGCNN++, a hierarchical multiscale fusion
dynamic graph convolutional network that uses semantically meaningful feature
extraction at local, branch, and canopy scales with cross-scale information
propagation. Our method employs scale-specific feature engineering, including
standard geometric features for the local scale, normalized relative vectors
for the branch scale, and distance information for the canopy scale. This
hierarchical approach replaces uniform parallel processing with semantically
differentiated representations that are aligned with the natural tree
structure. Under the same proposed tree species data augmentation strategy for
all experiments, MS-DGCNN++ achieved an accuracy of 94.96 \% on STPCTLS,
outperforming DGCNN, MS-DGCNN, and the state-of-the-art model PPT. On
FOR-species20K, it achieves 67.25\% accuracy (6.1\% improvement compared to
MS-DGCNN). For standard 3D object recognition, our method outperformed DGCNN
and MS-DGCNN with overall accuracies of 93.15\% on ModelNet40 and 94.05\% on
ModelNet10. With lower parameters and reduced complexity compared to
state-of-the-art transformer approaches, our method is suitable for
resource-constrained applications while maintaining a competitive accuracy.
Beyond tree classification, the method generalizes to standard 3D object
recognition, establishing it as a versatile solution for diverse point cloud
processing applications. The implementation code is publicly available at
https://github.com/said-ohamouddou/MS-DGCNN2.

### [7] [Predicting Soccer Penalty Kick Direction Using Human Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12617)
*David Freire-Obregón,Oliverio J. Santana,Javier Lorenzo-Navarro,Daniel Hernández-Sosa,Modesto Castrillón-Santana*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel soccer penalty kick dataset is introduced for predicting shot direction using pre-kick movements. A deep learning classifier with HAR-based features and metadata achieves 63.9% accuracy, outperforming real goalkeepers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited annotated datasets for real-world sports scenarios hinder action anticipation in HAR. This work addresses this gap by focusing on soccer penalty kicks.

Method: A deep learning classifier integrates HAR-based feature embeddings with contextual metadata. Twenty-two backbone models across seven architecture families are evaluated.

Result: The model achieves 63.9% accuracy in predicting shot direction (left or right), outperforming real goalkeepers.

Conclusion: The dataset is valuable for anticipatory action recognition, and the model shows promise for generalizable sports-based predictive tasks.

Abstract: Action anticipation has become a prominent topic in Human Action Recognition
(HAR). However, its application to real-world sports scenarios remains limited
by the availability of suitable annotated datasets. This work presents a novel
dataset of manually annotated soccer penalty kicks to predict shot direction
based on pre-kick player movements. We propose a deep learning classifier to
benchmark this dataset that integrates HAR-based feature embeddings with
contextual metadata. We evaluate twenty-two backbone models across seven
architecture families (MViTv2, MViTv1, SlowFast, Slow, X3D, I3D, C2D),
achieving up to 63.9% accuracy in predicting shot direction (left or right),
outperforming the real goalkeepers' decisions. These results demonstrate the
dataset's value for anticipatory action recognition and validate our model's
potential as a generalizable approach for sports-based predictive tasks.

### [8] [Funnel-HOI: Top-Down Perception for Zero-Shot HOI Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12628)
*Sandipan Sarma,Agney Talwarr,Arijit Sur*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Funnel-HOI introduces a top-down framework for human-object interaction detection, leveraging object and action cues at the encoder stage with a novel asymmetric co-attention mechanism and loss function, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the long-tail distribution problem in HOID by focusing on encoder-level HOI-specific cues for stronger scene interpretation, inspired by human cognition.

Method: Proposes Funnel-HOI, a top-down framework probing objects first, then actions, using asymmetric co-attention and a novel loss function for better interaction classification.

Result: Achieves up to 12.4% and 8.4% gains for unseen and rare HOI categories on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: Funnel-HOI demonstrates the importance of encoder-level cues and novel loss functions in improving HOID, especially in zero-shot settings.

Abstract: Human-object interaction detection (HOID) refers to localizing interactive
human-object pairs in images and identifying the interactions. Since there
could be an exponential number of object-action combinations, labeled data is
limited - leading to a long-tail distribution problem. Recently, zero-shot
learning emerged as a solution, with end-to-end transformer-based object
detectors adapted for HOID becoming successful frameworks. However, their
primary focus is designing improved decoders for learning entangled or
disentangled interpretations of interactions. We advocate that HOI-specific
cues must be anticipated at the encoder stage itself to obtain a stronger scene
interpretation. Consequently, we build a top-down framework named Funnel-HOI
inspired by the human tendency to grasp well-defined concepts first and then
associate them with abstract concepts during scene understanding. We first
probe an image for the presence of objects (well-defined concepts) and then
probe for actions (abstract concepts) associated with them. A novel asymmetric
co-attention mechanism mines these cues utilizing multimodal information
(incorporating zero-shot capabilities) and yields stronger interaction
representations at the encoder level. Furthermore, a novel loss is devised that
considers objectaction relatedness and regulates misclassification penalty
better than existing loss functions for guiding the interaction classifier.
Extensive experiments on the HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets across
fully-supervised and six zero-shot settings reveal our state-of-the-art
performance, with up to 12.4% and 8.4% gains for unseen and rare HOI
categories, respectively.

### [9] [Reconstruct, Inpaint, Finetune: Dynamic Novel-view Synthesis from Monocular Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12646)
*Kaihua Chen,Tarasha Khurana,Deva Ramanan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CogNVS introduces a novel-view synthesis method for dynamic scenes using monocular videos, combining 3D reconstruction and 2D video diffusion models for superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods either require costly optimization or fail to preserve geometry in feed-forward training. CogNVS addresses these limitations.

Method: Uses 3D scene reconstruction for covisible pixels and 2D video diffusion models (CogNVS) for hidden pixels, trained self-supervised on 2D videos.

Result: Outperforms most prior methods in novel-view synthesis for dynamic scenes.

Conclusion: CogNVS offers a scalable, effective solution for dynamic scene synthesis, leveraging self-supervised training and zero-shot application.

Abstract: We explore novel-view synthesis for dynamic scenes from monocular videos.
Prior approaches rely on costly test-time optimization of 4D representations or
do not preserve scene geometry when trained in a feed-forward manner. Our
approach is based on three key insights: (1) covisible pixels (that are visible
in both the input and target views) can be rendered by first reconstructing the
dynamic 3D scene and rendering the reconstruction from the novel-views and (2)
hidden pixels in novel views can be "inpainted" with feed-forward 2D video
diffusion models. Notably, our video inpainting diffusion model (CogNVS) can be
self-supervised from 2D videos, allowing us to train it on a large corpus of
in-the-wild videos. This in turn allows for (3) CogNVS to be applied zero-shot
to novel test videos via test-time finetuning. We empirically verify that
CogNVS outperforms almost all prior art for novel-view synthesis of dynamic
scenes from monocular videos.

### [10] [Integrated Oculomics and Lipidomics Reveal Microvascular Metabolic Signatures Associated with Cardiovascular Health in a Healthy Cohort](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12663)
*Inamullah,Ernesto Elias Vidal Rosas,Imran Razzak,Shoaib Jameel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study integrates retinal microvasculature and serum lipidomic data to identify early CVD biomarkers, revealing strong correlations between vascular traits and lipid subclasses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CVD risk stratification lacks early detection methods. This study aims to bridge the gap by combining retinal imaging and lipidomics for better biomarker identification.

Method: Used deep learning for retinal image analysis and UHPLC ESI HRMS for lipid profiling in a healthy population, adjusting for covariates.

Result: Found age- and sex-independent correlations between retinal traits (artery width, vessel density) and lipid subclasses (TAGs, DAGs, Cers).

Conclusion: The study provides novel insights into early CVD pathogenesis and potential non-invasive biomarkers for improved detection and prevention.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading global cause of mortality,
yet current risk stratification methods often fail to detect early, subclinical
changes. Previous studies have generally not integrated retinal
microvasculature characteristics with comprehensive serum lipidomic profiles as
potential indicators of CVD risk. In this study, an innovative imaging omics
framework was introduced, combining retinal microvascular traits derived
through deep learning based image processing with serum lipidomic data to
highlight asymptomatic biomarkers of cardiovascular risk beyond the
conventional lipid panel. This represents the first large scale, covariate
adjusted and stratified correlation analysis conducted in a healthy population,
which is essential for identifying early indicators of disease. Retinal
phenotypes were quantified using automated image analysis tools, while serum
lipid profiling was performed by Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography
Electrospray ionization High resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC ESI HRMS).
Strong, age- and sex-independent correlations were established, particularly
between average artery width, vessel density, and lipid subclasses such as
triacylglycerols (TAGs), diacylglycerols (DAGs), and ceramides (Cers). These
associations suggest a converging mechanism of microvascular remodeling under
metabolic stress. By linking detailed
  vascular structural phenotypes to specific lipid species, this study fills a
critical gap in the understanding of early CVD pathogenesis. This integration
not only offers a novel perspective on microvascular metabolic associations but
also presents a significant opportunity for the identification of robust,
non-invasive biomarkers. Ultimately, these findings may support improved early
detection, targeted prevention, and personalized approaches in cardiovascular
healthcare.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of achieving high accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency for real-time structural defect segmentation in civil infrastructure.

Method: FORTRESS combines depthwise separable convolutions with adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold Network integration, featuring parameter reduction, adaptive function composition, and multi-scale attention fusion.

Result: Achieves 91% parameter reduction, 91% computational complexity reduction, 3x inference speed improvement, and state-of-the-art performance (F1-score: 0.771, mean IoU: 0.677).

Conclusion: FORTRESS is a robust solution for practical structural defect segmentation, excelling in both accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Automated structural defect segmentation in civil infrastructure faces a
critical challenge: achieving high accuracy while maintaining computational
efficiency for real-time deployment. This paper presents FORTRESS
(Function-composition Optimized Real-Time Resilient Structural Segmentation), a
new architecture that balances accuracy and speed by using a special method
that combines depthwise separable convolutions with adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold
Network integration. FORTRESS incorporates three key innovations: a systematic
depthwise separable convolution framework achieving a 3.6x parameter reduction
per layer, adaptive TiKAN integration that selectively applies function
composition transformations only when computationally beneficial, and
multi-scale attention fusion combining spatial, channel, and KAN-enhanced
features across decoder levels. The architecture achieves remarkable efficiency
gains with 91% parameter reduction (31M to 2.9M), 91% computational complexity
reduction (13.7 to 1.17 GFLOPs), and 3x inference speed improvement while
delivering superior segmentation performance. Evaluation on benchmark
infrastructure datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art results with an F1- score
of 0.771 and a mean IoU of 0.677, significantly outperforming existing methods
including U-Net, SA-UNet, and U- KAN. The dual optimization strategy proves
essential for optimal performance, establishing FORTRESS as a robust solution
for practical structural defect segmentation in resource-constrained
environments where both accuracy and computational efficiency are paramount.

*Yang Yang,Dongni Mao,Hiroaki Santo,Yasuyuki Matsushita,Fumio Okura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeuraLeaf is a neural parametric model for 3D leaves, addressing challenges in plant modeling by disentangling geometry into 2D base shapes and 3D deformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Plant leaves' diverse shapes and flexible deformation pose unique challenges, unlike humans or animals, requiring specialized modeling.

Method: NeuraLeaf uses 2D leaf datasets for base shapes and a skeleton-free skinning model for 3D deformations, supported by the DeformLeaf dataset.

Result: NeuraLeaf accurately generates diverse leaf shapes and fits 3D observations like depth maps and point clouds.

Conclusion: NeuraLeaf effectively models 3D leaves, leveraging 2D data and novel deformation techniques, with potential applications in agriculture and graphics.

Abstract: We develop a neural parametric model for 3D leaves for plant modeling and
reconstruction that are essential for agriculture and computer graphics. While
neural parametric models are actively studied for humans and animals, plant
leaves present unique challenges due to their diverse shapes and flexible
deformation. To this problem, we introduce a neural parametric model for
leaves, NeuraLeaf. Capitalizing on the fact that flattened leaf shapes can be
approximated as a 2D plane, NeuraLeaf disentangles the leaves' geometry into
their 2D base shapes and 3D deformations. This representation allows learning
from rich sources of 2D leaf image datasets for the base shapes, and also has
the advantage of simultaneously learning textures aligned with the geometry. To
model the 3D deformation, we propose a novel skeleton-free skinning model and
create a newly captured 3D leaf dataset called DeformLeaf. We show that
NeuraLeaf successfully generates a wide range of leaf shapes with deformation,
resulting in accurate model fitting to 3D observations like depth maps and
point clouds. Our implementation and dataset are available at

provide higher-resolution feature maps for better small object detection, and
employs Soft-NMS to refine confidence scores and retain true positives.
Experimental results demonstrate that SOD-YOLO significantly improves detection
performance, achieving a 36.1% increase in mAP$_{50:95}$ and 20.6% increase in
mAP$_{50}$ on the VisDrone2019-DET dataset compared to the baseline model.
These enhancements make SOD-YOLO a practical and efficient solution for small
object detection in UAV imagery. Our source code, hyper-parameters, and model
weights are available at https://github.com/iamwangxiaobai/SOD-YOLO.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A privacy-preserving semantic-segmentation method using perceptual encryption for training and test images, achieving near-original accuracy via domain adaptation on Vision Transformer (ViT) embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance privacy in semantic segmentation by encrypting images while maintaining high accuracy.

Method: Uses perceptual encryption on images and domain adaptation on ViT embeddings, tested with Segmentation Transformer.

Result: Achieves almost the same accuracy as non-encrypted models, confirmed experimentally.

Conclusion: The method effectively balances privacy and accuracy in semantic segmentation.

Abstract: We propose a privacy-preserving semantic-segmentation method for applying

the accuracy of semantic segmentation when using a powerful
semantic-segmentation model with ViT called Segmentation Transformer.

TL;DR: HairShifter introduces a novel framework for video-based hair transfer, combining image hair transfer with animation for temporal consistency and spatial fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video-based hair transfer is challenging due to temporal consistency and spatial fidelity requirements, motivating the need for a unified solution.

Method: HairShifter uses an 'Anchor Frame + Animation' framework with an Image Hair Transfer module and Multi-Scale Gated SPADE Decoder for seamless blending.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance in video hairstyle transfer, ensuring visual quality and temporal coherence.

Conclusion: HairShifter sets a robust baseline for video hairstyle transfer and opens new research avenues.

Abstract: Hair transfer is increasingly valuable across domains such as social media,
gaming, advertising, and entertainment. While significant progress has been
made in single-image hair transfer, video-based hair transfer remains
challenging due to the need for temporal consistency, spatial fidelity, and
dynamic adaptability. In this work, we propose HairShifter, a novel "Anchor
Frame + Animation" framework that unifies high-quality image hair transfer with
smooth and coherent video animation. At its core, HairShifter integrates a
Image Hair Transfer (IHT) module for precise per-frame transformation and a
Multi-Scale Gated SPADE Decoder to ensure seamless spatial blending and
temporal coherence. Our method maintains hairstyle fidelity across frames while
preserving non-hair regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HairShifter
achieves state-of-the-art performance in video hairstyle transfer, combining
superior visual quality, temporal consistency, and scalability. The code will
be publicly available. We believe this work will open new avenues for
video-based hairstyle transfer and establish a robust baseline in this field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of pixel-based methods in handling morphological complexity and feature conflicts in Unified Medical Image Segmentation (UMIS).

Method: Proposes Mamba Snake, using hierarchical state space atlas and Mamba Evolution Block (MEB) for adaptive refinement, with energy map priors and dual-classification synergy.

Result: Achieves 3% average Dice improvement over state-of-the-art methods across five clinical datasets.

Conclusion: Mamba Snake effectively addresses UMIS challenges, offering robust segmentation of complex anatomical structures.

Abstract: Unified Medical Image Segmentation (UMIS) is critical for comprehensive
anatomical assessment but faces challenges due to multi-scale structural
heterogeneity. Conventional pixel-based approaches, lacking object-level
anatomical insight and inter-organ relational modeling, struggle with
morphological complexity and feature conflicts, limiting their efficacy in
UMIS. We propose Mamba Snake, a novel deep snake framework enhanced by state
space modeling for UMIS. Mamba Snake frames multi-contour evolution as a
hierarchical state space atlas, effectively modeling macroscopic inter-organ
topological relationships and microscopic contour refinements. We introduce a
snake-specific vision state space module, the Mamba Evolution Block (MEB),
which leverages effective spatiotemporal information aggregation for adaptive
refinement of complex morphologies. Energy map shape priors further ensure
robust long-range contour evolution in heterogeneous data. Additionally, a
dual-classification synergy mechanism is incorporated to concurrently optimize
detection and segmentation, mitigating under-segmentation of microstructures in
UMIS. Extensive evaluations across five clinical datasets reveal Mamba Snake's
superior performance, with an average Dice improvement of 3\% over
state-of-the-art methods.

*Hanlei Shi,Leyuan Qu,Yu Liu,Di Gao,Yuhua Zheng,Taihao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Think-Before-Draw framework for emotional talking-head generation, improving expressiveness by parsing emotions into facial muscle movements and optimizing micro-expressions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-driven methods oversimplify emotions with predefined labels, lacking natural expressiveness. The study aims to enhance human-computer interaction through more dynamic and realistic emotional generation.

Method: The Think-Before-Draw framework uses Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to transform emotion labels into facial muscle descriptions and employs a progressive guidance denoising strategy for fine-grained expressiveness.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like MEAD and HDTF and demonstrates zero-shot generation capability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances emotional talking-head generation by bridging high-level semantics with detailed facial dynamics, enabling more natural and expressive results.

Abstract: Emotional talking-head generation has emerged as a pivotal research area at
the intersection of computer vision and multimodal artificial intelligence,
with its core value lying in enhancing human-computer interaction through
immersive and empathetic engagement.With the advancement of multimodal large
language models, the driving signals for emotional talking-head generation has
shifted from audio and video to more flexible text. However, current
text-driven methods rely on predefined discrete emotion label texts,
oversimplifying the dynamic complexity of real facial muscle movements and thus
failing to achieve natural emotional expressiveness.This study proposes the
Think-Before-Draw framework to address two key challenges: (1) In-depth
semantic parsing of emotions--by innovatively introducing Chain-of-Thought
(CoT), abstract emotion labels are transformed into physiologically grounded
facial muscle movement descriptions, enabling the mapping from high-level
semantics to actionable motion features; and (2) Fine-grained expressiveness
optimization--inspired by artists' portrait painting process, a progressive
guidance denoising strategy is proposed, employing a "global emotion
localization--local muscle control" mechanism to refine micro-expression
dynamics in generated videos.Our experiments demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on widely-used benchmarks, including MEAD
and HDTF. Additionally, we collected a set of portrait images to evaluate our
model's zero-shot generation capability.

TL;DR: A framework combining generative scene augmentation and adaptive temporal reasoning improves traffic accident anticipation by addressing data scarcity and missing cues, validated on new and public datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for reliable accident anticipation in autonomous driving is hindered by limited training data and missing object-level cues due to environmental or sensor issues.

Method: Proposes a video generation pipeline for diverse driving scenarios and a dynamic prediction model with graph convolutions and temporal operators to handle incomplete data.

Result: Enhances accuracy and lead time in accident anticipation, validated on datasets.

Conclusion: The framework robustly addresses data and modeling gaps in autonomous driving safety.

Abstract: Reliable anticipation of traffic accidents is essential for advancing
autonomous driving systems. However, this objective is limited by two
fundamental challenges: the scarcity of diverse, high-quality training data and
the frequent absence of crucial object-level cues due to environmental
disruptions or sensor deficiencies. To tackle these issues, we propose a
comprehensive framework combining generative scene augmentation with adaptive
temporal reasoning. Specifically, we develop a video generation pipeline that
utilizes a world model guided by domain-informed prompts to create
high-resolution, statistically consistent driving scenarios, particularly
enriching the coverage of edge cases and complex interactions. In parallel, we
construct a dynamic prediction model that encodes spatio-temporal relationships
through strengthened graph convolutions and dilated temporal operators,
effectively addressing data incompleteness and transient visual noise.
Furthermore, we release a new benchmark dataset designed to better capture
diverse real-world driving risks. Extensive experiments on public and newly
released datasets confirm that our framework enhances both the accuracy and
lead time of accident anticipation, offering a robust solution to current data
and modeling limitations in safety-critical autonomous driving applications.

Result: Achieved 81.9% tracking success on a shark dataset (5,200 frames) and 82.9% target coverage during UAV handoffs.

Conclusion: The system is viable for extended marine tracking and scalable autonomous monitoring.

Abstract: This paper introduces an autonomous UAV vision system for continuous,
real-time tracking of marine animals, specifically sharks, in dynamic marine
environments. The system integrates an onboard computer with a stabilised RGB-D
camera and a custom-trained OSTrack pipeline, enabling visual identification
under challenging lighting, occlusion, and sea-state conditions. A key
innovation is the inter-UAV handoff protocol, which enables seamless transfer
of tracking responsibilities between drones, extending operational coverage

TL;DR: The paper introduces ATARA and AnyPos to address limitations of VLA models, improving scalability and efficiency in task-agnostic action paradigms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models rely heavily on task-specific human demonstrations, limiting generalization and increasing data costs.

Method: Proposes ATARA for scalable self-supervised data collection and AnyPos, an inverse dynamics model with Arm-Decoupled Estimation and Direction-Aware Decoder.

Result: The pipeline improves test accuracy by 51% and achieves 30-40% higher success rates in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The ATARA-AnyPos framework enhances scalability and performance in task-agnostic action paradigms.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise on task-conditioned
control in complex settings such as bimanual manipulation. However, the heavy
reliance on task-specific human demonstrations limits their generalization and
incurs high data acquisition costs. In this work, we present a new notion of
task-agnostic action paradigm that decouples action execution from
task-specific conditioning, enhancing scalability, efficiency, and
cost-effectiveness. To address the data collection challenges posed by this
paradigm -- such as low coverage density, behavioral redundancy, and safety
risks -- we introduce ATARA (Automated Task-Agnostic Random Actions), a
scalable self-supervised framework that accelerates collection by over $
30\times $ compared to human teleoperation. To further enable effective
learning from task-agnostic data, which often suffers from distribution
mismatch and irrelevant trajectories, we propose AnyPos, an inverse dynamics
model equipped with Arm-Decoupled Estimation and a Direction-Aware Decoder
(DAD). We additionally integrate a video-conditioned action validation module
to verify the feasibility of learned policies across diverse manipulation
tasks. Extensive experiments show that the AnyPos-ATARA pipeline yields a 51%
improvement in test accuracy and achieves 30-40% higher success rates in
downstream tasks such as lifting, pick-and-place, and clicking, using
replay-based video validation. Project Page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReToM improves efficiency in Stable Diffusion by merging tokens locally, preserving salient features while reducing computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic complexity of attention operations in Stable Diffusion makes generation time-consuming. Existing token merging methods overlook model-specific needs, limiting effectiveness.

Method: ReToM merges tokens using local windows and representative tokens, adjusting window sizes and selecting tokens with highest similarity.

Result: ReToM improves FID by 6.2% and CLIP scores over baseline, maintaining comparable inference time.

Conclusion: ReToM effectively balances visual quality and computational efficiency in image generation.

Abstract: Stable diffusion is an outstanding image generation model for text-to-image,
but its time-consuming generation process remains a challenge due to the
quadratic complexity of attention operations. Recent token merging methods
improve efficiency by reducing the number of tokens during attention
operations, but often overlook the characteristics of attention-based image
generation models, limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose
local representative token guided merging (ReToM), a novel token merging
strategy applicable to any attention mechanism in image generation. To merge
tokens based on various contextual information, ReToM defines local boundaries
as windows within attention inputs and adjusts window sizes. Furthermore, we
introduce a representative token, which represents the most representative
token per window by computing similarity at a specific timestep and selecting
the token with the highest average similarity. This approach preserves the most
salient local features while minimizing computational overhead. Experimental
results show that ReToM achieves a 6.2% improvement in FID and higher CLIP
scores compared to the baseline, while maintaining comparable inference time.
We empirically demonstrate that ReToM is effective in balancing visual quality
and computational efficiency.

Motivation: To integrate transformer blocks into compact neural architectures for computer vision efficiently, reducing FLOPs without sacrificing performance.

Method: KCR-Transformer performs input/output channel selection in MLP layers of transformer blocks, guided by a novel theoretical generalization bound.

Result: KCR-Transformer reduces FLOPs and parameters while maintaining or improving accuracy, achieving superior performance on various vision tasks.

Conclusion: KCR-Transformer is a theoretically grounded, efficient solution for vision transformers, compatible with popular models like ViT and Swin.

Abstract: Self-attention and transformer architectures have become foundational
components in modern deep learning. Recent efforts have integrated transformer
blocks into compact neural architectures for computer vision, giving rise to
various efficient vision transformers. In this work, we introduce Transformer
with Kernel Complexity Reduction, or KCR-Transformer, a compact transformer
block equipped with differentiable channel selection, guided by a novel and
sharp theoretical generalization bound. KCR-Transformer performs input/output
channel selection in the MLP layers of transformer blocks to reduce the
computational cost. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis
establishing a tight generalization bound for networks equipped with
KCR-Transformer blocks. Leveraging such strong theoretical results, the channel
pruning by KCR-Transformer is conducted in a generalization-aware manner,
ensuring that the resulting network retains a provably small generalization
error. Our KCR-Transformer is compatible with many popular and compact
transformer networks, such as ViT and Swin, and it reduces the FLOPs of the
vision transformers while maintaining or even improving the prediction
accuracy. In the experiments, we replace all the transformer blocks in the
vision transformers with KCR-Transformer blocks, leading to KCR-Transformer
networks with different backbones. The resulting TCR-Transformers achieve
superior performance on various computer vision tasks, achieving even better
performance than the original models with even less FLOPs and parameters.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SVM-City, a multidomain outdoor scene understanding dataset, and City-VLM, an LVLM for multimodal fusion, outperforming existing models by 18.14%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing LVLMs in outdoor large-scale scene understanding, such as single-view indoor focus and poor 2D-3D integration.

Method: Build SVM-City dataset with multi-scale, multi-view, multimodal data. Introduce incomplete multimodal learning and City-VLM for fusion via joint probabilistic distribution.

Result: City-VLM surpasses existing LVLMs by 18.14% in QA tasks and shows strong generalization across outdoor scenes.

Conclusion: SVM-City and City-VLM effectively address outdoor scene understanding challenges, offering improved performance and practicality.

Abstract: Scene understanding enables intelligent agents to interpret and comprehend
their environment. While existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) for
scene understanding have primarily focused on indoor household tasks, they face
two significant limitations when applied to outdoor large-scale scene
understanding. First, outdoor scenarios typically encompass larger-scale
environments observed through various sensors from multiple viewpoints (e.g.,
bird view and terrestrial view), while existing indoor LVLMs mainly analyze
single visual modalities within building-scale contexts from humanoid
viewpoints. Second, existing LVLMs suffer from missing multidomain perception
outdoor data and struggle to effectively integrate 2D and 3D visual
information. To address the aforementioned limitations, we build the first
multidomain perception outdoor scene understanding dataset, named
\textbf{\underline{SVM-City}}, deriving from multi\textbf{\underline{S}}cale
scenarios with multi\textbf{\underline{V}}iew and
multi\textbf{\underline{M}}odal instruction tuning data. It contains $420$k
images and $4, 811$M point clouds with $567$k question-answering pairs from
vehicles, low-altitude drones, high-altitude aerial planes, and satellite. To
effectively fuse the multimodal data in the absence of one modality, we
introduce incomplete multimodal learning to model outdoor scene understanding
and design the LVLM named \textbf{\underline{City-VLM}}. Multimodal fusion is
realized by constructing a joint probabilistic distribution space rather than
implementing directly explicit fusion operations (e.g., concatenation).
Experimental results on three typical outdoor scene understanding tasks show
City-VLM achieves $18.14 \%$ performance surpassing existing LVLMs in
question-answering tasks averagely. Our method demonstrates pragmatic and
generalization performance across multiple outdoor scenes.

Motivation: Existing document quality assessment methods lack accuracy and robustness, limiting practical use. MLLMs show promise in image quality assessment, motivating their adaptation to documents.

Method: DeQA-Doc leverages MLLMs' visual language capabilities and a soft label strategy for continuous score regression. It relaxes resolution constraints and uses ensemble methods for performance enhancement.

Result: DeQA-Doc significantly outperforms baselines, providing accurate and generalizable quality scores across diverse document degradation types.

Conclusion: DeQA-Doc successfully extends MLLM-based quality assessment to documents, offering a robust solution with superior performance.

Abstract: Document quality assessment is critical for a wide range of applications
including document digitization, OCR, and archival. However, existing
approaches often struggle to provide accurate and robust quality scores,
limiting their applicability in practical scenarios. With the rapid progress in
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), recent MLLM-based methods have
achieved remarkable performance in image quality assessment. In this work, we
extend this success to the document domain by adapting DeQA-Score, a
state-of-the-art MLLM-based image quality scorer, for document quality
assessment. We propose DeQA-Doc, a framework that leverages the visual language
capabilities of MLLMs and a soft label strategy to regress continuous document
quality scores. To adapt DeQA-Score to DeQA-Doc, we adopt two complementary
solutions to construct soft labels without the variance information. Also, we
relax the resolution constrains to support the large resolution of document
images. Finally, we introduce ensemble methods to further enhance the
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeQA-Doc significantly
outperforms existing baselines, offering accurate and generalizable document
quality assessment across diverse degradation types. Codes and model weights

*Yufei Peng,Yonggang Zhang,Yiu-ming Cheung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Sage, a method for long-tailed visual recognition that integrates semantic guidance from text into visual fine-tuning and addresses prediction bias with a novel compensation factor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-tailed learning suffers from degraded performance in less frequent classes due to uneven class-wise sample sizes. Foundation models offer potential but existing methods overlook visual-textual alignment.

Method: Sage introduces an SG-Adapter to incorporate class descriptions as semantic guidance into visual fine-tuning and a distribution mismatch-aware compensation factor to address prediction bias.

Result: Experiments show Sage effectively enhances performance in long-tailed learning by improving alignment and reducing bias.

Conclusion: Sage successfully leverages semantic guidance and addresses distribution mismatch, improving long-tailed visual recognition.

Abstract: The variance in class-wise sample sizes within long-tailed scenarios often
results in degraded performance in less frequent classes. Fortunately,
foundation models, pre-trained on vast open-world datasets, demonstrate strong
potential for this task due to their generalizable representation, which
promotes the development of adaptive strategies on pre-trained models in
long-tailed learning. Advanced fine-tuning methods typically adjust visual
encoders while neglecting the semantics derived from the frozen text encoder,
overlooking the visual and textual alignment. To strengthen this alignment, we
propose a novel approach, Semantic-guided fine-tuning of foundation model for
long-tailed visual recognition (Sage), which incorporates semantic guidance
derived from textual modality into the visual fine-tuning process.
Specifically, we introduce an SG-Adapter that integrates class descriptions as
semantic guidance to guide the fine-tuning of the visual encoder. The
introduced guidance is passesed through the attention mechanism and enables the
model to focus more on semantically relevant content, strengthening the
alignment between the visual and textual modalities. Due to the inconsistent
class-conditional distributions neglected by the existing loss function, the
resulting prediction bias causes performance improvements for the tail class
less than for the head class, even when the multi-modal alignment is enhanced.
To address this challenge, we propose a novel distribution mismatch-aware
compensation factor, which is specifically designed to rectify the prediction
bias caused by the ignored inconsistent distribution based on our theoretical
analysis, and is seamlessly integrated into the loss function. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
Sage in enhancing performance in long-tailed learning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FIQ, a method for video question answering (VQA) that generates Q&A pairs from video descriptions to improve model reasoning and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQA methods rely on event-centric Q&A pairs, lacking broader context like object types and spatial layouts, which limits generalization and reasoning.

Method: FIQ generates Q&A pairs from video descriptions and integrates a VQ-CAlign module to align question embeddings with visual features.

Result: FIQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on SUTD-TrafficQA, outperforming baseline methods.

Conclusion: FIQ enhances VQA by enriching training data with fundamental scene information, improving reasoning and adaptability.

Abstract: Video question answering (VQA) is a multimodal task that requires the
interpretation of a video to answer a given question. Existing VQA methods
primarily utilize question and answer (Q&A) pairs to learn the spatio-temporal
characteristics of video content. However, these annotations are typically
event-centric, which is not enough to capture the broader context of each
video. The absence of essential details such as object types, spatial layouts,
and descriptive attributes restricts the model to learning only a fragmented
scene representation. This issue limits the model's capacity for generalization
and higher-level reasoning. In this paper, we propose a fundamental question
generation with the integration of question embeddings for video question
answering (FIQ), a novel approach designed to strengthen the reasoning ability
of the model by enhancing the fundamental understanding of videos. FIQ
generates Q&A pairs based on descriptions extracted from videos, enriching the
training data with fundamental scene information. Generated Q&A pairs enable
the model to understand the primary context, leading to enhanced
generalizability and reasoning ability. Furthermore, we incorporate a VQ-CAlign
module that assists task-specific question embeddings with visual features,
ensuring that essential domain-specific details are preserved to increase the
adaptability of downstream tasks. Experiments on SUTD-TrafficQA demonstrate
that our FIQ achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing
baseline methods.

### [30] [MCoT-RE: Multi-Faceted Chain-of-Thought and Re-Ranking for Training-Free Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12819)
*Jeong-Woo Park,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCoT-RE is a training-free zero-shot CIR framework using multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought and re-ranking to improve retrieval by balancing modifications and visual context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot CIR methods either lose information in sequential processing or ignore visual context, limiting performance.

Method: MCoT-RE generates two captions (modification-focused and context-integrated), filters candidates, and performs multi-grained re-ranking.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results, improving Recall@10 by 6.24% on FashionIQ and Recall@1 by 8.58% on CIRR.

Conclusion: MCoT-RE effectively balances textual modifications and visual context, enhancing retrieval accuracy without training.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is the task of retrieving a target image from
a gallery using a composed query consisting of a reference image and a
modification text. Among various CIR approaches, training-free zero-shot
methods based on pre-trained models are cost-effective but still face notable
limitations. For example, sequential VLM-LLM pipelines process each modality
independently, which often results in information loss and limits cross-modal
interaction. In contrast, methods based on multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) often focus exclusively on applying changes indicated by the text,
without fully utilizing the contextual visual information from the reference
image. To address these issues, we propose multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought with
re-ranking (MCoT-RE), a training-free zero-shot CIR framework. MCoT-RE utilizes
multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought to guide the MLLM to balance explicit
modifications and contextual visual cues, generating two distinct captions: one
focused on modification and the other integrating comprehensive visual-textual
context. The first caption is used to filter candidate images. Subsequently, we
combine these two captions and the reference image to perform multi-grained
re-ranking. This two-stage approach facilitates precise retrieval by aligning
with the textual modification instructions while preserving the visual context
of the reference image. Through extensive experiments, MCoT-RE achieves
state-of-the-art results among training-free methods, yielding improvements of
up to 6.24% in Recall@10 on FashionIQ and 8.58% in Recall@1 on CIRR.

### [31] [FAR-Net: Multi-Stage Fusion Network with Enhanced Semantic Alignment and Adaptive Reconciliation for Composed Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12823)
*Jeong-Woo Park,Young-Eun Kim,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FAR-Net is a multi-stage fusion framework for composed image retrieval (CIR) that combines enhanced semantic alignment and adaptive reconciliation to improve performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CIR methods either overly focus on textual details (early fusion) or struggle with fine-grained alignments (late fusion), limiting their effectiveness.

Method: FAR-Net integrates two modules: ESAM (late fusion with cross-attention for fine-grained alignments) and ARM (early fusion with uncertainty embeddings for robustness).

Result: FAR-Net improves Recall@1 by up to 2.4% and Recall@50 by 1.04% on CIRR and FashionIQ datasets.

Conclusion: FAR-Net offers a robust and scalable solution for CIR tasks by effectively balancing visual and textual fusion.

Abstract: Composed image retrieval (CIR) is a vision language task that retrieves a
target image using a reference image and modification text, enabling intuitive
specification of desired changes. While effectively fusing visual and textual
modalities is crucial, existing methods typically adopt either early or late
fusion. Early fusion tends to excessively focus on explicitly mentioned textual
details and neglect visual context, whereas late fusion struggles to capture
fine-grained semantic alignments between image regions and textual tokens. To
address these issues, we propose FAR-Net, a multi-stage fusion framework
designed with enhanced semantic alignment and adaptive reconciliation,
integrating two complementary modules. The enhanced semantic alignment module
(ESAM) employs late fusion with cross-attention to capture fine-grained
semantic relationships, while the adaptive reconciliation module (ARM) applies
early fusion with uncertainty embeddings to enhance robustness and
adaptability. Experiments on CIRR and FashionIQ show consistent performance
gains, improving Recall@1 by up to 2.4% and Recall@50 by 1.04% over existing
state-of-the-art methods, empirically demonstrating that FAR Net provides a
robust and scalable solution to CIR tasks.

Conclusion: FE-TResNet is effective and superior for fine-grained food image classification.

Abstract: Food is not only a core component of humans' daily diets, but also an
important carrier of cultural heritage and emotional bonds. With the
development of technology, the need for accurate classification of food images
has grown, which is crucial for a variety of application scenarios. However,
existing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) face significant challenges when

detail. To address this challenge, this study presents an innovative method for
classifying food images, named Feature-Enhanced TResNet (FE-TResNet),
specifically designed to address fine-grained food images and accurately
capture subtle features within them. The FE-TResNet method is based on the
TResNet model and integrates Style-based Recalibration Module (StyleRM) and
Deep Channel-wise Attention (DCA) technologies to enhance feature extraction
capabilities. In experimental validation on Chinese food image datasets
ChineseFoodNet and CNFOOD-241, the FE-TResNet method significantly improved
classification accuracy, achieving rates of 81.37% and 80.29%, respectively,
demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority in fine-grained food image
classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the unreliability of detection and appearance-based association in SMOT due to small target sizes, the paper leverages temporal information to enhance tracking accuracy.

Method: The SMOT4SB dataset (211 UAV sequences, 108,192 frames) is introduced, alongside the SO-HOTA metric (combining Dot Distance with HOTA) and a competitive challenge (MVA2025).

Result: The winning method in the challenge achieved a 5.1x improvement over the baseline, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: This work advances SMOT for UAV applications, benefiting fields like bird strike avoidance, agriculture, and ecological monitoring.

Abstract: Small Multi-Object Tracking (SMOT) is particularly challenging when targets
occupy only a few dozen pixels, rendering detection and appearance-based
association unreliable. Building on the success of the MVA2023 SOD4SB
challenge, this paper introduces the SMOT4SB challenge, which leverages
temporal information to address limitations of single-frame detection. Our
three main contributions are: (1) the SMOT4SB dataset, consisting of 211 UAV
video sequences with 108,192 annotated frames under diverse real-world
conditions, designed to capture motion entanglement where both camera and
targets move freely in 3D; (2) SO-HOTA, a novel metric combining Dot Distance
with HOTA to mitigate the sensitivity of IoU-based metrics to small
displacements; and (3) a competitive MVA2025 challenge with 78 participants and
308 submissions, where the winning method achieved a 5.1x improvement over the
baseline. This work lays a foundation for advancing SMOT in UAV scenarios with
applications in bird strike avoidance, agriculture, fisheries, and ecological
monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The AnyCap Project introduces a plug-and-play framework (ACM) for controllable captioning, a dataset (ACD), and a benchmark (AnyCapEval) to improve fine-grained control and evaluation in multimodal captioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models lack fine-grained control and reliable evaluation for controllable captioning, necessitating an integrated solution.

Method: ACM enhances existing foundation models without retraining, leveraging user instructions and modality features. ACD provides diverse data, and AnyCapEval offers decoupled evaluation metrics.

Result: ACM improves caption quality significantly, e.g., boosting GPT-4o's content scores by 45% and style scores by 12%, and performs well on other benchmarks.

Conclusion: The AnyCap Project successfully addresses gaps in controllable captioning through its model, dataset, and evaluation framework, demonstrating notable improvements.

Abstract: Controllable captioning is essential for precise multimodal alignment and
instruction following, yet existing models often lack fine-grained control and
reliable evaluation protocols. To address this gap, we present the AnyCap
Project, an integrated solution spanning model, dataset, and evaluation. We
introduce AnyCapModel (ACM), a lightweight plug-and-play framework that
enhances the controllability of existing foundation models for omni-modal
captioning without retraining the base model. ACM reuses the original captions
from base models while incorporating user instructions and modality features to
generate improved captions. To remedy the data scarcity in controllable
multimodal captioning, we build AnyCapDataset (ACD), covering three modalities,
28 user-instruction types, and 300\,k high-quality data entries. We further
propose AnyCapEval, a new benchmark that provides more reliable evaluation
metrics for controllable captioning by decoupling content accuracy and
stylistic fidelity. ACM markedly improves caption quality across a diverse set
of base models on AnyCapEval. Notably, ACM-8B raises GPT-4o\'s content scores
by 45\% and style scores by 12\%, and it also achieves substantial gains on
widely used benchmarks such as MIA-Bench and VidCapBench.

Motivation: Image captioning aids in interpreting complex satellite imagery for applications like environmental monitoring and disaster assessment.

Method: Proposes a transformer-based architecture with Static Expansion, Memory-Augmented Self-Attention, and Mesh Transformer, evaluated on UCM-Caption and NWPU-Caption datasets.

Result: The best model outperforms state-of-the-art systems on most evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed model shows potential for real-life remote sensing image systems.

Abstract: Image captioning has emerged as a crucial task in the intersection of
computer vision and natural language processing, enabling automated generation
of descriptive text from visual content. In the context of remote sensing,
image captioning plays a significant role in interpreting vast and complex
satellite imagery, aiding applications such as environmental monitoring,

*Ziyi Wang,Zhi Gao,Jin Chen,Qingjie Zhao,Xinxiao Wu,Jiebo Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes SRE, an attention-refocusing scheme for domain generalization (DG) using CLIP, to align attention maps and reduce domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP struggles with focusing on domain-invariant regions, leading to suboptimal performance in DG tasks.

Method: SRE simulates domain shifts via augmentation, refocuses attention in CLIP, and uses ensemble learning to capture domain-invariant attention maps.

Result: SRE outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several datasets.

Conclusion: SRE effectively addresses domain shift challenges in DG by refining attention in CLIP.

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) aims to learn a model from source domains and
apply it to unseen target domains with out-of-distribution data. Owing to
CLIP's strong ability to encode semantic concepts, it has attracted increasing
interest in domain generalization. However, CLIP often struggles to focus on
task-relevant regions across domains, i.e., domain-invariant regions, resulting
in suboptimal performance on unseen target domains. To address this challenge,
we propose an attention-refocusing scheme, called Simulate, Refocus and
Ensemble (SRE), which learns to reduce the domain shift by aligning the
attention maps in CLIP via attention refocusing. SRE first simulates domain
shifts by performing augmentation on the source data to generate simulated
target domains. SRE then learns to reduce the domain shifts by refocusing the
attention in CLIP between the source and simulated target domains. Finally, SRE
utilizes ensemble learning to enhance the ability to capture domain-invariant
attention maps between the source data and the simulated target data. Extensive
experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that SRE generally
achieves better results than state-of-the-art methods. The code is available

*Shiqi Huang,Shuting He,Huaiyuan Qin,Bihan Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCORE introduces open-vocabulary learning for remote sensing instance segmentation, addressing challenges like diverse landscapes and small objects by integrating multi-granularity scene context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods are limited to close-vocabulary prediction, restricting their use in diverse Earth observation scenarios.

Method: Proposes SCORE, integrating regional and global context to enhance visual and textual representations via Region-Aware Integration and Global Context Adaptation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-vocabulary remote sensing instance segmentation benchmarks.

Conclusion: SCORE provides a robust solution for large-scale geospatial analysis, advancing open-vocabulary learning in remote sensing.

Abstract: Most existing remote sensing instance segmentation approaches are designed
for close-vocabulary prediction, limiting their ability to recognize novel
categories or generalize across datasets. This restricts their applicability in
diverse Earth observation scenarios. To address this, we introduce
open-vocabulary (OV) learning for remote sensing instance segmentation. While
current OV segmentation models perform well on natural image datasets, their
direct application to remote sensing faces challenges such as diverse
landscapes, seasonal variations, and the presence of small or ambiguous objects
in aerial imagery. To overcome these challenges, we propose $\textbf{SCORE}$
($\textbf{S}$cene $\textbf{C}$ontext matters in $\textbf{O}$pen-vocabulary
$\textbf{RE}$mote sensing instance segmentation), a framework that integrates
multi-granularity scene context, i.e., regional context and global context, to
enhance both visual and textual representations. Specifically, we introduce
Region-Aware Integration, which refines class embeddings with regional context
to improve object distinguishability. Additionally, we propose Global Context
Adaptation, which enriches naive text embeddings with remote sensing global
context, creating a more adaptable and expressive linguistic latent space for
the classifier. We establish new benchmarks for OV remote sensing instance
segmentation across diverse datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that,
our proposed method achieves SOTA performance, which provides a robust solution
for large-scale, real-world geospatial analysis. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional person re-identification methods rely on visual data but suffer from performance issues due to poor lighting conditions, occlusion, and suboptimal camera angles, necessitating an alternative approach that can work reliably in challenging visual environments.

Method: The paper proposes WhoFi, a pipeline that extracts biometric features from Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) and processes them through a modular Deep Neural Network with a Transformer-based encoder, trained using an in-batch negative loss function to learn robust biometric signatures.

Result: Experiments conducted on the NTU-Fi dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art person re-identification methods, validating the effectiveness of Wi-Fi signal-based identification.

Conclusion: WhoFi successfully demonstrates that Wi-Fi signals can be effectively used for person re-identification, offering a viable alternative to visual-based methods and confirming the potential of wireless sensing for biometric identification tasks in challenging environments.

Abstract: Person Re-Identification is a key and challenging task in video surveillance.
While traditional methods rely on visual data, issues like poor lighting,
occlusion, and suboptimal angles often hinder performance. To address these
challenges, we introduce WhoFi, a novel pipeline that utilizes Wi-Fi signals

in-batch negative loss function to learn robust and generalizable biometric
signatures. Experiments on the NTU-Fi dataset show that our approach achieves
competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods, confirming its
effectiveness in identifying individuals via Wi-Fi signals.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HRSeg improves reasoning segmentation by enhancing perceptual resolution with HRP and HRE modules, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods suffer from low perceptual resolution due to pre-trained visual encoders at lower resolutions, limiting performance.

Method: HRSeg introduces High-Resolution Perception (HRP) for multi-granularity feature integration and High-Resolution Enhancement (HRE) for fine-grained mask refinement.

Result: HRSeg achieves superior performance on benchmark datasets, validated by ablation studies.

Conclusion: HRSeg effectively addresses resolution limitations, offering precise segmentation through high-resolution perception and enhancement.

Abstract: The reasoning segmentation task involves segmenting objects within an image
by interpreting implicit user instructions, which may encompass subtleties such
as contextual cues and open-world knowledge. Despite significant advancements
made by existing approaches, they remain constrained by low perceptual
resolution, as visual encoders are typically pre-trained at lower resolutions.
Furthermore, simply interpolating the positional embeddings of visual encoders
to enhance perceptual resolution yields only marginal performance improvements
while incurring substantial computational costs. To address this, we propose
HRSeg, an efficient model with high-resolution fine-grained perception. It
features two key innovations: High-Resolution Perception (HRP) and
High-Resolution Enhancement (HRE). The HRP module processes high-resolution
images through cropping, integrating local and global features for
multi-granularity quality. The HRE module enhances mask features by integrating
fine-grained information from high-resolution images, refining their alignment
with text features for precise segmentation. Extensive ablation studies
validate the effectiveness of our modules, while comprehensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate HRSeg's superior performance.

TL;DR: NeckSense is a wearable system using bio-impedance sensing to track head pose, achieving performance comparable to vision-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a lightweight, line-of-sight-free wearable for accurate head pose tracking.

Method: Multi-channel bio-impedance sensing with soft electrodes and a deep learning framework incorporating anatomical priors.

Result: Mean per-vertex error of 25.9 mm, validated on 7 participants.

Conclusion: NeckSense demonstrates bio-impedance wearables can match vision-based head-tracking performance.

Abstract: We present NeckSense, a novel wearable system for head pose tracking that
leverages multi-channel bio-impedance sensing with soft, dry electrodes
embedded in a lightweight, necklace-style form factor. NeckSense captures
dynamic changes in tissue impedance around the neck, which are modulated by
head rotations and subtle muscle activations. To robustly estimate head pose,
we propose a deep learning framework that integrates anatomical priors,
including joint constraints and natural head rotation ranges, into the loss
function design. We validate NeckSense on 7 participants using the current SOTA
pose estimation model as ground truth. Our system achieves a mean per-vertex
error of 25.9 mm across various head movements with a leave-one-person-out
cross-validation method, demonstrating that a compact, line-of-sight-free
bio-impedance wearable can deliver head-tracking performance comparable to SOTA

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel camera-based method for emotion recognition integrates gaze patterns with environmental context, capturing implicit emotions without specialized hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on explicit signals or physiological sensors, which are limited in capturing deeper, implicit emotions or are intrusive.

Method: Uses standard HD cameras to unobtrusively capture gaze and head movements, modeling spatial, semantic, and temporal dimensions of gaze behavior.

Result: The approach reveals emotions as outcomes of human-environment interactions, enabling real-time, continuous recognition with high generalizability.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a scalable, unobtrusive solution for emotion recognition by leveraging gaze dynamics and environmental context.

Abstract: Emotion recognition,as a step toward mind reading,seeks to infer internal
states from external cues.Most existing methods rely on explicit signals-such
as facial expressions,speech,or gestures-that reflect only bodily responses and
overlook the influence of environmental context.These cues are often
voluntary,easy to mask,and insufficient for capturing deeper,implicit emotions.
Physiological signal-based approaches offer more direct access to internal
states but require complex sensors that compromise natural behavior and limit
scalability.Gaze-based methods typically rely on static fixation analysis and
fail to capture the rich,dynamic interactions between gaze and the
environment,and thus cannot uncover the deep connection between emotion and
implicit behavior.To address these limitations,we propose a novel
camera-based,user-unaware emotion recognition approach that integrates gaze
fixation patterns with environmental semantics and temporal dynamics.Leveraging
standard HD cameras,our method unobtrusively captures users'eye appearance and
head movements in natural settings-without the need for specialized hardware or
active user participation.From these visual cues,the system estimates gaze
trajectories over time and space, providing the basis for modeling the spatial,
semantic,and temporal dimensions of gaze behavior. This allows us to capture
the dynamic interplay between visual attention and the surrounding
environment,revealing that emotions are not merely physiological responses but
complex outcomes of human-environment interactions.The proposed approach
enables user-unaware,real-time,and continuous emotion recognition,offering high
generalizability and low deployment cost.

*Yin Wu,Daniel Slieter,Ahmed Abouelazm,Christian Hubschneider,J. Marius Zöllner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes LanePerf, a framework for estimating lane detection model performance without ground-truth labels, outperforming baselines in diverse domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shifts in lane detection models require costly labeled data for robustness assessment. Label-free performance estimation is underexplored.

Method: Adapts five image classification methods to lane detection, then introduces LanePerf, integrating image and lane features with a pretrained encoder and DeepSets architecture.

Result: LanePerf achieves lower MAE (0.117) and higher Spearman's correlation (0.727) on OpenLane dataset, handling zero-lane and large domain shifts.

Conclusion: LanePerf enables efficient, label-free robustness assessment for ADAS, improving safety in challenging driving scenarios.

Abstract: Lane detection is a critical component of Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems
(ADAS) and Automated Driving System (ADS), providing essential spatial
information for lateral control. However, domain shifts often undermine model
reliability when deployed in new environments. Ensuring the robustness and
safety of lane detection models typically requires collecting and annotating
target domain data, which is resource-intensive. Estimating model performance
without ground-truth labels offers a promising alternative for efficient
robustness assessment, yet remains underexplored in lane detection. While
previous work has addressed performance estimation in image classification,
these methods are not directly applicable to lane detection tasks. This paper
first adapts five well-performing performance estimation methods from image
classification to lane detection, building a baseline. Addressing the
limitations of prior approaches that solely rely on softmax scores or lane
features, we further propose a new Lane Performance Estimation Framework
(LanePerf), which integrates image and lane features using a pretrained image
encoder and a DeepSets-based architecture, effectively handling zero-lane
detection scenarios and large domain-shift cases. Extensive experiments on the
OpenLane dataset, covering diverse domain shifts (scenes, weather, hours),
demonstrate that our LanePerf outperforms all baselines, achieving a lower MAE
of 0.117 and a higher Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.727. These
findings pave the way for robust, label-free performance estimation in ADAS,
supporting more efficient testing and improved safety in challenging driving
scenarios.

TL;DR: A new dataset for Federated Learning (FL) is introduced, along with two novel FL algorithms (Fed-Cyclic and Fed-Star), both outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy-preserving collaborative learning and provide a dedicated FL dataset for image classification.

Method: Two FL algorithms: Fed-Cyclic (cyclic topology) and Fed-Star (star-like topology with pre-aggregation).

Result: Both algorithms perform better than existing baselines on the new dataset.

Conclusion: The new dataset and algorithms advance FL research, offering improved performance and privacy.

Abstract: Federated Learning is a collaborative machine learning paradigm that enables
multiple clients to learn a global model without exposing their data to each
other. Consequently, it provides a secure learning platform with
privacy-preserving capabilities. This paper introduces a new dataset containing
23,326 images collected from eight different commercial sources and classified
into 31 categories, similar to the Office-31 dataset. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first image classification dataset specifically designed
for Federated Learning. We also propose two new Federated Learning algorithms,
namely Fed-Cyclic and Fed-Star. In Fed-Cyclic, a client receives weights from
its previous client, updates them through local training, and passes them to
the next client, thus forming a cyclic topology. In Fed-Star, a client receives
weights from all other clients, updates its local weights through
pre-aggregation (to address statistical heterogeneity) and local training, and
sends its updated local weights to all other clients, thus forming a star-like
topology. Our experiments reveal that both algorithms perform better than
existing baselines on our newly introduced dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of realistic sports datasets and unclear reliability of monocular 3D pose estimation for sports tasks.

Method: Introduce the AthleticsPose dataset, train a 3D pose estimation model, and evaluate its performance against a baseline.

Result: Model trained on AthleticsPose reduces MPJPE by ~75% compared to baseline, but accuracy varies with camera view and subject scale.

Conclusion: Authentic sports motion data is crucial for accurate pose estimation, though challenges remain for high-speed metrics. The dataset and findings advance sports motion analysis.

Abstract: Monocular 3D pose estimation is a promising, flexible alternative to costly
motion capture systems for sports analysis. However, its practical application
is hindered by two factors: a lack of realistic sports datasets and unclear
reliability for sports tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce the
AthleticsPose dataset, a new public dataset featuring ``real'' motions captured
from 23 athletes performing various athletics events on an athletic field.
Using this dataset, we trained a representative 3D pose estimation model and
performed a comprehensive evaluation. Our results show that the model trained
on AthleticsPose significantly outperforms a baseline model trained on an
imitated sports motion dataset, reducing MPJPE by approximately 75 %. These
results show the importance of training on authentic sports motion data, as
models based on imitated motions do not effectively transfer to real-world
motions. Further analysis reveals that estimation accuracy is sensitive to
camera view and subject scale. In case studies of kinematic indicators, the
model demonstrated the potential to capture individual differences in knee
angles but struggled with higher-speed metrics, such as knee-drive velocity,
due to prediction biases. This work provides the research community with a
valuable dataset and clarifies the potential and practical limitations of using
monocular 3D pose estimation for sports motion analysis. Our dataset, code, and

### [45] [Argus: Leveraging Multiview Images for Improved 3-D Scene Understanding With Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12916)
*Yifan Xu,Chao Zhang,Hanqi Jiang,Xiaoyan Wang,Ruifei Ma,Yiwei Li,Zihao Wu,Zeju Li,Xiangde Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Argus is a 3D multimodal framework using multi-view images and LLMs to enhance 3D scene understanding, addressing information loss in point clouds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D point cloud methods suffer from information loss and misalignments, while 2D multi-view images offer detailed representations to compensate.

Method: Argus fuses multi-view images, camera poses, and 3D point clouds into 3D-aware scene embeddings, integrating them with LLMs.

Result: Argus outperforms existing 3D-LMMs in downstream tasks by providing more detailed and accurate 3D scene understanding.

Conclusion: Argus effectively bridges gaps in 3D scene understanding by leveraging multi-modal inputs, enhancing LLM capabilities for 3D tasks.

Abstract: Advancements in foundation models have made it possible to conduct
applications in various downstream tasks. Especially, the new era has witnessed
a remarkable capability to extend Large Language Models (LLMs) for tackling
tasks of 3D scene understanding. Current methods rely heavily on 3D point
clouds, but the 3D point cloud reconstruction of an indoor scene often results
in information loss. Some textureless planes or repetitive patterns are prone
to omission and manifest as voids within the reconstructed 3D point clouds.
Besides, objects with complex structures tend to introduce distortion of
details caused by misalignments between the captured images and the dense
reconstructed point clouds. 2D multi-view images present visual consistency
with 3D point clouds and provide more detailed representations of scene
components, which can naturally compensate for these deficiencies. Based on
these insights, we propose Argus, a novel 3D multimodal framework that
leverages multi-view images for enhanced 3D scene understanding with LLMs. In
general, Argus can be treated as a 3D Large Multimodal Foundation Model
(3D-LMM) since it takes various modalities as input(text instructions, 2D
multi-view images, and 3D point clouds) and expands the capability of LLMs to
tackle 3D tasks. Argus involves fusing and integrating multi-view images and
camera poses into view-as-scene features, which interact with the 3D features
to create comprehensive and detailed 3D-aware scene embeddings. Our approach
compensates for the information loss while reconstructing 3D point clouds and
helps LLMs better understand the 3D world. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method outperforms existing 3D-LMMs in various downstream tasks.

*Dongyeun Lee,Jiwan Hur,Hyounguk Shon,Jae Young Lee,Junmo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes DMQ, combining Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES) and channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling (PTS), to improve quantization in diffusion models, outperforming existing methods at low bit-widths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational costs and performance degradation in diffusion models due to outliers and low bit-width quantization.

Method: Combines LES for optimizing channel-wise scaling and PTS for activations, with adaptive timestep weighting and a voting algorithm for reliable PTS factor selection.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing methods at low bit-widths (e.g., W4A6, W4A8), maintaining high image generation quality.

Conclusion: DMQ effectively addresses quantization challenges in diffusion models, enhancing performance and stability.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation but
come with significant computational costs, posing challenges for deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Recent post-training quantization (PTQ)
methods have attempted to mitigate this issue by focusing on the iterative
nature of diffusion models. However, these approaches often overlook outliers,
leading to degraded performance at low bit-widths. In this paper, we propose a
DMQ which combines Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES) and channel-wise
Power-of-Two Scaling (PTS) to effectively address these challenges. Learned
Equivalent Scaling optimizes channel-wise scaling factors to redistribute
quantization difficulty between weights and activations, reducing overall
quantization error. Recognizing that early denoising steps, despite having
small quantization errors, crucially impact the final output due to error
accumulation, we incorporate an adaptive timestep weighting scheme to
prioritize these critical steps during learning. Furthermore, identifying that
layers such as skip connections exhibit high inter-channel variance, we
introduce channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling for activations. To ensure robust
selection of PTS factors even with small calibration set, we introduce a voting
algorithm that enhances reliability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing works, especially at low bit-widths
such as W4A6 (4-bit weight, 6-bit activation) and W4A8, maintaining high image
generation quality and model stability. The code is available at

Abstract: The use of satellite imagery combined with deep learning to support automatic
landslide detection is becoming increasingly widespread. However, selecting an
appropriate deep learning architecture to optimize performance while avoiding
overfitting remains a critical challenge. To address these issues, we propose a
deep-learning based framework for landslide detection from remote sensing image
in this paper. The proposed framework presents an effective combination of the
online an offline data augmentation to tackle the imbalanced data, a backbone
EfficientNet\_Large deep learning model for extracting robust embedding
features, and a post-processing SVM classifier to balance and enhance the
classification performance. The proposed model achieved an F1-score of 0.8938
on the public test set of the Zindi challenge.

*Yafei Zhang,Lingqi Kong,Huafeng Li,Jie Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A weakly supervised cross-modal person ReID method is proposed, using single-modal labels to address missing cross-modal labels, improving identity recognition via expert collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce reliance on labeled cross-modal samples and address scenarios where such labels are unavailable.

Method: A heterogeneous expert collaborative consistency learning framework trains modality-specific experts and uses a cross-modal fusion mechanism to associate identities.

Result: Improved cross-modal identity recognition, validated on two challenging datasets.

Conclusion: The method effectively enhances modality-invariant feature extraction and cross-modal recognition without full cross-modal labels.

Abstract: To reduce the reliance of visible-infrared person re-identification (ReID)
models on labeled cross-modal samples, this paper explores a weakly supervised
cross-modal person ReID method that uses only single-modal sample identity
labels, addressing scenarios where cross-modal identity labels are unavailable.
To mitigate the impact of missing cross-modal labels on model performance, we
propose a heterogeneous expert collaborative consistency learning framework,
designed to establish robust cross-modal identity correspondences in a weakly
supervised manner. This framework leverages labeled data from each modality to
independently train dedicated classification experts. To associate cross-modal
samples, these classification experts act as heterogeneous predictors,
predicting the identities of samples from the other modality. To improve
prediction accuracy, we design a cross-modal relationship fusion mechanism that
effectively integrates predictions from different experts. Under the implicit
supervision provided by cross-modal identity correspondences, collaborative and
consistent learning among the experts is encouraged, significantly enhancing
the model's ability to extract modality-invariant features and improve
cross-modal identity recognition. Experimental results on two challenging
datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

*Yucheng Tang,Yunguan Fu,Weixi Yi,Yipei Wang,Daniel C. Alexander,Rhodri Davies,Yipeng Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Multimodal Uncertainty Propagation Model (MUPM) to analyze uncertainties in MLLMs from image-only, text-only, and joint image-text inputs, demonstrating robustness and transferability in clinical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding interrelationships and uncertainties in multimodal inputs of large-scale MLLMs for clinical applications.

Method: Proposes MUPM based on uncertainty propagation, tested with cardiac MR scans and digital health records.

Result: MUPMs are robust, generalizable across data distributions and tasks, and enable clinical uncertainty analysis.

Conclusion: MUPMs offer practical clinical applications by efficiently estimating uncertainties and identifying redundant factors.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can process and integrate
information from multimodality sources, such as text and images. However,
interrelationship among input modalities, uncertainties due to individual
uni-modal data and potential clinical applications following such an
uncertainty decomposition are yet fully understood in the context of
large-scale MLLMs. In this work, we propose a multimodal uncertainty
propagation model (MUPM) based on uncertainty propagation, to characterise the
relationship among the uncertainties arising from image-only, text-only, and
joint image-text variations in MLLM inputs. Using real clinical data consisting
of cardiac MR scans and digital health records, we describe that MUPMs can be
optimised robustly with a few samples. We then show that the fitted MUPMs are
generalisable across different input data distributions and, perhaps
surprisingly, across different downstream tasks. Such a transferability may be
explained by the shared pretraining, comparatively light MLLM fine-tuning,
along with the low-dimensional nature of the MUPMs. More importantly, this
learned transferability, quantifying the relationship between these
uncertainties, led to direct clinical applications in which uncertainties may
be estimated and thus analysed robustly for varying data or even a novel set of
cardiac disease prediction tasks. In addition, we show experimentally the
efficiency in multimodal data required for estimating the overall uncertainty
and its ability to identify redundant factors, both of which are considered
practical yet clinically useful applications with the proposed MUPMs. Codes are

TL;DR: LoViC is a DiT-based framework for generating long, coherent videos using a segment-wise approach and FlexFormer, an autoencoder for unified video-text latent representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of scaling diffusion transformers (DiTs) for long-duration video generation without compromising temporal coherence or scalability.

Method: Introduces LoViC with FlexFormer, an autoencoder for joint video-text compression, supporting variable-length inputs and temporal context encoding.

Result: Validated through diverse tasks, enabling prediction, retradiction, interpolation, and multi-shot generation.

Conclusion: LoViC effectively generates long, coherent videos while maintaining scalability and versatility.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in diffusion transformers (DiTs) for text-to-video
generation, scaling to long-duration content remains challenging due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. While prior efforts -- such as sparse
attention and temporally autoregressive models -- offer partial relief, they
often compromise temporal coherence or scalability. We introduce LoViC, a
DiT-based framework trained on million-scale open-domain videos, designed to
produce long, coherent videos through a segment-wise generation process. At the
core of our approach is FlexFormer, an expressive autoencoder that jointly
compresses video and text into unified latent representations. It supports
variable-length inputs with linearly adjustable compression rates, enabled by a
single query token design based on the Q-Former architecture. Additionally, by
encoding temporal context through position-aware mechanisms, our model
seamlessly supports prediction, retradiction, interpolation, and multi-shot
generation within a unified paradigm. Extensive experiments across diverse
tasks validate the effectiveness and versatility of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisionThink dynamically adjusts visual token resolution for VLMs, improving efficiency without significant performance loss in most tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most real-world scenarios don't require extensive visual tokens, yet current VLMs use them uniformly, leading to inefficiency.

Method: Proposes VisionThink, which starts with low-resolution images and requests higher resolution only if needed, using reinforcement learning for decision-making.

Result: Achieves strong performance on OCR tasks while saving tokens on simpler tasks, with stable resize call ratios.

Conclusion: VisionThink offers a superior, efficient, and effective paradigm for visual token compression in VLMs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved
performance by increasing the number of visual tokens, which are often
significantly longer than text tokens. However, we observe that most real-world
scenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the
performance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models
still perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4
resolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with
different resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression,
namely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides
whether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output
a special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing
Efficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or
thresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by
case. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding
capability on OCR-related tasks, and meanwhile saves substantial visual tokens
on simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge
strategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks. Moreover, we carefully
design a reward function and penalty mechanism to achieve a stable and
reasonable image resize call ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority, efficiency, and effectiveness of our method. Our code is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: cIDIR is a novel DIR framework using INRs to condition registration on regularization hyperparameters, avoiding retraining and enabling advanced regularization via differentiable DVFs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning regularization parameters in learning-based DIR is computationally expensive, requiring multiple training iterations.

Method: Proposes cIDIR, a DIR framework based on INRs, trained over a prior distribution of hyperparameters and optimized using segmentation masks. Models a continuous, differentiable DVF.

Result: Achieves high accuracy and robustness on the DIR-LAB dataset.

Conclusion: cIDIR efficiently handles regularization hyperparameters and integrates advanced techniques, improving DIR performance.

Abstract: Regularization is essential in deformable image registration (DIR) to ensure
that the estimated Deformation Vector Field (DVF) remains smooth, physically
plausible, and anatomically consistent. However, fine-tuning regularization
parameters in learning-based DIR frameworks is computationally expensive, often
requiring multiple training iterations. To address this, we propose cIDI, a
novel DIR framework based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) that
conditions the registration process on regularization hyperparameters. Unlike
conventional methods that require retraining for each regularization
hyperparameter setting, cIDIR is trained over a prior distribution of these
hyperparameters, then optimized over the regularization hyperparameters by
using the segmentations masks as an observation. Additionally, cIDIR models a
continuous and differentiable DVF, enabling seamless integration of advanced
regularization techniques via automatic differentiation. Evaluated on the
DIR-LAB dataset, $\operatorname{cIDIR}$ achieves high accuracy and robustness
across the dataset.

TL;DR: FantasyPortrait is a diffusion transformer framework for high-fidelity, emotion-rich facial animations, addressing cross reenactment and multi-character challenges with innovative learning and attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods using geometric priors often produce artifacts and struggle with subtle emotions or multi-character scenarios due to feature interference.

Method: Uses expression-augmented learning with implicit representations for facial dynamics and a masked cross-attention mechanism for multi-character control. Introduces Multi-Expr dataset and ExprBench for training and evaluation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross reenactment and multi-character contexts, as shown by quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: FantasyPortrait advances facial animation by improving emotion capture and multi-character coordination, supported by new datasets and benchmarks.

Abstract: Producing expressive facial animations from static images is a challenging
task. Prior methods relying on explicit geometric priors (e.g., facial
landmarks or 3DMM) often suffer from artifacts in cross reenactment and
struggle to capture subtle emotions. Furthermore, existing approaches lack
support for multi-character animation, as driving features from different
individuals frequently interfere with one another, complicating the task. To
address these challenges, we propose FantasyPortrait, a diffusion transformer
based framework capable of generating high-fidelity and emotion-rich animations
for both single- and multi-character scenarios. Our method introduces an
expression-augmented learning strategy that utilizes implicit representations
to capture identity-agnostic facial dynamics, enhancing the model's ability to
render fine-grained emotions. For multi-character control, we design a masked
cross-attention mechanism that ensures independent yet coordinated expression
generation, effectively preventing feature interference. To advance research in
this area, we propose the Multi-Expr dataset and ExprBench, which are
specifically designed datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating
multi-character portrait animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FantasyPortrait significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both
quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, excelling particularly in
challenging cross reenactment and multi-character contexts. Our project page is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multifaceted approach to diagnose wrist pathologies using limited datasets by combining fine-grained recognition, metadata fusion, and specialized pre-training, achieving improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diagnosing wrist pathologies is time-consuming and requires expertise, with limited datasets posing a challenge. Computer vision offers potential but needs innovative methods to overcome data scarcity.

Method: The study uses fine-grained recognition for subtle X-ray pathologies, fuses patient metadata with images, and employs weights from a fine-grained dataset instead of ImageNet.

Result: The approach improves diagnostic accuracy by 2% with limited data and over 10% with a larger fracture-focused dataset.

Conclusion: Fine-grained strategies and metadata integration enhance wrist pathology diagnosis, even with limited datasets, offering a promising direction for medical imaging.

Abstract: Wrist pathologies are frequently observed, particularly among children who
constitute the majority of fracture cases. However, diagnosing these conditions
is time-consuming and requires specialized expertise. Computer vision presents
a promising avenue, contingent upon the availability of extensive datasets, a
notable challenge in medical imaging. Therefore, reliance solely on one
modality, such as images, proves inadequate, especially in an era of diverse
and plentiful data types. In this study, we employ a multifaceted approach to
address the challenge of recognizing wrist pathologies using an extremely
limited dataset. Initially, we approach the problem as a fine-grained
recognition task, aiming to identify subtle X-ray pathologies that conventional
CNNs overlook. Secondly, we enhance network performance by fusing patient
metadata with X-ray images. Thirdly, rather than pre-training on a
coarse-grained dataset like ImageNet, we utilize weights trained on a
fine-grained dataset. While metadata integration has been used in other medical
domains, this is a novel application for wrist pathologies. Our results show
that a fine-grained strategy and metadata integration improve diagnostic
accuracy by 2% with a limited dataset and by over 10% with a larger
fracture-focused dataset.

*Keli Deng,Jie Nie,Yuntao Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-stage method using a latent diffusion model to reconstruct hyperspectral images (HSIs) from RGB images by focusing on unobservable spectral features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge is estimating unobservable spectral features in RGB images for accurate HSI reconstruction, leveraging spatial knowledge from RGB pre-trained models.

Method: Extends RGB pre-trained latent diffusion model (RGB-LDM) to an unobservable feature LDM (ULDM), using a spectral unobservable feature autoencoder (SpeUAE) and spatial autoencoder (SpaAE) for spectral-spatial joint distribution learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in spectral reconstruction and downstream relighting tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed ULDM effectively models spectral-spatial joint distribution, improving HSI reconstruction from RGB images.

Abstract: Spectral reconstruction (SR) is a crucial problem in image processing that
requires reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSIs) from the corresponding RGB
images. A key difficulty in SR is estimating the unobservable feature, which
encapsulates significant spectral information not captured by RGB imaging
sensors. The solution lies in effectively constructing the spectral-spatial
joint distribution conditioned on the RGB image to complement the unobservable
feature. Since HSIs share a similar spatial structure with the corresponding
RGB images, it is rational to capitalize on the rich spatial knowledge in RGB
pre-trained models for spectral-spatial joint distribution learning. To this
end, we extend the RGB pre-trained latent diffusion model (RGB-LDM) to an
unobservable feature LDM (ULDM) for SR. As the RGB-LDM and its corresponding
spatial autoencoder (SpaAE) already excel in spatial knowledge, the ULDM can
focus on modeling spectral structure. Moreover, separating the unobservable
feature from the HSI reduces the redundant spectral information and empowers
the ULDM to learn the joint distribution in a compact latent space.
Specifically, we propose a two-stage pipeline consisting of spectral structure
representation learning and spectral-spatial joint distribution learning to
transform the RGB-LDM into the ULDM. In the first stage, a spectral
unobservable feature autoencoder (SpeUAE) is trained to extract and compress
the unobservable feature into a 3D manifold aligned with RGB space. In the
second stage, the spectral and spatial structures are sequentially encoded by
the SpeUAE and the SpaAE, respectively. The ULDM is then acquired to model the
distribution of the coded unobservable feature with guidance from the
corresponding RGB images. Experimental results on SR and downstream relighting
tasks demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

TL;DR: Variance-Based Pruning is introduced to compress large models like Vision Transformers efficiently, reducing computational costs and memory demands with minimal retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational costs and memory demands of large models like Vision Transformers make deployment challenging, especially on resource-constrained hardware.

Method: Uses activation statistics to select neurons for pruning and integrates mean activations to preserve performance, requiring minimal fine-tuning.

Result: On ImageNet-1k, DeiT-Base retains 70% performance post-pruning and regains 99% accuracy with 10 epochs of fine-tuning, reducing MACs by 35% and model size by 36%.

Conclusion: Variance-Based Pruning offers an efficient, one-shot solution to compress models while maintaining performance, reducing deployment barriers.

Abstract: Increasingly expensive training of ever larger models such as Vision
Transfomers motivate reusing the vast library of already trained
state-of-the-art networks. However, their latency, high computational costs and
memory demands pose significant challenges for deployment, especially on
resource-constrained hardware. While structured pruning methods can reduce
these factors, they often require costly retraining, sometimes for up to
hundreds of epochs, or even training from scratch to recover the lost accuracy
resulting from the structural modifications. Maintaining the provided
performance of trained models after structured pruning and thereby avoiding
extensive retraining remains a challenge. To solve this, we introduce
Variance-Based Pruning, a simple and structured one-shot pruning technique for
efficiently compressing networks, with minimal finetuning. Our approach first
gathers activation statistics, which are used to select neurons for pruning.
Simultaneously the mean activations are integrated back into the model to
preserve a high degree of performance. On ImageNet-1k recognition tasks, we
demonstrate that directly after pruning DeiT-Base retains over 70% of its
original performance and requires only 10 epochs of fine-tuning to regain 99%
of the original accuracy while simultaneously reducing MACs by 35% and model
size by 36%, thus speeding up the model by 1.44x.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DISSect, a Differential-Informed Sample Selection method, to efficiently address noisy correspondence in contrastive-learning-based multimodal models, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sample selection methods either rely on offline oracle models (inefficient for cold-start) or online predictions (ineffective for noisy correspondence), creating a need for a better solution.

Method: DISSect uses the differential between predicted correlations of current and historical models to characterize sample quality, enabling robust sample selection.

Result: Experiments on three benchmark datasets show DISSect consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in training acceleration and performance.

Conclusion: DISSect effectively addresses noisy correspondence and improves training efficiency, demonstrating superior performance in multimodal contrastive learning.

Abstract: The remarkable success of contrastive-learning-based multimodal models has
been greatly driven by training on ever-larger datasets with expensive compute
consumption. Sample selection as an alternative efficient paradigm plays an
important direction to accelerate the training process. However, recent
advances on sample selection either mostly rely on an oracle model to offline
select a high-quality coreset, which is limited in the cold-start scenarios, or
focus on online selection based on real-time model predictions, which has not
sufficiently or efficiently considered the noisy correspondence. To address
this dilemma, we propose a novel Differential-Informed Sample Selection
(DISSect) method, which accurately and efficiently discriminates the noisy
correspondence for training acceleration. Specifically, we rethink the impact
of noisy correspondence on contrastive learning and propose that the
differential between the predicted correlation of the current model and that of
a historical model is more informative to characterize sample quality. Based on
this, we construct a robust differential-based sample selection and analyze its
theoretical insights. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and
various downstream tasks demonstrate the consistent superiority of DISSect over
current state-of-the-art methods. Source code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scribble-based weakly supervised framework for image manipulation localization (IML), outperforming fully supervised methods by leveraging scribble annotations, self-supervised training, and novel modules like PFMM and GAFM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of acquiring high-quality pixel-level annotations for IML, the study explores scribble annotations as a more efficient weak supervision method to improve detection performance.

Method: The proposed framework includes self-supervised training with structural consistency loss, a prior-aware feature modulation module (PFMM), a gated adaptive fusion module (GAFM), and a confidence-aware entropy minimization loss (L_CEM).

Result: The method outperforms existing fully supervised approaches in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: Scribble annotation supervision is a viable and efficient alternative to pixel-level annotations, enabling high-performance IML with reduced annotation effort.

Abstract: Deep learning-based image manipulation localization (IML) methods have
achieved remarkable performance in recent years, but typically rely on
large-scale pixel-level annotated datasets. To address the challenge of
acquiring high-quality annotations, some recent weakly supervised methods
utilize image-level labels to segment manipulated regions. However, the
performance is still limited due to insufficient supervision signals. In this
study, we explore a form of weak supervision that improves the annotation
efficiency and detection performance, namely scribble annotation supervision.
We re-annotated mainstream IML datasets with scribble labels and propose the
first scribble-based IML (Sc-IML) dataset. Additionally, we propose the first
scribble-based weakly supervised IML framework. Specifically, we employ
self-supervised training with a structural consistency loss to encourage the
model to produce consistent predictions under multi-scale and augmented inputs.
In addition, we propose a prior-aware feature modulation module (PFMM) that
adaptively integrates prior information from both manipulated and authentic
regions for dynamic feature adjustment, further enhancing feature
discriminability and prediction consistency in complex scenes. We also propose
a gated adaptive fusion module (GAFM) that utilizes gating mechanisms to
regulate information flow during feature fusion, guiding the model toward
emphasizing potential tampered regions. Finally, we propose a confidence-aware
entropy minimization loss (${\mathcal{L}}_{ {CEM }}$). This loss dynamically
regularizes predictions in weakly annotated or unlabeled regions based on model
uncertainty, effectively suppressing unreliable predictions. Experimental
results show that our method outperforms existing fully supervised approaches
in terms of average performance both in-distribution and out-of-distribution.

Conclusion: MaskGIL advances MAR models, achieving AR-level performance with efficiency, and extends to versatile applications like text-driven and real-time image generation.

Abstract: AutoRegressive (AR) models have made notable progress in image generation,
with Masked AutoRegressive (MAR) models gaining attention for their efficient
parallel decoding. However, MAR models have traditionally underperformed when
compared to standard AR models. This study refines the MAR architecture to
improve image generation quality. We begin by evaluating various image
tokenizers to identify the most effective one. Subsequently, we introduce an
improved Bidirectional LLaMA architecture by replacing causal attention with
bidirectional attention and incorporating 2D RoPE, which together form our
advanced model, MaskGIL. Scaled from 111M to 1.4B parameters, MaskGIL achieves
a FID score of 3.71, matching state-of-the-art AR models in the ImageNet
256x256 benchmark, while requiring only 8 inference steps compared to the 256
steps of AR models. Furthermore, we develop a text-driven MaskGIL model with
775M parameters for generating images from text at various resolutions. Beyond
image generation, MaskGIL extends to accelerate AR-based generation and enable
real-time speech-to-image conversion. Our codes and models are available at

*Jingyao Wang,Yiming Chen,Lingyu Si,Changwen Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Hierarchical Coresets Selection (HCS) mechanism to improve Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for complex wide-area scene understanding without additional fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs struggle with adaptation to unseen complex wide-area scenes, prompting the need for a method to enhance their performance.

Method: HCS progressively refines selected regions using a theoretically guaranteed importance function, focusing on utility, representativeness, robustness, and synergy.

Result: HCS enables VLMs to rapidly understand unseen scenes at any scale with minimal interpretable regions, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: HCS is a plug-and-play solution that enhances VLM performance universally, as validated by experiments.

Abstract: Scene understanding is one of the core tasks in computer vision, aiming to
extract semantic information from images to identify objects, scene categories,
and their interrelationships. Although advancements in Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have driven progress in this field, existing VLMs still face challenges
in adaptation to unseen complex wide-area scenes. To address the challenges,
this paper proposes a Hierarchical Coresets Selection (HCS) mechanism to
advance the adaptation of VLMs in complex wide-area scene understanding. It
progressively refines the selected regions based on the proposed theoretically
guaranteed importance function, which considers utility, representativeness,
robustness, and synergy. Without requiring additional fine-tuning, HCS enables
VLMs to achieve rapid understandings of unseen scenes at any scale using
minimal interpretable regions while mitigating insufficient feature density.
HCS is a plug-and-play method that is compatible with any VLM. Experiments
demonstrate that HCS achieves superior performance and universality in various
tasks.

### [61] [Label-Consistent Dataset Distillation with Detector-Guided Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13074)
*Yawen Zou,Guang Li,Zi Wang,Chunzhi Gu,Chao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A detector-guided dataset distillation framework improves synthetic dataset quality by refining anomalous samples using a pre-trained detector, ensuring label consistency and richer details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models for dataset distillation produce samples with label inconsistencies or insufficient detail, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: A pre-trained detector identifies anomalous synthetic samples, and a diffusion model generates refined candidates. The best candidate is selected based on detector confidence and dissimilarity to existing samples.

Result: The method synthesizes high-quality images with richer details, achieving state-of-the-art performance on validation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses label and detail issues in dataset distillation, enhancing downstream performance.

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) aims to generate a compact yet informative dataset
that achieves performance comparable to the original dataset, thereby reducing
demands on storage and computational resources. Although diffusion models have
made significant progress in dataset distillation, the generated surrogate
datasets often contain samples with label inconsistencies or insufficient
structural detail, leading to suboptimal downstream performance. To address
these issues, we propose a detector-guided dataset distillation framework that
explicitly leverages a pre-trained detector to identify and refine anomalous
synthetic samples, thereby ensuring label consistency and improving image
quality. Specifically, a detector model trained on the original dataset is
employed to identify anomalous images exhibiting label mismatches or low
classification confidence. For each defective image, multiple candidates are
generated using a pre-trained diffusion model conditioned on the corresponding
image prototype and label. The optimal candidate is then selected by jointly
considering the detector's confidence score and dissimilarity to existing
qualified synthetic samples, thereby ensuring both label accuracy and
intra-class diversity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can
synthesize high-quality representative images with richer details, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on the validation set.

*Riku Inoue,Masamitsu Tsuchiya,Yuji Yasui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a cost-volume-based motion feature representation, Channel-wise Motion Features, for efficient and real-time motion segmentation in robotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational cost and inefficiency of existing motion segmentation models that use multiple subnetworks.

Method: Uses a novel Channel-wise Motion Features representation, extracting depth features and 3D motion information with only a Pose Network, eliminating other subnetworks.

Result: Achieves 4x FPS of state-of-the-art models on KITTI and Cityscapes datasets, with equivalent accuracy and 25% fewer parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly improves efficiency and real-time performance without sacrificing accuracy in motion segmentation.

Abstract: For safety-critical robotics applications such as autonomous driving, it is
important to detect all required objects accurately in real-time. Motion
segmentation offers a solution by identifying dynamic objects from the scene in
a class-agnostic manner. Recently, various motion segmentation models have been
proposed, most of which jointly use subnetworks to estimate Depth, Pose,
Optical Flow, and Scene Flow. As a result, the overall computational cost of
the model increases, hindering real-time performance.
  In this paper, we propose a novel cost-volume-based motion feature
representation, Channel-wise Motion Features. By extracting depth features of
each instance in the feature map and capturing the scene's 3D motion
information, it offers enhanced efficiency. The only subnetwork used to build
Channel-wise Motion Features is the Pose Network, and no others are required.
Our method not only achieves about 4 times the FPS of state-of-the-art models
in the KITTI Dataset and Cityscapes of the VCAS-Motion Dataset, but also
demonstrates equivalent accuracy while reducing the parameters to about 25$\%$.

*Riku Inoue,Masamitsu Tsuchiya,Yuji Yasui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Decoupled PROB improves Open World Object Detection (OWOD) by resolving learning conflicts in PROB and introducing efficient feature extraction for known and unknown objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing learning conflicts between objectness and class predictions in PROB and enhancing performance in OWOD tasks.

Method: Introduces Early Termination of Objectness Prediction (ETOP) and Task-Decoupled Query Initialization (TDQI) to decouple and optimize predictions.

Result: Decoupled PROB outperforms existing methods on OWOD benchmarks, achieving significant performance improvements.

Conclusion: Decoupled PROB is a novel and effective solution for OWOD, resolving PROB's limitations and advancing the field.

Abstract: Open World Object Detection (OWOD) is a challenging computer vision task that
extends standard object detection by (1) detecting and classifying unknown
objects without supervision, and (2) incrementally learning new object classes
without forgetting previously learned ones. The absence of ground truths for
unknown objects makes OWOD tasks particularly challenging. Many methods have
addressed this by using pseudo-labels for unknown objects. The recently
proposed Probabilistic Objectness transformer-based open-world detector (PROB)
is a state-of-the-art model that does not require pseudo-labels for unknown
objects, as it predicts probabilistic objectness. However, this method faces
issues with learning conflicts between objectness and class predictions.
  To address this issue and further enhance performance, we propose a novel
model, Decoupled PROB. Decoupled PROB introduces Early Termination of
Objectness Prediction (ETOP) to stop objectness predictions at appropriate
layers in the decoder, resolving the learning conflicts between class and
objectness predictions in PROB. Additionally, we introduce Task-Decoupled Query
Initialization (TDQI), which efficiently extracts features of known and unknown
objects, thereby improving performance. TDQI is a query initialization method
that combines query selection and learnable queries, and it is a module that
can be easily integrated into existing DETR-based OWOD models. Extensive
experiments on OWOD benchmarks demonstrate that Decoupled PROB surpasses all
existing methods across several metrics, significantly improving performance.

*Han Zhang,Xiangde Luo,Yong Chen,Kang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffOSeg is a two-stage diffusion-based framework for medical image segmentation that addresses annotation variability by achieving both consensus-driven and preference-driven segmentation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Annotation variability in medical image segmentation due to ambiguous boundaries and diverse expertise challenges traditional deep learning methods, which fail to capture annotator biases.

Method: DiffOSeg uses a two-stage approach: Stage I establishes population consensus via probabilistic consensus, and Stage II captures expert-specific preferences with adaptive prompts.

Result: The model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on LIDC-IDRI and NPC-170 datasets across all metrics.

Conclusion: DiffOSeg effectively combines consensus and expert-specific preferences, offering a comprehensive solution for medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Annotation variability remains a substantial challenge in medical image
segmentation, stemming from ambiguous imaging boundaries and diverse clinical
expertise. Traditional deep learning methods producing single deterministic
segmentation predictions often fail to capture these annotator biases. Although
recent studies have explored multi-rater segmentation, existing methods
typically focus on a single perspective -- either generating a probabilistic
``gold standard'' consensus or preserving expert-specific preferences -- thus
struggling to provide a more omni view. In this study, we propose DiffOSeg, a
two-stage diffusion-based framework, which aims to simultaneously achieve both
consensus-driven (combining all experts' opinions) and preference-driven
(reflecting experts' individual assessments) segmentation. Stage I establishes
population consensus through a probabilistic consensus strategy, while Stage II
captures expert-specific preference via adaptive prompts. Demonstrated on two
public datasets (LIDC-IDRI and NPC-170), our model outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated metrics. Source code is available

*Yuqi Peng,Pengfei Wang,Jianzhuang Liu,Shifeng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLAD (Generalizable LoRA tuning with RegulArized GraDient) is a simpler, more general framework for prompt tuning in vision-language models, addressing overfitting in few-shot scenarios with gradient-based regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt tuning methods struggle with overfitting in few-shot learning and rely on complex architectures, limiting general applicability.

Method: GLAD uses LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and introduces gradient-based regularization to stabilize optimization and improve robustness.

Result: GLAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 15 benchmark datasets in base-to-novel class, image domain, and cross-dataset generalization.

Conclusion: GLAD provides a simpler, more effective solution for prompt tuning, enhancing generalization without complex architectures.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, show impressive zero-shot
recognition ability and can be easily transferred to specific downstream tasks
via prompt tuning, even with limited training data. However, existing prompt
tuning methods face two main challenges: (1) In few-shot scenarios, data
scarcity often leads to overfitting, making the model sensitive to changes in
the input domain. (2) To mitigate overfitting, these methods typically rely on
complex task-specific model architectures and sensitive hyperparameter tuning,
severely restricting their general applicability. To address these issues, we
propose a simpler and more general framework called GLAD (Generalizable LoRA
tuning with RegulArized GraDient). We show that merely applying LoRA achieves
performance in downstream tasks comparable to current state-of-the-art
prompt-based methods. While LoRA is effective and easy to use, it remains
susceptible to overfitting in few-shot learning scenarios. To mitigate this
risk, we introduce a gradient-based regularization technique. This technique
effectively steers the optimization trajectory, encouraging the model to find a
more stable parameter region that is robust to variations in data distribution.
Through extensive experiments conducted on 15 benchmark datasets, we
demonstrate that GLAD outperforms previous tuning approaches in terms of
base-to-novel class generalization, image domain generalization, and
cross-dataset generalization. The code will be publicly available.

*Zhennan Xiao,Katharine Brudkiewicz,Zhen Yuan,Rosalind Aughwane,Magdalena Sokolska,Joanna Chappell,Trevor Gaunt,Anna L. David,Andrew P. King,Andrew Melbourne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An automated pipeline using deep learning (3D nnU-Net) for fetal lung segmentation and maturity assessment from diffusion-weighted MRI, achieving robust performance (82.14% Dice coefficient) and comparable results to manual segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fetal lung maturity is crucial for neonatal outcomes, but current IVIM analysis relies on time-consuming manual segmentation, limiting clinical use.

Method: Developed an automated pipeline with a 3D nnU-Net for segmentation and voxel-wise model fitting for IVIM parameter quantification.

Result: Segmentation achieved 82.14% Dice coefficient; automated and manual segmentations yielded similar IVIM parameters.

Conclusion: The pipeline enables fully automated fetal lung maturity assessment, supporting clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Fetal lung maturity is a critical indicator for predicting neonatal outcomes
and the need for post-natal intervention, especially for pregnancies affected
by fetal growth restriction. Intra-voxel incoherent motion analysis has shown
promising results for non-invasive assessment of fetal lung development, but
its reliance on manual segmentation is time-consuming, thus limiting its
clinical applicability. In this work, we present an automated lung maturity
evaluation pipeline for diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images that
consists of a deep learning-based fetal lung segmentation model and a
model-fitting lung maturity assessment. A 3D nnU-Net model was trained on
manually segmented images selected from the baseline frames of 4D
diffusion-weighted MRI scans. The segmentation model demonstrated robust
performance, yielding a mean Dice coefficient of 82.14%. Next, voxel-wise model
fitting was performed based on both the nnU-Net-predicted and manual lung
segmentations to quantify IVIM parameters reflecting tissue microstructure and
perfusion. The results suggested no differences between the two. Our work shows
that a fully automated pipeline is possible for supporting fetal lung maturity
assessment and clinical decision-making.

TL;DR: Proposes R²MoE, a parameter-efficient framework for lifelong visual concept learning, addressing catastrophic forgetting and parameter expansion with routing distillation, redundancy removal, and hierarchical attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable large-scale generative models to continuously learn new visual concepts without catastrophic forgetting or excessive parameter growth.

Method: Uses a mixture-of-experts framework with routing distillation, redundancy removal of experts, and hierarchical local attention-guided inference.

Result: Achieves 87.8% reduction in forgetting rates and 63.3% fewer parameters, outperforming SOTA on CustomConcept 101.

Conclusion: R²MoE effectively balances learning new concepts and minimizing overhead, demonstrating superior performance in lifelong visual concept learning.

Abstract: Enabling large-scale generative models to continuously learn new visual
concepts is essential for personalizing pre-trained models to meet individual
user preferences. Existing approaches for continual visual concept learning are
constrained by two fundamental challenges: catastrophic forgetting and
parameter expansion. In this paper, we propose Redundancy-Removal Mixture of
Experts (R^2MoE), a parameter-efficient framework for lifelong visual concept
learning that effectively learns new concepts while incurring minimal parameter
overhead. Our framework includes three key innovative contributions: First, we
propose a mixture-of-experts framework with a routing distillation mechanism
that enables experts to acquire concept-specific knowledge while preserving the
gating network's routing capability, thereby effectively mitigating
catastrophic forgetting. Second, we propose a strategy for eliminating
redundant layer-wise experts that reduces the number of expert parameters by
fully utilizing previously learned experts. Third, we employ a hierarchical
local attention-guided inference approach to mitigate interference between
generated visual concepts. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our
method generates images with superior conceptual fidelity compared to the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, achieving an impressive 87.8\% reduction in
forgetting rates and 63.3\% fewer parameters on the CustomConcept 101 dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A registration-based framework for 3D anomaly detection using multi-prototype alignment and cluster-wise discrepancy analysis achieves state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution 3D point clouds are effective for industrial inspection but face challenges like computational cost and spatial misalignment.

Method: Combines multi-prototype alignment with keypoint-guided clustering for localized structural comparison.

Result: Achieves top performance on the Real3D-AD benchmark for object-level and point-level anomaly detection.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables precise anomaly localization using raw features, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: High-resolution 3D point clouds are highly effective for detecting subtle
structural anomalies in industrial inspection. However, their dense and
irregular nature imposes significant challenges, including high computational
cost, sensitivity to spatial misalignment, and difficulty in capturing
localized structural differences. This paper introduces a registration-based
anomaly detection framework that combines multi-prototype alignment with
cluster-wise discrepancy analysis to enable precise 3D anomaly localization.
Specifically, each test sample is first registered to multiple normal
prototypes to enable direct structural comparison. To evaluate anomalies at a
local level, clustering is performed over the point cloud, and similarity is
computed between features from the test sample and the prototypes within each
cluster. Rather than selecting cluster centroids randomly, a keypoint-guided
strategy is employed, where geometrically informative points are chosen as
centroids. This ensures that clusters are centered on feature-rich regions,
enabling more meaningful and stable distance-based comparisons. Extensive
experiments on the Real3D-AD benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in both object-level and point-level
anomaly detection, even using only raw features.

*Pranav Singh,Pravendra Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel multimodal IRSTD framework combines language priors with image data to improve small target detection in infrared images, validated by significant performance improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IRSTD methods rely solely on image data, missing the potential of multimodal (image + text) approaches for better detection.

Method: Proposes a multimodal framework using language-guided attention weights and GPT-4 for text descriptions, alongside a new multimodal dataset.

Result: Achieves significant improvements in IoU, nIoU, Pd, and Fa metrics on NUAA-SIRST and IRSTD-1k subsets.

Conclusion: The multimodal approach enhances IRSTD performance, demonstrating the value of combining language and image data.

Abstract: IRSTD (InfraRed Small Target Detection) detects small targets in infrared
blurry backgrounds and is essential for various applications. The detection
task is challenging due to the small size of the targets and their sparse
distribution in infrared small target datasets. Although existing IRSTD methods
and datasets have led to significant advancements, they are limited by their
reliance solely on the image modality. Recent advances in deep learning and
large vision-language models have shown remarkable performance in various
visual recognition tasks. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal IRSTD
framework that incorporates language priors to guide small target detection. We
leverage language-guided attention weights derived from the language prior to
enhance the model's ability for IRSTD, presenting a novel approach that
combines textual information with image data to improve IRSTD capabilities.
Utilizing the state-of-the-art GPT-4 vision model, we generate text
descriptions that provide the locations of small targets in infrared images,
employing careful prompt engineering to ensure improved accuracy. Due to the
absence of multimodal IR datasets, existing IRSTD methods rely solely on image
data. To address this shortcoming, we have curated a multimodal infrared
dataset that includes both image and text modalities for small target
detection, expanding upon the popular IRSTD-1k and NUDT-SIRST datasets. We
validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments and
comprehensive ablation studies. The results demonstrate significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art method, with relative percentage
differences of 9.74%, 13.02%, 1.25%, and 67.87% in IoU, nIoU, Pd, and Fa on the
NUAA-SIRST subset, and 4.41%, 2.04%, 2.01%, and 113.43% on the IRSTD-1k subset
of the LangIR dataset, respectively.

TL;DR: RS-TinyNet improves tiny object detection in remote sensing by multi-stage feature fusion and enhancement, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tiny objects in remote sensing imagery are hard to detect due to limited spatial info, weak features, and dense backgrounds.

Method: RS-TinyNet uses tiny object saliency modeling and feature integrity reconstruction, with modules like MDCA, ARB, and PFDH.

Result: Achieves 4.0% AP and 6.5% AP75 improvements on AI-TOD and performs well on DIOR.

Conclusion: RS-TinyNet effectively addresses tiny object detection in complex remote sensing environments.

Abstract: Detecting tiny objects in remote sensing (RS) imagery has been a
long-standing challenge due to their extremely limited spatial information,
weak feature representations, and dense distributions across complex
backgrounds. Despite numerous efforts devoted, mainstream detectors still
underperform in such scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce RS-TinyNet, a
multi-stage feature fusion and enhancement model explicitly tailored for RS
tiny object detection in various RS scenarios. RS-TinyNet comes with two novel
designs: tiny object saliency modeling and feature integrity reconstruction.
Guided by these principles, we design three step-wise feature enhancement
modules. Among them, the multi-dimensional collaborative attention (MDCA)
module employs multi-dimensional attention to enhance the saliency of tiny
objects. Additionally, the auxiliary reversible branch (ARB) and a progressive
fusion detection head (PFDH) module are introduced to preserve information flow
and fuse multi-level features to bridge semantic gaps and retain structural
detail. Comprehensive experiments on public RS dataset AI-TOD show that our
RS-TinyNet surpasses existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) detectors by 4.0% AP and
6.5% AP75. Evaluations on DIOR benchmark dataset further validate its superior
detection performance in diverse RS scenarios. These results demonstrate that
the proposed multi-stage feature fusion strategy offers an effective and
practical solution for tiny object detection in complex RS environments.

Motivation: Addressing robustness, generalization, and efficiency challenges in learning-based monocular VO by leveraging DINOv2's features and enhancing them with fine-grained geometric details.

Method: Proposes DINO-VO, combining DINOv2's semantic features with a custom keypoints detector, geometric features, and a transformer-based matcher for precise pose estimation.

Result: Outperforms prior methods on TartanAir, KITTI, and EuRoC datasets, achieving 72 FPS with <1GB memory usage, and competes with Visual SLAM in outdoor scenarios.

Conclusion: DINO-VO demonstrates superior robustness, accuracy, and generalization in monocular VO, efficiently integrating foundation models for practical applications.

Abstract: Learning-based monocular visual odometry (VO) poses robustness,
generalization, and efficiency challenges in robotics. Recent advances in
visual foundation models, such as DINOv2, have improved robustness and
generalization in various vision tasks, yet their integration in VO remains
limited due to coarse feature granularity. In this paper, we present DINO-VO, a
feature-based VO system leveraging DINOv2 visual foundation model for its
sparse feature matching. To address the integration challenge, we propose a
salient keypoints detector tailored to DINOv2's coarse features. Furthermore,
we complement DINOv2's robust-semantic features with fine-grained geometric
features, resulting in more localizable representations. Finally, a
transformer-based matcher and differentiable pose estimation layer enable
precise camera motion estimation by learning good matches. Against prior
detector-descriptor networks like SuperPoint, DINO-VO demonstrates greater
robustness in challenging environments. Furthermore, we show superior accuracy
and generalization of the proposed feature descriptors against standalone
DINOv2 coarse features. DINO-VO outperforms prior frame-to-frame VO methods on
the TartanAir and KITTI datasets and is competitive on EuRoC dataset, while
running efficiently at 72 FPS with less than 1GB of memory usage on a single
GPU. Moreover, it performs competitively against Visual SLAM systems on outdoor
driving scenarios, showcasing its generalization capabilities.

TL;DR: SE-VLN is a self-evolving VLN framework using multimodal LLMs, improving navigation success rates by learning from experience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLN methods lack evolutionary capacity due to fixed knowledge in LLMs, limiting experiential learning.

Method: SE-VLN includes hierarchical memory, retrieval-augmented reasoning, and reflection modules for continuous evolution.

Result: Achieved 57% and 35.2% success rates in unseen environments, outperforming SOTA by 23.9% and 15.0%.

Conclusion: SE-VLN demonstrates potential as a self-evolving framework, improving with experience.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language navigation (VLN) were mainly attributed to
emerging large language models (LLMs). These methods exhibited excellent
generalization capabilities in instruction understanding and task reasoning.
However, they were constrained by the fixed knowledge bases and reasoning
abilities of LLMs, preventing fully incorporating experiential knowledge and
thus resulting in a lack of efficient evolutionary capacity. To address this,
we drew inspiration from the evolution capabilities of natural agents, and
proposed a self-evolving VLN framework (SE-VLN) to endow VLN agents with the
ability to continuously evolve during testing. To the best of our knowledge, it
was the first time that an multimodal LLM-powered self-evolving VLN framework
was proposed. Specifically, SE-VLN comprised three core modules, i.e., a
hierarchical memory module to transfer successful and failure cases into
reusable knowledge, a retrieval-augmented thought-based reasoning module to
retrieve experience and enable multi-step decision-making, and a reflection
module to realize continual evolution. Comprehensive tests illustrated that the
SE-VLN achieved navigation success rates of 57% and 35.2% in unseen
environments, representing absolute performance improvements of 23.9% and 15.0%
over current state-of-the-art methods on R2R and REVERSE datasets,
respectively. Moreover, the SE-VLN showed performance improvement with
increasing experience repository, elucidating its great potential as a
self-evolving agent framework for VLN.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A model for autonomous driving achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal design and no extra sensors, excelling in challenging scenarios like urban traffic. A comparison favors continuous autoregressive models over discrete token models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of existing world models in autonomous driving, particularly in long-horizon generation and generalization to difficult scenarios.

Method: Develops a model with simple design choices, no additional supervision or sensors, and compares discrete token models with continuous autoregressive models using a hybrid tokenizer.

Result: The model performs exceptionally well in challenging scenarios (e.g., turning maneuvers, urban traffic) and the continuous autoregressive model outperforms the discrete token model.

Conclusion: Continuous autoregressive models are more robust and powerful than discrete token models for autonomous driving world models.

Abstract: Existing world models for autonomous driving struggle with long-horizon
generation and generalization to challenging scenarios. In this work, we
develop a model using simple design choices, and without additional supervision
or sensors, such as maps, depth, or multiple cameras. We show that our model
yields state-of-the-art performance, despite having only 469M parameters and
being trained on 280h of video data. It particularly stands out in difficult
scenarios like turning maneuvers and urban traffic. We test whether discrete
token models possibly have advantages over continuous models based on flow
matching. To this end, we set up a hybrid tokenizer that is compatible with
both approaches and allows for a side-by-side comparison. Our study concludes
in favor of the continuous autoregressive model, which is less brittle on
individual design choices and more powerful than the model built on discrete
tokens. Code, models and qualitative results are publicly available at

*Hongyang Zhao,Tianyu Liang,Sina Davari,Daeho Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method using Midjourney to generate synthetic images for construction worker detection addresses data scarcity in DNN training, showing promising results on real datasets but highlighting limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle the challenge of inadequate data diversity and volume in the construction domain for DNN training.

Method: Generates 12,000 synthetic images using 3,000 prompts via Midjourney, focusing on realism and diversity, then manually labels them for DNN training.

Result: Achieved APs of 0.937 (IoU 0.5) and 0.642 (IoU 0.5-0.95) on real data; near-perfect APs (0.994, 0.919) on synthetic data.

Conclusion: Generative AI shows potential for addressing data scarcity but has weaknesses, as performance varies between synthetic and real datasets.

Abstract: While recent advancements in deep neural networks (DNNs) have substantially
enhanced visual AI's capabilities, the challenge of inadequate data diversity
and volume remains, particularly in construction domain. This study presents a
novel image synthesis methodology tailored for construction worker detection,
leveraging the generative-AI platform Midjourney. The approach entails
generating a collection of 12,000 synthetic images by formulating 3000
different prompts, with an emphasis on image realism and diversity. These
images, after manual labeling, serve as a dataset for DNN training. Evaluation
on a real construction image dataset yielded promising results, with the model
attaining average precisions (APs) of 0.937 and 0.642 at
intersection-over-union (IoU) thresholds of 0.5 and 0.5 to 0.95, respectively.
Notably, the model demonstrated near-perfect performance on the synthetic
dataset, achieving APs of 0.994 and 0.919 at the two mentioned thresholds.
These findings reveal both the potential and weakness of generative AI in
addressing DNN training data scarcity.

*Keerthi Veeramachaneni,Praveen Tirupattur,Amrit Singh Bedi,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method using pre-trained visual models detects AI-generated videos with high accuracy, addressing the gap beyond deepfake detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of indistinguishable AI-generated videos necessitates robust detection methods to combat misinformation, privacy breaches, and security threats.

Method: Leverages features from pre-trained visual models and adds a linear classification layer for distinguishing real from AI-generated videos.

Result: Achieves over 90% detection accuracy on a dataset of 10,000 AI-generated and 4,000 real videos.

Conclusion: The approach is effective and scalable, with plans to release code, models, and dataset to aid further research.

Abstract: Recent advances in Generative AI (GenAI) have led to significant improvements
in the quality of generated visual content. As AI-generated visual content
becomes increasingly indistinguishable from real content, the challenge of
detecting the generated content becomes critical in combating misinformation,
ensuring privacy, and preventing security threats. Although there has been
substantial progress in detecting AI-generated images, current methods for
video detection are largely focused on deepfakes, which primarily involve human
faces. However, the field of video generation has advanced beyond DeepFakes,
creating an urgent need for methods capable of detecting AI-generated videos
with generic content. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that
leverages pre-trained visual models to distinguish between real and generated
videos. The features extracted from these pre-trained models, which have been
trained on extensive real visual content, contain inherent signals that can
help distinguish real from generated videos. Using these extracted features, we
achieve high detection performance without requiring additional model training,
and we further improve performance by training a simple linear classification
layer on top of the extracted features. We validated our method on a dataset we
compiled (VID-AID), which includes around 10,000 AI-generated videos produced
by 9 different text-to-video models, along with 4,000 real videos, totaling
over 7 hours of video content. Our evaluation shows that our approach achieves
high detection accuracy, above 90% on average, underscoring its effectiveness.
Upon acceptance, we plan to publicly release the code, the pre-trained models,
and our dataset to support ongoing research in this critical area.

*Junhong Min,Youngpil Jeon,Jimin Kim,Minyong Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: $S^2M^2$ is a global stereo matching model that balances accuracy and efficiency, outperforming benchmarks without dataset-specific tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between local search methods (limited generalization) and global architectures (historically inefficient).

Method: Uses a multi-resolution transformer and novel loss function for robust long-range correspondence and joint disparity, occlusion, and confidence estimation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on Middlebury v3 and ETH3D benchmarks with competitive efficiency.

Conclusion: $S^2M^2$ resolves the generalization-efficiency trade-off, setting a new standard in stereo matching.

Abstract: The pursuit of a generalizable stereo matching model, capable of performing
across varying resolutions and disparity ranges without dataset-specific
fine-tuning, has revealed a fundamental trade-off. Iterative local search
methods achieve high scores on constrained benchmarks, but their core mechanism
inherently limits the global consistency required for true generalization. On
the other hand, global matching architectures, while theoretically more robust,
have been historically rendered infeasible by prohibitive computational and
memory costs. We resolve this dilemma with $S^2M^2$: a global matching
architecture that achieves both state-of-the-art accuracy and high efficiency
without relying on cost volume filtering or deep refinement stacks. Our design
integrates a multi-resolution transformer for robust long-range correspondence,
trained with a novel loss function that concentrates probability on feasible
matches. This approach enables a more robust joint estimation of disparity,
occlusion, and confidence. $S^2M^2$ establishes a new state of the art on the
Middlebury v3 and ETH3D benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior methods
across most metrics while reconstructing high-quality details with competitive
efficiency.

### [77] [VITA: Vision-to-Action Flow Matching Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13231)
*Dechen Gao,Boqi Zhao,Andrew Lee,Ian Chuang,Hanchu Zhou,Hang Wang,Zhe Zhao,Junshan Zhang,Iman Soltani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VITA introduces a Vision-To-Action flow matching policy that maps latent visual representations to actions, eliminating conditioning overheads and improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional flow matching policies require additional conditioning mechanisms for action generation, creating inefficiencies. VITA aims to streamline this by learning a direct vision-to-action mapping.

Method: VITA uses latent images as flow sources, structures action latent space via an autoencoder, and supervises flow matching with encoder targets and action outputs.

Result: VITA outperforms state-of-the-art generative policies, reducing inference latency by 50-130% and solving complex bi-manual tasks.

Conclusion: VITA is the first MLP-only flow matching policy effective for complex tasks, offering simplicity and efficiency.

Abstract: We present VITA, a Vision-To-Action flow matching policy that evolves latent
visual representations into latent actions for visuomotor control. Traditional
flow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions
(e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like
cross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating
time and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent
images as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action
while eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative
modeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different
modalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data
lacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional
visual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a
structured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,
up-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we
supervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs
through flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss
through sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end
learning. Implemented as simple MLP layers, VITA is evaluated on challenging
bi-manual manipulation tasks on the ALOHA platform, including 5 simulation and
2 real-world tasks. Despite its simplicity, MLP-only VITA outperforms or
matches state-of-the-art generative policies while reducing inference latency
by 50-130% compared to conventional flow matching policies requiring different
conditioning mechanisms or complex architectures. To our knowledge, VITA is the
first MLP-only flow matching policy capable of solving complex bi-manual
manipulation tasks like those in ALOHA benchmarks.

### [78] [Efficient Adaptation of Pre-trained Vision Transformer underpinned by Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13260)
*Yiting Yang,Hao Luo,Yuan Sun,Qingsen Yan,Haokui Zhang,Wei Dong,Guoqing Wang,Peng Wang,Yang Yang,Hengtao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (AOFT) strategy to enhance the generalization capability of fine-tuned Vision Transformers by aligning the properties of low-rank adaptation matrices with the backbone's orthogonality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The observation that pre-trained backbone weight matrices exhibit approximate orthogonality, which improves generalization, while fine-tuned low-rank matrices (e.g., LoRA, Adapter) lack this property.

Method: AOFT uses a single learnable vector to generate approximately orthogonal vectors for down/up-projection matrices, aligning them with the backbone's properties.

Result: AOFT achieves competitive performance in downstream image classification tasks, validating improved generalization.

Conclusion: AOFT effectively enhances generalization in fine-tuned ViTs by preserving orthogonality in low-rank adaptation matrices.

Abstract: A prevalent approach in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of pre-trained
Vision Transformers (ViT) involves freezing the majority of the backbone
parameters and solely learning low-rank adaptation weight matrices to
accommodate downstream tasks. These low-rank matrices are commonly derived
through the multiplication structure of down-projection and up-projection
matrices, exemplified by methods such as LoRA and Adapter. In this work, we
observe an approximate orthogonality among any two row or column vectors within
any weight matrix of the backbone parameters; however, this property is absent
in the vectors of the down/up-projection matrices. Approximate orthogonality
implies a reduction in the upper bound of the model's generalization error,
signifying that the model possesses enhanced generalization capability. If the
fine-tuned down/up-projection matrices were to exhibit this same property as
the pre-trained backbone matrices, could the generalization capability of
fine-tuned ViTs be further augmented? To address this question, we propose an
Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (AOFT) strategy for representing the
low-rank weight matrices. This strategy employs a single learnable vector to
generate a set of approximately orthogonal vectors, which form the
down/up-projection matrices, thereby aligning the properties of these matrices
with those of the backbone. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves competitive performance across a range of downstream image
classification tasks, confirming the efficacy of the enhanced generalization
capability embedded in the down/up-projection matrices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffClean uses a text-guided diffusion model to erase makeup traces, improving age verification accuracy and face verification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate age verification is needed to protect minors from accessing age-restricted online services, but makeup can fool verification systems.

Method: Proposes DiffClean, a text-guided diffusion model to remove makeup traces from images.

Result: Improves minor vs. adult accuracy by 4.8% and face verification TMR by 8.9% at FMR=0.01%.

Conclusion: DiffClean effectively defends against makeup attacks, enhancing age and face verification accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate age verification can protect underage users from unauthorized access
to online platforms and e-commerce sites that provide age-restricted services.
However, accurate age estimation can be confounded by several factors,
including facial makeup that can induce changes to alter perceived identity and
age to fool both humans and machines. In this work, we propose DiffClean which
erases makeup traces using a text-guided diffusion model to defend against
makeup attacks. DiffClean improves age estimation (minor vs. adult accuracy by
4.8%) and face verification (TMR by 8.9% at FMR=0.01%) over competing baselines
on digitally simulated and real makeup images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FashionPose is a text-to-pose-to-relighting framework for realistic garment visualization, enabling pose synthesis and lighting control via text input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack flexibility in pose and lighting for fashion e-commerce, requiring predefined poses and lacking illumination adaptability.

Method: FashionPose predicts 2D poses from text, generates high-fidelity images using a diffusion model, and applies a relighting module, all text-guided.

Result: The framework achieves fine-grained pose synthesis and consistent relighting, improving virtual fashion display.

Conclusion: FashionPose offers a practical, flexible solution for personalized garment visualization in e-commerce.

Abstract: Realistic and controllable garment visualization is critical for fashion
e-commerce, where users expect personalized previews under diverse poses and
lighting conditions. Existing methods often rely on predefined poses, limiting
semantic flexibility and illumination adaptability. To address this, we
introduce FashionPose, the first unified text-to-pose-to-relighting generation
framework. Given a natural language description, our method first predicts a 2D
human pose, then employs a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity person
images, and finally applies a lightweight relighting module, all guided by the
same textual input. By replacing explicit pose annotations with text-driven
conditioning, FashionPose enables accurate pose alignment, faithful garment
rendering, and flexible lighting control. Experiments demonstrate fine-grained
pose synthesis and efficient, consistent relighting, providing a practical
solution for personalized virtual fashion display.

TL;DR: The paper identifies reproducibility and quality issues in the RPE benchmark for pose-aware MLLMs, proposes refined GT annotations to address these, and releases them as an open-source resource.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address critical reproducibility and benchmark-quality issues in the RPE benchmark, which hinder fair and consistent evaluations of pose-aware MLLMs.

Method: Refined ground-truth annotations through meticulous visual matching and released them publicly.

Result: Improved reproducibility and reliability of evaluations by resolving issues like image redundancy, scenario imbalance, and ambiguous descriptions.

Conclusion: The refined annotations promote consistent quantitative evaluations and support future advancements in human pose-aware multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: The reasoning-based pose estimation (RPE) benchmark has emerged as a widely
adopted evaluation standard for pose-aware multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Despite its significance, we identified critical reproducibility and
benchmark-quality issues that hinder fair and consistent quantitative
evaluations. Most notably, the benchmark utilizes different image indices from
those of the original 3DPW dataset, forcing researchers into tedious and
error-prone manual matching processes to obtain accurate ground-truth (GT)
annotations for quantitative metrics (\eg, MPJPE, PA-MPJPE). Furthermore, our
analysis reveals several inherent benchmark-quality limitations, including
significant image redundancy, scenario imbalance, overly simplistic poses, and
ambiguous textual descriptions, collectively undermining reliable evaluations
across diverse scenarios. To alleviate manual effort and enhance
reproducibility, we carefully refined the GT annotations through meticulous
visual matching and publicly release these refined annotations as an
open-source resource, thereby promoting consistent quantitative evaluations and
facilitating future advancements in human pose-aware multimodal reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a real-time hand-object interaction detection system using a cascaded architecture with action recognition and object detection modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of fast and accurate hand-object interaction detection for intuitive user experiences in real-time applications.

Method: Combines an action recognition module (Mamba model with EfficientNetV2 backbone) and an object detection module (fine-tuned YOLOWorld) in a cascaded architecture.

Result: Achieves 38.52% p-AP for action recognition and 85.13% AP for hand and object detection on the ENIGMA-51 benchmark at 30fps.

Conclusion: The cascaded approach efficiently detects interactions by activating object detection only upon confirmed interaction, enabling real-time performance.

Abstract: Hand-object interaction detection remains an open challenge in real-time
applications, where intuitive user experiences depend on fast and accurate
detection of interactions with surrounding objects. We propose an efficient
approach for detecting hand-objects interactions from streaming egocentric
vision that operates in real time. Our approach consists of an action
recognition module and an object detection module for identifying active
objects upon confirmed interaction. Our Mamba model with EfficientNetV2 as
backbone for action recognition achieves 38.52% p-AP on the ENIGMA-51 benchmark
at 30fps, while our fine-tuned YOLOWorld reaches 85.13% AP for hand and object.
We implement our models in a cascaded architecture where the action recognition
and object detection modules operate sequentially. When the action recognition
predicts a contact state, it activates the object detection module, which in
turn performs inference on the relevant frame to detect and classify the active
object.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational cost of Diffusion Transformers (DiT) makes them impractical for resource-constrained devices like smartphones.

Method: 1. Compressed VAE for dimensionality reduction. 2. KD-guided tri-level pruning. 3. Adversarial step distillation to reduce inference steps.

Result: Achieves over 10 FPS on iPhone 16 Pro Max, enabling real-time video generation.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of high-quality, real-time video generation on mobile platforms.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have shown strong performance in video
generation tasks, but their high computational cost makes them impractical for
resource-constrained devices like smartphones, and real-time generation is even
more challenging. In this work, we propose a series of novel optimizations to
significantly accelerate video generation and enable real-time performance on
mobile platforms. First, we employ a highly compressed variational autoencoder
(VAE) to reduce the dimensionality of the input data without sacrificing visual
quality. Second, we introduce a KD-guided, sensitivity-aware tri-level pruning
strategy to shrink the model size to suit mobile platform while preserving
critical performance characteristics. Third, we develop an adversarial step
distillation technique tailored for DiT, which allows us to reduce the number
of inference steps to four. Combined, these optimizations enable our model to
achieve over 10 frames per second (FPS) generation on an iPhone 16 Pro Max,
demonstrating the feasibility of real-time, high-quality video generation on
mobile devices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a sliding iterative denoising process to improve spatio-temporal consistency in 4D diffusion models for high-fidelity human view synthesis from sparse-view videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 4D diffusion models for novel-view video generation lack spatio-temporal consistency, degrading synthesis quality.

Method: Uses a latent grid encoding image, camera pose, and human pose, denoised alternately along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ datasets, producing high-quality, consistent novel-view videos.

Conclusion: The sliding iterative denoising process enhances 4D consistency and GPU efficiency, improving view synthesis quality.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of high-fidelity view synthesis of humans
with sparse-view videos as input. Previous methods solve the issue of
insufficient observation by leveraging 4D diffusion models to generate videos
at novel viewpoints. However, the generated videos from these models often lack
spatio-temporal consistency, thus degrading view synthesis quality. In this
paper, we propose a novel sliding iterative denoising process to enhance the
spatio-temporal consistency of the 4D diffusion model. Specifically, we define
a latent grid in which each latent encodes the image, camera pose, and human
pose for a certain viewpoint and timestamp, then alternately denoising the
latent grid along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window, and
finally decode the videos at target viewpoints from the corresponding denoised
latents. Through the iterative sliding, information flows sufficiently across
the latent grid, allowing the diffusion model to obtain a large receptive field
and thus enhance the 4D consistency of the output, while making the GPU memory
consumption affordable. The experiments on the DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ
datasets demonstrate that our method is able to synthesize high-quality and
consistent novel-view videos and significantly outperforms the existing
approaches. See our project page for interactive demos and video results:

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective, efficient, and competitive with minimal implementation effort.

Abstract: In visual generation tasks, the responses and combinations of complex
concepts often lack stability and are error-prone, which remains an
under-explored area. In this paper, we attempt to explore the causal factors
for poor concept responses through elaborately designed experiments. We also
design a concept-wise equalization loss function (IMBA loss) to address this
issue. Our proposed method is online, eliminating the need for offline dataset

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoPartGen is an autoregressive model for generating 3D objects from parts, using inputs like images, masks, or existing 3D objects. It leverages a latent 3D representation for part-based generation and achieves state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable compositional 3D reconstruction from diverse inputs (images, masks, or 3D objects) by leveraging the compositional properties of a latent 3D space.

Method: AutoPartGen generates parts autoregressively, conditioning on prior parts and inputs (images, masks, or 3D objects), and stops when all parts are generated. It uses 3DShape2VecSet for latent representation.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D part generation, producing coherent objects without additional optimization.

Conclusion: AutoPartGen is effective for part-based 3D generation, demonstrating strong compositional capabilities and high-quality results.

Abstract: We introduce AutoPartGen, a model that generates objects composed of 3D parts
in an autoregressive manner. This model can take as input an image of an
object, 2D masks of the object's parts, or an existing 3D object, and generate
a corresponding compositional 3D reconstruction. Our approach builds upon
3DShape2VecSet, a recent latent 3D representation with powerful geometric
expressiveness. We observe that this latent space exhibits strong compositional
properties, making it particularly well-suited for part-based generation tasks.
Specifically, AutoPartGen generates object parts autoregressively, predicting
one part at a time while conditioning on previously generated parts and
additional inputs, such as 2D images, masks, or 3D objects. This process
continues until the model decides that all parts have been generated, thus
determining automatically the type and number of parts. The resulting parts can
be seamlessly assembled into coherent objects or scenes without requiring
additional optimization. We evaluate both the overall 3D generation
capabilities and the part-level generation quality of AutoPartGen,
demonstrating that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D part
generation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce $\pi^3$, a feed-forward neural network that offers a novel
approach to visual geometry reconstruction, breaking the reliance on a
conventional fixed reference view. Previous methods often anchor their
reconstructions to a designated viewpoint, an inductive bias that can lead to
instability and failures if the reference is suboptimal. In contrast, $\pi^3$
employs a fully permutation-equivariant architecture to predict
affine-invariant camera poses and scale-invariant local point maps without any
reference frames. This design makes our model inherently robust to input
ordering and highly scalable. These advantages enable our simple and bias-free
approach to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks,
including camera pose estimation, monocular/video depth estimation, and dense
point map reconstruction. Code and models are publicly available.

TL;DR: The paper introduces mini-batch couplings in hierarchical flow matching to adjust distribution complexity across hierarchy levels, improving performance on synthetic and imaging data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hierarchical flow matching captures multi-modal velocity fields but lacks complexity adjustment across hierarchy levels.

Method: Proposes mini-batch couplings to gradually adjust distribution complexity in hierarchical rectified flow matching.

Result: Demonstrates improved performance on synthetic and imaging data.

Conclusion: Mini-batch couplings enhance hierarchical flow matching by dynamically adjusting complexity, validated by empirical results.

Abstract: Flow matching has emerged as a compelling generative modeling approach that
is widely used across domains. To generate data via a flow matching model, an
ordinary differential equation (ODE) is numerically solved via forward
integration of the modeled velocity field. To better capture the multi-modality
that is inherent in typical velocity fields, hierarchical flow matching was
recently introduced. It uses a hierarchy of ODEs that are numerically
integrated when generating data. This hierarchy of ODEs captures the
multi-modal velocity distribution just like vanilla flow matching is capable of
modeling a multi-modal data distribution. While this hierarchy enables to model
multi-modal velocity distributions, the complexity of the modeled distribution
remains identical across levels of the hierarchy. In this paper, we study how
to gradually adjust the complexity of the distributions across different levels
of the hierarchy via mini-batch couplings. We show the benefits of mini-batch
couplings in hierarchical rectified flow matching via compelling results on
synthetic and imaging data. Code is available at

TL;DR: VideoITG improves Video-LLMs by aligning frame selection with user instructions via the VidThinker pipeline, achieving better performance in video understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for frame selection in videos struggle with complex scenarios in long video understanding, lacking alignment with user instructions.

Method: Proposes VideoITG with VidThinker pipeline: generates clip-level captions, retrieves relevant segments, and selects informative frames. Uses VideoITG-40K dataset and a plug-and-play model for discriminative frame selection.

Result: VideoITG consistently improves performance across multimodal video benchmarks.

Conclusion: VideoITG demonstrates superior potential for enhancing video understanding by aligning frame selection with instructions.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that selecting informative and relevant video
frames can significantly improve the performance of Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs). Current methods, such as reducing inter-frame redundancy,
employing separate models for image-text relevance assessment, or utilizing
temporal video grounding for event localization, substantially adopt
unsupervised learning paradigms, whereas they struggle to address the complex
scenarios in long video understanding. We propose Instructed Temporal Grounding
for Videos (VideoITG), featuring customized frame sampling aligned with user
instructions. The core of VideoITG is the VidThinker pipeline, an automated
annotation framework that explicitly mimics the human annotation process.
First, it generates detailed clip-level captions conditioned on the
instruction; then, it retrieves relevant video segments through
instruction-guided reasoning; finally, it performs fine-grained frame selection
to pinpoint the most informative visual evidence. Leveraging VidThinker, we
construct the VideoITG-40K dataset, containing 40K videos and 500K instructed
temporal grounding annotations. We then design a plug-and-play VideoITG model,
which takes advantage of visual language alignment and reasoning capabilities
of Video-LLMs, for effective frame selection in a discriminative manner.
Coupled with Video-LLMs, VideoITG achieves consistent performance improvements
across multiple multimodal video understanding benchmarks, showing its
superiority and great potentials for video understanding.

### [90] [AI-Powered Math Tutoring: Platform for Personalized and Adaptive Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12484)
*Jarosław A. Chudziak,Adam Kostka*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-agent AI tutoring platform for mathematics, addressing limitations of reactive AI systems by offering personalized, structured, and tool-assisted learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI tutoring systems lack deep reflection and pedagogical structure, especially in mathematics. The research aims to enhance AI tutoring by enabling individualized and modular learning experiences.

Method: A novel multi-agent AI tutoring platform is developed, integrating adaptive feedback, structured course generation, and textbook knowledge retrieval.

Result: The platform supports personalized learning, targeted weakness identification, effective exam revision, and unlimited personalized exercises.

Conclusion: The research advances AI in education by combining pedagogical agents and AI-driven components for modular and effective mathematics teaching.

Abstract: The growing ubiquity of artificial intelligence (AI), in particular large
language models (LLMs), has profoundly altered the way in which learners gain
knowledge and interact with learning material, with many claiming that AI
positively influences their learning achievements. Despite this advancement,
current AI tutoring systems face limitations associated with their reactive
nature, often providing direct answers without encouraging deep reflection or
incorporating structured pedagogical tools and strategies. This limitation is
most apparent in the field of mathematics, in which AI tutoring systems remain
underdeveloped. This research addresses the question: How can AI tutoring
systems move beyond providing reactive assistance to enable structured,
individualized, and tool-assisted learning experiences? We introduce a novel
multi-agent AI tutoring platform that combines adaptive and personalized
feedback, structured course generation, and textbook knowledge retrieval to
enable modular, tool-assisted learning processes. This system allows students
to learn new topics while identifying and targeting their weaknesses, revise
for exams effectively, and practice on an unlimited number of personalized
exercises. This article contributes to the field of artificial intelligence in
education by introducing a novel platform that brings together pedagogical
agents and AI-driven components, augmenting the field with modular and
effective systems for teaching mathematics.

### [91] [MR-LDM -- The Merge-Reactive Longitudinal Decision Model: Game Theoretic Human Decision Modeling for Interactive Sim Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12494)
*Dustin Holley,Jovin D'sa,Hossein Nourkhiz Mahjoub,Gibran Ali*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a game-theoretic model for simulating realistic highway merging behavior in autonomous vehicle development, combining tactical decision-making with dynamics for explainable and efficient simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing simulation environments to replicate real-world driver behavior is crucial for autonomous vehicle technology, especially in highway merging scenarios.

Method: A game-theoretic model for tactical decision-making with improved payoff functions and lag actions, coupled with an underlying dynamics model for unified decision and dynamics.

Result: The model showed good reproducibility of complex interactions in validation and was efficiently integrated into high-fidelity simulations.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively simulates realistic highway merging interactions, supporting autonomous vehicle development with explainable and efficient simulations.

Abstract: Enhancing simulation environments to replicate real-world driver behavior,
i.e., more humanlike sim agents, is essential for developing autonomous vehicle
technology. In the context of highway merging, previous works have studied the
operational-level yielding dynamics of lag vehicles in response to a merging
car at highway on-ramps. Other works focusing on tactical decision modeling
generally consider limited action sets or utilize payoff functions with large
parameter sets and limited payoff bounds. In this work, we aim to improve the
simulation of the highway merge scenario by targeting a game theoretic model
for tactical decision-making with improved payoff functions and lag actions. We
couple this with an underlying dynamics model to have a unified decision and
dynamics model that can capture merging interactions and simulate more
realistic interactions in an explainable and interpretable fashion. The
proposed model demonstrated good reproducibility of complex interactions when
validated on a real-world dataset. The model was finally integrated into a high
fidelity simulation environment and confirmed to have adequate computation time
efficiency for use in large-scale simulations to support autonomous vehicle
development.

### [92] [A Survey of Explainable Reinforcement Learning: Targets, Methods and Needs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12599)
*Léo Saulières*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reviews eXplainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL), proposing a 'What' and 'How' taxonomy to categorize methods and reviewing over 250 papers. It highlights adjacent domains and identifies future needs for XRL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The opacity of AI models, especially deep neural networks, necessitates explainability. XRL specifically addresses explaining actions of reinforcement learning agents.

Method: The authors propose a taxonomy based on 'What' (explanation target) and 'How' (explanation method) to categorize XRL approaches, reviewing 250+ papers.

Result: A comprehensive taxonomy and state-of-the-art review of XRL methods, along with identified adjacent domains and field needs.

Conclusion: The paper provides a structured overview of XRL, emphasizing its importance and suggesting future research directions.

Abstract: The success of recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) models has been
accompanied by the opacity of their internal mechanisms, due notably to the use
of deep neural networks. In order to understand these internal mechanisms and
explain the output of these AI models, a set of methods have been proposed,
grouped under the domain of eXplainable AI (XAI). This paper focuses on a
sub-domain of XAI, called eXplainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL), which aims
to explain the actions of an agent that has learned by reinforcement learning.
We propose an intuitive taxonomy based on two questions "What" and "How". The
first question focuses on the target that the method explains, while the second
relates to the way the explanation is provided. We use this taxonomy to provide
a state-of-the-art review of over 250 papers. In addition, we present a set of
domains close to XRL, which we believe should get attention from the community.
Finally, we identify some needs for the field of XRL.

### [93] [Fly, Fail, Fix: Iterative Game Repair with Reinforcement Learning and Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12666)
*Alex Zook,Josef Spjut,Jonathan Tremblay*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An automated framework pairs RL agents for playtesting with LMMs for game revision, enabling iterative refinement of game mechanics based on player behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern generative systems fail to capture dynamic player behavior from static rules and content, necessitating a better approach.

Method: Uses RL agents to playtest and generate metrics/image strips, which LMMs analyze to revise game configurations iteratively.

Result: LMMs effectively reason over RL-generated behavioral traces to refine game mechanics.

Conclusion: The framework offers scalable, practical tools for AI-assisted game design.

Abstract: Game design hinges on understanding how static rules and content translate
into dynamic player behavior - something modern generative systems that inspect
only a game's code or assets struggle to capture. We present an automated
design iteration framework that closes this gap by pairing a reinforcement
learning (RL) agent, which playtests the game, with a large multimodal model
(LMM), which revises the game based on what the agent does. In each loop the RL
player completes several episodes, producing (i) numerical play metrics and/or
(ii) a compact image strip summarising recent video frames. The LMM designer
receives a gameplay goal and the current game configuration, analyses the play
traces, and edits the configuration to steer future behaviour toward the goal.
We demonstrate results that LMMs can reason over behavioral traces supplied by
RL agents to iteratively refine game mechanics, pointing toward practical,
scalable tools for AI-assisted game design.

### [94] [Benchmarking Deception Probes via Black-to-White Performance Boosts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12691)
*Avi Parrack,Carlo Leonardo Attubato,Stefan Heimersheim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates deception probes in AI assistants, comparing white-box and black-box monitoring to assess their effectiveness and resistance to evasion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the practical effectiveness of deception probes in detecting AI deception and their vulnerability to evasion strategies.

Method: Comparison of white-box (access to token-level probe activations) and black-box monitoring (no such access), measuring the black-to-white performance boost.

Result: Weak but encouraging black-to-white performance boosts observed from existing deception probes.

Conclusion: Deception probes show promise but require further improvement for robust detection of AI deception.

Abstract: AI assistants will occasionally respond deceptively to user queries.
Recently, linear classifiers (called "deception probes") have been trained to
distinguish the internal activations of a language model during deceptive
versus honest responses. However, it's unclear how effective these probes are
at detecting deception in practice, nor whether such probes are resistant to
simple counter strategies from a deceptive assistant who wishes to evade
detection. In this paper, we compare white-box monitoring (where the monitor
has access to token-level probe activations) to black-box monitoring (without
such access). We benchmark deception probes by the extent to which the white
box monitor outperforms the black-box monitor, i.e. the black-to-white
performance boost. We find weak but encouraging black-to-white performance
boosts from existing deception probes.

### [95] [Imitating Mistakes in a Learning Companion AI Agent for Online Peer Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12801)
*Sosui Moribe,Taketoshi Ushiama*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study develops an AI Agent for peer learning in English composition, targeting learners with similar proficiency levels to enhance effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Peer learning is effective but limited by human constraints; an AI companion could overcome these limitations by matching proficiency levels.

Method: Focuses on English composition, assuming peers at the same level make similar mistakes, and validates this with an AI Agent.

Result: The approach aims to confirm that AI can effectively simulate peer learning by replicating human-like mistakes.

Conclusion: An AI Agent could provide scalable, anytime-anywhere peer learning, addressing human limitations.

Abstract: In recent years, peer learning has gained attention as a method that promotes
spontaneous thinking among learners, and its effectiveness has been confirmed
by numerous studies. This study aims to develop an AI Agent as a learning
companion that enables peer learning anytime and anywhere. However, peer
learning between humans has various limitations, and it is not always
effective. Effective peer learning requires companions at the same proficiency
levels. In this study, we assume that a learner's peers with the same
proficiency level as the learner make the same mistakes as the learner does and
focus on English composition as a specific example to validate this approach.

### [98] [Assessing adaptive world models in machines with novel games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12821)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper advocates for a new evaluation framework for AI world models, inspired by human adaptability, using novel games to assess rapid learning and adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI world models lack the dynamic adaptability seen in human intelligence, which efficiently constructs and refines representations through interaction.

Method: Proposes a benchmarking paradigm using novel games with deep, continually refreshing novelty to evaluate rapid world model induction.

Result: Introduces key desiderata for game design and metrics to explicitly test AI's adaptive learning capabilities.

Conclusion: The framework aims to advance AI towards human-like rapid adaptation and robust generalization, a step towards artificial general intelligence.

Abstract: Human intelligence exhibits a remarkable capacity for rapid adaptation and
effective problem-solving in novel and unfamiliar contexts. We argue that this
profound adaptability is fundamentally linked to the efficient construction and
refinement of internal representations of the environment, commonly referred to
as world models, and we refer to this adaptation mechanism as world model
induction. However, current understanding and evaluation of world models in
artificial intelligence (AI) remains narrow, often focusing on static
representations learned from training on a massive corpora of data, instead of
the efficiency and efficacy of models in learning these representations through
interaction and exploration within a novel environment. In this Perspective, we
provide a view of world model induction drawing on decades of research in
cognitive science on how humans learn and adapt so efficiently; we then call
for a new evaluation framework for assessing adaptive world models in AI.
Concretely, we propose a new benchmarking paradigm based on suites of carefully
designed games with genuine, deep and continually refreshing novelty in the
underlying game structures -- we refer to this kind of games as novel games. We
detail key desiderata for constructing these games and propose appropriate
metrics to explicitly challenge and evaluate the agent's ability for rapid
world model induction. We hope that this new evaluation framework will inspire
future evaluation efforts on world models in AI and provide a crucial step
towards developing AI systems capable of the human-like rapid adaptation and
robust generalization -- a critical component of artificial general
intelligence.

### [99] [Information-Theoretic Aggregation of Ethical Attributes in Simulated-Command](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12862)
*Hussein Abbass,Taylan Akay,Harrison Tolley*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes moving human judgment outside the simulation cycle by designing ethical metrics upfront, allowing AI to explore scenarios and present options for human selection. It focuses on dynamically weighting ethical attributes during simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human judgment is impractical for large-scale scenario simulations due to workload and timeliness. The paper aims to automate ethical decision-making within simulations while retaining human oversight.

Method: Human commanders design ethical metrics; AI explores the metric space in simulations. The paper adapts multi-criteria decision-making methods, using entropy-based approaches to dynamically weight ethical attributes.

Result: The approach enables efficient exploration of ethical decision spaces in simulations, reducing human workload while maintaining ethical oversight.

Conclusion: Automating ethical weighting in simulations balances efficiency and ethical considerations, with human judgment reserved for final decision-making.

Abstract: In the age of AI, human commanders need to use the computational powers
available in today's environment to simulate a very large number of scenarios.
Within each scenario, situations occur where different decision design options
could have ethical consequences. Making these decisions reliant on human
judgement is both counter-productive to the aim of exploring very large number
of scenarios in a timely manner and infeasible when considering the workload
needed to involve humans in each of these choices. In this paper, we move human
judgement outside the simulation decision cycle. Basically, the human will
design the ethical metric space, leaving it to the simulated environment to
explore the space. When the simulation completes its testing cycles, the
testing environment will come back to the human commander with a few options to
select from. The human commander will then exercise human-judgement to select
the most appropriate course of action, which will then get executed
accordingly. We assume that the problem of designing metrics that are
sufficiently granular to assess the ethical implications of decisions is
solved. Subsequently, the fundamental problem we look at in this paper is how
to weight ethical decisions during the running of these simulations; that is,
how to dynamically weight the ethical attributes when agents are faced with
decision options with ethical implications during generative simulations. The
multi-criteria decision making literature has started to look at nearby
problems, where the concept of entropy has been used to determine the weights
during aggregation. We draw from that literature different approaches to
automatically calculate the weights for ethical attributes during
simulation-based testing and evaluation.

### [100] [Manipulation Attacks by Misaligned AI: Risk Analysis and Safety Case Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12872)
*Rishane Dassanayake,Mario Demetroudi,James Walpole,Lindley Lentati,Jason R. Brown,Edward James Young*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper highlights the growing threat of AI systems manipulating humans, proposes a framework to assess and mitigate these risks, and provides actionable methodologies for AI companies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of AI capabilities in persuasion and deception poses significant risks, especially in cybersecurity, yet manipulation attacks remain understudied.

Method: The authors introduce a safety case framework structured around three arguments: inability, control, and trustworthiness, with evidence requirements and evaluation methodologies.

Result: The paper offers the first systematic approach to integrating manipulation risk into AI safety governance, providing practical tools for risk assessment and mitigation.

Conclusion: The framework equips AI companies with a concrete methodology to address manipulation risks before deployment, enhancing overall AI safety.

Abstract: Frontier AI systems are rapidly advancing in their capabilities to persuade,
deceive, and influence human behaviour, with current models already
demonstrating human-level persuasion and strategic deception in specific
contexts. Humans are often the weakest link in cybersecurity systems, and a
misaligned AI system deployed internally within a frontier company may seek to
undermine human oversight by manipulating employees. Despite this growing
threat, manipulation attacks have received little attention, and no systematic
framework exists for assessing and mitigating these risks. To address this, we
provide a detailed explanation of why manipulation attacks are a significant
threat and could lead to catastrophic outcomes. Additionally, we present a
safety case framework for manipulation risk, structured around three core lines
of argument: inability, control, and trustworthiness. For each argument, we
specify evidence requirements, evaluation methodologies, and implementation
considerations for direct application by AI companies. This paper provides the
first systematic methodology for integrating manipulation risk into AI safety
governance, offering AI companies a concrete foundation to assess and mitigate
these threats before deployment.

### [101] [VAR-MATH: Probing True Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models via Symbolic Multi-Instance Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12885)
*Jian Yao,Ran Cheng,Kay Chen Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces VAR-MATH, a symbolic evaluation framework to assess true reasoning in LLMs, revealing performance drops in RL-trained models on variabilized benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if RL improvements in LLMs reflect genuine reasoning or overfitting to benchmarks, addressing issues like benchmark contamination and evaluation fragility.

Method: Developed VAR-MATH, a framework converting fixed numerical problems into symbolic templates to test reasoning consistency across variants.

Result: RL-trained models showed significant performance drops (48.0% on AMC23, 58.3% on AIME24) on variabilized benchmarks, indicating reliance on superficial heuristics.

Conclusion: VAR-MATH provides a robust, contamination-resistant evaluation method, highlighting the limitations of current RL approaches in mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to substantial
improvements in the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs), as measured by standard benchmarks. However, these gains often persist
even when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted
rewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true
reasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific
patterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective
and identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First,
\emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test
problems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \emph{evaluation
fragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are
highly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning
consistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic
evaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting
fixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve
multiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across
structurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and
improving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular
benchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and
VAR-AIME24. Experimental results reveal substantial performance drops for
RL-trained models on the variabilized versions, especially for smaller models,
with average declines of 48.0\% on AMC23 and 58.3\% on AIME24. These findings
suggest that many existing RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail
to generalize beyond specific numerical forms. Overall, VAR-MATH offers a
principled, contamination-resistant evaluation paradigm for mathematical
reasoning.

### [102] [A Translation of Probabilistic Event Calculus into Markov Decision Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12989)
*Lyris Xu,Fabio Aurelio D'Asaro,Luke Dickens*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a translation of Probabilistic Event Calculus (PEC) into Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) to enable goal-directed reasoning while preserving interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PEC lacks mechanisms for goal-directed reasoning, limiting its utility in planning tasks.

Method: Develops a formal translation of PEC domains into MDPs, introducing 'action-taking situations' to retain PEC's flexible action semantics.

Result: The PEC-MDP formalism allows leveraging MDP tools for PEC domains, supporting temporal reasoning and planning.

Conclusion: The translation extends PEC's capabilities while maintaining interpretability, enabling human-readable policy representations.

Abstract: Probabilistic Event Calculus (PEC) is a logical framework for reasoning about
actions and their effects in uncertain environments, which enables the
representation of probabilistic narratives and computation of temporal
projections. The PEC formalism offers significant advantages in
interpretability and expressiveness for narrative reasoning. However, it lacks
mechanisms for goal-directed reasoning. This paper bridges this gap by
developing a formal translation of PEC domains into Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs), introducing the concept of "action-taking situations" to preserve PEC's
flexible action semantics. The resulting PEC-MDP formalism enables the
extensive collection of algorithms and theoretical tools developed for MDPs to
be applied to PEC's interpretable narrative domains. We demonstrate how the
translation supports both temporal reasoning tasks and objective-driven
planning, with methods for mapping learned policies back into human-readable
PEC representations, maintaining interpretability while extending PEC's
capabilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: X-MILP is a domain-agnostic method for generating contrastive explanations for MILPs using constraint reasoning and IIS to build a 'graph of reasons.'


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for trustworthy AI by developing contrastive explanations for MILPs to enhance decision-making transparency.

Method: Encode user queries as constraints, compute IIS to identify reasons, and represent explanations as a 'graph of reasons.'

Result: Tested on well-known optimization problems to evaluate empirical hardness of explanation computation.

Conclusion: X-MILP effectively provides structured contrastive explanations for MILPs, aiding user understanding.

Abstract: Following the recent push for trustworthy AI, there has been an increasing
interest in developing contrastive explanation techniques for optimisation,
especially concerning the solution of specific decision-making processes
formalised as MILPs. Along these lines, we propose X-MILP, a domain-agnostic
approach for building contrastive explanations for MILPs based on constraint
reasoning techniques. First, we show how to encode the queries a user makes
about the solution of an MILP problem as additional constraints. Then, we
determine the reasons that constitute the answer to the user's query by
computing the Irreducible Infeasible Subsystem (IIS) of the newly obtained set
of constraints. Finally, we represent our explanation as a "graph of reasons"
constructed from the IIS, which helps the user understand the structure among
the reasons that answer their query. We test our method on instances of
well-known optimisation problems to evaluate the empirical hardness of
computing explanations.

California Highway 78 over a five-month period from July to November 2022,
analyzing a 7.24 km westbound section connecting "Melrose Dr" and "El-Camino
Real" in the San Diego area. The study employed Multiple Linear Regression
(MLR) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms, analyzing data collection intervals
ranging from 30 seconds to 15 minutes. Using R^2, MAE, and RMSE as performance

### [105] [From Roots to Rewards: Dynamic Tree Reasoning with RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13142)
*Ahmed Bahloul,Simon Malberg*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A dynamic reinforcement learning framework improves tree-structured reasoning by enabling adaptive construction and selective resource allocation, addressing limitations of static methods like ProbTree.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern language models struggle with error propagation and knowledge integration in complex question answering, despite advances like CoT reasoning and retrieval augmentation. Static tree-structured methods like ProbTree have limitations in adaptability and computational efficiency.

Method: The paper introduces a dynamic reinforcement learning framework that incrementally constructs reasoning trees using real-time confidence estimates and learns optimal policies for action selection (decomposition, retrieval, or aggregation).

Result: The approach maintains ProbTree's probabilistic rigor while enhancing solution quality and computational efficiency through adaptive expansion and focused resource allocation.

Conclusion: This work establishes a new paradigm for tree-structured reasoning, balancing probabilistic reliability with the flexibility needed for real-world question answering.

Abstract: Modern language models address complex questions through chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning (Wei et al., 2023) and retrieval augmentation (Lewis et al.,
2021), yet struggle with error propagation and knowledge integration.
Tree-structured reasoning methods, particularly the Probabilistic
Tree-of-Thought (ProbTree)(Cao et al., 2023) framework, mitigate these issues
by decomposing questions into hierarchical structures and selecting answers
through confidence-weighted aggregation of parametric and retrieved knowledge
(Yao et al., 2023). However, ProbTree's static implementation introduces two
key limitations: (1) the reasoning tree is fixed during the initial
construction phase, preventing dynamic adaptation to intermediate results, and
(2) each node requires exhaustive evaluation of all possible solution
strategies, creating computational inefficiency. We present a dynamic
reinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto, 2018) framework that transforms
tree-based reasoning into an adaptive process. Our approach incrementally
constructs the reasoning tree based on real-time confidence estimates, while
learning optimal policies for action selection (decomposition, retrieval, or
aggregation). This maintains ProbTree's probabilistic rigor while improving
both solution quality and computational efficiency through selective expansion
and focused resource allocation. The work establishes a new paradigm for
treestructured reasoning that balances the reliability of probabilistic
frameworks with the flexibility required for real-world question answering
systems.

### [106] [Black Box Deployed -- Functional Criteria for Artificial Moral Agents in the LLM Era](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13175)
*Matthew E. Brophy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes revising ethical criteria for evaluating LLM-based artificial moral agents (AMAs) due to their opaque nature, introducing ten new functional criteria for better alignment and societal integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ethical frameworks for AMAs assume transparent architectures, which are incompatible with the stochastic and opaque nature of LLMs. This necessitates updated criteria.

Method: The paper introduces ten revised functional criteria for evaluating LLM-based AMAs, illustrated through hypothetical scenarios like an autonomous public bus (APB).

Result: The proposed criteria (e.g., moral concordance, trustworthiness) aim to improve the alignment and societal integration of LLM-based AMAs.

Conclusion: The revised criteria provide a pragmatic framework for evaluating LLM-based AMAs, addressing the limitations of traditional approaches.

Abstract: The advancement of powerful yet opaque large language models (LLMs)
necessitates a fundamental revision of the philosophical criteria used to
evaluate artificial moral agents (AMAs). Pre-LLM frameworks often relied on the
assumption of transparent architectures, which LLMs defy due to their
stochastic outputs and opaque internal states. This paper argues that
traditional ethical criteria are pragmatically obsolete for LLMs due to this
mismatch. Engaging with core themes in the philosophy of technology, this paper
proffers a revised set of ten functional criteria to evaluate LLM-based
artificial moral agents: moral concordance, context sensitivity, normative
integrity, metaethical awareness, system resilience, trustworthiness,
corrigibility, partial transparency, functional autonomy, and moral
imagination. These guideposts, applied to what we term "SMA-LLS" (Simulating
Moral Agency through Large Language Systems), aim to steer AMAs toward greater
alignment and beneficial societal integration in the coming years. We
illustrate these criteria using hypothetical scenarios involving an autonomous
public bus (APB) to demonstrate their practical applicability in morally
salient contexts.

### [107] [Higher-Order Pattern Unification Modulo Similarity Relations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13208)
*Besik Dundua,Temur Kutsia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper integrates higher-order patterns with fuzzy logic for decision-making, proposing a unification algorithm with proven termination, soundness, and completeness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of reasoning with abstract functions and predicates in fuzzy logic, where exact matches are rare.

Method: Combines higher-order patterns with fuzzy equivalences (using minimum T-norm) and develops a unification algorithm for this formalism.

Result: The algorithm is proven to terminate, be sound, and complete, computing a most general unifier with the highest approximation degree.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully unifies higher-order patterns under fuzzy similarity relations, offering a computationally efficient solution.

Abstract: The combination of higher-order theories and fuzzy logic can be useful in
decision-making tasks that involve reasoning across abstract functions and
predicates, where exact matches are often rare or unnecessary. Developing
efficient reasoning and computational techniques for such a combined formalism
presents a significant challenge. In this paper, we adopt a more
straightforward approach aiming at integrating two well-established and
computationally well-behaved components: higher-order patterns on one side and
fuzzy equivalences expressed through similarity relations based on minimum
T-norm on the other. We propose a unification algorithm for higher-order
patterns modulo these similarity relations and prove its termination,
soundness, and completeness. This unification problem, like its crisp
counterpart, is unitary. The algorithm computes a most general unifier with the
highest degree of approximation when the given terms are unifiable.

### [108] [The Generative Energy Arena (GEA): Incorporating Energy Awareness in Large Language Model (LLM) Human Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13302)
*Carlos Arriaga,Gonzalo Martínez,Eneko Sendin,Javier Conde,Pedro Reviriego*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces GEA, an arena for evaluating LLMs that includes energy consumption data, showing users prefer energy-efficient models when aware of their consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluation methods lack scalability and human correlation. Energy consumption is a growing concern, but its impact on user preference is unclear.

Method: GEA (Generative Energy Arena) incorporates energy consumption data into the evaluation process, allowing users to rank models based on both performance and energy efficiency.

Result: Preliminary results indicate users favor smaller, energy-efficient models when energy consumption is disclosed.

Conclusion: Energy awareness influences user preference, suggesting top-performing models may not justify their higher cost and energy use for most interactions.

Abstract: The evaluation of large language models is a complex task, in which several
approaches have been proposed. The most common is the use of automated
benchmarks in which LLMs have to answer multiple-choice questions of different
topics. However, this method has certain limitations, being the most
concerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is
to have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a
large and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and
costly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators
and having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is
the use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can
freely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.
The results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important
aspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how
energy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of
interest. In this paper, we present GEA, the Generative Energy Arena, an arena
that incorporates information on the energy consumption of the model in the
evaluation process. Preliminary results obtained with GEA are also presented,
showing that for most questions, when users are aware of the energy
consumption, they favor smaller and more energy efficient models. This suggests
that for most user interactions, the extra cost and energy incurred by the more
complex and top-performing models do not provide an increase in the perceived
quality of the responses that justifies their use.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces FormulaOne, a benchmark for evaluating AI models' expertise in graph theory, logic, and algorithms, revealing their limitations compared to human experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the gap between frontier AI models and true human expertise by focusing on real-life research problems rather than contrived puzzles.

Method: Constructed FormulaOne, a benchmark derived from Monadic Second-Order (MSO) logic on graphs, featuring complex problems with commercial and theoretical relevance.

Result: State-of-the-art models like OpenAI's o3 perform poorly, solving less than 1% of problems, highlighting their lack of expert-level understanding.

Conclusion: FormulaOne underscores the limitations of current AI models in tackling demanding real-world problems and provides a framework for further research.

Abstract: Frontier AI models demonstrate formidable breadth of knowledge. But how close
are they to true human -- or superhuman -- expertise? Genuine experts can
tackle the hardest problems and push the boundaries of scientific
understanding. To illuminate the limits of frontier model capabilities, we turn
away from contrived competitive programming puzzles, and instead focus on
real-life research problems.
  We construct FormulaOne, a benchmark that lies at the intersection of graph
theory, logic, and algorithms, all well within the training distribution of
frontier models. Our problems are incredibly demanding, requiring an array of
reasoning steps. The dataset has three key properties. First, it is of
commercial interest and relates to practical large-scale optimisation problems,
such as those arising in routing, scheduling, and network design. Second, it is
generated from the highly expressive framework of Monadic Second-Order (MSO)
logic on graphs, paving the way toward automatic problem generation at scale;
ideal for building RL environments. Third, many of our problems are intimately
related to the frontier of theoretical computer science, and to central
conjectures therein, such as the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). As
such, any significant algorithmic progress on our dataset, beyond known
results, could carry profound theoretical implications.
  Remarkably, state-of-the-art models like OpenAI's o3 fail entirely on
FormulaOne, solving less than 1% of the questions, even when given 10 attempts
and explanatory fewshot examples -- highlighting how far they remain from
expert-level understanding in some domains. To support further research, we
additionally curate FormulaOne-Warmup, offering a set of simpler tasks, from
the same distribution. We release the full corpus along with a comprehensive
evaluation framework.

*Lionel Wong,Katherine M. Collins,Lance Ying,Cedegao E. Zhang,Adrian Weller,Tobias Gersternberg,Timothy O'Donnell,Alexander K. Lew,Jacob D. Andreas,Joshua B. Tenenbaum,Tyler Brooke-Wilson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Model Synthesis Architecture (MSA) that combines language models with probabilistic programs to mimic human reasoning in novel situations, demonstrating improved performance over language model-only approaches on a sports reasoning dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans can effectively reason about novel situations by drawing relevant information from diverse background knowledge and constructing coherent inferences. The authors aim to understand and replicate this ability computationally, specifically how people use both distributed and symbolic representations to build tailored mental models for new scenarios.

Method: The authors develop a Model Synthesis Architecture (MSA) that uses language models for global relevance-based retrieval and model synthesis, combined with probabilistic programs to implement coherent world models. They evaluate this on a "Model Olympics" dataset featuring sports vignettes that require reasoning about novel causal structures, background knowledge integration, and handling arbitrary novel variables.

Result: The MSA approach outperformed language model-only baselines in capturing human judgments, showing superior performance compared to both direct language model generations and chain-of-thought prompting approaches on the reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The results suggest that MSAs can successfully mirror human reasoning capabilities by delivering locally coherent reasoning over globally relevant variables, providing a promising pathway for understanding and replicating human-like reasoning in open-ended domains.

Abstract: When faced with novel situations, people are able to marshal relevant
considerations from a wide range of background knowledge and put these to use
in inferences and predictions. What permits us to draw in globally relevant
information and reason over it coherently? Here, we explore the hypothesis that
people use a combination of distributed and symbolic representations to
construct bespoke mental models tailored to novel situations. We propose a
computational implementation of this idea -- a ``Model Synthesis Architecture''
(MSA) -- using language models to implement global relevance-based retrieval
and model synthesis and probabilistic programs to implement bespoke, coherent
world models. We evaluate our MSA as a model of human judgments on a novel
reasoning dataset. The dataset -- built around a `Model Olympics` domain of
sports vignettes -- tests models' capacity for human-like, open-ended reasoning
by requiring (i) judgments about novel causal structures described in language;
(ii) drawing on large bodies of background knowledge; and (iii) doing both in
light of observations that introduce arbitrary novel variables. Our MSA
approach captures human judgments better than language model-only baselines,
under both direct and chain-of-thought generations from the LM that supports
model synthesis. These results suggest that MSAs can be implemented in a way
that mirrors people's ability to deliver locally coherent reasoning over
globally relevant variables, offering a path to understanding and replicating
human reasoning in open-ended domains.

*Michael A. Lepori,Jennifer Hu,Ishita Dasgupta,Roma Patel,Thomas Serre,Ellie Pavlick*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies linear representations (modal difference vectors) in LMs that reliably categorize sentence modality, revealing better performance than previously thought. These vectors also model human categorization behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent studies questioned LMs' ability to categorize sentences by modality, prompting investigation into their actual capabilities and potential insights into human cognition.

Method: The authors identify modal difference vectors in LMs and analyze their emergence and consistency across training steps, layers, and parameters. They correlate these vectors with human categorization behavior.

Result: LMs exhibit reliable modal categorization via modal difference vectors, which emerge consistently and can model human behavior. Projections along these vectors correlate with human ratings.

Conclusion: The study provides new insights into LM modal categorization and suggests parallels with human cognition, offering a novel perspective for understanding both.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are used for a diverse range of tasks, from question
answering to writing fantastical stories. In order to reliably accomplish these
tasks, LMs must be able to discern the modal category of a sentence (i.e.,
whether it describes something that is possible, impossible, completely
nonsensical, etc.). However, recent studies have called into question the
ability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,
2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that
discriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal
difference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have
access to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously
reported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a
consistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,
layers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors
identified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human
categorization behavior. This potentially provides a novel view into how human
participants distinguish between modal categories, which we explore by
correlating projections along modal difference vectors with human participants'
ratings of interpretable features. In summary, we derive new insights into LM
modal categorization using techniques from mechanistic interpretability, with
the potential to inform our understanding of modal categorization in humans.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of translation resources for the vulnerable Chechen language.

Method: Fine-tune NLLB-200 for Chechen, collect parallel corpora, and adapt a multilingual encoder.

Result: Achieved BLEU/ChrF++ scores of 8.34/34.69 (Ru→Chechen) and 20.89/44.55 (Chechen→Ru).

Abstract: We introduce the first open-source model for translation between the
vulnerable Chechen language and Russian, and the dataset collected to train and
evaluate it. We explore fine-tuning capabilities for including a new language
into a large language model system for multilingual translation NLLB-200. The
BLEU / ChrF++ scores for our model are 8.34 / 34.69 and 20.89 / 44.55 for
translation from Russian to Chechen and reverse direction, respectively. The
release of the translation models is accompanied by the distribution of
parallel words, phrases and sentences corpora and multilingual sentence encoder

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NLP models, especially fine-tuned BioClinicalBERT, accurately classify drug-related deaths from free-text coroner reports, outperforming traditional methods and other models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rising rate of drug-related deaths, driven by fentanyl, necessitates timely and accurate surveillance, but current ICD-10 coding is slow and inefficient.

Method: Evaluated multiple NLP approaches (traditional classifiers, fine-tuned BERT models like BioClinicalBERT, and large language models) on 35,433 death records for training and 3,335 for external validation.

Result: BioClinicalBERT achieved near-perfect performance (macro F1 >=0.998 internally, 0.966 externally), surpassing other methods.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned NLP models like BioClinicalBERT provide a scalable, accurate solution for overdose surveillance, enabling near real-time trend detection.

Abstract: The rising rate of drug-related deaths in the United States, largely driven
by fentanyl, requires timely and accurate surveillance. However, critical
overdose data are often buried in free-text coroner reports, leading to delays
and information loss when coded into ICD (International Classification of
Disease)-10 classifications. Natural language processing (NLP) models may
automate and enhance overdose surveillance, but prior applications have been
limited. A dataset of 35,433 death records from multiple U.S. jurisdictions in
2020 was used for model training and internal testing. External validation was
conducted using a novel separate dataset of 3,335 records from 2023-2024.
Multiple NLP approaches were evaluated for classifying specific drug
involvement from unstructured death certificate text. These included
traditional single- and multi-label classifiers, as well as fine-tuned
encoder-only language models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (BERT) and BioClinicalBERT, and contemporary decoder-only large
language models such as Qwen 3 and Llama 3. Model performance was assessed
using macro-averaged F1 scores, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to
quantify uncertainty. Fine-tuned BioClinicalBERT models achieved near-perfect
performance, with macro F1 scores >=0.998 on the internal test set. External
validation confirmed robustness (macro F1=0.966), outperforming conventional
machine learning, general-domain BERT models, and various decoder-only large
language models. NLP models, particularly fine-tuned clinical variants like
BioClinicalBERT, offer a highly accurate and scalable solution for overdose
death classification from free-text reports. These methods can significantly
accelerate surveillance workflows, overcoming the limitations of manual ICD-10
coding and supporting near real-time detection of emerging substance use
trends.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaptiSent is a new framework for Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (MABSA) that uses adaptive cross-modal attention to improve sentiment classification and aspect term extraction from text and images. It outperforms existing models in precision, recall, and F1 score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance sentiment analysis and aspect term extraction by leveraging interactions between textual and visual data, addressing limitations of traditional text-based and other multimodal methods.

Method: Integrates dynamic modality weighting and context-adaptive attention mechanisms to focus on relevant inter-modal relationships.

Result: Outperforms baselines in precision, recall, and F1 score on Twitter datasets, excelling in nuanced inter-modal relationship identification.

Conclusion: AdaptiSent sets a new standard for MABSA, significantly improving accuracy and depth in analyzing complex multimodal data.

Abstract: We introduce AdaptiSent, a new framework for Multimodal Aspect-Based
Sentiment Analysis (MABSA) that uses adaptive cross-modal attention mechanisms
to improve sentiment classification and aspect term extraction from both text
and images. Our model integrates dynamic modality weighting and
context-adaptive attention, enhancing the extraction of sentiment and
aspect-related information by focusing on how textual cues and visual context
interact. We tested our approach against several baselines, including
traditional text-based models and other multimodal methods. Results from
standard Twitter datasets show that AdaptiSent surpasses existing models in
precision, recall, and F1 score, and is particularly effective in identifying
nuanced inter-modal relationships that are crucial for accurate sentiment and
aspect term extraction. This effectiveness comes from the model's ability to
adjust its focus dynamically based on the context's relevance, improving the
depth and accuracy of sentiment analysis across various multimodal data sets.
AdaptiSent sets a new standard for MABSA, significantly outperforming current
methods, especially in understanding complex multimodal information.

*Potsawee Manakul,Woody Haosheng Gan,Michael J. Ryan,Ali Sartaz Khan,Warit Sirichotedumrong,Kunat Pipatanakul,William Held,Diyi Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AudioJudge, a Large Audio Model (LAM), is proposed as a unified framework for speech evaluation, addressing limitations of specialized systems and poor correlation with human preferences. It excels in audio characteristic detection and human preference simulation, achieving high correlation with human rankings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speech evaluation methods are limited by the need for specialized systems and poor alignment with human preferences. This work aims to unify evaluation using LAMs.

Method: AudioJudge employs prompt engineering, audio concatenation, and in-context learning for tasks like pronunciation, speaking rate, and speech quality. A multi-aspect ensemble further enhances evaluation.

Result: Achieves up to 0.91 Spearman correlation with human preferences. Robust under noise but suffers from verbosity and positional biases.

Conclusion: AudioJudge offers a promising unified framework for speech evaluation, though biases require mitigation for broader applicability.

Abstract: Current speech evaluation suffers from two critical limitations: the need and
difficulty of designing specialized systems targeting individual audio
characteristics, and poor correlation between automatic evaluation methods and
human preferences. This work presents a systematic study of Large Audio Model
(LAM) as a Judge, AudioJudge, investigating whether it can provide a unified
evaluation framework that addresses both challenges. We systematically explore
AudioJudge across audio characteristic detection tasks, including
pronunciation, speaking rate, speaker identification and speech quality, and
system-level human preference simulation for automated benchmarking. We
investigate different prompt engineering strategies, finding that audio
concatenation combined with in-context learning significantly improves
performance across both audio characteristic detection and human preference
simulation tasks. We further introduce a multi-aspect ensemble AudioJudge to
enable general-purpose multi-aspect audio evaluation. This method decomposes
speech assessment into specialized judges for lexical content, speech quality,
and paralinguistic features, achieving up to 0.91 Spearman correlation with
human preferences on our system ranking benchmark. Robustness analysis reveals
that while LAMs maintain strong performance under acoustic noise, they exhibit
significant verbosity and positional biases that require careful mitigation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FLEXITOKENS improves LM adaptation by enabling flexible, learnable tokenization, reducing over-fragmentation and boosting performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subword tokenizers in LMs are rigid, causing inefficient tokenization for new data distributions, languages, or scripts.

Method: Develop byte-level LMs with learnable tokenizers, using FLEXITOKENS for flexible boundary prediction without fixed compression rates.

Result: FLEXITOKENS reduces token over-fragmentation and improves downstream task performance by up to 10%.

Conclusion: FLEXITOKENS offers a more adaptable and efficient tokenization method for LMs, outperforming traditional subword and gradient-based tokenizers.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are challenging to adapt to new data distributions by
simple finetuning. This is due to the rigidity of their subword tokenizers,
which typically remain unchanged during adaptation. This inflexibility often
leads to inefficient tokenization, causing overfragmentation of
out-of-distribution domains, unseen languages, or scripts. In this work, we
develop byte-level LMs with learnable tokenizers to make tokenization adaptive.
Our models include a submodule that learns to predict boundaries between the
input byte sequence, encoding it into variable-length segments. Existing
tokenizer-free methods train this boundary predictor using an auxiliary loss
that enforces a fixed compression rate across the training corpus, introducing
a new kind of rigidity. We propose FLEXITOKENS, a simplified training objective
that enables significantly greater flexibility during adaptation. Evaluating
across multiple multilingual benchmarks, morphologically diverse tasks, and
domains, we demonstrate that FLEXITOKENS consistently reduces token
over-fragmentation and achieves up to 10\% improvements on downstream task
performance compared to subword and other gradient-based tokenizers. Code and
data for our experiments will be released at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TransEvalnia is a prompting-based translation evaluation system using reasoning, outperforming MT-Ranker and aligning well with human ratings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve translation evaluation by providing fine-grained assessments and addressing position bias.

Method: Uses reasoning-based prompting with LLMs (Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct) for evaluation and ranking.

Result: Performs as well or better than MT-Ranker, with high human acceptability and correlation to human scores.

Conclusion: TransEvalnia is effective, but position bias exists; solutions are proposed.

Abstract: We present TransEvalnia, a prompting-based translation evaluation and ranking
system that uses reasoning in performing its evaluations and ranking. This
system presents fine-grained evaluations based on a subset of the
Multidimensional Quality Metrics (https://themqm.org/), returns an assessment
of which translation it deems the best, and provides numerical scores for the
various dimensions and for the overall translation. We show that TransEvalnia
performs as well as or better than the state-of-the-art MT-Ranker (Moosa et al.
2024) on our own English-Japanese data as well as several language pairs from
various WMT shared tasks. Using Anthropic's Claude-3.5-Sonnet and
Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct as the evaluation LLMs, we show that the evaluations
returned are deemed highly acceptable to human raters, and that the scores
assigned to the translations by Sonnet, as well as other LLMs, correlate well
with scores assigned by the human raters. We also note the sensitivity of our
system -- as well as MT-Ranker -- to the order in which the translations are
presented, and we propose methods to address this position bias. All data,
including the system's evaluation and reasoning, human assessments, as well as
code is released.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a method to enhance Werewolf agents by dynamically switching strategies based on player attitudes and conversation context, outperforming fixed or implicit strategy agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods using prompt engineering lack adaptability to changing game situations, necessitating a more dynamic approach.

Method: Explicitly selects strategies based on game context and estimated player roles, comparing performance against baseline agents with fixed or implicit strategies.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates improved effectiveness over baseline agents.

Conclusion: Dynamic strategy adaptation enhances Werewolf agent performance, offering a more adaptable solution than prior methods.

Abstract: This study proposes a method to improve the performance of Werewolf agents by
switching between predefined strategies based on the attitudes of other players
and the context of conversations. While prior works of Werewolf agents using
prompt engineering have employed methods where effective strategies are
implicitly defined, they cannot adapt to changing situations. In this research,
we propose a method that explicitly selects an appropriate strategy based on
the game context and the estimated roles of other players. We compare the
strategy adaptation Werewolf agents with baseline agents using implicit or
fixed strategies and verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.

TL;DR: ThinkLogit and ThinkLogit-DPO improve reasoning in large models without extra training, using a smaller model as a guide, achieving up to 29% better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if long reasoning abilities in large models can be unlocked without training, using a smaller model to guide the process.

Method: Proposes ThinkLogit, a decoding-time approach using logits arithmetic, and ThinkLogit-DPO, which optimizes the guider model with preference training.

Result: Achieves 26% and 29% relative improvement in pass@1 on math datasets, with a 21x smaller guider model. Also transfers reasoning skills via reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: ThinkLogit efficiently elicits long reasoning in large models with minimal or no training, demonstrating significant performance gains.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) can do complex reasoning via long
chain-of-thought (CoT) involving cognitive strategies such as backtracking and
self-correction. Recent studies suggest that some models inherently possess
these long reasoning abilities, which may be unlocked via extra training. Our
work first investigates whether we can elicit such behavior without any
training. To this end, we propose a decoding-time approach, ThinkLogit, which
utilizes logits arithmetic (Liu et al., 2024) to tune a target large LM for
long reasoning using a substantially smaller model as guider. We then show that
we can further boost performance by training the guider model with preference
optimization over correct/incorrect reasoning pairs sampled from both the
target and guider model -- a setup we refer to as ThinkLogit-DPO. Our
experiments demonstrate that ThinkLogit and ThinkLogit-DPO achieve a relative
improvement in pass@1 by 26% and 29%, respectively, over four mathematical
datasets using the Qwen2.5-32B when guided by R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B -- a model
21x smaller. Lastly, we show that ThinkLogit can transfer long reasoning skills
acquired through reinforcement learning, improving pass@1 by 13% relative
compared to the Qwen2.5-32B base model. Our work presents a
computationally-efficient method to elicit long reasoning in large models with
minimal or no additional training.

TL;DR: Synergy is a language model that bridges abstraction levels via learned routing, outperforming BBPE tokenizers and showing advantages over Llama3.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore tokenizer-free architectures and improve robustness in language models by bridging abstraction levels.

Method: Trained as a byte-level language model with a learned routing mechanism, comparing performance with BBPE and Llama3.

Result: Synergy produces fewer tokens than BBPE with comparable performance and shows advantages over Llama3. Position-independent concepts emerge in higher abstraction layers.

Conclusion: Tokenizer-free architectures are feasible, enabling more robust and flexible language pipelines.

Abstract: In this paper, we present Synergy, a language model that bridges different
levels of abstraction in an end-to-end fashion through a learned routing
mechanism. Focusing on low-level linguistic abstraction, we trained our model
as a byte-level language model. Our model spontaneously learns to tokenize
bytes, producing fewer concept tokens than Byte-level Byte Pair Encoder (BBPE)
tokenizers while keeping comparable performance. By comparing with Llama3, we
observed an advantage of Synergy under the same model scale and training
dataset size. Further studies show that the middle part (the higher abstraction
part) of our model performs better when positional encodings are removed,
suggesting the emergence of position-independent concepts. These findings
demonstrate the feasibility of tokenizer-free architectures, paving the way for
more robust and flexible pipelines.

### [121] [Learning Robust Negation Text Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12782)
*Thinh Hung Truong,Karin Verspoor,Trevor Cohn,Timothy Baldwin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to enhance negation understanding in text encoders by distilling data from large language models, improving performance without compromising general benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smaller text encoders lack robustness in handling negation, impacting downstream tasks. Addressing this gap is crucial for better text understanding.

Method: Uses data distillation from large language models with diverse negation patterns, combined with contrastive learning to finetune a BERT-based model.

Result: Significant improvement in negation understanding while maintaining general benchmark performance; method also adapts to LLMs.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances negation robustness in text encoders and is scalable to LLMs, benefiting downstream applications.

Abstract: Despite rapid adoption of autoregressive large language models, smaller text
encoders still play an important role in text understanding tasks that require
rich contextualized representations. Negation is an important semantic function
that is still not properly captured by such methods, affecting many downstream
applications relying on text embeddings. We propose a strategy to improve
negation robustness of text encoders, by distilling data from large language
models using diverse patterns of negation and hedging. We adopt a standard
contrastive learning strategy to finetune a strong BERT-based model, and
observe large improvement in negation understanding capabilities while
maintaining competitive performance on general benchmarks. In addition, we also
show that our method can be adapted to LLMs, leading to improved performance on
negation benchmarks.

### [122] [Large Language Models' Internal Perception of Symbolic Music](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12808)
*Andrew Shin,Kunitake Kaneko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can model symbolic music from text prompts, generating MIDI files without explicit training. Neural networks trained on this data perform genre/style classification and melody completion, showing LLMs' potential and limitations in music generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how LLMs implicitly model symbolic music, given their success in other symbolic domains like coding and mathematics.

Method: Generate symbolic music data from text prompts describing genres/styles, create a dataset of LLM-generated MIDI files, and train neural networks on this data for classification and melody tasks.

Result: LLMs infer basic musical structures and temporal relationships from text, but their lack of explicit musical context limits performance.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in encoding musical patterns implicitly but require further refinement for robust symbolic music generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at modeling relationships between strings
in natural language and have shown promise in extending to other symbolic
domains like coding or mathematics. However, the extent to which they
implicitly model symbolic music remains underexplored. This paper investigates
how LLMs represent musical concepts by generating symbolic music data from
textual prompts describing combinations of genres and styles, and evaluating
their utility through recognition and generation tasks. We produce a dataset of
LLM-generated MIDI files without relying on explicit musical training. We then
train neural networks entirely on this LLM-generated MIDI dataset and perform
genre and style classification as well as melody completion, benchmarking their
performance against established models. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can
infer rudimentary musical structures and temporal relationships from text,
highlighting both their potential to implicitly encode musical patterns and
their limitations due to a lack of explicit musical context, shedding light on
their generative capabilities for symbolic music.

### [123] [Are Knowledge and Reference in Multilingual Language Models Cross-Lingually Consistent?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12838)
*Xi Ai,Mahardika Krisna Ihsani,Min-Yen Kan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines cross-lingual consistency in multilingual models, focusing on factual knowledge transfer and model behavior. It identifies factors affecting consistency and evaluates strategies to improve it, highlighting code-switching training and cross-lingual alignment as effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and improve cross-lingual transferability, factuality, and performance parity in multilingual models by analyzing cross-lingual consistency for factual knowledge.

Method: Examines code-mixed coreferential statements and uses interpretability approaches to analyze model behavior. Evaluates strategies like code-switching training and cross-lingual word alignment.

Result: Multilingual models exhibit varying consistency levels influenced by language families, linguistic factors, and a bottleneck in a specific layer. Code-switching and alignment objectives show promise.

Conclusion: Cross-lingual alignment supervision and code-switching training are crucial for enhancing both multilingual performance and cross-lingual consistency.

Abstract: Cross-lingual consistency should be considered to assess cross-lingual
transferability, maintain the factuality of the model knowledge across
languages, and preserve the parity of language model performance. We are thus
interested in analyzing, evaluating, and interpreting cross-lingual consistency
for factual knowledge. We examine code-mixed coreferential statements conveyed
identical knowledge across languages to study cross-lingual knowledge
consistency. We use some interpretability approaches to analyze the behavior of
a model in cross-lingual contexts, discovering that multilingual models show
different levels of consistency, subject to language families, linguistic
factors, and a bottleneck in cross-lingual consistency on a particular layer.
In addition, we evaluate common strategies aimed at improving multilingual
performance to observe whether these strategies can improve knowledge
consistency at the same time. While knowledge is not cross-lingual consistency
in many cases, code-switching training and cross-lingual word alignment
objectives show the most promising results, emphasizing the noteworthiness of
cross-lingual alignment supervision and code-switching training for both
multilingual performance and cross-lingual consistency enhancement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hierarchical decoder architecture for language models, adapting pretrained models by copying and fine-tuning language heads to intermediate layers, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by human hierarchical thinking, the study aims to enhance decoder-only language models by enabling simultaneous text decoding across different layers.

Method: Adapts a pretrained model by copying language heads from the last layer to selected intermediate layers and fine-tuning them with task-specific inputs.

Result: Experiments show intermediate layers can generate meaningful content, and the hierarchical decoder achieves top performance on tasks like hierarchical text classification and generation.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential for a generalized hierarchical reasoner and suggests pretraining such models from scratch.

Abstract: Decoder-only language models, such as GPT and LLaMA, generally decode on the
last layer. Motivated by human's hierarchical thinking capability, we propose
that a hierarchical decoder architecture could be built with different layers
decoding texts simultaneously. Due to limited time and computationally
resources, we choose to adapt a pretrained language model into this form of
hierarchical decoder. Language heads of the last layer are copied to different
selected intermediate layers, and fine-tuned with different task inputs. By
thorough experiments, we validate that these selective intermediate layers
could be adapted to speak meaningful and reasonable contents, and this paradigm
of hierarchical decoder can obtain state-of-the-art performances on multiple
tasks such as hierarchical text classification, classification-guided
generation, and hierarchical text generation. This study suggests the
possibility of a generalized hierarchical reasoner, pretraining from scratch.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper describes a method for answering questions about Spanish tables using Python code generation with LLMs, achieving 85% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of answering questions about tables in Spanish (PRESTA task) by leveraging LLMs for code generation and table processing.

Method: The approach involves analyzing tables, selecting columns, generating natural language instructions, translating them to Python code, executing it, and handling errors using open-source LLMs and optimized prompts.

Result: Achieved an accuracy score of 85% in the PRESTA task.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates effectiveness in table-based question answering in Spanish, building on prior work (MRT for Semeval 2025).

Abstract: This paper presents our approach for the IberLEF 2025 Task PRESTA: Preguntas
y Respuestas sobre Tablas en Espa\~nol (Questions and Answers about Tables in
Spanish). Our solution obtains answers to the questions by implementing Python
code generation with LLMs that is used to filter and process the table. This
solution evolves from the MRT implementation for the Semeval 2025 related task.
The process consists of multiple steps: analyzing and understanding the content
of the table, selecting the useful columns, generating instructions in natural
language, translating these instructions to code, running it, and handling
potential errors or exceptions. These steps use open-source LLMs and
fine-grained optimized prompts for each step. With this approach, we achieved
an accuracy score of 85\% in the task.

*Quentin Goux,Nadira Lammari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A formal UML-based model for attack scenarios to automate cybersecurity processes like attack simulation and analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Organizations need automation in cybersecurity due to evolving threats, requiring formalized input data for attack scenarios.

Method: Develops a novel UML class model to formalize attack context and scenarios.

Result: Demonstrates the model's utility for attack analysis and automatic script generation in training.

Conclusion: The model enhances cybersecurity automation, supporting attack analysis and training script generation.

Abstract: Organizations face an ever-changing threat landscape. They must continuously
dedicate significant efforts to protect their assets, making their adoption of
increased cybersecurity automation inevitable. However, process automation
requires formalization of input data. Through this paper, we address this need
for processes that use attack scenarios as input. Among these processes, one
can mention both the generation of scripts for attack simulation and training
purposes, as well as the analysis of attacks. Therefore, the paper's main
research contribution is a novel formal model that encompasses the attack's
context description and its scenario. It is abstracted using UML class model.
Once the description of our model done, we will show how it could serve an
upstream attack analysis process. We will show also its use for an automatic
generation of attack scripts in the context of cybersecurity training. These
two uses cases constitute the second contribution of this present research
work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemCSE is an unsupervised method for learning semantic embeddings of scientific texts using LLM-generated summaries and contrastive learning, outperforming citation-based approaches and achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional citation-based approaches for text embeddings may not reflect true semantic similarity. SemCSE aims to capture the actual semantic content of scientific texts.

Method: Leverages LLM-generated summaries and contrastive learning to train a model that positions semantically related summaries closer in embedding space.

Result: Demonstrates stronger semantic separation in embeddings and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SciRepEval benchmark.

Conclusion: SemCSE highlights the benefits of a semantically focused training approach for scientific text embeddings.

Abstract: We introduce SemCSE, an unsupervised method for learning semantic embeddings
of scientific texts. Building on recent advances in contrastive learning for
text embeddings, our approach leverages LLM-generated summaries of scientific
abstracts to train a model that positions semantically related summaries closer
together in the embedding space. This resulting objective ensures that the
model captures the true semantic content of a text, in contrast to traditional
citation-based approaches that do not necessarily reflect semantic similarity.
To validate this, we propose a novel benchmark designed to assess a model's
ability to understand and encode the semantic content of scientific texts,
demonstrating that our method enforces a stronger semantic separation within
the embedding space. Additionally, we evaluate SemCSE on the comprehensive
SciRepEval benchmark for scientific text embeddings, where it achieves
state-of-the-art performance among models of its size, thus highlighting the
benefits of a semantically focused training approach.

### [128] [A Computational Framework to Identify Self-Aspects in Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13115)
*Jaya Caporusso,Matthew Purver,Senja Pollak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A computational framework to identify Self-aspects in text, leveraging NLP to explore this underexplored area, with applications in mental health and phenomenology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Self is a multifaceted construct reflected in language but underexplored in NLP, despite alignment with psychological phenomena like mental health.

Method: Develop an ontology of Self-aspects, create a gold-standard dataset, and evaluate discriminative models, generative LLMs, and embedding-based retrieval against interpretability, accuracy, etc.

Result: Top models will be applied in mental health and phenomenology case studies.

Conclusion: The framework aims to bridge gaps in NLP by systematically analyzing Self-aspects, with practical applications in psychology and phenomenology.

Abstract: This Ph.D. proposal introduces a plan to develop a computational framework to
identify Self-aspects in text. The Self is a multifaceted construct and it is
reflected in language. While it is described across disciplines like cognitive
science and phenomenology, it remains underexplored in natural language
processing (NLP). Many of the aspects of the Self align with psychological and
other well-researched phenomena (e.g., those related to mental health),
highlighting the need for systematic NLP-based analysis. In line with this, we
plan to introduce an ontology of Self-aspects and a gold-standard annotated
dataset. Using this foundation, we will develop and evaluate conventional
discriminative models, generative large language models, and embedding-based
retrieval approaches against four main criteria: interpretability, ground-truth
adherence, accuracy, and computational efficiency. Top-performing models will
be applied in case studies in mental health and empirical phenomenology.

*Hadi Mohammadi,Tina Shahedi,Pablo Mosteiro,Massimo Poesio,Ayoub Bagheri,Anastasia Giachanou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines how annotator demographics and text content influence labeling in sexism detection, finding content dominates. It also tests Generative AI's reliability as annotators, showing persona prompting often fails, and highlights content-driven explanations for fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand variability in annotations for fair NLP systems, especially in sexism detection, by analyzing the impact of annotator demographics versus text content.

Method: Uses a Generalized Linear Mixed Model to quantify demographic influence and evaluates Generative AI models with demographic personas, applying explainable AI techniques.

Result: Demographic factors account for 8% of variance, with content being dominant. Persona prompting in GenAI often degrades performance, and models rely on content-specific tokens.

Conclusion: Focusing on content-driven explanations and robust annotation protocols is more reliable for fairness than persona simulation.

Abstract: Understanding the sources of variability in annotations is crucial for
developing fair NLP systems, especially for tasks like sexism detection where
demographic bias is a concern. This study investigates the extent to which
annotator demographic features influence labeling decisions compared to text
content. Using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model, we quantify this inf luence,
finding that while statistically present, demographic factors account for a
minor fraction ( 8%) of the observed variance, with tweet content being the
dominant factor. We then assess the reliability of Generative AI (GenAI) models
as annotators, specifically evaluating if guiding them with demographic
personas improves alignment with human judgments. Our results indicate that
simplistic persona prompting often fails to enhance, and sometimes degrades,
performance compared to baseline models. Furthermore, explainable AI (XAI)
techniques reveal that model predictions rely heavily on content-specific
tokens related to sexism, rather than correlates of demographic
characteristics. We argue that focusing on content-driven explanations and
robust annotation protocols offers a more reliable path towards fairness than
potentially persona simulation.

*Emma Sharratt,Annelien Smith,Retief Louw,Daleen Klop,Febe de Wet,Herman Kamper*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study analyzes oral narratives of children needing intervention, identifying lexical diversity and utterance length as key indicators of typical development, with some language-specific predictors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify features of oral narratives that predict literacy development and intervention needs in multilingual children.

Method: Simple machine learning analysis of recorded stories from Afrikaans- and isiXhosa-speaking children, focusing on lexical diversity, utterance length, and part-of-speech patterns.

Result: Lexical diversity and utterance length are strong indicators; specific verbs and auxiliaries linked to goal-directed storytelling reduce intervention likelihood. Cross-linguistic variation exists.

Conclusion: The findings highlight shared and language-specific predictors of narrative proficiency, aiding early assessment in multilingual contexts.

Abstract: Oral narrative skills are strong predictors of later literacy development.
This study examines the features of oral narratives from children who were
identified by experts as requiring intervention. Using simple machine learning
methods, we analyse recorded stories from four- and five-year-old Afrikaans-
and isiXhosa-speaking children. Consistent with prior research, we identify
lexical diversity (unique words) and length-based features (mean utterance
length) as indicators of typical development, but features like articulation
rate prove less informative. Despite cross-linguistic variation in
part-of-speech patterns, the use of specific verbs and auxiliaries associated
with goal-directed storytelling is correlated with a reduced likelihood of
requiring intervention. Our analysis of two linguistically distinct languages
reveals both language-specific and shared predictors of narrative proficiency,
with implications for early assessment in multilingual contexts.

*Jisoo Lee,Raeyoung Chang,Dongwook Kwon,Harmanpreet Singh,Nikhil Verma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GEMMAS introduces graph-based metrics (IDS and UPR) to evaluate multi-agent collaboration beyond final output correctness, revealing inefficiencies in communication and coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations overlook inefficiencies in multi-agent collaboration, focusing only on final output correctness.

Method: GEMMAS models agent interactions as a directed acyclic graph, proposing IDS for semantic variation and UPR for redundant paths.

Result: On GSM8K, systems with similar accuracy showed significant differences in IDS (12.8%) and UPR (80%), highlighting collaboration inefficiencies.

Conclusion: Process-level metrics like IDS and UPR are crucial for designing interpretable and efficient multi-agent systems, beyond outcome-only evaluations.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on language models have shown strong performance on
collaborative reasoning tasks. However, existing evaluations focus only on the
correctness of the final output, overlooking how inefficient communication and
poor coordination contribute to redundant reasoning and higher computational
costs. We introduce GEMMAS, a graph-based evaluation framework that analyzes
the internal collaboration process by modeling agent interactions as a directed
acyclic graph. To capture collaboration quality, we propose two process-level
metrics: Information Diversity Score (IDS) to measure semantic variation in
inter-agent messages, and Unnecessary Path Ratio (UPR) to quantify redundant
reasoning paths. We evaluate GEMMAS across five benchmarks and highlight
results on GSM8K, where systems with only a 2.1% difference in accuracy differ
by 12.8% in IDS and 80% in UPR, revealing substantial variation in internal
collaboration. These findings demonstrate that outcome-only metrics are
insufficient for evaluating multi-agent performance and highlight the
importance of process-level diagnostics in designing more interpretable and
resource-efficient collaborative AI systems.

TL;DR: An automated system assesses preschool children's oral narratives in Afrikaans and isiXhosa using speech recognition and machine learning, outperforming simpler models and matching human expert accuracy in identifying children needing intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early childhood narrative and comprehension skills are crucial for literacy, but teachers struggle to identify students needing intervention in large classrooms.

Method: The system combines automatic speech recognition with machine learning (linear model vs. LLM) to score oral narratives.

Result: The LLM-based system outperforms the linear model and matches human expert performance in flagging children for intervention.

Conclusion: The system provides a foundation for automated oral assessments, freeing teachers to focus on personalized support.

Abstract: Developing narrative and comprehension skills in early childhood is critical
for later literacy. However, teachers in large preschool classrooms struggle to
accurately identify students who require intervention. We present a system for
automatically assessing oral narratives of preschool children in Afrikaans and
isiXhosa. The system uses automatic speech recognition followed by a machine
learning scoring model to predict narrative and comprehension scores. For
scoring predicted transcripts, we compare a linear model to a large language
model (LLM). The LLM-based system outperforms the linear model in most cases,
but the linear system is competitive despite its simplicity. The LLM-based
system is comparable to a human expert in flagging children who require
intervention. We lay the foundation for automatic oral assessments in
classrooms, giving teachers extra capacity to focus on personalised support for
children's learning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes CAST, a framework for cross-task transfer in LLMs by steering latent space activations, improving robustness and efficiency without parameter updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with unseen tasks in data-scarce scenarios, and existing cross-task in-context learning lacks robustness and scalability.

Method: Analyzes activation patterns in LLMs' latent space, then uses contrastive representation-enhanced activations from high-resource tasks to adapt to low-resource tasks.

Result: CAST outperforms baselines in cross-domain and cross-lingual transfer, showing superior scalability and lower computational costs.

Conclusion: Latent space steering enables effective cross-task transfer, offering a scalable and efficient solution for adapting LLMs to low-resource tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive abilities in leveraging
pretrained knowledge through prompting, but they often struggle with unseen
tasks, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. While cross-task in-context
learning offers a direct solution for transferring knowledge across tasks, it
still faces critical challenges in terms of robustness, scalability, and
efficiency. In this paper, we investigate whether cross-task transfer can be
achieved via latent space steering without parameter updates or input
expansion. Through an analysis of activation patterns in the latent space of
LLMs, we observe that the enhanced activations induced by in-context examples
have consistent patterns across different tasks. Inspired by these findings, we
propose CAST, a novel Cross-task Activation Steering Transfer framework that
enables effective transfer by manipulating the model's internal activation
states. Our approach first selects influential and diverse samples from
high-resource tasks, then utilizes their contrastive representation-enhanced
activations to adapt LLMs to low-resource tasks. Extensive experiments across
both cross-domain and cross-lingual transfer settings show that our method
outperforms competitive baselines and demonstrates superior scalability and
lower computational costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the understudied reasoning capabilities of LLMs in Indic languages, particularly Hindi, and evaluate their generalization across languages.

Method: Introduces HATS (405 Hindi analogy questions), benchmarks multilingual LLMs with various prompting strategies, and proposes a grounded Chain of Thought approach based on cognitive theories.

Result: Models perform best with English prompts, and the proposed Chain of Thought approach improves Hindi analogy performance.

Conclusion: HATS fills a critical gap in evaluating LLM reasoning in Hindi, highlighting the need for better multilingual generalization.

Abstract: Analogies test a model's ability to infer implicit relationships between
concepts, making them a key benchmark for evaluating reasoning capabilities.
While large language models (LLMs) are widely evaluated for reasoning in
English, their abilities in Indic languages remain understudied, limiting our
understanding of whether these models generalize across languages. To address
this gap, we introduce a new Hindi Analogy Test Set (HATS), comprising 405
multiple-choice questions sourced from Indian government exams. We benchmark
state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs using various prompting strategies and
introduce a grounded Chain of Thought approach that leverages cognitive
theories of analogical reasoning. This approach improves model performance on
Hindi analogy questions. Our experiments show that models perform best with
English prompts, irrespective of the prompting strategy. Our test set addresses
the lack of a critical resource to evaluate LLM reasoning capabilities in
Hindi.

TL;DR: AutoSteer is a modular, inference-time intervention technology for MLLMs that improves safety without fine-tuning, using SAS, an adaptive safety prober, and a Refusal Head.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address safety concerns in MLLMs due to adversarial multimodal inputs.

Method: Introduces AutoSteer with three components: Safety Awareness Score (SAS), adaptive safety prober, and Refusal Head.

Result: Reduces Attack Success Rate (ASR) for textual, visual, and cross-modal threats while maintaining general abilities.

Conclusion: AutoSteer is a practical and effective framework for safer deployment of multimodal AI systems.

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has unlocked
powerful cross-modal reasoning abilities, but also raised new safety concerns,
particularly when faced with adversarial multimodal inputs. To improve the
safety of MLLMs during inference, we introduce a modular and adaptive
inference-time intervention technology, AutoSteer, without requiring any
fine-tuning of the underlying model. AutoSteer incorporates three core
components: (1) a novel Safety Awareness Score (SAS) that automatically
identifies the most safety-relevant distinctions among the model's internal
layers; (2) an adaptive safety prober trained to estimate the likelihood of
toxic outputs from intermediate representations; and (3) a lightweight Refusal
Head that selectively intervenes to modulate generation when safety risks are
detected. Experiments on LLaVA-OV and Chameleon across diverse safety-critical
benchmarks demonstrate that AutoSteer significantly reduces the Attack Success
Rate (ASR) for textual, visual, and cross-modal threats, while maintaining
general abilities. These findings position AutoSteer as a practical,
interpretable, and effective framework for safer deployment of multimodal AI
systems.

TL;DR: QuestA, a method using question augmentation with partial solutions during RL training, improves reasoning in LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art results on math benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the ineffectiveness of standard RL in improving multi-step reasoning, particularly on hard problems.

Method: Introduce partial solutions (Question Augmentation) during RL training to reduce problem difficulty and provide better learning signals.

Result: Improved pass@1 and pass@k rates, with new SOTA results on math benchmarks (e.g., 67.1% on AIME24).

Conclusion: QuestA enhances reasoning capability and sample efficiency in RL, offering a practical and generalizable approach.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key component in training large
language reasoning models (LLMs). However, recent studies questions its
effectiveness in improving multi-step reasoning-particularly on hard problems.
To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective strategy via
Question Augmentation: introduce partial solutions during training to reduce
problem difficulty and provide more informative learning signals. Our method,
QuestA, when applied during RL training on math reasoning tasks, not only
improves pass@1 but also pass@k-particularly on problems where standard RL
struggles to make progress. This enables continual improvement over strong
open-source models such as DeepScaleR and OpenMath Nemotron, further enhancing
their reasoning capabilities. We achieve new state-of-the-art results on math
benchmarks using 1.5B-parameter models: 67.1% (+5.3%) on AIME24, 59.5% (+10.0%)
on AIME25, and 35.5% (+4.0%) on HMMT25. Further, we provide theoretical
explanations that QuestA improves sample efficiency, offering a practical and
generalizable pathway for expanding reasoning capability through RL.

TL;DR: TalentCLEF 2025 introduces the first public benchmark for skill and job title intelligence in Human Capital Management, addressing the lack of reliable and fair models in the domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing use of language technologies in Human Capital Management lacks reliable, fair models and public benchmarks, hindering progress.

Method: TalentCLEF 2025 includes two tasks: Multilingual Job Title Matching (Task A) and Job Title-Based Skill Prediction (Task B), using real, anonymized, and annotated job application data.

Result: The campaign attracted 76 teams with 280+ submissions, showing that training strategies impact performance more than model size.

Conclusion: TalentCLEF establishes the first public benchmark, promoting robust, fair, and transferable language technologies for the labor market.

Abstract: Advances in natural language processing and large language models are driving
a major transformation in Human Capital Management, with a growing interest in
building smart systems based on language technologies for talent acquisition,
upskilling strategies, and workforce planning. However, the adoption and
progress of these technologies critically depend on the development of reliable
and fair models, properly evaluated on public data and open benchmarks, which
have so far been unavailable in this domain.
  To address this gap, we present TalentCLEF 2025, the first evaluation
campaign focused on skill and job title intelligence. The lab consists of two
tasks: Task A - Multilingual Job Title Matching, covering English, Spanish,
German, and Chinese; and Task B - Job Title-Based Skill Prediction, in English.
Both corpora were built from real job applications, carefully anonymized, and
manually annotated to reflect the complexity and diversity of real-world labor
market data, including linguistic variability and gender-marked expressions.
  The evaluations included monolingual and cross-lingual scenarios and covered
the evaluation of gender bias.
  TalentCLEF attracted 76 registered teams with more than 280 submissions. Most
systems relied on information retrieval techniques built with multilingual
encoder-based models fine-tuned with contrastive learning, and several of them
incorporated large language models for data augmentation or re-ranking. The
results show that the training strategies have a larger effect than the size of
the model alone. TalentCLEF provides the first public benchmark in this field
and encourages the development of robust, fair, and transferable language
technologies for the labor market.

TL;DR: RCPS framework improves automated presentation generation with deep narrative planning, adaptive layout, and iterative optimization, outperforming baselines. PREVAL evaluation aligns with human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods produce inconsistent and suboptimal presentations, failing professional standards.

Method: RCPS integrates deep structured narrative planning, adaptive layout generation, and iterative optimization. PREVAL evaluates quality using rationale-enhanced models.

Result: RCPS outperforms baselines in content, coherence, and design. PREVAL correlates well with human judgments.

Conclusion: RCPS and PREVAL advance automated presentation generation and evaluation, achieving near-human quality.

Abstract: Automated generation of high-quality media presentations is challenging,
requiring robust content extraction, narrative planning, visual design, and
overall quality optimization. Existing methods often produce presentations with
logical inconsistencies and suboptimal layouts, thereby struggling to meet
professional standards. To address these challenges, we introduce RCPS
(Reflective Coherent Presentation Synthesis), a novel framework integrating
three key components: (1) Deep Structured Narrative Planning; (2) Adaptive
Layout Generation; (3) an Iterative Optimization Loop. Additionally, we propose
PREVAL, a preference-based evaluation framework employing rationale-enhanced
multi-dimensional models to assess presentation quality across Content,
Coherence, and Design. Experimental results demonstrate that RCPS significantly
outperforms baseline methods across all quality dimensions, producing
presentations that closely approximate human expert standards. PREVAL shows
strong correlation with human judgments, validating it as a reliable automated
tool for assessing presentation quality.

*Yilun Zhao,Weiyuan Chen,Zhijian Xu,Manasi Patwardhan,Yixin Liu,Chengye Wang,Lovekesh Vig,Arman Cohan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AbGen is a benchmark for evaluating LLMs in designing ablation studies, revealing a performance gap between models and humans. It also introduces AbGen-Eval to assess automated evaluation reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks for evaluating LLMs in designing ablation studies for scientific research.

Method: AbGen uses 1,500 expert-annotated examples from NLP papers. LLMs generate ablation study designs, evaluated for importance, faithfulness, and soundness. AbGen-Eval assesses automated evaluation reliability.

Result: LLMs lag behind humans in designing ablation studies. Automated evaluations are unreliable compared to human judgment.

Conclusion: AbGen highlights LLM limitations and the need for better evaluation systems, paving the way for future improvements in LLM-based scientific tasks.

Abstract: We introduce AbGen, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities
of LLMs in designing ablation studies for scientific research. AbGen consists
of 1,500 expert-annotated examples derived from 807 NLP papers. In this
benchmark, LLMs are tasked with generating detailed ablation study designs for
a specified module or process based on the given research context. Our
evaluation of leading LLMs, such as DeepSeek-R1-0528 and o4-mini, highlights a
significant performance gap between these models and human experts in terms of
the importance, faithfulness, and soundness of the ablation study designs.
Moreover, we demonstrate that current automated evaluation methods are not
reliable for our task, as they show a significant discrepancy when compared to
human assessment. To better investigate this, we develop AbGen-Eval, a
meta-evaluation benchmark designed to assess the reliability of commonly used
automated evaluation systems in measuring LLM performance on our task. We
investigate various LLM-as-Judge systems on AbGen-Eval, providing insights for
future research on developing more effective and reliable LLM-based evaluation
systems for complex scientific tasks.

### [140] [HapticCap: A Multimodal Dataset and Task for Understanding User Experience of Vibration Haptic Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13318)
*Guimin Hu,Daniel Hershcovich,Hasti Seifi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces HapticCap, a dataset for matching haptic vibrations to user descriptions, addressing challenges in haptic signal design and annotation. A supervised contrastive learning framework is proposed for haptic-caption retrieval, with T5 and AST models performing best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing meaningful haptic signals is difficult due to lack of annotated datasets and limited models for describing vibrations in text.

Method: Created HapticCap, a dataset of 92,070 haptic-text pairs, and proposed a supervised contrastive learning framework for haptic-caption retrieval.

Result: The T5 and AST models combined yielded the best performance, especially when trained separately for each description category.

Conclusion: HapticCap and the proposed framework advance haptic signal design by enabling better matching of vibrations to user descriptions.

Abstract: Haptic signals, from smartphone vibrations to virtual reality touch feedback,
can effectively convey information and enhance realism, but designing signals
that resonate meaningfully with users is challenging. To facilitate this, we
introduce a multimodal dataset and task, of matching user descriptions to
vibration haptic signals, and highlight two primary challenges: (1) lack of
large haptic vibration datasets annotated with textual descriptions as
collecting haptic descriptions is time-consuming, and (2) limited capability of
existing tasks and models to describe vibration signals in text. To advance
this area, we create HapticCap, the first fully human-annotated
haptic-captioned dataset, containing 92,070 haptic-text pairs for user
descriptions of sensory, emotional, and associative attributes of vibrations.
Based on HapticCap, we propose the haptic-caption retrieval task and present
the results of this task from a supervised contrastive learning framework that
brings together text representations within specific categories and vibrations.
Overall, the combination of language model T5 and audio model AST yields the
best performance in the haptic-caption retrieval task, especially when
separately trained for each description category.

*Amrit Poudel,Tim Weninger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Search engines amplify biases through content prioritization and ideologically-driven user queries, reinforcing ideological divides and information polarization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how search engines and user queries contribute to bias in search results, particularly in political and social contexts.

Method: Analysis of search engine outputs using a dataset of political and social topics.

Result: Search engines prioritize biased content, and ideologically-driven queries worsen these biases, amplifying specific narratives. Differences in source prioritization were also noted across search engines.

Conclusion: Search engines reinforce ideological divides, shaping public perceptions and contributing to information polarization.

Abstract: Search engines play a crucial role in shaping public discourse by influencing
how information is accessed and framed. While prior research has extensively
examined various dimensions of search bias -- such as content prioritization,
indexical bias, political polarization, and sources of bias -- an important
question remains underexplored: how do search engines and
ideologically-motivated user queries contribute to bias in search results. This
study analyzes the outputs of major search engines using a dataset of political
and social topics. The findings reveal that search engines not only prioritize
content in ways that reflect underlying biases but also that
ideologically-driven user queries exacerbate these biases, resulting in the
amplification of specific narratives. Moreover, significant differences were
observed across search engines in terms of the sources they prioritize. These
results suggest that search engines may play a pivotal role in shaping public
perceptions by reinforcing ideological divides, thereby contributing to the
broader issue of information polarization.

*Yulu Qin,Dheeraj Varghese,Adam Dahlgren Lindström,Lucia Donatelli,Kanishka Misra,Najoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VL training improves deployment of taxonomic knowledge in tasks but doesn't significantly change the knowledge itself.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate if VL training alters linguistic representations, focusing on lexical-conceptual and taxonomic knowledge.

Method: Compare text-only LMs and VL-trained models using behavioral and representational analyses on a text-only QA task.

Result: VL models outperform text-only models in taxonomic QA tasks, but their taxonomic knowledge remains similar. Differences lie in how they represent taxonomic vs. non-taxonomic relations.

Conclusion: VL training enhances task-specific deployment of taxonomic knowledge without altering the knowledge itself.

Abstract: Does vision-and-language (VL) training change the linguistic representations
of language models in meaningful ways? Most results in the literature have
shown inconsistent or marginal differences, both behaviorally and
representationally. In this work, we start from the hypothesis that the domain
in which VL training could have a significant effect is lexical-conceptual
knowledge, in particular its taxonomic organization. Through comparing minimal
pairs of text-only LMs and their VL-trained counterparts, we first show that
the VL models often outperform their text-only counterparts on a text-only
question-answering task that requires taxonomic understanding of concepts
mentioned in the questions. Using an array of targeted behavioral and
representational analyses, we show that the LMs and VLMs do not differ
significantly in terms of their taxonomic knowledge itself, but they differ in
how they represent questions that contain concepts in a taxonomic relation vs.
a non-taxonomic relation. This implies that the taxonomic knowledge itself does
not change substantially through additional VL training, but VL training does
improve the deployment of this knowledge in the context of a specific task,
even when the presentation of the task is purely linguistic.

*Zhouqi Hua,Wenwei Zhang,Chengqi Lyu,Yuzhe Gu,Songyang Gao,Kuikun Liu,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes TAIL, a method to improve length generalization in LLMs by imitating Turing Machine execution, achieving better performance on synthetic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of length generalization in LLMs by focusing on computable reasoning problems solvable by Turing Machines.

Method: TAIL synthesizes chain-of-thoughts data mimicking Turing Machine execution, expanding reasoning steps into atomic states and using explicit memory fetch mechanisms.

Result: TAIL significantly improves length generalization and performance on synthetic tasks, outperforming previous methods.

Conclusion: Turing Machine concepts are crucial for TAIL, enabling consistent read-and-write behaviors in LLMs, offering a promising direction for future research.

Abstract: Length generalization, the ability to solve problems of longer sequences than
those observed during training, poses a core challenge of Transformer-based
large language models (LLM). Although existing studies have predominantly
focused on data-driven approaches for arithmetic operations and symbolic
manipulation tasks, these approaches tend to be task-specific with limited
overall performance. To pursue a more general solution, this paper focuses on a
broader case of reasoning problems that are computable, i.e., problems that
algorithms can solve, thus can be solved by the Turing Machine. From this
perspective, this paper proposes Turing MAchine Imitation Learning (TAIL) to
improve the length generalization ability of LLMs. TAIL synthesizes
chain-of-thoughts (CoT) data that imitate the execution process of a Turing
Machine by computer programs, which linearly expands the reasoning steps into
atomic states to alleviate shortcut learning and explicit memory fetch
mechanism to reduce the difficulties of dynamic and long-range data access in
elementary operations. To validate the reliability and universality of TAIL, we
construct a challenging synthetic dataset covering 8 classes of algorithms and
18 tasks. Without bells and whistles, TAIL significantly improves the length
generalization ability as well as the performance of Qwen2.5-7B on various
tasks using only synthetic data, surpassing previous methods and DeepSeek-R1.
The experimental results reveal that the key concepts in the Turing Machine,
instead of the thinking styles, are indispensable for TAIL for length
generalization, through which the model exhibits read-and-write behaviors
consistent with the properties of the Turing Machine in their attention layers.
This work provides a promising direction for future research in the learning of
LLM reasoning from synthetic data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Context Engineering, a systematic approach to optimizing contextual information for LLMs, and presents a taxonomy of its components and implementations. It highlights a research gap in model capabilities for generating sophisticated outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize and optimize the use of contextual information in LLMs, addressing the asymmetry between understanding and generating complex contexts.

Method: A comprehensive survey of over 1300 research papers, decomposing Context Engineering into foundational components (retrieval, generation, processing, management) and system implementations (RAG, memory systems, multi-agent systems).

Result: Establishes a technical roadmap for Context Engineering and identifies a critical gap in LLMs' ability to generate sophisticated long-form outputs despite advanced understanding.

Conclusion: The survey provides a unified framework for advancing context-aware AI, emphasizing the need to address the identified research gap in future work.

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is fundamentally determined
by the contextual information provided during inference. This survey introduces
Context Engineering, a formal discipline that transcends simple prompt design
to encompass the systematic optimization of information payloads for LLMs. We
present a comprehensive taxonomy decomposing Context Engineering into its
foundational components and the sophisticated implementations that integrate
them into intelligent systems. We first examine the foundational components:
context retrieval and generation, context processing and context management. We
then explore how these components are architecturally integrated to create
sophisticated system implementations: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
memory systems and tool-integrated reasoning, and multi-agent systems. Through
this systematic analysis of over 1300 research papers, our survey not only
establishes a technical roadmap for the field but also reveals a critical
research gap: a fundamental asymmetry exists between model capabilities. While
current models, augmented by advanced context engineering, demonstrate
remarkable proficiency in understanding complex contexts, they exhibit
pronounced limitations in generating equally sophisticated, long-form outputs.
Addressing this gap is a defining priority for future research. Ultimately,
this survey provides a unified framework for both researchers and engineers
advancing context-aware AI.

### [145] [Comparing Apples to Oranges: A Dataset & Analysis of LLM Humour Understanding from Traditional Puns to Topical Jokes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13335)
*Tyler Loakman,William Thorne,Chenghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can explain different types of humour, comparing their performance on simple puns and complex topical jokes. It finds current models, including reasoning models, fail to reliably explain all joke types, highlighting a gap in computational humour research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing computational humour research focuses on simple puns, neglecting more complex forms. This work investigates if LLMs can explain diverse humour types, addressing this oversight.

Method: A dataset of 600 jokes across 4 types (heterographic/homographic puns, internet humour, topical jokes) was curated, with manual explanations. Zero-shot abilities of various LLMs were tested for joke explanation.

Result: No tested model could reliably explain all joke types, especially those requiring world knowledge (e.g., news, pop culture).

Conclusion: Current LLMs struggle with complex humour, revealing a research gap in computational humour beyond simple puns.

Abstract: Humour, as a complex language form, is derived from myriad aspects of life,
whilst existing work on computational humour has focussed almost exclusively on
short pun-based jokes. In this work, we investigate whether the ability of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to explain humour depends on the particular humour
form. We compare models on simple puns and more complex topical humour that
requires knowledge of real-world entities and events. In doing so, we curate a
dataset of 600 jokes split across 4 joke types and manually write high-quality
explanations. These jokes include heterographic and homographic puns,
contemporary internet humour, and topical jokes, where understanding relies on
reasoning beyond "common sense", rooted instead in world knowledge regarding
news events and pop culture. Using this dataset, we compare the zero-shot
abilities of a range of LLMs to accurately and comprehensively explain jokes of
different types, identifying key research gaps in the task of humour
explanation. We find that none of the tested models (inc. reasoning models) are
capable of reliably generating adequate explanations of all joke types, further
highlighting the narrow focus of most works in computational humour on overly
simple joke forms.

TL;DR: Scaling test-time computation and RL with verifiable rewards improves reasoning in small language models, achieving significant gains in math, coding, and logic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effects of prolonged RL on small language models and identify key training ingredients for reasoning tasks.

Method: Uses verifiable reward tasks, enhanced GRPO, controlled KL regularization, clipping ratio, and periodic reference policy resets.

Result: Achieves +14.7% on math, +13.9% on coding, and +54.8% on logic puzzles over baselines.

Conclusion: Key techniques unlock long-term performance gains, and the model is released for further research.

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning-focused language models such as OpenAI's O1
and DeepSeek-R1 have shown that scaling test-time computation-through
chain-of-thought reasoning and iterative exploration-can yield substantial
improvements on complex tasks like mathematics and code generation. These
breakthroughs have been driven by large-scale reinforcement learning (RL),
particularly when combined with verifiable reward signals that provide
objective and grounded supervision. In this report, we investigate the effects
of prolonged reinforcement learning on a small language model across a diverse
set of reasoning domains. Our work identifies several key ingredients for
effective training, including the use of verifiable reward tasks, enhancements
to Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and practical techniques to
improve training stability and generalization. We introduce controlled KL
regularization, clipping ratio, and periodic reference policy resets as
critical components for unlocking long-term performance gains. Our model
achieves significant improvements over strong baselines, including +14.7% on
math, +13.9% on coding, and +54.8% on logic puzzle tasks. To facilitate
continued research, we release our model publicly.

TL;DR: The paper highlights the limitations of parallel-centric machine learning for inherently sequential problems, advocating for scaling serial computation in AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the blind spot in machine learning where some problems are fundamentally sequential and cannot be parallelized, impacting tasks like reasoning and simulations.

Method: The study formalizes the distinction between parallel and serial problems using complexity theory and evaluates current architectures.

Result: Demonstrates that parallel-centric architectures have fundamental limitations on inherently serial tasks.

Conclusion: Scaling serial computation is crucial for AI progress in complex reasoning and sequential tasks.

Abstract: While machine learning has advanced through massive parallelization, we
identify a critical blind spot: some problems are fundamentally sequential.
These "inherently serial" problems-from mathematical reasoning to physical
simulations to sequential decision-making-require dependent computational steps
that cannot be parallelized. Drawing from complexity theory, we formalize this
distinction and demonstrate that current parallel-centric architectures face
fundamental limitations on such tasks. We argue that recognizing the serial
nature of computation holds profound implications on machine learning, model
design, hardware development. As AI tackles increasingly complex reasoning,
deliberately scaling serial computation-not just parallel computation-is
essential for continued progress.

### [148] [Can Mental Imagery Improve the Thinking Capabilities of AI Systems?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12555)
*Slimane Larabi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a machine thinking framework integrating mental imagery to enhance autonomous reasoning, addressing limitations in current AI models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI models lack autonomous reasoning and struggle with cross-domain knowledge integration, unlike humans who use mental imagery for thinking.

Method: A machine thinking framework with a Cognitive Thinking Unit and three auxiliary units (Input Data, Needs, and Mental Imagery Units) is proposed, using natural language or sketches for data representation.

Result: Validation tests were conducted, with results presented and discussed.

Conclusion: Integrating mental imagery into AI frameworks can initiate autonomous thinking, bridging gaps in current models.

Abstract: Although existing models can interact with humans and provide satisfactory
responses, they lack the ability to act autonomously or engage in independent
reasoning. Furthermore, input data in these models is typically provided as
explicit queries, even when some sensory data is already acquired.
  In addition, AI agents, which are computational entities designed to perform
tasks and make decisions autonomously based on their programming, data inputs,
and learned knowledge, have shown significant progress. However, they struggle
with integrating knowledge across multiple domains, unlike humans.
  Mental imagery plays a fundamental role in the brain's thinking process,
which involves performing tasks based on internal multisensory data, planned
actions, needs, and reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we investigate how
to integrate mental imagery into a machine thinking framework and how this
could be beneficial in initiating the thinking process. Our proposed machine
thinking framework integrates a Cognitive thinking unit supported by three
auxiliary units: the Input Data Unit, the Needs Unit, and the Mental Imagery
Unit. Within this framework, data is represented as natural language sentences
or drawn sketches, serving both informative and decision-making purposes. We
conducted validation tests for this framework, and the results are presented
and discussed.

*Eduardo V. L. Barboza,Paulo R. Lisboa de Almeida,Alceu de Souza Britto Jr.,Robert Sabourin,Rafael M. O. Cruz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes IncA-DES, a framework for handling concept drift in data streams by combining local expert training, a concept drift detector, and an overlap-based classification filter. It also introduces an Online K-d tree to improve processing time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concept drift in data streams challenges traditional ML methods. Existing approaches like classifier fusion show promise but need adaptation for drift scenarios.

Method: IncA-DES trains local experts, uses a drift detector for adaptation, and employs an overlap-based filter. An Online K-d tree reduces processing time.

Result: IncA-DES achieved the best average accuracy and fastest processing time among state-of-the-art methods, with minimal accuracy loss from the K-d tree.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses concept drift and processing efficiency, making it practical for real-world data streams.

Abstract: Data streams pose challenges not usually encountered in batch-based ML. One
of them is concept drift, which is characterized by the change in data
distribution over time. Among many approaches explored in literature, the
fusion of classifiers has been showing good results and is getting growing
attention. DS methods, due to the ensemble being instance-based, seem to be an
efficient choice under drifting scenarios. However, some attention must be paid
to adapting such methods for concept drift. The training must be done in order
to create local experts, and the commonly used neighborhood-search DS may
become prohibitive with the continuous arrival of data. In this work, we
propose IncA-DES, which employs a training strategy that promotes the
generation of local experts with the assumption that different regions of the
feature space become available with time. Additionally, the fusion of a concept
drift detector supports the maintenance of information and adaptation to a new
concept. An overlap-based classification filter is also employed in order to
avoid using the DS method when there is a consensus in the neighborhood, a
strategy that we argue every DS method should employ, as it was shown to make
them more applicable and quicker. Moreover, aiming to reduce the processing
time of the kNN, we propose an Online K-d tree algorithm, which can quickly
remove instances without becoming inconsistent and deals with unbalancing
concerns that may occur in data streams. Experimental results showed that the
proposed framework got the best average accuracy compared to seven
state-of-the-art methods considering different levels of label availability and
presented the smaller processing time between the most accurate methods.
Additionally, the fusion with the Online K-d tree has improved processing time
with a negligible loss in accuracy. We have made our framework available in an
online repository.

TL;DR: Assay2Mol is a workflow using large language models to leverage unstructured biochemical assay data for early-stage drug discovery, outperforming other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unstructured text in biochemical assays contains valuable but untapped information for drug discovery.

Method: Assay2Mol retrieves similar assay records and generates candidate molecules using in-context learning with screening data.

Result: It outperforms recent machine learning approaches in generating candidate ligands and promotes synthesizable molecules.

Conclusion: Assay2Mol effectively utilizes unstructured assay data to enhance drug discovery.

Abstract: Scientific databases aggregate vast amounts of quantitative data alongside
descriptive text. In biochemistry, molecule screening assays evaluate the
functional responses of candidate molecules against disease targets.
Unstructured text that describes the biological mechanisms through which these
targets operate, experimental screening protocols, and other attributes of
assays offer rich information for new drug discovery campaigns but has been
untapped because of that unstructured format. We present Assay2Mol, a large
language model-based workflow that can capitalize on the vast existing
biochemical screening assays for early-stage drug discovery. Assay2Mol
retrieves existing assay records involving targets similar to the new target
and generates candidate molecules using in-context learning with the retrieved
assay screening data. Assay2Mol outperforms recent machine learning approaches
that generate candidate ligand molecules for target protein structures, while
also promoting more synthesizable molecule generation.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the k-centroids ranking vectors clustering problem (KRC), proving its NP-hardness and proposing efficient algorithms (KRCA and BnB) to solve it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to cluster ranking vectors, which represent preferences, for applications like personalization and large-scale decision making.

Method: The authors derive a closed-form solution for the single-cluster case and develop KRCA (an approximation algorithm) and BnB (a branch-and-bound algorithm) for efficient computation.

Result: KRCA outperforms baseline solutions in experiments, showing improved quality and speed. Theoretical error bounds are established.

Conclusion: KRC is practically significant, with methodological advancements for future research.

Abstract: We study the problem of clustering ranking vectors, where each vector
represents preferences as an ordered list of distinct integers. Specifically,
we focus on the k-centroids ranking vectors clustering problem (KRC), which
aims to partition a set of ranking vectors into k clusters and identify the
centroid of each cluster. Unlike classical k-means clustering (KMC), KRC
constrains both the observations and centroids to be ranking vectors. We
establish the NP-hardness of KRC and characterize its feasible set. For the
single-cluster case, we derive a closed-form analytical solution for the
optimal centroid, which can be computed in linear time. To address the
computational challenges of KRC, we develop an efficient approximation
algorithm, KRCA, which iteratively refines initial solutions from KMC, referred
to as the baseline solution. Additionally, we introduce a branch-and-bound
(BnB) algorithm for efficient cluster reconstruction within KRCA, leveraging a
decision tree framework to reduce computational time while incorporating a
controlling parameter to balance solution quality and efficiency. We establish
theoretical error bounds for KRCA and BnB. Through extensive numerical
experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that KRCA
consistently outperforms baseline solutions, delivering significant
improvements in solution quality with fast computational times. This work
highlights the practical significance of KRC for personalization and
large-scale decision making, offering methodological advancements and insights
that can be built upon in future studies.

*Yinan Li,Kwang-Sung Jun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores regression and cost-sensitive classification, showing the log loss minimizer's improved generalization. It introduces a novel betting loss for variance-dependent bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve generalization bounds in regression and classification, particularly by achieving variance-adaptive results without prior variance knowledge.

Method: Analyzes log loss minimizer's first-order bound, then proposes the betting loss for variance-dependent bounds.

Result: The betting loss achieves a variance-dependent bound, improving upon first-order bounds adaptively.

Conclusion: The betting loss provides a variance-adaptive solution, advancing regression and classification performance.

Abstract: We consider the $[0,1]$-valued regression problem in the i.i.d. setting. In a
related problem called cost-sensitive classification, \citet{foster21efficient}
have shown that the log loss minimizer achieves an improved generalization
bound compared to that of the squared loss minimizer in the sense that the
bound scales with the cost of the best classifier, which can be arbitrarily
small depending on the problem at hand. Such a result is often called a
first-order bound. For $[0,1]$-valued regression, we first show that the log
loss minimizer leads to a similar first-order bound. We then ask if there
exists a loss function that achieves a variance-dependent bound (also known as
a second order bound), which is a strict improvement upon first-order bounds.
We answer this question in the affirmative by proposing a novel loss function
called the betting loss. Our result is ``variance-adaptive'' in the sense that
the bound is attained \textit{without any knowledge about the variance}, which
is in contrast to modeling label (or reward) variance or the label distribution
itself explicitly as part of the function class such as distributional
reinforcement learning.

*Antoni Zajko,Katarzyna Woźnica*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes two novel methods for tabular representation learning tailored to warm-starting Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO), focusing on capturing landmarker properties. While effective in aligning with landmarkers, they may not significantly improve HPO warm-starting performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of representing heterogeneous tabular datasets for meta-learning, specifically for warm-starting Bayesian HPO, where universal representations fall short.

Method: Two approaches: (1) deep metric learning and (2) landmarkers reconstruction, both designed to meet a requirement of capturing landmarker properties.

Result: The encoders successfully learn representations aligned with landmarkers but show limited direct performance gains in HPO warm-starting.

Conclusion: While the methods meet the proposed requirement, their impact on the meta-task of HPO warm-starting is not substantial, suggesting further refinement is needed.

Abstract: Effectively representing heterogeneous tabular datasets for meta-learning
purposes is still an open problem. Previous approaches rely on representations
that are intended to be universal. This paper proposes two novel methods for
tabular representation learning tailored to a specific meta-task -
warm-starting Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization. Both follow the specific
requirement formulated by ourselves that enforces representations to capture
the properties of landmarkers. The first approach involves deep metric
learning, while the second one is based on landmarkers reconstruction. We
evaluate the proposed encoders in two ways. Next to the gain in the target
meta-task, we also use the degree of fulfillment of the proposed requirement as
the evaluation metric. Experiments demonstrate that while the proposed encoders
can effectively learn representations aligned with landmarkers, they may not
directly translate to significant performance gains in the meta-task of HPO
warm-starting.

Method: Uses behavioral divergences (e.g., Jensen Shannon Divergence) to model task relationships and provides a closed-form solution under simplex constraints.

Result: Improves performance on Llama 2 and Mistral across benchmarks like MMLU and BIGBench, with theoretical guarantees.

Conclusion: TASKPGM offers efficient, interpretable, and robust LLM finetuning by optimizing task mixtures.

Abstract: The performance of finetuned large language models (LLMs) hinges critically
on the composition of the training mixture. However, selecting an optimal blend
of task datasets remains a largely manual, heuristic driven process, with
practitioners often relying on uniform or size based sampling strategies. We
introduce TASKPGM, a principled and scalable framework for mixture optimization
that selects continuous task proportions by minimizing an energy function over
a Markov Random Field (MRF). Task relationships are modeled using behavioral
divergences such as Jensen Shannon Divergence and Pointwise Mutual Information
computed from the predictive distributions of single task finetuned models. Our
method yields a closed form solution under simplex constraints and provably
balances representativeness and diversity among tasks. We provide theoretical
guarantees, including weak submodularity for budgeted variants, and demonstrate
consistent empirical improvements on Llama 2 and Mistral across evaluation
suites such as MMLU and BIGBench. Beyond performance, TASKPGM offers
interpretable insights into task influence and mixture composition, making it a
powerful tool for efficient and robust LLM finetuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the startup overhead in training Large Language Models (LLMs), introduces Bootseer to reduce it by 50%, and analyzes its impact using real production data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Startup overhead in LLM training is critical in industrial-scale settings, wasting significant GPU time (over 3.5%) and hindering iterative workflows.

Method: The study characterizes startup overhead, identifies bottlenecks (container loading, dependency installation, checkpoint resumption), and designs Bootseer with techniques like hot block prefetch and dependency snapshotting.

Result: Bootseer reduces startup overhead by 50% in real-world LLM training workloads.

Conclusion: Addressing startup overhead is crucial for efficiency in LLM training, and Bootseer provides a practical solution with measurable impact.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone of modern AI, driving
breakthroughs in natural language processing and expanding into multimodal jobs
involving images, audio, and video. As with most computational software, it is
important to distinguish between ordinary runtime performance and startup
overhead. Prior research has focused on runtime performance: improving training
efficiency and stability. This work focuses instead on the increasingly
critical issue of startup overhead in training: the delay before training jobs
begin execution. Startup overhead is particularly important in large,
industrial-scale LLMs, where failures occur more frequently and multiple teams
operate in iterative update-debug cycles. In one of our training clusters, more
than 3.5% of GPU time is wasted due to startup overhead alone.
  In this work, we present the first in-depth characterization of LLM training
startup overhead based on real production data. We analyze the components of
startup cost, quantify its direct impact, and examine how it scales with job
size. These insights motivate the design of Bootseer, a system-level
optimization framework that addresses three primary startup bottlenecks: (a)
container image loading, (b) runtime dependency installation, and (c) model
checkpoint resumption. To mitigate these bottlenecks, Bootseer introduces three
techniques: (a) hot block record-and-prefetch, (b) dependency snapshotting, and
(c) striped HDFS-FUSE. Bootseer has been deployed in a production environment
and evaluated on real LLM training workloads, demonstrating a 50% reduction in
startup overhead.

*Jake Ward,Chuqiao Lin,Constantin Venhoff,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores backtracking in reasoning models, identifying a pre-existing direction in base model activations that induces backtracking in finetuned models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the underlying mechanism of backtracking in reasoning models and how finetuning repurposes base model representations.

Method: Identified a direction in base Llama-3.1-8B's residual stream and tested its effect on backtracking in the finetuned model.

Result: The identified direction induces backtracking in the finetuned model but not in the base model, suggesting repurposing of pre-existing representations.

Conclusion: Reasoning-finetuned models repurpose base model representations rather than learning new capabilities from scratch.

Abstract: Backtracking, an emergent behavior elicited by reasoning fine-tuning, has
been shown to be a key mechanism in reasoning models' enhanced capabilities.
Prior work has succeeded in manipulating this behavior via steering vectors,
but the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. In this work, we show
that the emergence of backtracking in DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B is in part
driven by a repurposed direction already present in base model activations.
Specifically, we identify a direction in base Llama-3.1-8B's residual stream
which systematically induces backtracking when used to steer the distilled
reasoning model, and find that the effects of steering with this direction
cannot be trivially explained by token-level attributes. We further find that
this direction does not induce backtracking in the base model, suggesting that
the reasoning finetuning process repurposes pre-existing representations to
form new behavioral circuits. Additionally, we hypothesize that this direction
is one of several which may work together to mediate backtracking. Our findings
offer a compelling picture that reasoning-finetuned models repurpose
pre-existing base model representations, rather than learn new capabilities
from scratch.

*Kai Malcolm,César Uribe,Momona Yamagami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FL-based neural decoding improves privacy and performance in open-loop scenarios but faces challenges in closed-loop, single-user settings, revealing a performance-privacy tradeoff.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns in neural data sharing for decoder training while maintaining high performance in neural interfaces.

Method: Introduce and evaluate federated learning (FL) for neural decoding using high-dimensional electromyography signals in open- and closed-loop scenarios.

Result: FL outperforms local learning in open-loop but requires adaptation for closed-loop, where local learning performs better but poses higher privacy risks.

Conclusion: FL shows promise for privacy-conscious neural decoding but needs tailored methods for real-time, single-user applications.

Abstract: Invasive and non-invasive neural interfaces hold promise as high-bandwidth
input devices for next-generation technologies. However, neural signals
inherently encode sensitive information about an individual's identity and
health, making data sharing for decoder training a critical privacy challenge.
Federated learning (FL), a distributed, privacy-preserving learning framework,
presents a promising solution, but it remains unexplored in closed-loop
adaptive neural interfaces. Here, we introduce FL-based neural decoding and
systematically evaluate its performance and privacy using high-dimensional
electromyography signals in both open- and closed-loop scenarios. In open-loop
simulations, FL significantly outperformed local learning baselines,
demonstrating its potential for high-performance, privacy-conscious neural
decoding. In contrast, closed-loop user studies required adapting FL methods to
accommodate single-user, real-time interactions, a scenario not supported by
standard FL. This modification resulted in local learning decoders surpassing
the adapted FL approach in closed-loop performance, yet local learning still
carried higher privacy risks. Our findings highlight a critical
performance-privacy tradeoff in real-time adaptive applications and indicate
the need for FL methods specifically designed for co-adaptive, single-user
applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a transfer learning method and adaptive activation functions to improve the extrapolation performance of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), reducing errors significantly without added computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs struggle with extrapolation and sensitivity to activation functions, limiting their broader application in scientific and engineering problems.

Method: The authors propose a transfer learning approach within an extended training domain and an adaptive activation function combining standard functions.

Result: Experiments show a 40% reduction in relative L2 error and 50% reduction in mean absolute error in extrapolation.

Conclusion: The method enhances PINNs' robustness and accuracy for extrapolation tasks, with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are deep learning models that
incorporate the governing physical laws of a system into the learning process,
making them well-suited for solving complex scientific and engineering
problems. Recently, PINNs have gained widespread attention as a powerful
framework for combining physical principles with data-driven modeling to
improve prediction accuracy. Despite their successes, however, PINNs often
exhibit poor extrapolation performance outside the training domain and are
highly sensitive to the choice of activation functions (AFs). In this paper, we
introduce a transfer learning (TL) method to improve the extrapolation
capability of PINNs. Our approach applies transfer learning (TL) within an
extended training domain, using only a small number of carefully selected
collocation points. Additionally, we propose an adaptive AF that takes the form
of a linear combination of standard AFs, which improves both the robustness and
accuracy of the model. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that our
method achieves an average of 40% reduction in relative L2 error and an average
of 50% reduction in mean absolute error in the extrapolation domain, all
without a significant increase in computational cost. The code is available at

Result: The study highlights the significance of selecting appropriate transformation techniques to preserve data integrity and enhance AI learning.

Conclusion: Comprehensive reviews of modern data transformation approaches are lacking, and this survey fills the gap by addressing format-related heterogeneity challenges.

Abstract: Data heterogeneity is a prevalent issue, stemming from various conflicting
factors, making its utilization complex. This uncertainty, particularly
resulting from disparities in data formats, frequently necessitates the
involvement of experts to find resolutions. Current methodologies primarily
address conflicts related to data structures and schemas, often overlooking the
pivotal role played by data transformation. As the utilization of artificial
intelligence (AI) continues to expand, there is a growing demand for a more
streamlined data preparation process, and data transformation becomes
paramount. It customizes training data to enhance AI learning efficiency and
adapts input formats to suit diverse AI models. Selecting an appropriate
transformation technique is paramount in preserving crucial data details.
Despite the widespread integration of AI across various industries,
comprehensive reviews concerning contemporary data transformation approaches
are scarce. This survey explores the intricacies of data heterogeneity and its
underlying sources. It systematically categorizes and presents strategies to
address heterogeneity stemming from differences in data formats, shedding light
on the inherent challenges associated with each strategy.

Motivation: To leverage user activity sequences for recommender systems at scale, overcoming challenges like latency, cost, and handling new items.

Method: Pretraining a transformer model (PinFM) on extensive user data, fine-tuning for applications, and using techniques like DCAT for efficiency.

Result: Achieved 600% throughput improvement and 20% engagement increase with new items, deployed for 500M+ users.

Conclusion: PinFM successfully addresses industrial recommender system challenges, enhancing user experience and engagement.

Abstract: User activity sequences have emerged as one of the most important signals in
recommender systems. We present a foundational model, PinFM, for understanding
user activity sequences across multiple applications at a billion-scale visual
discovery platform. We pretrain a transformer model with 20B+ parameters using
extensive user activity data, then fine-tune it for specific applications,
efficiently coupling it with existing models. While this
pretraining-and-fine-tuning approach has been popular in other domains, such as
Vision and NLP, its application in industrial recommender systems presents
numerous challenges. The foundational model must be scalable enough to score
millions of items every second while meeting tight cost and latency constraints
imposed by these systems. Additionally, it should capture the interactions
between user activities and other features and handle new items that were not
present during the pretraining stage.
  We developed innovative techniques to address these challenges. Our
infrastructure and algorithmic optimizations, such as the Deduplicated
Cross-Attention Transformer (DCAT), improved our throughput by 600% on
Pinterest internal data. We demonstrate that PinFM can learn interactions
between user sequences and candidate items by altering input sequences, leading
to a 20% increase in engagement with new items. PinFM is now deployed to help
improve the experience of more than a half billion users across various
applications.

Motivation: To theoretically clarify the training dynamics of deep neural networks, which remain unclear despite their success.

Method: Uses a matrix-valued stochastic differential equation (SDE) framework to model SGD dynamics and derive exact SDEs for singular-value spectra.

Result: Shows squared singular values follow Dyson Brownian motion with repulsion, leading to gamma-type stationary distributions with power-law tails.

Conclusion: Provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for understanding deep learning dynamics, validated by experiments on transformers and MLPs.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have revolutionized machine learning, yet their training
dynamics remain theoretically unclear-we develop a continuous-time,
matrix-valued stochastic differential equation (SDE) framework that rigorously
connects the microscopic dynamics of SGD to the macroscopic evolution of
singular-value spectra in weight matrices. We derive exact SDEs showing that
squared singular values follow Dyson Brownian motion with eigenvalue repulsion,
and characterize stationary distributions as gamma-type densities with
power-law tails, providing the first theoretical explanation for the
empirically observed 'bulk+tail' spectral structure in trained networks.
Through controlled experiments on transformer and MLP architectures, we
validate our theoretical predictions and demonstrate quantitative agreement
between SDE-based forecasts and observed spectral evolution, providing a
rigorous foundation for understanding why deep learning works.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dataset pruning methods rely on static heuristics or task-specific metrics, lacking robustness and generalizability.

Method: Uses a dynamic pruning framework with task-driven difficulty and cross-modality semantic consistency, leveraging pretrained multimodal foundation models.

Result: Effectively filters uninformative samples and captures training dynamics, enhancing efficiency and robustness.

Conclusion: Integrating cross-modality alignment advances data-centric learning for efficient and robust practices across domains.

Abstract: Modern deep models are trained on large real-world datasets, where data
quality varies and redundancy is common. Data-centric approaches such as
dataset pruning have shown promise in improving training efficiency and model
performance. However, most existing methods rely on static heuristics or
task-specific metrics, limiting their robustness and generalizability across
domains. In this work, we introduce a dynamic dataset pruning framework that
adaptively selects training samples based on both task-driven difficulty and
cross-modality semantic consistency. By incorporating supervision from
pretrained multimodal foundation models, our approach captures training
dynamics while effectively filtering out uninformative samples. Our work
highlights the potential of integrating cross-modality alignment for robust
sample selection, advancing data-centric learning toward more efficient and
robust practices across application domains.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the LySep model, a layer separation framework, to improve deep learning optimization for solving PDEs by decomposing deep networks into shallow ones using auxiliary variables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for PDEs suffer from suboptimal local minima and gradient issues due to non-convex loss functions.

Method: LySep introduces auxiliary variables to separate layers, creating shallow architectures with coupled neighboring layers, and develops alternating direction algorithms.

Result: Theoretical consistency with deep models is proven, and numerical results show LySep's effectiveness in loss minimization and error reduction.

Conclusion: LySep offers a robust optimization framework for deep learning in PDEs, addressing key challenges in non-convex optimization.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new optimization framework, the layer separation
(LySep) model, to improve the deep learning-based methods in solving partial
differential equations. Due to the highly non-convex nature of the loss
function in deep learning, existing optimization algorithms often converge to
suboptimal local minima or suffer from gradient explosion or vanishing,
resulting in poor performance. To address these issues, we introduce auxiliary
variables to separate the layers of deep neural networks. Specifically, the
output and its derivatives of each layer are represented by auxiliary
variables, effectively decomposing the deep architecture into a series of
shallow architectures. New loss functions with auxiliary variables are
established, in which only variables from two neighboring layers are coupled.
Corresponding algorithms based on alternating directions are developed, where
many variables can be updated optimally in closed forms. Moreover, we provide
theoretical analyses demonstrating the consistency between the LySep model and
the original deep model. High-dimensional numerical results validate our theory
and demonstrate the advantages of LySep in minimizing loss and reducing
solution error.

Abstract: With the continuous evolution of China's multi-level capital market, the
National Equities Exchange and Quotations (NEEQ), also known as the "New Third

enterprises (SMEs). However, due to their limited scale and financial
resilience, many NEEQ-listed companies face elevated risks of financial
distress. To address this issue, we propose a multi-channel deep learning

Specifically, we design a Triple-Channel Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) that
processes numeric, textual, and graph-based inputs separately. These
modality-specific representations are fused using an attention-based mechanism
followed by a gating unit to enhance robustness and prediction accuracy.
Experimental results on data from 7,731 real-world NEEQ companies demonstrate

Motivation: Addressing the limitations of Transformer-based and Mamba-based models in handling multi-scale periodicity, transient dynamics, and noise in long-term time series prediction.

Method: Proposes FLDmamba, integrating Fourier and Laplace transforms with Mamba to decompose and model time series data effectively.

Result: FLDmamba outperforms Transformer-based and other Mamba-based models on time series benchmarks.

Conclusion: FLDmamba offers a robust and efficient solution for long-term time series prediction, with code and data made available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Time series prediction, a crucial task across various domains, faces
significant challenges due to the inherent complexities of time series data,
including non-stationarity, multi-scale periodicity, and transient dynamics,
particularly when tackling long-term predictions. While Transformer-based
architectures have shown promise, their quadratic complexity with sequence
length hinders their efficiency for long-term predictions. Recent advancements
in State-Space Models, such as Mamba, offer a more efficient alternative for
long-term modeling, but they cannot capture multi-scale periodicity and
transient dynamics effectively. Meanwhile, they are susceptible to data noise
issues in time series. This paper proposes a novel framework, FLDmamba (Fourier
and Laplace Transform Decomposition Mamba), addressing these limitations.
FLDmamba leverages the strengths of both Fourier and Laplace transforms to
effectively capture both multi-scale periodicity, transient dynamics within
time series data, and improve the robustness of the model to the data noise
issue. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that FLDmamba achieves superior
performance on time series prediction benchmarks, outperforming both
Transformer-based and other Mamba-based architectures. To promote the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current learning-based lossless compressors for genomic data suffer from inadequate compression ratio, low throughput, and poor robustness, limiting their adoption.

Method: PMKLC introduces four key designs: a multi-knowledge learning framework, GPU-accelerated encoder, parallel acceleration mechanisms, and two compression modes (single-GPU and multi-GPU).

Result: PMKLC achieves up to 73.6% better compression ratio and 10.7x faster throughput compared to baselines, with strong robustness and memory efficiency.

Conclusion: PMKLC is a highly effective and stable solution for genomic data compression, suitable for diverse scenarios and resource constraints.

Abstract: Learning-based lossless compressors play a crucial role in large-scale
genomic database backup, storage, transmission, and management. However, their
1) inadequate compression ratio, 2) low compression \& decompression
throughput, and 3) poor compression robustness limit their widespread adoption
and application in both industry and academia. To solve those challenges, we
propose a novel \underline{P}arallel \underline{M}ulti-\underline{K}nowledge
\underline{L}earning-based \underline{C}ompressor (PMKLC) with four crucial
designs: 1) We propose an automated multi-knowledge learning-based compression
framework as compressors' backbone to enhance compression ratio and robustness;
2) we design a GPU-accelerated ($s$,$k$)-mer encoder to optimize compression
throughput and computing resource usage; 3) we introduce data block
partitioning and Step-wise Model Passing (SMP) mechanisms for parallel
acceleration; 4) We design two compression modes PMKLC-S and PMKLC-M to meet
the complex application scenarios, where the former runs on a
resource-constrained single GPU and the latter is multi-GPU accelerated. We
benchmark PMKLC-S/M and 14 baselines (7 traditional and 7 leaning-based) on 15
real-world datasets with different species and data sizes. Compared to
baselines on the testing datasets, PMKLC-S/M achieve the average compression
ratio improvement up to 73.609\% and 73.480\%, the average throughput
improvement up to 3.036$\times$ and 10.710$\times$, respectively. Besides,
PMKLC-S/M also achieve the best robustness and competitive memory cost,
indicating its greater stability against datasets with different probability

TL;DR: The paper introduces RONOM, a framework combining reduced-order modeling and neural operator learning to address computational challenges in solving time-dependent PDEs, offering improved flexibility and error quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between reduced-order modeling (ROM) and neural operator learning, addressing limitations like fixed discretization in ROM and lack of error quantification in neural operators.

Method: Proposes the RONOM framework, integrating ROM and neural operator learning, with theoretical error bounds and numerical validation.

Result: RONOM achieves comparable input generalization and superior spatial super-resolution and discretization robustness compared to existing neural operators.

Conclusion: RONOM effectively combines ROM and operator learning, providing theoretical and practical advantages for solving PDEs in varying scenarios.

Abstract: Time-dependent partial differential equations are ubiquitous in physics-based
modeling, but they remain computationally intensive in many-query scenarios,
such as real-time forecasting, optimal control, and uncertainty quantification.
Reduced-order modeling (ROM) addresses these challenges by constructing a
low-dimensional surrogate model but relies on a fixed discretization, which
limits flexibility across varying meshes during evaluation. Operator learning
approaches, such as neural operators, offer an alternative by parameterizing
mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces, enabling adaptation to
data across different resolutions. Whereas ROM provides rigorous numerical
error estimates, neural operator learning largely focuses on discretization
convergence and invariance without quantifying the error between the
infinite-dimensional and the discretized operators. This work introduces the
reduced-order neural operator modeling (RONOM) framework, which bridges
concepts from ROM and operator learning. We establish a discretization error
bound analogous to those in ROM, and get insights into RONOM's discretization
convergence and discretization robustness. Moreover, two numerical examples are
presented that compare RONOM to existing neural operators for solving partial
differential equations. The results demonstrate that RONOM using standard
vector-to-vector neural networks achieves comparable performance in input
generalization and superior performance in both spatial super-resolution and
discretization robustness, while also offering novel insights into temporal
super-resolution scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReLOAD introduces a reward annotation framework for offline RL using intrinsic rewards from expert demonstrations, avoiding costly handcrafted rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL struggles with the need for explicit reward annotations, which are expensive or hard to obtain. ReLOAD addresses this by generating intrinsic rewards.

Method: ReLOAD uses Random Network Distillation (RND) to create intrinsic rewards. A predictor network mimics a target network's embeddings, and the prediction error serves as the reward signal.

Result: Experiments on D4RL show ReLOAD achieves competitive performance without handcrafted rewards.

Conclusion: ReLOAD provides a practical solution for offline RL by leveraging intrinsic rewards, reducing dependency on explicit annotations.

Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to learn effective policies from a
static dataset without requiring further agent-environment interactions.
However, its practical adoption is often hindered by the need for explicit
reward annotations, which can be costly to engineer or difficult to obtain
retrospectively. To address this, we propose ReLOAD (Reinforcement Learning
with Offline Reward Annotation via Distillation), a novel reward annotation
framework for offline RL. Unlike existing methods that depend on complex
alignment procedures, our approach adapts Random Network Distillation (RND) to
generate intrinsic rewards from expert demonstrations using a simple yet
effective embedding discrepancy measure. First, we train a predictor network to
mimic a fixed target network's embeddings based on expert state transitions.
Later, the prediction error between these networks serves as a reward signal
for each transition in the static dataset. This mechanism provides a structured
reward signal without requiring handcrafted reward annotations. We provide a
formal theoretical construct that offers insights into how RND prediction
errors effectively serve as intrinsic rewards by distinguishing expert-like
transitions. Experiments on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that ReLOAD enables
robust offline policy learning and achieves performance competitive with
traditional reward-annotated methods.

### [170] [Understanding the Evolution of the Neural Tangent Kernel at the Edge of Stability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12837)
*Kaiqi Jiang,Jeremy Cohen,Yuanzhi Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the dynamics of Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) eigenvectors during the Edge of Stability (EoS) phenomenon, revealing that larger learning rates improve alignment with training targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite prior studies on NTK eigenvalues during EoS, the behavior of NTK eigenvectors remains unexplored. This gap motivates the study.

Method: The paper analyzes NTK eigenvector dynamics across architectures and provides theoretical analysis for a two-layer linear network.

Result: Larger learning rates enhance alignment of leading NTK eigenvectors with training targets.

Conclusion: The study advances understanding of Gradient Descent dynamics in deep learning by elucidating NTK eigenvector behavior during EoS.

Abstract: The study of Neural Tangent Kernels (NTKs) in deep learning has drawn
increasing attention in recent years. NTKs typically actively change during
training and are related to feature learning. In parallel, recent work on
Gradient Descent (GD) has found a phenomenon called Edge of Stability (EoS), in
which the largest eigenvalue of the NTK oscillates around a value inversely
proportional to the step size. However, although follow-up works have explored
the underlying mechanism of such eigenvalue behavior in depth, the
understanding of the behavior of the NTK eigenvectors during EoS is still
missing. This paper examines the dynamics of NTK eigenvectors during EoS in
detail. Across different architectures, we observe that larger learning rates
cause the leading eigenvectors of the final NTK, as well as the full NTK
matrix, to have greater alignment with the training target. We then study the
underlying mechanism of this phenomenon and provide a theoretical analysis for
a two-layer linear network. Our study enhances the understanding of GD training
dynamics in deep learning.

### [171] [A Kernel Distribution Closeness Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12843)
*Zhijian Zhou,Liuhua Peng,Xunye Tian,Feng Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces norm-adaptive MMD (NAMMD) to improve distribution closeness testing (DCT) by addressing limitations of MMD, showing higher test power in theory and experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DCT methods are limited to discrete one-dimensional spaces, making them unsuitable for complex data like images. MMD, while powerful, lacks informativeness for assessing closeness levels of multiple distribution pairs.

Method: The authors propose NAMMD, which scales MMD's value using RKHS norms of distributions, and develop NAMMD-based DCT. They also apply NAMMD to two-sample testing.

Result: NAMMD-based DCT outperforms MMD-based DCT in test power with bounded type-I error. NAMMD also enhances two-sample testing, showing higher power than MMD-based tests.

Conclusion: NAMMD is a more effective measurement for DCT and two-sample testing, validated by theoretical proofs and experiments on diverse data types.

Abstract: The distribution closeness testing (DCT) assesses whether the distance
between a distribution pair is at least $\epsilon$-far. Existing DCT methods
mainly measure discrepancies between a distribution pair defined on discrete
one-dimensional spaces (e.g., using total variation), which limits their
applications to complex data (e.g., images). To extend DCT to more types of
data, a natural idea is to introduce maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), a powerful
measurement of the distributional discrepancy between two complex
distributions, into DCT scenarios. However, we find that MMD's value can be the
same for many pairs of distributions that have different norms in the same
reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), making MMD less informative when
assessing the closeness levels for multiple distribution pairs. To mitigate the
issue, we design a new measurement of distributional discrepancy, norm-adaptive
MMD (NAMMD), which scales MMD's value using the RKHS norms of distributions.
Based on the asymptotic distribution of NAMMD, we finally propose the
NAMMD-based DCT to assess the closeness levels of a distribution pair.
Theoretically, we prove that NAMMD-based DCT has higher test power compared to
MMD-based DCT, with bounded type-I error, which is also validated by extensive
experiments on many types of data (e.g., synthetic noise, real images).
Furthermore, we also apply the proposed NAMMD for addressing the two-sample
testing problem and find NAMMD-based two-sample test has higher test power than
the MMD-based two-sample test in both theory and experiments.

*Danilo Avola,Andrea Bernardini,Francesco Danese,Mario Lezoche,Maurizio Mancini,Daniele Pannone,Amedeo Ranaldi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A transformer-based method identifies individuals from Wi-Fi CSI while stationary, achieving 99.82% accuracy with a dual-branch architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wi-Fi sensing offers a privacy-preserving alternative to vision-based systems, but stationary identification remains unexplored.

Method: Uses CSI data with preprocessing (outlier removal, smoothing, phase calibration) and a dual-branch transformer for amplitude and phase.

Result: Achieves 99.82% accuracy, outperforming baselines like CNNs and MLPs.

Conclusion: Demonstrates CSI's potential for passive, device-free identification with low-cost Wi-Fi hardware.

Abstract: Wi-Fi sensing is gaining momentum as a non-intrusive and privacy-preserving
alternative to vision-based systems for human identification. However, person
identification through wireless signals, particularly without user motion,
remains largely unexplored. Most prior wireless-based approaches rely on
movement patterns, such as walking gait, to extract biometric cues. In
contrast, we propose a transformer-based method that identifies individuals
from Channel State Information (CSI) recorded while the subject remains
stationary. CSI captures fine-grained amplitude and phase distortions induced
by the unique interaction between the human body and the radio signal. To
support evaluation, we introduce a dataset acquired with ESP32 devices in a
controlled indoor environment, featuring six participants observed across
multiple orientations. A tailored preprocessing pipeline, including outlier
removal, smoothing, and phase calibration, enhances signal quality. Our
dual-branch transformer architecture processes amplitude and phase modalities
separately and achieves 99.82\% classification accuracy, outperforming
convolutional and multilayer perceptron baselines. These results demonstrate
the discriminative potential of CSI perturbations, highlighting their capacity
to encode biometric traits in a consistent manner. They further confirm the
viability of passive, device-free person identification using low-cost
commodity Wi-Fi hardware in real-world settings.

TL;DR: The paper connects Behavior Cloning (BC) to Reinforcement Learning (RL), proposing an importance-weighted variant (iw-SFT) that improves performance and aligns closer to RL objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RL, improving performance with a simple modification.

Method: Introduces importance-weighted SFT (iw-SFT), optimizing a tighter bound to the RL objective and generalizing to quality-scored data.

Result: iw-SFT outperforms standard SFT, achieving 66.7% on the AIME 2024 dataset, and competes with advanced RL methods.

Conclusion: iw-SFT is a simple, effective alternative to RL for fine-tuning, offering competitive performance in language models and control tasks.

Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) on curated (or filtered) data is the predominant
paradigm for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models; as well as
for imitation learning of control policies. Here, we draw on a connection
between this successful strategy and the theory and practice of finding optimal
policies via Reinforcement Learning (RL). Building on existing literature, we
clarify that SFT can be understood as maximizing a lower bound on the RL
objective in a sparse reward setting. Giving support to its often observed good
performance. From this viewpoint, we realize that a small modification to SFT
leads to an importance weighted variant that behaves closer to training with RL
as it: i) optimizes a tighter bound to the RL objective and, ii) can improve
performance compared to SFT on curated data. We refer to this variant as
importance weighted supervised fine-tuning (iw-SFT). We show that it is easy to
implement and can be further generalized to training with quality scored data.
The resulting SFT variants are competitive with more advanced RL algorithms for
large language models and for training policies in continuous control tasks.
For example achieving 66.7% on the AIME 2024 dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional EEG-based biometric systems are secure but inconvenient due to scalp-based setups. Ear-EEG offers a more user-friendly alternative.

Method: The system extracts temporal and spectral features from ear-EEG signals and uses a fully connected deep neural network for subject identification.

Result: The system achieved an average accuracy of 82% in subject identification.

Conclusion: Ear-EEG shows promise as a practical and deployable solution for next-generation biometric authentication.

Abstract: This work explores the feasibility of biometric authentication using EEG
signals acquired through in-ear devices, commonly referred to as ear-EEG.
Traditional EEG-based biometric systems, while secure, often suffer from low
usability due to cumbersome scalp-based electrode setups. In this study, we
propose a novel and practical framework leveraging ear-EEG signals as a
user-friendly alternative for everyday biometric authentication. The system
extracts an original combination of temporal and spectral features from ear-EEG
signals and feeds them into a fully connected deep neural network for subject
identification. Experimental results on the only currently available ear-EEG
dataset suitable for different purposes, including biometric authentication,
demonstrate promising performance, with an average accuracy of 82\% in a

ear-EEG as a viable and deployable direction for next-generation real-world
biometric systems.

Motivation: Traditional activation functions like ReLU have limitations in handling data topology. The study aims to improve neural networks' ability to transform complex data manifolds.

Method: Proposes SmoothSplit and ParametricSplit, which introduce topology "cutting" capabilities. Experiments are conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Result: ParametricSplit outperforms traditional activations in low-dimensional settings while maintaining competitive performance in higher-dimensional ones.

Conclusion: Topology-aware activation functions like ParametricSplit show promise in advancing neural network architectures.

Abstract: This study explores novel activation functions that enhance the ability of
neural networks to manipulate data topology during training. Building on the
limitations of traditional activation functions like $\mathrm{ReLU}$, we
propose $\mathrm{SmoothSplit}$ and $\mathrm{ParametricSplit}$, which introduce
topology "cutting" capabilities. These functions enable networks to transform

TL;DR: VIDAR is a two-stage framework using video diffusion pre-training and masked inverse dynamics for bimanual robotic manipulation, achieving strong generalization with minimal human demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data scarcity and embodiment heterogeneity hinder scaling bimanual robotic manipulation. VIDAR aims to address these challenges.

Method: VIDAR combines large-scale video diffusion pre-training on 750K multi-view videos and a masked inverse dynamics model for action prediction without pixel-level labels.

Result: With only 20 minutes of human demonstrations (1% of typical data), VIDAR generalizes to unseen tasks and backgrounds, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Video foundation models with masked action prediction can enable scalable and generalizable robotic manipulation in diverse real-world settings.

Abstract: Bimanual robotic manipulation, which involves the coordinated control of two
robotic arms, is foundational for solving challenging tasks. Despite recent
progress in general-purpose manipulation, data scarcity and embodiment
heterogeneity remain serious obstacles to further scaling up in bimanual
settings. In this paper, we introduce VIdeo Diffusion for Action Reasoning
(VIDAR), a two-stage framework that leverages large-scale, diffusion-based
video pre-training and a novel masked inverse dynamics model for action
prediction. We pre-train the video diffusion model on 750K multi-view videos
from three real-world bimanual robot platforms, utilizing a unified observation
space that encodes robot, camera, task, and scene contexts. Our masked inverse
dynamics model learns masks to extract action-relevant information from
generated trajectories without requiring pixel-level labels, and the masks can
effectively generalize to unseen backgrounds. Our experiments demonstrate that
with only 20 minutes of human demonstrations on an unseen robot platform (only
1% of typical data requirements), VIDAR generalizes to unseen tasks and
backgrounds with strong semantic understanding, surpassing state-of-the-art
methods. Our findings highlight the potential of video foundation models,
coupled with masked action prediction, to enable scalable and generalizable
robotic manipulation in diverse real-world settings.

*Luca Stradiotti,Dario Pesenti,Stefano Teso,Jesse Davis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework (LtX) for classifiers to reject inputs with low-quality explanations, introducing ULER to assess and reject poor explanations based on human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-stakes applications like credit scoring require trustworthy ML predictions, but poor explanations hinder user trust and decision-making.

Method: Introduces ULER, a rejector trained on human ratings and feature relevance to evaluate explanation quality.

Result: ULER outperforms state-of-the-art methods in rejecting low-quality explanations across benchmarks and a new human-annotated dataset.

Conclusion: The LtX framework and ULER effectively improve explanation quality and trust in ML predictions, with potential for broader adoption.

Abstract: Machine Learning predictors are increasingly being employed in high-stakes
applications such as credit scoring. Explanations help users unpack the reasons
behind their predictions, but are not always "high quality''. That is,
end-users may have difficulty interpreting or believing them, which can
complicate trust assessment and downstream decision-making. We argue that
classifiers should have the option to refuse handling inputs whose predictions
cannot be explained properly and introduce a framework for learning to reject
low-quality explanations (LtX) in which predictors are equipped with a rejector
that evaluates the quality of explanations. In this problem setting, the key
challenges are how to properly define and assess explanation quality and how to
design a suitable rejector. Focusing on popular attribution techniques, we
introduce ULER (User-centric Low-quality Explanation Rejector), which learns a
simple rejector from human ratings and per-feature relevance judgments to
mirror human judgments of explanation quality. Our experiments show that ULER
outperforms both state-of-the-art and explanation-aware learning to reject
strategies at LtX on eight classification and regression benchmarks and on a
new human-annotated dataset, which we will publicly release to support future
research.

*Jiadong Chen,Hengyu Ye,Fuxin Jiang,Xiao He,Tieying Zhang,Jianjun Chen,Xiaofeng Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fremer is an efficient deep forecasting model for cloud workload, outperforming Transformers in speed and accuracy while handling multi-period series.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models lack efficiency for large-scale cloud workloads, and workload series often have complex periodic patterns, making frequency-domain approaches advantageous.

Method: Fremer is proposed as a frequency-domain deep forecasting model, tested on proprietary and public datasets, and evaluated in Kubernetes auto-scaling.

Result: Fremer improves MSE by 5.5%, MAE by 4.7%, and SMAPE by 8.6% over SOTA models, reduces computational costs, and enhances auto-scaling performance.

Conclusion: Fremer is a practical, efficient, and accurate solution for cloud workload forecasting, validated in real-world applications.

Abstract: Workload forecasting is pivotal in cloud service applications, such as
auto-scaling and scheduling, with profound implications for operational
efficiency. Although Transformer-based forecasting models have demonstrated
remarkable success in general tasks, their computational efficiency often falls
short of the stringent requirements in large-scale cloud environments. Given
that most workload series exhibit complicated periodic patterns, addressing
these challenges in the frequency domain offers substantial advantages. To this
end, we propose Fremer, an efficient and effective deep forecasting model.
Fremer fulfills three critical requirements: it demonstrates superior
efficiency, outperforming most Transformer-based forecasting models; it
achieves exceptional accuracy, surpassing all state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in
workload forecasting; and it exhibits robust performance for multi-period
series. Furthermore, we collect and open-source four high-quality, open-source
workload datasets derived from ByteDance's cloud services, encompassing
workload data from thousands of computing instances. Extensive experiments on
both our proprietary datasets and public benchmarks demonstrate that Fremer
consistently outperforms baseline models, achieving average improvements of
5.5% in MSE, 4.7% in MAE, and 8.6% in SMAPE over SOTA models, while
simultaneously reducing parameter scale and computational costs. Additionally,
in a proactive auto-scaling test based on Kubernetes, Fremer improves average
latency by 18.78% and reduces resource consumption by 2.35%, underscoring its
practical efficacy in real-world applications.

*Chenrui Zhu,Louenas Bounia,Vu Linh Nguyen,Sébastien Destercke,Arthur Hoarau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using prediction uncertainty (aleatoric and epistemic) to enhance model interpretability by guiding explanation selection and rejecting unreliable ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for transparency in complex machine learning models where interpretability is challenging.

Method: Distinguishing between aleatoric (data-related) and epistemic (model-related) uncertainty to inform explanation choices and reject unreliable ones.

Result: Experiments show improved robustness and attainability of explanations in traditional and deep learning scenarios.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-aware methods enhance interpretability by leveraging uncertainty quantification to guide and validate explanations.

Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning have emphasized the need for
transparency in model predictions, particularly as interpretability diminishes
when using increasingly complex architectures. In this paper, we propose
leveraging prediction uncertainty as a complementary approach to classical
explainability methods. Specifically, we distinguish between aleatoric
(data-related) and epistemic (model-related) uncertainty to guide the selection
of appropriate explanations. Epistemic uncertainty serves as a rejection
criterion for unreliable explanations and, in itself, provides insight into
insufficient training (a new form of explanation). Aleatoric uncertainty
informs the choice between feature-importance explanations and counterfactual
explanations. This leverages a framework of explainability methods driven by
uncertainty quantification and disentanglement. Our experiments demonstrate the
impact of this uncertainty-aware approach on the robustness and attainability
of explanations in both traditional machine learning and deep learning
scenarios.

TL;DR: TReconLM uses language models for trace reconstruction, outperforming existing methods by adapting to error patterns in DNA data storage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to recover sequences from noisy copies in DNA data storage, where errors occur during synthesis, storage, and sequencing.

Method: Pretrain language models on synthetic data and fine-tune on real-world data to handle technology-specific errors.

Result: TReconLM achieves higher accuracy in sequence recovery compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.

Conclusion: TReconLM is a promising solution for trace reconstruction in DNA data storage, improving data retrieval reliability.

Abstract: The general trace reconstruction problem seeks to recover an original
sequence from its noisy copies independently corrupted by deletions,
insertions, and substitutions. This problem arises in applications such as DNA
data storage, a promising storage medium due to its high information density
and longevity. However, errors introduced during DNA synthesis, storage, and
sequencing require correction through algorithms and codes, with trace
reconstruction often used as part of the data retrieval process. In this work,
we propose TReconLM, which leverages language models trained on next-token
prediction for trace reconstruction. We pretrain language models on synthetic
data and fine-tune on real-world data to adapt to technology-specific error
patterns. TReconLM outperforms state-of-the-art trace reconstruction
algorithms, including prior deep learning approaches, recovering a
substantially higher fraction of sequences without error.

TL;DR: The paper introduces two modifications to the DAPO algorithm to improve stability and sample efficiency in sparse reward settings, using a mixed-policy approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard policy gradient methods often face instability and inefficiency, especially in sparse reward scenarios.

Method: 1. Incorporates a pre-trained guiding policy for off-policy experience to stabilize training. 2. Reuses zero-reward samples guided by an expert policy to enhance efficiency.

Result: Theoretical analysis confirms convergence to optimal solutions, improving stability and sample efficiency.

Conclusion: The mixed-policy framework balances exploration and exploitation, offering more stable and efficient policy optimization.

Abstract: This paper introduces two novel modifications to the Differentiable Automatic
Post-editing Optimization (DAPO) algorithm, approached from a mixed-policy
perspective. Standard policy gradient methods can suffer from instability and
sample inefficiency, particularly in sparse reward settings. To address this,
we first propose a method that incorporates a pre-trained, stable guiding
policy ($\piphi$) to provide off-policy experience, thereby regularizing the
training of the target policy ($\pion$). This approach improves training
stability and convergence speed by adaptively adjusting the learning step size.
Secondly, we extend this idea to re-utilize zero-reward samples, which are
often discarded by dynamic sampling strategies like DAPO's. By treating these
samples as a distinct batch guided by the expert policy, we further enhance
sample efficiency. We provide a theoretical analysis for both methods,
demonstrating that their objective functions converge to the optimal solution
within the established theoretical framework of reinforcement learning. The
proposed mixed-policy framework effectively balances exploration and
exploitation, promising more stable and efficient policy optimization.

Motivation: High computational costs of MCMC algorithms limit their feasibility for large-scale problems, and existing acceleration solutions lack flexibility or efficiency.

Method: MC²A extends the roofline model, proposes a parametrized hardware accelerator, and introduces a novel Gumbel sampler to eliminate costly operations.

Result: MC²A achieves speedups of 307.6×, 1.4×, 2.0×, and 84.2× over CPU, GPU, TPU, and state-of-the-art MCMC accelerators, respectively.

Conclusion: MC²A demonstrates the feasibility of general hardware acceleration for MCMC, enabling broader adoption in diverse applications.

Abstract: An increasing number of applications are exploiting sampling-based algorithms
for planning, optimization, and inference. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
algorithms form the computational backbone of this emerging branch of machine
learning. Unfortunately, the high computational cost limits their feasibility
for large-scale problems and real-world applications, and the existing MCMC
acceleration solutions are either limited in hardware flexibility or fail to
maintain efficiency at the system level across a variety of end-to-end
applications. This paper introduces \textbf{MC$^2$A}, an algorithm-hardware
co-design framework, enabling efficient and flexible optimization for MCMC
acceleration. Firstly, \textbf{MC$^2$A} analyzes the MCMC workload diversity
through an extension of the processor performance roofline model with a 3rd

accelerator architecture with flexible and efficient support of MCMC kernels
with a pipeline of ISA-programmable tree-structured processing units,
reconfigurable samplers and a crossbar interconnect to support irregular

TL;DR: ARES is a probabilistic framework for detecting propagated errors in LLM reasoning chains, outperforming existing methods with certified guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Initial errors in LLM reasoning chains propagate and undermine reliability; current methods fail to detect these due to improper accounting of error corruption.

Method: ARES uses an autoregressive inductive approach, judging claims based on sound premises, providing nuanced scores and statistical guarantees.

Result: ARES achieves state-of-the-art performance (72.1% Macro-F1, +8.2 points) and excels in robustness on long reasoning chains (90.3% F1, +27.6 points).

Conclusion: ARES effectively mitigates error propagation in LLM reasoning, offering superior detection and reliability.

Abstract: In reasoning chains generated by large language models (LLMs), initial errors
often propagate and undermine the reliability of the final conclusion. Current
LLM-based error detection methods often fail to detect propagated errors
because they do not properly account for how earlier errors might corrupt
judgments of downstream reasoning. To better detect such propagated errors, we
introduce Autoregressive Reasoning Entailment Stability (ARES), a novel
probabilistic framework that prevents error propagation by judging each claim
based only on previously-assessed sound premises. This inductive method yields
a nuanced score for each step and provides certified statistical guarantees of
its soundness, rather than a brittle binary label. ARES achieves
state-of-the-art performance across four benchmarks (72.1% Macro-F1, +8.2
points) and demonstrates superior robustness on very long synthetic reasoning
chains, where it excels at detecting propagated errors (90.3% F1, +27.6
points).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing AI interpretability in healthcare for safety, transparency, and trust, given the high stakes of medical decisions.

Method: Uses sparse autoencoders (SAEs) on MAIRA-2 to identify and interpret internal features, followed by steering experiments.

Result: Identified clinically relevant concepts (e.g., medical devices, pathologies) and demonstrated partial control over model behavior.

Conclusion: The study advances mechanistic interpretability for radiology LLMs, highlighting challenges and potential for improved transparency.

Abstract: Interpretability can improve the safety, transparency and trust of AI models,
which is especially important in healthcare applications where decisions often
carry significant consequences. Mechanistic interpretability, particularly
through the use of sparse autoencoders (SAEs), offers a promising approach for
uncovering human-interpretable features within large transformer-based models.
In this study, we apply Matryoshka-SAE to the radiology-specialised multimodal
large language model, MAIRA-2, to interpret its internal representations. Using
large-scale automated interpretability of the SAE features, we identify a range
of clinically relevant concepts - including medical devices (e.g., line and
tube placements, pacemaker presence), pathologies such as pleural effusion and
cardiomegaly, longitudinal changes and textual features. We further examine the
influence of these features on model behaviour through steering, demonstrating
directional control over generations with mixed success. Our results reveal
practical and methodological challenges, yet they offer initial insights into
the internal concepts learned by MAIRA-2 - marking a step toward deeper
mechanistic understanding and interpretability of a radiology-adapted
multimodal large language model, and paving the way for improved model
transparency. We release the trained SAEs and interpretations:

Method: The paper introduces a variant of MRGNN based on a Fairing algorithm, providing a pass-band spectral filter for smoothing without shrinkage, adapted to graphs via the Laplacian operator.

Result: Theoretical analysis links spectral coefficient tuning to modulating redundant random walks. Experiments with MRGNN show the approach's potential for tasks like graph classification.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively controls smoothing in GNNs, with theoretical insights and experimental results suggesting promising future research directions.

Abstract: Reservoir computing has been successfully applied to graphs as a
preprocessing method to improve the training efficiency of Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs). However, a common issue that arises when repeatedly applying
layer operators on graphs is over-smoothing, which consists in the convergence
of graph signals toward low-frequency components of the graph Laplacian. This
work revisits the definition of the reservoir in the Multiresolution Reservoir
Graph Neural Network (MRGNN), a spectral reservoir model, and proposes a
variant based on a Fairing algorithm originally introduced in the field of
surface design in computer graphics. This algorithm provides a pass-band
spectral filter that allows smoothing without shrinkage, and it can be adapted
to the graph setting through the Laplacian operator. Given its spectral
formulation, this method naturally connects to GNN architectures for tasks
where smoothing, when properly controlled, can be beneficial,such as graph
classification. The core contribution of the paper lies in the theoretical
analysis of the algorithm from a random walks perspective. In particular, it
shows how tuning the spectral coefficients can be interpreted as modulating the
contribution of redundant random walks. Exploratory experiments based on the
MRGNN architecture illustrate the potential of this approach and suggest
promising directions for future research.

### [186] [WaveletInception Networks for Drive-by Vibration-Based Infrastructure Health Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12969)
*Reza Riahi Samani,Alfredo Nunez,Bart De Schutter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep learning framework (WaveletInception-BiLSTM) for infrastructure health monitoring using drive-by vibration signals, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in railway track stiffness estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve infrastructure health monitoring by leveraging spectral and temporal information from drive-by vibration signals without preprocessing.

Method: Combines WaveletInception (LWPT and 1D Inception) for feature extraction and BiLSTM for temporal dependency modeling, enabling high-resolution health assessment.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in railway track stiffness estimation, demonstrating accurate and automated monitoring.

Conclusion: The framework is effective for localized, automated infrastructure health monitoring, with potential for broader applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel deep learning-based framework for infrastructure
health monitoring using drive-by vibration response signals. Recognizing the
importance of spectral and temporal information, we introduce the
WaveletInception-BiLSTM network. The WaveletInception feature extractor
utilizes a Learnable Wavelet Packet Transform (LWPT) as the stem for extracting
vibration signal features, incorporating spectral information in the early
network layers. This is followed by 1D Inception networks that extract
multi-scale, high-level features at deeper layers. The extracted vibration
signal features are then integrated with operational conditions via a Long
Short-term Memory (LSTM) layer. The resulting feature extraction network
effectively analyzes drive-by vibration signals across various measurement
speeds without preprocessing and uses LSTM to capture interrelated temporal
dependencies among different modes of information and to create feature vectors
for health condition estimation. The estimator head is designed with a
sequential modeling architecture using bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) networks,
capturing bi-directional temporal relationships from drive-by measurements.
This architecture allows for a high-resolution, beam-level assessment of
infrastructure health conditions. A case study focusing on railway track
stiffness estimation with simulated drive-by vibration signals shows that the
model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in estimating railway
ballast and railpad stiffness parameters. Results underscore the potential of
this approach for accurate, localized, and fully automated drive-by
infrastructure health monitoring.

*Youssef Tawfilis,Hossam Amer,Minar El-Aasser,Tallal Elshabrawy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel decentralized GAN training approach combines KLD-weighted Clustered Federated Learning and Heterogeneous U-Shaped split learning to utilize distributed data and underutilized devices without raw data sharing, improving performance metrics significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training generative models requires large datasets and computational resources, which are often unavailable due to privacy concerns and device limitations.

Method: Combines KLD-weighted Clustered Federated Learning for data heterogeneity and Heterogeneous U-Shaped split learning for device heterogeneity under strict data-sharing constraints.

Result: Achieves 1.1x-2.2x higher image generation scores, 10% average boost in classification metrics (up to 50% in non-IID settings), and lower latency.

Conclusion: The approach effectively leverages distributed resources while preserving privacy, demonstrating superior performance in decentralized environments.

Abstract: Federated Learning has gained increasing attention for its ability to enable
multiple nodes to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing
their raw data. At the same time, Generative AI -- particularly Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) -- have achieved remarkable success across a wide
range of domains, such as healthcare, security, and Image Generation. However,
training generative models typically requires large datasets and significant
computational resources, which are often unavailable in real-world settings.
Acquiring such resources can be costly and inefficient, especially when many
underutilized devices -- such as IoT devices and edge devices -- with varying
capabilities remain idle. Moreover, obtaining large datasets is challenging due
to privacy concerns and copyright restrictions, as most devices are unwilling
to share their data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach
for decentralized GAN training that enables the utilization of distributed data
and underutilized, low-capability devices while not sharing data in its raw
form. Our approach is designed to tackle key challenges in decentralized
environments, combining KLD-weighted Clustered Federated Learning to address
the issues of data heterogeneity and multi-domain datasets, with Heterogeneous
U-Shaped split learning to tackle the challenge of device heterogeneity under
strict data sharing constraints -- ensuring that no labels or raw data, whether
real or synthetic, are ever shared between nodes. Experimental results shows
that our approach demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across
key performance metrics, where it achieves 1.1x -- 2.2x higher image generation
scores, an average 10% boost in classification metrics (up to 50% in
multi-domain non-IID settings), in much lower latency compared to several
benchmarks. Find our code at https://github.com/youssefga28/HuSCF-GAN.

TL;DR: FedGA is a fairness-aware federated learning algorithm that addresses performance disparities in heterogeneous data settings by dynamically adjusting aggregation weights based on real-time fairness metrics like the Gini coefficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data heterogeneity in federated learning leads to performance disparities among clients, raising fairness concerns.

Method: Uses the Gini coefficient to measure disparity, establishes a relationship between the coefficient and model updates, and dynamically adjusts aggregation weights for fairness.

Result: Experiments show FedGA improves fairness metrics (variance, Gini coefficient) while maintaining strong overall performance.

Conclusion: FedGA effectively balances fairness and performance in federated learning.

Abstract: Fairness has emerged as one of the key challenges in federated learning. In
horizontal federated settings, data heterogeneity often leads to substantial
performance disparities across clients, raising concerns about equitable model
behavior. To address this issue, we propose FedGA, a fairness-aware federated
learning algorithm. We first employ the Gini coefficient to measure the
performance disparity among clients. Based on this, we establish a relationship
between the Gini coefficient $G$ and the update scale of the global model
${U_s}$, and use this relationship to adaptively determine the timing of
fairness intervention. Subsequently, we dynamically adjust the aggregation
weights according to the system's real-time fairness status, enabling the
global model to better incorporate information from clients with relatively
poor performance.We conduct extensive experiments on the Office-Caltech-10,
CIFAR-10, and Synthetic datasets. The results show that FedGA effectively
improves fairness metrics such as variance and the Gini coefficient, while
maintaining strong overall performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of our
approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A residual learning approach improves Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) by capturing domain-specific features missed by primary models, enhancing interpretability without full retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the feature blindness of SAEs in capturing domain-specific features not prevalent in their training data.

Method: Train a secondary SAE to model reconstruction errors of a pretrained SAE on domain-specific texts, combining outputs during inference.

Result: Significant improvements in LLM cross-entropy and explained variance metrics across specialized domains.

Conclusion: Enables selective enhancement of SAE interpretability for specific domains, advancing targeted mechanistic interpretability of LLMs.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders have emerged as powerful tools for interpreting the
internal representations of Large Language Models, yet they often fail to
capture domain-specific features not prevalent in their training corpora. This
paper introduces a residual learning approach that addresses this feature
blindness without requiring complete retraining. We propose training a
secondary SAE specifically to model the reconstruction error of a pretrained
SAE on domain-specific texts, effectively capturing features missed by the
primary model. By summing the outputs of both models during inference, we
demonstrate significant improvements in both LLM cross-entropy and explained
variance metrics across multiple specialized domains. Our experiments show that
this method efficiently incorporates new domain knowledge into existing SAEs
while maintaining their performance on general tasks. This approach enables
researchers to selectively enhance SAE interpretability for specific domains of
interest, opening new possibilities for targeted mechanistic interpretability
of LLMs.

### [190] [SMART: Relation-Aware Learning of Geometric Representations for Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13001)
*Kossi Amouzouvi,Bowen Song,Andrea Coletta,Luigi Bellomarini,Jens Lehmann,Sahar Vahdati*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to evaluate and assign the best geometric transformations for relations in knowledge graphs, improving representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current KGE models use generic geometric transformations for all relations, lacking relation-specific adaptability.

Method: The framework ranks transformations for each relation, assigns the best match or uses majority voting, and employs an attention mechanism for low-dimensional learning.

Result: The model performs comparably to leading models on benchmark and real-world financial KGs.

Conclusion: Relation-specific geometric transformations enhance KGE model performance.

Abstract: Knowledge graph representation learning approaches provide a mapping between
symbolic knowledge in the form of triples in a knowledge graph (KG) and their
feature vectors. Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models often represent
relations in a KG as geometric transformations. Most state-of-the-art (SOTA)
KGE models are derived from elementary geometric transformations (EGTs), such
as translation, scaling, rotation, and reflection, or their combinations. These
geometric transformations enable the models to effectively preserve specific
structural and relational patterns of the KG. However, the current use of EGTs
by KGEs remains insufficient without considering relation-specific
transformations. Although recent models attempted to address this problem by
ensembling SOTA baseline models in different ways, only a single or composite
version of geometric transformations are used by such baselines to represent
all the relations. In this paper, we propose a framework that evaluates how
well each relation fits with different geometric transformations. Based on this
ranking, the model can: (1) assign the best-matching transformation to each
relation, or (2) use majority voting to choose one transformation type to apply
across all relations. That is, the model learns a single relation-specific EGT
in low dimensional vector space through an attention mechanism. Furthermore, we
use the correlation between relations and EGTs, which are learned in a low
dimension, for relation embeddings in a high dimensional vector space. The
effectiveness of our models is demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations
on three benchmark KGs as well as a real-world financial KG, witnessing a
performance comparable to leading models

TL;DR: A novel onboard fault detection and diagnostic framework for reusable space launchers' electrical systems, using a temporal convolutional autoencoder and calibrated classifiers, with techniques for confidence estimation, OOD detection, and false alarm control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a fault detection system for engine valve control in reusable space launchers, addressing broader requirements like confidence estimation, OOD detection, and false alarm control.

Method: Uses a temporal convolutional autoencoder for feature extraction, binary and multiclass classifiers for fault detection/diagnosis, and techniques like inductive conformal anomaly detection, CUSUM, and threshold moving.

Result: Evaluated on simulated data, showing promise but requires real-world testing for operational maturity.

Conclusion: The framework is a promising initial step, though further validation with real data is needed.

Abstract: In the context of the health monitoring for the next generation of reusable
space launchers, we outline a first step toward developing an onboard fault
detection and diagnostic capability for the electrical system that controls the
engine valves. Unlike existing approaches in the literature, our solution is
designed to meet a broader range of key requirements. This includes estimating
confidence levels for predictions, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) cases,
and controlling false alarms. The proposed solution is based on a temporal
convolutional autoencoder to automatically extract low-dimensional features
from raw sensor data. Fault detection and diagnosis are respectively carried
out using a binary and a multiclass classifier trained on the autoencoder
latent and residual spaces. The classifiers are histogram-based gradient
boosting models calibrated to output probabilities that can be interpreted as
confidence levels. A relatively simple technique, based on inductive conformal
anomaly detection, is used to identify OOD data. We leverage other simple yet
effective techniques, such as cumulative sum control chart (CUSUM) to limit the
false alarms, and threshold moving to address class imbalance in fault
detection. The proposed framework is highly configurable and has been evaluated
on simulated data, covering both nominal and anomalous operational scenarios.
The results indicate that our solution is a promising first step, though
testing with real data will be necessary to ensure that it achieves the
required maturity level for operational use.

*Ahmed Emam,Ribana Roscher*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Confidence-Filtered Relevance (CFR), a framework combining LRP Attention Rollout and Deep Deterministic Uncertainty (DDU) to analyze how model uncertainty affects interpretability in satellite imagery for naturalness assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for monitoring protected natural areas lack interpretability and uncertainty-awareness, especially in assessing naturalness.

Method: CFR integrates LRP Attention Rollout with DDU to partition datasets by uncertainty thresholds, analyzing how uncertainty influences relevance heatmaps.

Result: CFR identified shrublands, forests, and wetlands as highly relevant for naturalness, with interpretability declining as uncertainty rises.

Conclusion: CFR offers a data-centric approach to evaluate naturalness relevance in satellite imagery, linking certainty to interpretability.

Abstract: Protected natural areas play a vital role in ecological balance and ecosystem
services. Monitoring these regions at scale using satellite imagery and machine
learning is promising, but current methods often lack interpretability and
uncertainty-awareness, and do not address how uncertainty affects naturalness
assessment. In contrast, we propose Confidence-Filtered Relevance (CFR), a
data-centric framework that combines LRP Attention Rollout with Deep
Deterministic Uncertainty (DDU) estimation to analyze how model uncertainty
influences the interpretability of relevance heatmaps. CFR partitions the
dataset into subsets based on uncertainty thresholds, enabling systematic
analysis of how uncertainty shapes the explanations of naturalness in satellite
imagery. Applied to the AnthroProtect dataset, CFR assigned higher relevance to
shrublands, forests, and wetlands, aligning with other research on naturalness
assessment. Moreover, our analysis shows that as uncertainty increases, the
interpretability of these relevance heatmaps declines and their entropy grows,
indicating less selective and more ambiguous attributions. CFR provides a
data-centric approach to assess the relevance of patterns to naturalness in
satellite imagery based on their associated certainty.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Transformer architectures for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF), proposing a taxonomy to disentangle design choices and identify optimal configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Transformer models for LTSF are coupled with time-series-specific designs, making it hard to evaluate architecture impact.

Method: A novel taxonomy is introduced to compare Transformer architectures, focusing on attention mechanisms, forecasting aggregations, paradigms, and normalization layers.

Result: Key findings: bi-directional attention with joint-attention works best; complete forecasting aggregation improves performance; direct-mapping outperforms autoregressive approaches.

Conclusion: The combined model with optimal choices outperforms existing models, providing guidance for future Transformer designs in LTSF.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have recently become dominant in Long-term Time
Series Forecasting (LTSF), yet the variations in their architecture, such as
encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only designs, raise a crucial
question: What Transformer architecture works best for LTSF tasks? However,
existing models are often tightly coupled with various time-series-specific
designs, making it difficult to isolate the impact of the architecture itself.
To address this, we propose a novel taxonomy that disentangles these designs,
enabling clearer and more unified comparisons of Transformer architectures. Our
taxonomy considers key aspects such as attention mechanisms, forecasting
aggregations, forecasting paradigms, and normalization layers. Through
extensive experiments, we uncover several key insights: bi-directional
attention with joint-attention is most effective; more complete forecasting
aggregation improves performance; and the direct-mapping paradigm outperforms
autoregressive approaches. Furthermore, our combined model, utilizing optimal
architectural choices, consistently outperforms several existing models,
reinforcing the validity of our conclusions. We hope these findings offer
valuable guidance for future research on Transformer architectural designs in
LTSF. Our code is available at https://github.com/HALF111/TSF_architecture.

provides a comprehensive review of recent advances in LLM alignment through the
lens of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), emphasizing the distinctions
between RL techniques employed in LLM alignment and those in conventional RL
tasks. In particular, we highlight the necessity of constructing neural reward
models from human data and discuss the formal and practical implications of
this paradigm shift. We begin by introducing fundamental concepts in RL to
provide a foundation for readers unfamiliar with the field. We then examine
recent advances in this research agenda, discussing key challenges and
opportunities in conducting IRL for LLM alignment. Beyond methodological
considerations, we explore practical aspects, including datasets, benchmarks,
evaluation metrics, infrastructure, and computationally efficient training and
inference techniques. Finally, we draw insights from the literature on
sparse-reward RL to identify open questions and potential research directions.
By synthesizing findings from diverse studies, we aim to provide a structured

TL;DR: The paper explores PAC and online learnability of hypothesis classes derived from countably infinite graphs, focusing on finite-support permutations and their implications for learnability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the conditions under which graph labelings and structures can be learned, given knowledge of the graph's structure and label set.

Method: Analyzes classes of graphs where permutations have finite support, linking PAC learnability to online learnability and automorphic triviality. Also examines learnability for k-vertex permutations.

Result: Shows that PAC learnability of finite-support copies implies online learnability of the full isomorphism type, and characterizes graphs where learnability fails. Also establishes a four-class partition of infinite graphs.

Conclusion: The study provides a framework for understanding learnability in infinite graphs, connecting it to automorphic triviality and descriptive set theory.

Abstract: We study PAC and online learnability of hypothesis classes formed by copies
of a countably infinite graph G, where each copy is induced by permuting G's
vertices. This corresponds to learning a graph's labeling, knowing its
structure and label set. We consider classes where permutations move only
finitely many vertices. Our main result shows that PAC learnability of all such
finite-support copies implies online learnability of the full isomorphism type
of G, and is equivalent to the condition of automorphic triviality. We also
characterize graphs where copies induced by swapping two vertices are not
learnable, using a relaxation of the extension property of the infinite random
graph. Finally, we show that, for all G and k>2, learnability for k-vertex
permutations is equivalent to that for 2-vertex permutations, yielding a
four-class partition of infinite graphs, whose complexity we also determine
using tools coming from both descriptive set theory and computability theory.

Result: DASViT outperforms ViT-B/16 on multiple datasets with fewer parameters and FLOPs, breaking traditional Transformer designs.

Conclusion: DASViT successfully bridges the gap in differentiable search for ViTs, offering a more efficient and innovative solution.

Abstract: Designing effective neural networks is a cornerstone of deep learning, and
Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a powerful tool for automating
this process. Among the existing NAS approaches, Differentiable Architecture
Search (DARTS) has gained prominence for its efficiency and ease of use,
inspiring numerous advancements. Since the rise of Vision Transformers (ViT),
researchers have applied NAS to explore ViT architectures, often focusing on
macro-level search spaces and relying on discrete methods like evolutionary
algorithms. While these methods ensure reliability, they face challenges in

Motivation: To address the need for XAI methods that are deterministic, model-agnostic, and convergent, ensuring trustworthy and explainable AI systems.

Method: MUPAX uses measure-theoretic formulation for feature importance attribution via structured perturbation analysis, eliminating spurious relationships.

Result: MUPAX outperforms other XAI methods by preserving or enhancing model accuracy and works across diverse data modalities (1D, 2D, 3D).

Conclusion: MUPAX provides precise, consistent, and understandable explanations, advancing the development of trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: Robust XAI techniques should ideally be simultaneously deterministic, model
agnostic, and guaranteed to converge. We propose MULTIDIMENSIONAL PROBLEM
AGNOSTIC EXPLAINABLE AI (MUPAX), a deterministic, model agnostic explainability
technique, with guaranteed convergency. MUPAX measure theoretic formulation
gives principled feature importance attribution through structured perturbation
analysis that discovers inherent input patterns and eliminates spurious
relationships. We evaluate MUPAX on an extensive range of data modalities and
tasks: audio classification (1D), image classification (2D), volumetric medical
image analysis (3D), and anatomical landmark detection, demonstrating dimension
agnostic effectiveness. The rigorous convergence guarantees extend to any loss
function and arbitrary dimensions, making MUPAX applicable to virtually any
problem context for AI. By contrast with other XAI methods that typically
decrease performance when masking, MUPAX not only preserves but actually
enhances model accuracy by capturing only the most important patterns of the
original data. Extensive benchmarking against the state of the XAI art
demonstrates MUPAX ability to generate precise, consistent and understandable

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a cross-modal knowledge distillation framework to improve EEG learning by addressing modality and label inconsistencies, outperforming baselines in emotion tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG signals in BCIs are prone to errors, degrading model performance. Multimodal knowledge distillation is explored but faces challenges like modality gap and label misalignment.

Method: A novel framework aligns feature semantics via a prototype-based similarity module and uses a task-specific distillation head to resolve label inconsistencies.

Result: The approach enhances EEG-based emotion regression and classification, surpassing unimodal and multimodal baselines on a public dataset.

Conclusion: The framework shows promise for BCI applications by effectively mitigating semantic uncertainty and improving EEG learning.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a fundamental modality for cognitive state
monitoring in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, it is highly
susceptible to intrinsic signal errors and human-induced labeling errors, which
lead to label noise and ultimately degrade model performance. To enhance EEG
learning, multimodal knowledge distillation (KD) has been explored to transfer
knowledge from visual models with rich representations to EEG-based models.
Nevertheless, KD faces two key challenges: modality gap and soft label
misalignment. The former arises from the heterogeneous nature of EEG and visual
feature spaces, while the latter stems from label inconsistencies that create
discrepancies between ground truth labels and distillation targets. This paper
addresses semantic uncertainty caused by ambiguous features and weakly defined
labels. We propose a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that
mitigates both modality and label inconsistencies. It aligns feature semantics
through a prototype-based similarity module and introduces a task-specific
distillation head to resolve label-induced inconsistency in supervision.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves EEG-based emotion
regression and classification performance, outperforming both unimodal and
multimodal baselines on a public multimodal dataset. These findings highlight
the potential of our framework for BCI applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph generation methods lack interpretability, obscuring the rationale behind structural decisions.

Method: NGTM represents graphs as mixtures of latent topics, each defining distributions over meaningful substructures, integrating topic distributions with a global structural variable.

Result: NGTM achieves competitive generation quality while enabling fine-grained control and interpretability, allowing topic-level adjustments.

Conclusion: NGTM provides a transparent and interpretable approach to graph generation, with practical applications in domains like molecular design.

Abstract: Graph generation plays a pivotal role across numerous domains, including
molecular design and knowledge graph construction. Although existing methods
achieve considerable success in generating realistic graphs, their
interpretability remains limited, often obscuring the rationale behind
structural decisions. To address this challenge, we propose the Neural Graph
Topic Model (NGTM), a novel generative framework inspired by topic modeling in
natural language processing. NGTM represents graphs as mixtures of latent
topics, each defining a distribution over semantically meaningful
substructures, which facilitates explicit interpretability at both local and
global scales. The generation process transparently integrates these topic
distributions with a global structural variable, enabling clear semantic
tracing of each generated graph. Experiments demonstrate that NGTM achieves
competitive generation quality while uniquely enabling fine-grained control and
interpretability, allowing users to tune structural features or induce
biological properties through topic-level adjustments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited availability of open-source datasets with diverse nonverbal vocalizations (NVs) restricts expressive speech synthesis research.

Method: The dataset is created using automated detection and human validation from VoxCeleb and Expresso. A pipeline integrates ASR, NV tagging, emotion classification, and fusion of multiple annotators' transcriptions. Open-source TTS models are fine-tuned on NVTTS.

Result: Fine-tuned models match closed-source systems (e.g., CosyVoice2) in human evaluation and automatic metrics like speaker similarity and NV fidelity.

Conclusion: NVTTS and its guidelines address a key bottleneck in expressive TTS research, with the dataset publicly available.

Abstract: Current expressive speech synthesis models are constrained by the limited
availability of open-source datasets containing diverse nonverbal vocalizations
(NVs). In this work, we introduce NonverbalTTS (NVTTS), a 17-hour open-access
dataset annotated with 10 types of NVs (e.g., laughter, coughs) and 8 emotional

### [201] [Spectral Bellman Method: Unifying Representation and Exploration in RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13181)
*Ofir Nabati,Bo Dai,Shie Mannor,Guy Tennenholtz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Spectral Bellman Representation, a novel framework aligning representation learning with Bellman updates for value-based RL, improving performance in hard-exploration tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing representation learning in RL misaligns with tasks; this work aims to align it with Bellman updates for better performance.

Method: Derived from Inherent Bellman Error (IBE), the framework leverages a spectral relationship between Bellman operator transformations and feature covariance.

Result: The method improves structured exploration and performance, especially in hard-exploration and long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: Spectral Bellman Representation provides a principled, effective approach for learning better representations in value-based RL.

Abstract: The effect of representation has been demonstrated in reinforcement learning,
from both theoretical and empirical successes. However, the existing
representation learning mainly induced from model learning aspects, misaligning
with our RL tasks. This work introduces Spectral Bellman Representation, a
novel framework derived from the Inherent Bellman Error (IBE) condition, which
aligns with the fundamental structure of Bellman updates across a space of
possible value functions, therefore, directly towards value-based RL. Our key
insight is the discovery of a fundamental spectral relationship: under the
zero-IBE condition, the transformation of a distribution of value functions by
the Bellman operator is intrinsically linked to the feature covariance
structure. This spectral connection yields a new, theoretically-grounded
objective for learning state-action features that inherently capture this
Bellman-aligned covariance. Our method requires a simple modification to
existing algorithms. We demonstrate that our learned representations enable
structured exploration, by aligning feature covariance with Bellman dynamics,
and improve overall performance, particularly in challenging hard-exploration
and long-horizon credit assignment tasks. Our framework naturally extends to
powerful multi-step Bellman operators, further broadening its impact. Spectral
Bellman Representation offers a principled and effective path toward learning
more powerful and structurally sound representations for value-based
reinforcement learning.

*Shreyas Chaudhari,Srinivasa Pranav,José M. F. Moura*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Monotone Gradient Networks (mGradNets) to learn optimal transport maps by minimizing a loss based on the Monge-Ampère equation, demonstrating effectiveness in robot swarm control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimal transport problems, crucial in fields like fluid dynamics and robot swarm control, require solving the Monge formulation, where monotone gradient maps are key.

Method: Proposes mGradNets, neural networks parameterizing monotone gradient maps, and trains them using a loss derived from the Monge-Ampère equation.

Result: Empirical results show mGradNets effectively learn optimal transport maps, applied successfully in robot swarm control.

Conclusion: mGradNets offer a promising approach for solving optimal transport problems, with practical applications like robot swarm control.

Abstract: Monotone gradient functions play a central role in solving the Monge
formulation of the optimal transport problem, which arises in modern
applications ranging from fluid dynamics to robot swarm control. When the
transport cost is the squared Euclidean distance, Brenier's theorem guarantees
that the unique optimal map is the gradient of a convex function, namely a
monotone gradient map, and it satisfies a Monge-Amp\`ere equation. In
[arXiv:2301.10862] [arXiv:2404.07361], we proposed Monotone Gradient Networks
(mGradNets), neural networks that directly parameterize the space of monotone
gradient maps. In this work, we leverage mGradNets to directly learn the
optimal transport mapping by minimizing a training loss function defined using
the Monge-Amp\`ere equation. We empirically show that the structural bias of
mGradNets facilitates the learning of optimal transport maps and employ our
method for a robot swarm control problem.

*Etienne Le Naour,Tahar Nabil,Ghislain Agoua*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes MoTM, a foundation model for time series imputation using implicit neural representations (INRs) and ridge regressors to handle distribution shifts and missing data scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the underexplored task of out-of-domain imputation of missing values in time series, leveraging INRs for continuous modeling but overcoming their limitations under distribution shifts.

Method: Introduces MoTM (Mixture of Timeflow Models), combining a basis of INRs trained on distinct time series families with a ridge regressor for context adaptation at inference.

Result: Demonstrates robust in-domain and out-of-domain generalization across diverse imputation scenarios (e.g., block and pointwise missingness, variable sampling rates).

Conclusion: MoTM paves the way for adaptable foundation models for time series imputation, addressing key challenges in the field.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a growing interest for time series foundation
models, with a strong emphasis on the forecasting task. Yet, the crucial task
of out-of-domain imputation of missing values remains largely underexplored. We
propose a first step to fill this gap by leveraging implicit neural
representations (INRs). INRs model time series as continuous functions and
naturally handle various missing data scenarios and sampling rates. While they
have shown strong performance within specific distributions, they struggle
under distribution shifts. To address this, we introduce MoTM (Mixture of
Timeflow Models), a step toward a foundation model for time series imputation.
Building on the idea that a new time series is a mixture of previously seen
patterns, MoTM combines a basis of INRs, each trained independently on a
distinct family of time series, with a ridge regressor that adapts to the
observed context at inference. We demonstrate robust in-domain and
out-of-domain generalization across diverse imputation scenarios (e.g., block
and pointwise missingness, variable sampling rates), paving the way for
adaptable foundation imputation models.

*Maria Margarida Mascarenhas,Jilles De Blauwe,Mikael Amelin,Hussain Kazmi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores using asynchronously published electricity prices from markets with earlier gate closure times (GCTs) to improve forecasting accuracy in other markets. Results show significant accuracy improvements in Belgian and Swedish zones when incorporating data from interconnected markets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate short-term electricity price forecasting is vital for optimizing demand and generation bids in day-ahead markets. The study investigates whether leveraging price data from markets with earlier GCTs can enhance forecasting in other zones.

Method: The study employs a state-of-the-art ensemble of models, incorporating price data from interconnected markets (Germany-Luxembourg, Austria, Switzerland) with earlier GCTs to forecast prices in Belgian (BE) and Swedish (SE3) zones.

Result: Forecast accuracy improved by 22% in BE and 9% in SE3 when using data from markets with earlier GCTs. The findings hold under general and extreme market conditions. Frequent model recalibration is necessary but computationally costly.

Conclusion: Incorporating data from interconnected markets with earlier GCTs significantly improves forecasting accuracy. However, frequent recalibration and selective data use are key for optimal performance, offering valuable insights for market participants in volatile European energy markets.

Abstract: Accurate short-term electricity price forecasting is crucial for
strategically scheduling demand and generation bids in day-ahead markets. While
data-driven techniques have shown considerable prowess in achieving high
forecast accuracy in recent years, they rely heavily on the quality of input
covariates. In this paper, we investigate whether asynchronously published
prices as a result of differing gate closure times (GCTs) in some bidding zones
can improve forecasting accuracy in other markets with later GCTs. Using a
state-of-the-art ensemble of models, we show significant improvements of 22%
and 9% in forecast accuracy in the Belgian (BE) and Swedish bidding zones (SE3)
respectively, when including price data from interconnected markets with
earlier GCT (Germany-Luxembourg, Austria, and Switzerland). This improvement
holds for both general as well as extreme market conditions. Our analysis also
yields further important insights: frequent model recalibration is necessary
for maximum accuracy but comes at substantial additional computational costs,
and using data from more markets does not always lead to better performance - a
fact we delve deeper into with interpretability analysis of the forecast
models. Overall, these findings provide valuable guidance for market
participants and decision-makers aiming to optimize bidding strategies within
increasingly interconnected and volatile European energy markets.

### [205] [Merge Kernel for Bayesian Optimization on Permutation Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13263)
*Zikai Xie,Linjiang Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel framework for generating kernel functions on permutation space using sorting algorithms is proposed, introducing the Merge Kernel with linearithmic complexity, outperforming the Mallows kernel.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the quadratic complexity of the Mallows kernel in Bayesian Optimization for permutation spaces by leveraging sorting algorithms for more efficient and compact representations.

Method: Proposes a framework for kernel generation based on sorting algorithms, introducing the Merge Kernel (derived from merge sort) with Θ(n log n) complexity. Incorporates lightweight descriptors (shift histogram, split-pair line, sliding-window motifs) for robustness.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows the Merge Kernel consistently outperforms the Mallows kernel in permutation optimization benchmarks, offering a more compact and effective solution.

Conclusion: The Merge Kernel provides a superior alternative to the Mallows kernel for Bayesian Optimization in permutation spaces, combining efficiency, compactness, and effectiveness.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm is a standard tool for black-box
optimization problems. The current state-of-the-art BO approach for permutation
spaces relies on the Mallows kernel-an $\Omega(n^2)$ representation that
explicitly enumerates every pairwise comparison. Inspired by the close
relationship between the Mallows kernel and pairwise comparison, we propose a
novel framework for generating kernel functions on permutation space based on
sorting algorithms. Within this framework, the Mallows kernel can be viewed as
a special instance derived from bubble sort. Further, we introduce the
\textbf{Merge Kernel} constructed from merge sort, which replaces the quadratic
complexity with $\Theta(n\log n)$ to achieve the lowest possible complexity.
The resulting feature vector is significantly shorter, can be computed in
linearithmic time, yet still efficiently captures meaningful permutation
distances. To boost robustness and right-invariance without sacrificing
compactness, we further incorporate three lightweight, task-agnostic
descriptors: (1) a shift histogram, which aggregates absolute element
displacements and supplies a global misplacement signal; (2) a split-pair line,
which encodes selected long-range comparisons by aligning elements across the
two halves of the whole permutation; and (3) sliding-window motifs, which
summarize local order patterns that influence near-neighbor objectives. Our
empirical evaluation demonstrates that the proposed kernel consistently
outperforms the state-of-the-art Mallows kernel across various permutation
optimization benchmarks. Results confirm that the Merge Kernel provides a more
compact yet more effective solution for Bayesian optimization in permutation
space.

### [206] [Boosting Team Modeling through Tempo-Relational Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13305)
*Vincenzo Marco De Luca,Giovanna Varni,Andrea Passerini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRENN is a novel tempo-relational architecture for team modeling, integrating temporal and relational dynamics, with MT-TRENN extending it for multi-task prediction and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models fail to jointly capture temporal and relational dynamics in teams, limiting interpretability and actionable insights for improving team performance.

Method: TRENN combines a temporal graph extractor, tempo-relational encoder, decoder, and explainability modules. MT-TRENN replaces the decoder with a multi-task head for shared embeddings and multi-construct prediction.

Result: TRENN outperforms temporal- or relational-only models. MT-TRENN provides interpretable insights and actionable suggestions, validated in experiments.

Conclusion: TRENN and MT-TRENN address practical demands for team modeling, offering interpretability and multi-task capabilities, suitable for Human-Centered AI applications.

Abstract: Team modeling remains a fundamental challenge at the intersection of
Artificial Intelligence and the Social Sciences. Social Science research
emphasizes the need to jointly model dynamics and relations, while practical
applications demand unified models capable of inferring multiple team
constructs simultaneously, providing interpretable insights and actionable
recommendations to enhance team performance. However, existing works do not
meet these practical demands. To bridge this gap, we present TRENN, a novel
tempo-relational architecture that integrates: (i) an automatic temporal graph
extractor, (ii) a tempo-relational encoder, (iii) a decoder for team construct
prediction, and (iv) two complementary explainability modules. TRENN jointly
captures relational and temporal team dynamics, providing a solid foundation
for MT-TRENN, which extends TReNN by replacing the decoder with a multi-task
head, enabling the model to learn shared Social Embeddings and simultaneously
predict multiple team constructs, including Emergent Leadership, Leadership
Style, and Teamwork components. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms approaches that rely exclusively on temporal
or relational information. Additionally, experimental evaluation has shown that
the explainability modules integrated in MT-TRENN yield interpretable insights
and actionable suggestions to support team improvement. These capabilities make
our approach particularly well-suited for Human-Centered AI applications, such
as intelligent decision-support systems in high-stakes collaborative
environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GeoReg, a regression model, integrates satellite imagery and geospatial data to estimate socio-economic indicators like GDP, population, and education levels, even in data-scarce regions, using LLM for feature extraction and outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of estimating socio-economic indicators in data-scarce regions, leveraging diverse data sources and LLM capabilities for accurate predictions.

Method: GeoReg uses LLM for feature extraction, categorizes feature correlations, applies tailored weight constraints, and integrates nonlinear transformations and feature interactions.

Result: Outperforms baselines in estimating socio-economic indicators across three countries, including low-income regions with limited data.

Conclusion: GeoReg effectively estimates socio-economic indicators in data-scarce regions, demonstrating the potential of integrating diverse data and LLM prior knowledge.

Abstract: Socio-economic indicators like regional GDP, population, and education
levels, are crucial to shaping policy decisions and fostering sustainable
development. This research introduces GeoReg a regression model that integrates
diverse data sources, including satellite imagery and web-based geospatial
information, to estimate these indicators even for data-scarce regions such as
developing countries. Our approach leverages the prior knowledge of large
language model (LLM) to address the scarcity of labeled data, with the LLM
functioning as a data engineer by extracting informative features to enable
effective estimation in few-shot settings. Specifically, our model obtains
contextual relationships between data features and the target indicator,
categorizing their correlations as positive, negative, mixed, or irrelevant.
These features are then fed into the linear estimator with tailored weight
constraints for each category. To capture nonlinear patterns, the model also
identifies meaningful feature interactions and integrates them, along with
nonlinear transformations. Experiments across three countries at different
stages of development demonstrate that our model outperforms baselines in
estimating socio-economic indicators, even for low-income countries with
limited data availability.

### [208] [Training Transformers with Enforced Lipschitz Constants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13338)
*Laker Newhouse,R. Preston Hess,Franz Cesista,Andrii Zahorodnii,Jeremy Bernstein,Phillip Isola*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores training transformers with Lipschitz bounds, improving stability and performance by using novel weight constraint methods and optimizer dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks' sensitivity to perturbations leads to issues like adversarial vulnerability and overfitting. The study aims to enforce Lipschitz bounds in modern architectures like transformers.

Method: Developed efficient tools for norm-constrained weight matrices, trained transformers with Lipschitz bounds, and experimented with optimizers (AdamW vs. Muon) and weight constraints.

Result: Achieved 60% validation accuracy with a 2-Lipschitz transformer on Shakespeare text and 21% accuracy with a 10-Lipschitz transformer on internet text. However, matching baseline performance required a very high Lipschitz bound (10^264).

Conclusion: Lipschitz transformers can train without stability measures, but balancing performance and Lipschitz bounds remains challenging.

Abstract: Neural networks are often highly sensitive to input and weight perturbations.
This sensitivity has been linked to pathologies such as vulnerability to
adversarial examples, divergent training, and overfitting. To combat these
problems, past research has looked at building neural networks entirely from
Lipschitz components. However, these techniques have not matured to the point
where researchers have trained a modern architecture such as a transformer with
a Lipschitz certificate enforced beyond initialization. To explore this gap, we
begin by developing and benchmarking novel, computationally-efficient tools for
maintaining norm-constrained weight matrices. Applying these tools, we are able
to train transformer models with Lipschitz bounds enforced throughout training.
We find that optimizer dynamics matter: switching from AdamW to Muon improves
standard methods -- weight decay and spectral normalization -- allowing models
to reach equal performance with a lower Lipschitz bound. Inspired by Muon's
update having a fixed spectral norm, we co-design a weight constraint method
that improves the Lipschitz vs. performance tradeoff on MLPs and 2M parameter
transformers. Our 2-Lipschitz transformer on Shakespeare text reaches
validation accuracy 60%. Scaling to 145M parameters, our 10-Lipschitz
transformer reaches 21% accuracy on internet text. However, to match the
NanoGPT baseline validation accuracy of 39.4%, our Lipschitz upper bound
increases to 10^264. Nonetheless, our Lipschitz transformers train without
stability measures such as layer norm, QK norm, and logit tanh softcapping.

Main category: q-bio.PE

TL;DR: The paper analyzes COVID-19 forecasting in Cyprus using a two-year dataset to improve pandemic preparedness and response strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The COVID-19 pandemic's global impact and the need for better forecasting models to mitigate future outbreaks.

Method: A large-scale case study integrating epidemiological data, vaccination records, policy measures, and weather conditions for forecasting.

Result: Analysis of infection trends, forecasting performance, and external factors' influence on disease dynamics.

Conclusion: The study provides valuable insights to enhance pandemic preparedness and response, leveraging data from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Abstract: Emerging in December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic caused widespread health,
economic, and social disruptions. Rapid global transmission overwhelmed
healthcare systems, resulting in high infection rates, hospitalisations, and
fatalities. To minimise the spread, governments implemented several
non-pharmaceutical interventions like lockdowns and travel restrictions. While
effective in controlling transmission, these measures also posed significant
economic and societal challenges. Although the WHO declared COVID-19 no longer
a global health emergency in May 2023, its impact persists, shaping public
health strategies. The vast amount of data collected during the pandemic offers
valuable insights into disease dynamics, transmission, and intervention
effectiveness. Leveraging these insights can improve forecasting models,
enhancing preparedness and response to future outbreaks while mitigating their
social and economic impact. This paper presents a large-scale case study on
COVID-19 forecasting in Cyprus, utilising a two-year dataset that integrates
epidemiological data, vaccination records, policy measures, and weather
conditions. We analyse infection trends, assess forecasting performance, and
examine the influence of external factors on disease dynamics. The insights
gained contribute to improved pandemic preparedness and response strategies.

*Jinqiu Jin,Yang Zhang,Junwei Pan,Fuli Feng,Hua Lu,Haijie Gu,Xiangnan He*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces GMC, a generative approach for Multi-Target Cross-Domain Recommendation (MTCDR), leveraging semantic identifiers and a unified sequence-to-sequence model to improve performance without requiring overlapping entities or extensive pre-training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MTCDR methods rely on domain-shared entities or extensive auxiliary data, limiting their applicability in non-overlapped scenarios. GMC aims to address these limitations by using generative techniques.

Method: GMC uses semantic item identifiers and a domain-unified sequence-to-sequence model, enhanced with domain-aware contrastive loss and domain-specific fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments on five datasets show GMC outperforms baseline methods.

Conclusion: GMC provides an effective solution for MTCDR, overcoming limitations of existing methods and demonstrating strong performance.

Abstract: Recently, there has been a surge of interest in Multi-Target Cross-Domain
Recommendation (MTCDR), which aims to enhance recommendation performance across
multiple domains simultaneously. Existing MTCDR methods primarily rely on
domain-shared entities (\eg users or items) to fuse and transfer cross-domain
knowledge, which may be unavailable in non-overlapped recommendation scenarios.
Some studies model user preferences and item features as domain-sharable
semantic representations, which can be utilized to tackle the MTCDR task.
Nevertheless, they often require extensive auxiliary data for pre-training.
Developing more effective solutions for MTCDR remains an important area for
further exploration.
  Inspired by recent advancements in generative recommendation, this paper
introduces GMC, a generative paradigm-based approach for multi-target
cross-domain recommendation. The core idea of GMC is to leverage semantically
quantized discrete item identifiers as a medium for integrating multi-domain
knowledge within a unified generative model. GMC first employs an item
tokenizer to generate domain-shared semantic identifiers for each item, and
then formulates item recommendation as a next-token generation task by training
a domain-unified sequence-to-sequence model. To further leverage the domain
information to enhance performance, we incorporate a domain-aware contrastive
loss into the semantic identifier learning, and perform domain-specific
fine-tuning on the unified recommender. Extensive experiments on five public
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GMC compared to a range of baseline
methods.

Motivation: Vaccine hesitancy is a public health threat, and traditional methods like topic modelling fail to capture nuanced opinions. LLMs often miss current events and may hallucinate, compromising public health communication.

Method: Developed a tool using Retrieval Augmented Generation to analyze social media posts (e.g., 35,103 Shingrix posts) for understanding public vaccine concerns.

Result: Achieved high answer faithfulness (0.96) and relevance (0.94) in addressing complex queries about vaccine concerns.

Conclusion: The tool aids public health administrators in understanding concerns and implementing targeted interventions to improve vaccine confidence.

Abstract: Vaccine hesitancy threatens public health, leading to delayed or rejected
vaccines. Social media is a vital source for understanding public concerns, and
traditional methods like topic modelling often struggle to capture nuanced
opinions. Though trained for query answering, large Language Models (LLMs)
often miss current events and community concerns. Additionally, hallucinations
in LLMs can compromise public health communication. To address these
limitations, we developed a tool (VaxPulse Query Corner) using the Retrieval
Augmented Generation technique. It addresses complex queries about public
vaccine concerns on various online platforms, aiding public health
administrators and stakeholders in understanding public concerns and
implementing targeted interventions to boost vaccine confidence. Analysing
35,103 Shingrix social media posts, it achieved answer faithfulness (0.96) and

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of ensuring AI-powered agents align with older adults' autonomy preferences in caregiving.

Method: Examines four dimensions of autonomy (decision-making, goal-oriented, control, social responsibility) and proposes research directions.

Result: Identifies gaps in aligning agent autonomy with elderly preferences and suggests future research areas.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for further research on autonomy dimensions and ethical implications in AI-powered elderly care.

Abstract: As the global population ages, artificial intelligence (AI)-powered agents
have emerged as potential tools to support older adults' caregiving. Prior
research has explored agent autonomy by identifying key interaction stages in
task processes and defining the agent's role at each stage. However, ensuring
that agents align with older adults' autonomy preferences remains a critical
challenge. Drawing on interdisciplinary conceptualizations of autonomy, this
paper examines four key dimensions of autonomy for older adults:
decision-making autonomy, goal-oriented autonomy, control autonomy, and social
responsibility autonomy. This paper then proposes the following research
directions: (1) Addressing social responsibility autonomy, which concerns the
ethical and social implications of agent use in communal settings; (2)
Operationalizing agent autonomy from the task perspective; and (3) Developing
autonomy measures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The diversity of Quantum SDKs (QSDKs) like Qiskit, Cirq, and PennyLane creates interoperability challenges for hybrid quantum-classical software, with traditional rule-based transpilers being inefficient and rigid.

Method: The study explores LLMs as programming language-agnostic transpilers, leveraging their pretrained knowledge and contextual reasoning to convert quantum programs between QSDKs while preserving functional equivalence.

Result: The approach eliminates the need for manually defined transformation rules, offering a scalable solution for quantum software portability.

Conclusion: This work advances intelligent, general-purpose transpilation in quantum computing, simplifying cross-platform development.

Abstract: There exist various Software Development Kits (SDKs) tailored to different
quantum computing platforms. These are known as Quantum SDKs (QSDKs). Examples
include but are not limited to Qiskit, Cirq, and PennyLane. However, this
diversity presents significant challenges for interoperability and
cross-platform development of hybrid quantum-classical software systems.
Traditional rule-based transpilers for translating code between QSDKs are
time-consuming to design and maintain, requiring deep expertise and rigid
mappings in the source and destination code. In this study, we explore the use
of Large Language Models (LLMs) as a flexible and automated solution.
Leveraging their pretrained knowledge and contextual reasoning capabilities, we
position LLMs as programming language-agnostic transpilers capable of
converting quantum programs from one QSDK to another while preserving
functional equivalence. Our approach eliminates the need for manually defined

TL;DR: Kodezi Chronos is a next-gen architecture for autonomous code understanding and maintenance, outperforming traditional LLMs with a 23% improvement in bug detection and 40% faster debugging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are limited by context constraints and lack of explicit code structure reasoning, hindering large-scale codebase tasks.

Method: Uses a multi-level embedding memory engine combining vector and graph-based indexing for efficient reasoning over millions of lines of code.

Result: 23% better bug detection and 40% faster debugging compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: Chronos advances autonomous software maintenance, improving reliability and productivity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced code generation and software
automation, but are fundamentally constrained by limited inference-time context
and lack of explicit code structure reasoning. We introduce Kodezi Chronos, a
next-generation architecture for autonomous code understanding, debugging, and
maintenance, designed to operate across ultra-long contexts comprising entire
codebases, histories, and documentation, all without fixed window limits.
Kodezi Chronos leverages a multi-level embedding memory engine, combining
vector and graph-based indexing with continuous code-aware retrieval. This
enables efficient and accurate reasoning over millions of lines of code,
supporting repository-scale comprehension, multi-file refactoring, and
real-time self-healing actions. Our evaluation introduces a novel Multi Random
Retrieval benchmark, specifically tailored to the software engineering domain.
Unlike classical retrieval benchmarks, this method requires the model to
resolve arbitrarily distant and obfuscated associations across code artifacts,
simulating realistic tasks such as variable tracing, dependency migration, and
semantic bug localization. Chronos outperforms prior LLMs and code models,
demonstrating a 23% improvement in real-world bug detection and reducing
debugging cycles by up to 40% compared to traditional sequence-based
approaches. By natively interfacing with IDEs and CI/CD workflows, Chronos
enables seamless, autonomous software maintenance, elevating code reliability
and productivity while reducing manual effort. These results mark a critical
advance toward self-sustaining, continuously optimized software ecosystems.

comprehensive understanding of the impact, potential, and limitations of LLMs
in AIOps remains in its infancy. To address this gap, we conducted a detailed
survey of LLM4AIOps, focusing on how LLMs can optimize processes and improve
outcomes in this domain. We analyzed 183 research papers published between
January 2020 and December 2024 to answer four key research questions (RQs). In
RQ1, we examine the diverse failure data sources utilized, including advanced
LLM-based processing techniques for legacy data and the incorporation of new
data sources enabled by LLMs. RQ2 explores the evolution of AIOps tasks,
highlighting the emergence of novel tasks and the publication trends across
these tasks. RQ3 investigates the various LLM-based methods applied to address
AIOps challenges. Finally, RQ4 reviews evaluation methodologies tailored to
assess LLM-integrated AIOps approaches. Based on our findings, we discuss the
state-of-the-art advancements and trends, identify gaps in existing research,
and propose promising directions for future exploration.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: A novel fuzzy logic-based method for evaluating project success, focusing on end-user impact over traditional Likert-scale measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Likert-scale measures fail to capture the context-dependent and multifaceted nature of project success.

Method: Hierarchical Type-1 Mamdani fuzzy system prioritizing end-user impact over secondary outcomes.

Result: Potential for more accurate project success evaluation, adaptable to complex scenarios.

Conclusion: Future research will test empirically and explore broader fuzzy logic applications in social science.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to project success evaluation by
integrating fuzzy logic into an existing construct. Traditional Likert-scale

prioritizes sustained positive impact for end-users, reducing emphasis on
secondary outcomes like stakeholder satisfaction and internal project success.

TL;DR: Fine-tuning a 32B model with GRPO and ORPO improves Qiskit code generation, outperforming baselines on benchmarks but struggles with advanced tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the issue of flawed Qiskit code output by LLMs like Granite-20B-Code and StarCoder to enhance error-resilient quantum circuits.

Method: Fine-tuned a 32B model using GRPO and ORPO on a synthetic dataset, evaluated on Qiskit HumanEval and original HumanEval benchmarks.

Result: ORPO achieved 56.29% Pass@1 (≈+10pp over Granite-8B-QK), GRPO 49%, both surpassing baselines. GRPO excels on basic tasks, ORPO on intermediate, neither on advanced.

Conclusion: Significant improvements in AI-assisted quantum programming, but challenges remain for advanced tasks.

Abstract: Quantum circuits must be error-resilient, yet LLMs like Granite-20B-Code and
StarCoder often output flawed Qiskit code. We fine-tuned a 32 B model with two
RL methods, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Odds-Ratio Preference
Optimization (ORPO), using a richly annotated synthetic dataset. On the Qiskit
HumanEval benchmark, ORPO reaches 56.29\% Pass@1 ($\approx+10$ pp over
Granite-8B-QK) and GRPO hits 49\%, both beating all general-purpose baselines;
on the original HumanEval they score 65.90\% and 63.00\%. GRPO excels on basic
tasks (42/54), ORPO on intermediate ones (41/68), and neither solves the five
advanced tasks, highlighting clear gains yet room for progress in AI-assisted
quantum programming.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Single Conversation Methodology (SCM), a structured approach to software development with LLMs, emphasizing persistent dialogue, cognitive clarity, and developer supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the ad hoc and passive reliance on LLMs in current practices by promoting a structured, traceable, and modular development process.

Method: SCM involves a single, long-context conversation for all project stages (requirements, architecture, implementation), grounded in principles like cognitive clarity and documentation.

Result: SCM offers a corrective to passive LLM use, reasserting the developer's active role as architect and supervisor.

Conclusion: SCM provides a pragmatic and necessary framework for more effective and intentional use of LLMs in software development.

Abstract: We propose the Single Conversation Methodology (SCM), a novel and pragmatic
approach to software development using large language models (LLMs). In
contrast to ad hoc interactions with generative AI, SCM emphasizes a structured
and persistent development dialogue, where all stages of a project - from
requirements to architecture and implementation - unfold within a single,
long-context conversation. The methodology is grounded on principles of
cognitive clarity, traceability, modularity, and documentation. We define its
phases, best practices, and philosophical stance, while arguing that SCM offers
a necessary correction to the passive reliance on LLMs prevalent in current
practices. We aim to reassert the active role of the developer as architect and
supervisor of the intelligent tool.

TL;DR: FOUNDER integrates Foundation Models (FMs) and World Models (WMs) for open-ended task solving in embodied environments without rewards, using a mapping function to ground FM representations in WM state space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combine the generalizable knowledge of FMs with the dynamic modeling of WMs for better task generalization in complex environments.

Method: Learns a mapping function to ground FM representations in WM state space, enabling goal-conditioned policy learning through imagination and using predicted temporal distance as a reward signal.

Result: Superior performance on multi-task offline visual control benchmarks, especially in complex observations or domain gaps, with validated reward consistency.

Conclusion: FOUNDER effectively bridges FMs and WMs for robust task solving, demonstrating strong performance and reward consistency in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) and World Models (WMs) offer complementary strengths
in task generalization at different levels. In this work, we propose FOUNDER, a
framework that integrates the generalizable knowledge embedded in FMs with the
dynamic modeling capabilities of WMs to enable open-ended task solving in
embodied environments in a reward-free manner. We learn a mapping function that
grounds FM representations in the WM state space, effectively inferring the
agent's physical states in the world simulator from external observations. This
mapping enables the learning of a goal-conditioned policy through imagination
during behavior learning, with the mapped task serving as the goal state. Our
method leverages the predicted temporal distance to the goal state as an
informative reward signal. FOUNDER demonstrates superior performance on various
multi-task offline visual control benchmarks, excelling in capturing the
deep-level semantics of tasks specified by text or videos, particularly in
scenarios involving complex observations or domain gaps where prior methods
struggle. The consistency of our learned reward function with the ground-truth
reward is also empirically validated. Our project website is

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VLMgineer leverages vision language models and evolutionary search to co-design tools and action plans, outperforming human-crafted solutions in robotics tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if foundation models can automate tool design and use, shifting problem-solving to tool design rather than just controller improvement.

Method: Combines vision language models (VLMs) with evolutionary search to iteratively design tools and action plans for tasks.

Result: VLMgineer consistently outperforms human-crafted tools and VLM-generated designs, solving tasks more effectively and innovatively.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the potential of automated tool invention, with plans to release benchmarks and code for future research.

Abstract: Tool design and use reflect the ability to understand and manipulate the
physical world through creativity, planning, and foresight. As such, these
capabilities are often regarded as measurable indicators of intelligence across
biological species. While much of today's research on robotic intelligence
focuses on generating better controllers, inventing smarter tools offers a
complementary form of physical intelligence: shifting the onus of
problem-solving onto the tool's design. Given the vast and impressive
common-sense, reasoning, and creative capabilities of today's foundation
models, we investigate whether these models can provide useful priors to
automatically design and effectively wield such tools? We present VLMgineer, a
framework that harnesses the code generation abilities of vision language
models (VLMs) together with evolutionary search to iteratively co-design
physical tools and the action plans that operate them to perform a task. We
evaluate VLMgineer on a diverse new benchmark of everyday manipulation
scenarios that demand creative tool design and use. Across this suite,
VLMgineer consistently discovers tools and policies that solve tasks more
effectively and innovatively, transforming challenging robotics problems into
straightforward executions. It also outperforms VLM-generated designs from
human specifications and existing human-crafted tools for everyday tasks. To
facilitate future research on automated tool invention, we will release our
benchmark and code.

TL;DR: VLN-PE introduces a physically realistic VLN platform for humanoid, quadruped, and wheeled robots, evaluating existing methods in real-world settings and highlighting performance challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between idealized VLN assumptions and real-world robotic deployment challenges.

Method: VLN-PE evaluates ego-centric VLN methods, including classification models, a diffusion model, and an LLM-path planning integration, across various robotic embodiments.

Result: Performance degrades due to limited observation space, lighting variations, and physical challenges like collisions, exposing locomotion constraints for legged robots.

Conclusion: VLN-PE offers a pathway for improving cross-embodiment adaptability and encourages rethinking VLN limitations for robust, practical models.

Abstract: Recent Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) advancements are promising, but
their idealized assumptions about robot movement and control fail to reflect
physically embodied deployment challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce
VLN-PE, a physically realistic VLN platform supporting humanoid, quadruped, and
wheeled robots. For the first time, we systematically evaluate several
ego-centric VLN methods in physical robotic settings across different technical
pipelines, including classification models for single-step discrete action
prediction, a diffusion model for dense waypoint prediction, and a train-free,
map-based large language model (LLM) integrated with path planning. Our results
reveal significant performance degradation due to limited robot observation
space, environmental lighting variations, and physical challenges like
collisions and falls. This also exposes locomotion constraints for legged
robots in complex environments. VLN-PE is highly extensible, allowing seamless
integration of new scenes beyond MP3D, thereby enabling more comprehensive VLN
evaluation. Despite the weak generalization of current models in physical
deployment, VLN-PE provides a new pathway for improving cross-embodiment's
overall adaptability. We hope our findings and tools inspire the community to
rethink VLN limitations and advance robust, practical VLN models. The code is

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Long-term Active Embodied Question Answering (LA-EQA), a task requiring robots to recall past experiences and actively explore to answer complex questions. It proposes a structured memory system inspired by the mind palace method, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots operating over extended periods need to leverage accumulated knowledge for effective human assistance. Traditional EQA methods fail due to limited context, lack of persistent memory, and inability to combine memory recall with exploration.

Method: A scene-graph-based structured memory system is proposed, encoding episodic experiences as world instances. It includes a reasoning and planning algorithm for targeted memory retrieval and guided navigation, with value-of-information-based stopping criteria.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in real-world experiments and a new benchmark, improving answer accuracy and exploration efficiency.

Conclusion: The structured memory system effectively addresses LA-EQA challenges, demonstrating significant performance gains and potential for long-term robotic applications.

Abstract: As robots become increasingly capable of operating over extended periods --
spanning days, weeks, and even months -- they are expected to accumulate
knowledge of their environments and leverage this experience to assist humans
more effectively. This paper studies the problem of Long-term Active Embodied
Question Answering (LA-EQA), a new task in which a robot must both recall past
experiences and actively explore its environment to answer complex,
temporally-grounded questions. Unlike traditional EQA settings, which typically
focus either on understanding the present environment alone or on recalling a
single past observation, LA-EQA challenges an agent to reason over past,
present, and possible future states, deciding when to explore, when to consult
its memory, and when to stop gathering observations and provide a final answer.
Standard EQA approaches based on large models struggle in this setting due to
limited context windows, absence of persistent memory, and an inability to
combine memory recall with active exploration. To address this, we propose a
structured memory system for robots, inspired by the mind palace method from
cognitive science. Our method encodes episodic experiences as scene-graph-based
world instances, forming a reasoning and planning algorithm that enables
targeted memory retrieval and guided navigation. To balance the
exploration-recall trade-off, we introduce value-of-information-based stopping
criteria that determines when the agent has gathered sufficient information. We
evaluate our method on real-world experiments and introduce a new benchmark
that spans popular simulation environments and actual industrial sites. Our
approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding
substantial gains in both answer accuracy and exploration efficiency.

*Yuhang Lu,Jiadong Tu,Yuexin Ma,Xinge Zhu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ReAL-AD enhances autonomous driving by mimicking human hierarchical reasoning using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for strategic, tactical, and operational decision-making, improving planning accuracy by 30%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autonomous driving methods lack hierarchical reasoning like humans, limiting adaptability and situational awareness.

Method: ReAL-AD uses VLMs for structured reasoning: Strategic Reasoning Injector (high-level strategies), Tactical Reasoning Integrator (tactical choices), and Hierarchical Trajectory Decoder (precise control).

Result: Improves planning accuracy and safety by over 30%, aligning with human-like reasoning.

Conclusion: ReAL-AD makes autonomous driving more interpretable and effective by integrating hierarchical human-like reasoning.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has emerged as a promising approach to unify
perception, prediction, and planning within a single framework, reducing
information loss and improving adaptability. However, existing methods often
rely on fixed and sparse trajectory supervision, limiting their ability to
capture the hierarchical reasoning process that human drivers naturally employ.
To bridge this gap, we propose ReAL-AD, a Reasoning-Augmented Learning
framework that structures decision-making in autonomous driving based on the
three-tier human cognitive model: Driving Strategy, Driving Decision, and
Driving Operation, where Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are incorporated to
enhance situational awareness and structured reasoning across these levels.
Specifically, we introduce: (1) the Strategic Reasoning Injector, which
formulates high-level driving strategies by interpreting complex traffic
contexts from VLM-generated insights; (2) the Tactical Reasoning Integrator,
which refines strategic intent into interpretable tactical choices such as lane
changes, overtaking, and speed adjustments; and (3) the Hierarchical Trajectory
Decoder, which progressively translates tactical decisions into precise control
actions for smooth and human-like trajectory execution. Extensive evaluations
show that integrating our framework improves planning accuracy and safety by
over 30%, making end-to-end autonomous driving more interpretable and aligned
with human-like hierarchical reasoning. The project page can be found at:

TL;DR: GraspGen, a DiffusionTransformer-based framework, improves 6-DOF grasp generation with a novel discriminator training method and a large simulated dataset, outperforming prior methods in simulations and real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning-based 6-DOF grasping struggles with generalization across embodiments and real-world settings, prompting the need for a more robust solution.

Method: GraspGen uses a DiffusionTransformer for grasp generation and an efficient discriminator for scoring, trained with a novel on-generator recipe. A new 53M-grasp dataset is introduced.

Result: GraspGen outperforms prior methods in simulations, achieves SOTA on FetchBench, and performs well in real-world noisy conditions.

Conclusion: GraspGen advances grasp generation with its architecture and training approach, demonstrating strong generalization and real-world applicability.

Abstract: Grasping is a fundamental robot skill, yet despite significant research
advancements, learning-based 6-DOF grasping approaches are still not turnkey
and struggle to generalize across different embodiments and in-the-wild
settings. We build upon the recent success on modeling the object-centric grasp
generation process as an iterative diffusion process. Our proposed framework,
GraspGen, consists of a DiffusionTransformer architecture that enhances grasp
generation, paired with an efficient discriminator to score and filter sampled
grasps. We introduce a novel and performant on-generator training recipe for
the discriminator. To scale GraspGen to both objects and grippers, we release a
new simulated dataset consisting of over 53 million grasps. We demonstrate that
GraspGen outperforms prior methods in simulations with singulated objects
across different grippers, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
FetchBench grasping benchmark, and performs well on a real robot with noisy
visual observations.

TL;DR: A method for more accurate LiDAR simulation by modeling sensor characteristics like rolling shutter and laser power variations, outperforming existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LiDAR simulation methods inadequately address sensor-specific effects, limiting accuracy in Novel View Synthesis (NVS).

Method: Explicitly models LiDAR sensor characteristics (rolling shutter, laser power variations, intensity falloff) for improved simulation.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative comparisons show superior accuracy; ablation studies confirm the importance of each sensor model component.

Conclusion: The approach advances LiDAR simulation accuracy and enables high-resolution resimulation, with code and dataset publicly available.

Abstract: Methods for Novel View Synthesis (NVS) have recently found traction in the
field of LiDAR simulation and large-scale 3D scene reconstruction. While
solutions for faster rendering or handling dynamic scenes have been proposed,
LiDAR specific effects remain insufficiently addressed. By explicitly modeling
sensor characteristics such as rolling shutter, laser power variations, and
intensity falloff, our method achieves more accurate LiDAR simulation compared
to existing techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
through quantitative and qualitative comparisons with state-of-the-art methods,
as well as ablation studies that highlight the importance of each sensor model
component. Beyond that, we show that our approach exhibits advanced
resimulation capabilities, such as generating high resolution LiDAR scans in
the camera perspective.

*Suzie Kim,Hye-Bin Shin,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes RLIHF, a framework using EEG signals (ErrPs) for implicit human feedback in RL, achieving performance comparable to dense rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitations of sparse rewards and explicit feedback in RLHF by leveraging non-invasive EEG signals.

Method: Uses EEG signals (ErrPs) decoded into probabilistic rewards for policy learning in a robotic pick-and-place task.

Result: Agents with EEG feedback perform as well as those with dense rewards.

Conclusion: Implicit neural feedback (RLIHF) is viable for scalable, human-aligned RL in robotics.

Abstract: Conventional reinforcement learning (RL) ap proaches often struggle to learn
effective policies under sparse reward conditions, necessitating the manual
design of complex, task-specific reward functions. To address this limitation,
rein forcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a promising
strategy that complements hand-crafted rewards with human-derived evaluation
signals. However, most existing RLHF methods depend on explicit feedback
mechanisms such as button presses or preference labels, which disrupt the
natural interaction process and impose a substantial cognitive load on the
user. We propose a novel reinforcement learning from implicit human feedback
(RLIHF) framework that utilizes non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG)
signals, specifically error-related potentials (ErrPs), to provide continuous,
implicit feedback without requiring explicit user intervention. The proposed
method adopts a pre-trained decoder to transform raw EEG signals into
probabilistic reward components, en abling effective policy learning even in
the presence of sparse external rewards. We evaluate our approach in a
simulation environment built on the MuJoCo physics engine, using a Kinova Gen2
robotic arm to perform a complex pick-and-place task that requires avoiding
obstacles while manipulating target objects. The results show that agents
trained with decoded EEG feedback achieve performance comparable to those
trained with dense, manually designed rewards. These findings validate the
potential of using implicit neural feedback for scalable and human-aligned
reinforcement learning in interactive robotics.

Conclusion: The study advances robotic navigation and AI in assistive roles, highlighting PPO's potential for quadruped mobility in healthcare.

Abstract: Robots are increasingly integrated across industries, particularly in
healthcare. However, many valuable applications for quadrupedal robots remain
overlooked. This research explores the effectiveness of three reinforcement
learning algorithms in training a simulated quadruped robot for autonomous

simulation capable of path following and obstacle avoidance, with long-term
potential for real-world assistance to guide dogs and visually impaired

robotic guide and alert dogs.
  A comparative analysis of thirteen related research papers shaped key
evaluation criteria, including collision detection, pathfinding algorithms,
sensor usage, robot type, and simulation platforms. The study focuses on sensor
inputs, collision frequency, reward signals, and learning progression to
determine which algorithm best supports robotic navigation in complex

  Custom-made environments were used to ensure fair evaluation of all three
algorithms under controlled conditions, allowing consistent data collection.
Results show that Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) outperformed Deep

TL;DR: LaViPlan uses Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to align Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with low-level trajectory planning, improving OOD decision-making in autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the misalignment between high-level VLM decisions and low-level trajectory actions in OOD scenarios, which can lead to hazardous behavior.

Method: Proposes LaViPlan, a framework using RLVR to optimize VLMs with planning-oriented metrics.

Result: Improves situational awareness and decision-making under OOD conditions, mitigating the misalignment issue.

Conclusion: LaViPlan offers a promising post-training paradigm for VLMs in autonomous driving, enhancing OOD performance.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios in autonomous driving refer to situations
that deviate from the training domain, often leading to unexpected and
potentially hazardous behavior from planners that lack prior exposure to such
cases. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been introduced into
autonomous driving research for their promising generalization capabilities in
OOD settings. Early studies demonstrated that VLMs could recognize OOD
scenarios and generate user-level decisions such as "go straight" or "turn
right." However, a new challenge has emerged due to the misalignment between
the VLM's high-level decisions or visual reasoning expressed in language, and
the low-level predicted trajectories interpreted as actions. In this paper, we
propose LaViPlan, a framework that leverages Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize VLMs using planning-oriented metrics.
This approach addresses the vision-language-action misalignment observed in
existing VLMs fine-tuned via supervised learning, which can recognize driving
scenarios but often produce context-unaware decisions. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method improves situational awareness and decision-making
under OOD conditions, highlighting its potential to mitigate the misalignment
issue. This work introduces a promising post-training paradigm for VLM agents
in the context of autonomous driving.

*Yiqi Wang,Mrinal Verghese,Jeff Schneider*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to reduce data collection efforts for learning visuomotor robot policies by leveraging multi-embodiment datasets and optic flow as an action representation, combined with a latent policy search technique.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The performance of visuomotor policies depends on extensive training demonstrations, which are costly to collect. The goal is to minimize this dependency by utilizing existing or low-cost data from diverse embodiments.

Method: The approach uses optic flow for embodiment-agnostic action representation to train a World Model (WM) on multi-embodiment datasets, followed by fine-tuning on limited target robot data. It also introduces Latent Policy Steering (LPS) to refine behavior-cloned policies by searching the WM's latent space.

Result: Experiments show significant performance improvements with minimal data: over 50% relative improvement with 30 demonstrations and over 20% with 50 demonstrations, using WM pretrained on diverse datasets.

Conclusion: The method effectively reduces data collection needs while enhancing policy performance by leveraging multi-embodiment datasets and latent policy optimization.

Abstract: Learning visuomotor policies via imitation has proven effective across a wide
range of robotic domains. However, the performance of these policies is heavily
dependent on the number of training demonstrations, which requires expensive
data collection in the real world. In this work, we aim to reduce data
collection efforts when learning visuomotor robot policies by leveraging
existing or cost-effective data from a wide range of embodiments, such as
public robot datasets and the datasets of humans playing with objects (human
data from play). Our approach leverages two key insights. First, we use optic
flow as an embodiment-agnostic action representation to train a World Model
(WM) across multi-embodiment datasets, and finetune it on a small amount of
robot data from the target embodiment. Second, we develop a method, Latent
Policy Steering (LPS), to improve the output of a behavior-cloned policy by
searching in the latent space of the WM for better action sequences. In real
world experiments, we observe significant improvements in the performance of
policies trained with a small amount of data (over 50% relative improvement
with 30 demonstrations and over 20% relative improvement with 50
demonstrations) by combining the policy with a WM pretrained on two thousand
episodes sampled from the existing Open X-embodiment dataset across different
robots or a cost-effective human dataset from play.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: An efficient audio coding for machines (ACoM) method is introduced, compressing and quantizing intermediate features for downstream tasks with ultra-low bitrates (<200 bps) and minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prioritizing efficient compression and downstream task performance over perceptual nuances in audio coding for machines.

Method: Uses task-specific loss guidance and residual vector quantization (RVQ) losses to compress and quantize intermediate features of trained models.

Result: Achieves ultra-low bitrates (<200 bps) with minimal downstream performance loss, adaptable to various bitrates and model sizes.

Conclusion: Demonstrates efficacy in tasks like speech recognition and audio classification, with potential for broader applicability through regularization.

Abstract: Neural audio codecs, leveraging quantization algorithms, have significantly
impacted various speech/audio tasks. While high-fidelity reconstruction is
paramount for human perception, audio coding for machines (ACoM) prioritizes
efficient compression and downstream task performance, disregarding perceptual
nuances. This work introduces an efficient ACoM method that can compress and
quantize any chosen intermediate feature representation of an already trained
speech/audio downstream model. Our approach employs task-specific loss guidance
alongside residual vector quantization (RVQ) losses, providing ultra-low
bitrates (i.e., less than 200 bps) with a minimal loss of the downstream model
performance. The resulting tokenizer is adaptable to various bitrates and model

audio classification, our method demonstrates its efficacy and potential for
broader task and architectural applicability through appropriate

*Carlos De La Vega Martin,Rodrigo Diaz Fernandez,Mark Sandler*

TL;DR: Comparative analysis of neural network-based methods for simulating nonlinear elastic plate vibrations, highlighting limitations and proposing future improvements for real-time audio synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional numerical methods for simulating vibrating structures like drum membranes are computationally intensive, limiting real-time audio applications. Neural networks offer a potential alternative.

Method: Evaluated state-of-the-art neural network models trained on short sequences for long-sequence prediction in an autoregressive manner.

Result: Identified limitations of current models, emphasizing that time-domain prediction error alone is insufficient for evaluation.

Conclusion: Proposes future directions to enhance neural network approaches for modeling nonlinear vibrations in real-time audio synthesis.

Abstract: Physical modelling synthesis aims to generate audio from physical simulations
of vibrating structures. Thin elastic plates are a common model for drum
membranes. Traditional numerical methods like finite differences and finite
elements offer high accuracy but are computationally demanding, limiting their
use in real-time audio applications. This paper presents a comparative analysis
of neural network-based approaches for solving the vibration of nonlinear
elastic plates. We evaluate several state-of-the-art models, trained on short
sequences, for prediction of long sequences in an autoregressive fashion. We
show some of the limitations of these models, and why is not enough to look at
the prediction error in the time domain. We discuss the implications for
real-time audio synthesis and propose future directions for improving neural
approaches to model nonlinear vibration.

*Kutub Uddin,Awais Khan,Muhammad Umar Farooq,Khalid Malik*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: SHIELD is a novel collaborative learning method to detect and defend against generative adversarial network (GAN)-based deepfake audio attacks, improving robustness across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake audio poses risks like misinformation, and existing detection methods are vulnerable to anti-forensic attacks.

Method: SHIELD integrates an auxiliary generative model (DF) and a triplet model to expose AF signatures and capture correlations between real and attacked audios.

Result: SHIELD reduces detection accuracy drops caused by AF attacks and achieves high accuracy (98-99%) across datasets.

Conclusion: SHIELD effectively defends against generative AF attacks, outperforming existing methods in robustness and accuracy.

Abstract: Audio plays a crucial role in applications like speaker verification,
voice-enabled smart devices, and audio conferencing. However, audio
manipulations, such as deepfakes, pose significant risks by enabling the spread
of misinformation. Our empirical analysis reveals that existing methods for
detecting deepfake audio are often vulnerable to anti-forensic (AF) attacks,
particularly those attacked using generative adversarial networks. In this
article, we propose a novel collaborative learning method called SHIELD to
defend against generative AF attacks. To expose AF signatures, we integrate an
auxiliary generative model, called the defense (DF) generative model, which
facilitates collaborative learning by combining input and output. Furthermore,
we design a triplet model to capture correlations for real and AF attacked
audios with real-generated and attacked-generated audios using auxiliary
generative models. The proposed SHIELD strengthens the defense against
generative AF attacks and achieves robust performance across various generative
models. The proposed AF significantly reduces the average detection accuracy
from 95.49% to 59.77% for ASVspoof2019, from 99.44% to 38.45% for In-the-Wild,
and from 98.41% to 51.18% for HalfTruth for three different generative models.
The proposed SHIELD mechanism is robust against AF attacks and achieves an
average accuracy of 98.13%, 98.58%, and 99.57% in match, and 98.78%, 98.62%,
and 98.85% in mismatch settings for the ASVspoof2019, In-the-Wild, and
HalfTruth datasets, respectively.

*Rajalaxmi Rajagopalan,Yu-Lin Wei,Romit Roy Choudhury*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid querying approach using Sparse Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to personalize audio by optimizing user satisfaction, combining feedback on full filters and individual filter elements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To maximize user satisfaction in audio personalization by efficiently optimizing filters, leveraging both holistic and granular user feedback.

Method: Uses Sparse GPR for hybrid querying, combining user scores on full filters ($h_i$) and individual filter elements ($h^*[j]$) within a budget of $B$ queries.

Result: Validated through simulations and real-world experiments, achieving high user satisfaction levels in audio personalization.

Conclusion: Hybrid querying outperforms single-type querying, offering a promising direction for black-box optimization in diverse applications.

Abstract: We consider the problem of personalizing audio to maximize user experience.
Briefly, we aim to find a filter $h^*$, which applied to any music or speech,
will maximize the user's satisfaction. This is a black-box optimization problem
since the user's satisfaction function is unknown. Substantive work has been
done on this topic where the key idea is to play audio samples to the user,
each shaped by a different filter $h_i$, and query the user for their
satisfaction scores $f(h_i)$. A family of ``surrogate" functions is then
designed to fit these scores and the optimization method gradually refines
these functions to arrive at the filter $\hat{h}^*$ that maximizes
satisfaction. In certain applications, we observe that a second type of
querying is possible where users can tell us the individual elements $h^*[j]$
of the optimal filter $h^*$. Consider an analogy from cooking where the goal is
to cook a recipe that maximizes user satisfaction. A user can be asked to score
various cooked recipes (e.g., tofu fried rice) or to score individual
ingredients (say, salt, sugar, rice, chicken, etc.). Given a budget of $B$
queries, where a query can be of either type, our goal is to find the recipe
that will maximize this user's satisfaction. Our proposal builds on Sparse
Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and shows how a hybrid approach can
outperform any one type of querying. Our results are validated through
simulations and real world experiments, where volunteers gave feedback on
music/speech audio and were able to achieve high satisfaction levels. We
believe this idea of hybrid querying opens new problems in black-box
optimization and solutions can benefit other applications beyond audio
personalization.

### [234] [Autoregressive Speech Enhancement via Acoustic Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12825)
*Luca Della Libera,Cem Subakan,Mirco Ravanelli*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper explores acoustic tokens for speech enhancement, comparing them to semantic tokens and introducing an autoregressive model to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in speech enhancement using discrete representations, particularly the loss of acoustic details like speaker identity and the limitations of non-autoregressive models.

Method: 1) Study acoustic tokens' performance, including bitrate and noise effects; 2) Propose a transducer-based autoregressive architecture.

Result: Acoustic tokens outperform semantic tokens in preserving speaker identity, and the autoregressive model further enhances performance, though discrete representations still lag behind continuous ones.

Conclusion: Discrete representations show promise but require more research to match continuous methods in speech enhancement.

Abstract: In speech processing pipelines, improving the quality and intelligibility of
real-world recordings is crucial. While supervised regression is the primary
method for speech enhancement, audio tokenization is emerging as a promising
alternative for a smooth integration with other modalities. However, research
on speech enhancement using discrete representations is still limited. Previous
work has mainly focused on semantic tokens, which tend to discard key acoustic
details such as speaker identity. Additionally, these studies typically employ
non-autoregressive models, assuming conditional independence of outputs and
overlooking the potential improvements offered by autoregressive modeling. To
address these gaps we: 1) conduct a comprehensive study of the performance of
acoustic tokens for speech enhancement, including the effect of bitrate and
noise strength; 2) introduce a novel transducer-based autoregressive
architecture specifically designed for this task. Experiments on VoiceBank and
Libri1Mix datasets show that acoustic tokens outperform semantic tokens in
terms of preserving speaker identity, and that our autoregressive approach can
further improve performance. Nevertheless, we observe that discrete
representations still fall short compared to continuous ones, highlighting the
need for further research in this area.

*Rohit Prasad*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: A CGRA architecture is proposed to efficiently accelerate GEMM operations in transformer models for low-power edge devices, featuring a 4x4 PE array, dedicated MOBs, and a switchless mesh torus interconnect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers are computationally demanding, making deployment on low-power edge devices challenging. This paper aims to address this by designing a specialized CGRA architecture.

Method: The architecture includes a 4x4 PE array for parallel computation, 4x2 MOBs for optimized memory operations, and a switchless mesh torus interconnect to reduce power and latency.

Result: The design reduces memory bandwidth demands, enhances data reuse, and minimizes power and latency, making transformers feasible for edge applications.

Conclusion: The proposed CGRA architecture provides a scalable solution for deploying transformer models on resource-constrained edge devices.

Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized deep learning with applications in natural
language processing, computer vision, and beyond. However, their computational
demands make it challenging to deploy them on low-power edge devices. This
paper introduces an ultra-low-power, Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Array (CGRA)
architecture specifically designed to accelerate General Matrix Multiplication
(GEMM) operations in transformer models tailored for the energy and resource
constraints of edge applications. The proposed architecture integrates a 4 x 4
array of Processing Elements (PEs) for efficient parallel computation and
dedicated 4 x 2 Memory Operation Blocks (MOBs) for optimized LOAD/STORE
operations, reducing memory bandwidth demands and enhancing data reuse. A
switchless mesh torus interconnect network further minimizes power and latency
by enabling direct communication between PEs and MOBs, eliminating the need for
centralized switching. Through its heterogeneous array design and efficient
dataflow, this CGRA architecture addresses the unique computational needs of
transformers, offering a scalable pathway to deploy sophisticated machine
learning models on edge devices.

*Matthew Walker,Keith T. Butler*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: The study explores replacing DFT with ML in PV material discovery to reduce computational costs and CO2 emissions, finding hybrid ML/DFT strategies optimal for balancing accuracy and environmental impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational and environmental costs of DFT in PV material screening by leveraging ML as a surrogate.

Method: Reproducing a DFT-based workflow for efficiency estimation and progressively replacing components with ML surrogates, while quantifying CO2 emissions.

Result: Hybrid ML/DFT strategies optimize accuracy-emissions trade-offs; ML models can outperform DFT in screening, especially for direct scalar predictions.

Conclusion: ML-driven approaches offer a low-emission, efficient alternative to DFT in PV material discovery, with potential for further improvement via expanded datasets and tailored models.

Abstract: Computational screening has become a powerful complement to experimental
efforts in the discovery of high-performance photovoltaic (PV) materials. Most
workflows rely on density functional theory (DFT) to estimate electronic and
optical properties relevant to solar energy conversion. Although more efficient
than laboratory-based methods, DFT calculations still entail substantial
computational and environmental costs. Machine learning (ML) models have
recently gained attention as surrogates for DFT, offering drastic reductions in
resource use with competitive predictive performance. In this study, we
reproduce a canonical DFT-based workflow to estimate the maximum efficiency
limit and progressively replace its components with ML surrogates. By
quantifying the CO$_2$ emissions associated with each computational strategy,
we evaluate the trade-offs between predictive efficacy and environmental cost.
Our results reveal multiple hybrid ML/DFT strategies that optimize different
points along the accuracy--emissions front. We find that direct prediction of
scalar quantities, such as maximum efficiency, is significantly more tractable
than using predicted absorption spectra as an intermediate step. Interestingly,
ML models trained on DFT data can outperform DFT workflows using alternative
exchange--correlation functionals in screening applications, highlighting the
consistency and utility of data-driven approaches. We also assess strategies to
improve ML-driven screening through expanded datasets and improved model
architectures tailored to PV-relevant features. This work provides a
quantitative framework for building low-emission, high-throughput discovery
pipelines.

Motivation: To determine if LLMs can mimic imperfect, iterative, and diverse student coding styles in introductory programming courses.

Result: Fine-tuning enhances alignment with student trajectories, capturing errors, incremental improvements, and stylistic variations.

Conclusion: Realistic student code modeling requires context-aware generation, temporal modeling, and multi-dimensional evaluation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on programming
tasks, but can they generate student-like code like real students - imperfect,
iterative, and stylistically diverse? We present ParaStudent, a systematic
study of LLM-based "student-like" code generation in an introductory
programming course setting. Using a dataset of timestamped student submissions
across multiple semesters, we design low- and high-resolution experiments to
model student progress and evaluate code outputs along semantic, functional,
and stylistic dimensions. Our results show that fine-tuning significantly
improves alignment with real student trajectories and captures error patterns,
incremental improvements, and stylistic variations more faithfully. This study
shows that modeling realistic student code requires capturing learning dynamics
through context-aware generation, temporal modeling, and multi-dimensional
evaluation. Code for experiments and evaluation is available at

### [239] [Coarse Addition and the St. Petersburg Paradox: A Heuristic Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12475)
*Takashi Izumo*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: The paper proposes a cognitive-based solution to the St. Petersburg paradox by using coarse addition over perceptual categories, leading to inertial stabilization of infinite series.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the paradox's challenge of infinite expected value by modeling how humans process numerical information with limited precision.

Method: Introduces coarse addition over grouped numerical values, replacing exact numbers with representative elements to achieve inertial stabilization.

Result: Demonstrates that the St. Petersburg series can stabilize under coarse addition, offering a plausible cognitive model.

Conclusion: The framework provides a behavioral and machine reasoning tool for handling divergent rewards, though not a definitive paradox resolution.

Abstract: The St. Petersburg paradox presents a longstanding challenge in decision
theory. It describes a game whose expected value is infinite, yet for which no
rational finite stake can be determined. Traditional solutions introduce
auxiliary assumptions, such as diminishing marginal utility, temporal
discounting, or extended number systems. These methods often involve
mathematical refinements that may not correspond to how people actually
perceive or process numerical information. This paper explores an alternative
approach based on a modified operation of addition defined over coarse
partitions of the outcome space. In this model, exact numerical values are
grouped into perceptual categories, and each value is replaced by a
representative element of its group before being added. This method allows for
a phenomenon where repeated additions eventually cease to affect the outcome, a
behavior described as inertial stabilization. Although this is not intended as
a definitive resolution of the paradox, the proposed framework offers a
plausible way to represent how agents with limited cognitive precision might
handle divergent reward structures. We demonstrate that the St. Petersburg
series can become inert under this coarse addition for a suitably constructed
partition. The approach may also have broader applications in behavioral
modeling and the study of machine reasoning under perceptual limitations.

TL;DR: The paper highlights vulnerabilities in Federated Learning (FL) for Road Condition Classification (RCC) systems, specifically Targeted Label Flipping Attacks (TLFAs), and proposes FLARE, a defense mechanism to mitigate these attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FL is promising for privacy-preserving RCC but is vulnerable to TLFAs, which can misclassify dangerous road conditions, posing safety risks.

Method: The study discloses FL-RCC vulnerabilities, introduces a label-distance metric to quantify risks, and proposes FLARE, a neuron-wise analysis defense.

Result: Experiments show TLFAs severely impact FL-RCC systems, but FLARE effectively mitigates these attacks.

Conclusion: FLARE is a robust solution to counter TLFAs in FL-RCC, enhancing system safety and reliability.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution for
privacy-preserving autonomous driving, specifically camera-based Road Condition
Classification (RCC) systems, harnessing distributed sensing, computing, and
communication resources on board vehicles without sharing sensitive image data.
However, the collaborative nature of FL-RCC frameworks introduces new
vulnerabilities: Targeted Label Flipping Attacks (TLFAs), in which malicious
clients (vehicles) deliberately alter their training data labels to compromise
the learned model inference performance. Such attacks can, e.g., cause a
vehicle to mis-classify slippery, dangerous road conditions as pristine and
exceed recommended speed. However, TLFAs for FL-based RCC systems are largely
missing. We address this challenge with a threefold contribution: 1) we
disclose the vulnerability of existing FL-RCC systems to TLFAs; 2) we introduce
a novel label-distance-based metric to precisely quantify the safety risks
posed by TLFAs; and 3) we propose FLARE, a defensive mechanism leveraging
neuron-wise analysis of the output layer to mitigate TLFA effects. Extensive
experiments across three RCC tasks, four evaluation metrics, six baselines, and
three deep learning models demonstrate both the severity of TLFAs on FL-RCC
systems and the effectiveness of FLARE in mitigating the attack impact.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Prompt Injection 2.0, where AI systems are manipulated via malicious inputs, combining with traditional cyber threats like XSS and CSRF to bypass security. It evaluates defenses and proposes architectural solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt injection attacks have evolved into hybrid threats, exploiting AI systems and traditional vulnerabilities, necessitating updated defenses.

Method: The study builds on Preamble's research, benchmarks traditional security measures, and evaluates them against modern AI-enhanced threats. It also proposes architectural solutions.

Result: Traditional security controls fail against AI-enhanced attacks, prompting the need for new defenses like prompt isolation and runtime security.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the urgency of updated security architectures to counter hybrid AI-cyber threats and suggests combining isolation, detection, and privilege separation.

Abstract: Prompt injection attacks, where malicious input is designed to manipulate AI
systems into ignoring their original instructions and following unauthorized
commands instead, were first discovered by Preamble, Inc. in May 2022 and
responsibly disclosed to OpenAI. Over the last three years, these attacks have
continued to pose a critical security threat to LLM-integrated systems. The
emergence of agentic AI systems, where LLMs autonomously perform multistep
tasks through tools and coordination with other agents, has fundamentally
transformed the threat landscape. Modern prompt injection attacks can now
combine with traditional cybersecurity exploits to create hybrid threats that
systematically evade traditional security controls. This paper presents a
comprehensive analysis of Prompt Injection 2.0, examining how prompt injections
integrate with Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF),
and other web security vulnerabilities to bypass traditional security measures.
We build upon Preamble's foundational research and mitigation technologies,
evaluating them against contemporary threats, including AI worms, multi-agent
infections, and hybrid cyber-AI attacks. Our analysis incorporates recent
benchmarks that demonstrate how traditional web application firewalls, XSS
filters, and CSRF tokens fail against AI-enhanced attacks. We also present
architectural solutions that combine prompt isolation, runtime security, and
privilege separation with novel threat detection capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in connecting cortical columns to repeated neural modules in AI, addressing scalability, energy efficiency, and robustness.

Method: Synthesizes historical, theoretical, and methodological perspectives on neural module repetition, distinguishing between architectural and parameter-shared repetition.

Result: Repeated modules converge to generalist modules, offering solutions for energy efficiency, scalability, and robust control, though theoretical backing is limited.

Conclusion: Architectures with module repetition hold untapped potential for efficiency and robustness, aligning with brain-inspired principles to solve modern AI challenges.

Abstract: While modern AI continues to advance, the biological brain remains the
pinnacle of neural networks in its robustness, adaptability, and efficiency.
This review explores an AI architectural path inspired by the brain's
structure, particularly the minicolumn hypothesis, which views the neocortex as
a distributed system of repeated modules - a structure we connect to collective
intelligence (CI). Despite existing work, there is a lack of comprehensive
reviews connecting the cortical column to the architectures of repeated neural
modules. This review aims to fill that gap by synthesizing historical,
theoretical, and methodological perspectives on neural module repetition. We
distinguish between architectural repetition - reusing structure - and
parameter-shared module repetition, where the same functional unit is repeated
across a network. The latter exhibits key CI properties such as robustness,
adaptability, and generalization. Evidence suggests that the repeated module
tends to converge toward a generalist module: simple, flexible problem solvers
capable of handling many roles in the ensemble. This generalist tendency may
offer solutions to longstanding challenges in modern AI: improved energy
efficiency during training through simplicity and scalability, and robust
embodied control via generalization. While empirical results suggest such
systems can generalize to out-of-distribution problems, theoretical results are
still lacking. Overall, architectures featuring module repetition remain an
emerging and unexplored architectural strategy, with significant untapped
potential for both efficiency, robustness, and adaptiveness. We believe that a
system that adopts the benefits of CI, while adhering to architectural and
functional principles of the minicolumns, could challenge the modern AI
problems of scalability, energy consumption, and democratization.

TL;DR: The paper addresses unsupervised metric learning by simultaneously learning optimal transport cost matrices and examining algorithmic convergence and alternative distances like Mahalanobis and graph Laplacians.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data classification without labeled samples is challenging, requiring appropriate feature distances. The paper explores unsupervised metric learning to address this.

Method: Proposes using stochastic random function iteration for convergence and examines replacing OT distances with Mahalanobis-like distances and graph Laplacians.

Result: The stochastic algorithm converges linearly despite non-paracontractive operators. Mahalanobis and graph Laplacian distances are viable alternatives.

Conclusion: The paper provides insights into unsupervised metric learning, demonstrating algorithmic convergence and flexibility in distance metrics.

Abstract: Data classification without access to labeled samples remains a challenging
problem. It usually depends on an appropriately chosen distance between
features, a topic addressed in metric learning. Recently, Huizing, Cantini and
Peyr\'e proposed to simultaneously learn optimal transport (OT) cost matrices
between samples and features of the dataset. This leads to the task of finding
positive eigenvectors of a certain nonlinear function that maps cost matrices
to OT distances. Having this basic idea in mind, we consider both the
algorithmic and the modeling part of unsupervised metric learning. First, we
examine appropriate algorithms and their convergence. In particular, we propose
to use the stochastic random function iteration algorithm and prove that it
converges linearly for our setting, although our operators are not
paracontractive as it was required for convergence so far. Second, we ask the
natural question if the OT distance can be replaced by other distances. We show
how Mahalanobis-like distances fit into our considerations. Further, we examine
an approach via graph Laplacians. In contrast to the previous settings, we have
just to deal with linear functions in the wanted matrices here, so that simple
algorithms from linear algebra can be applied.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper analyzes stochastic first-order methods (SFOMs) under heavy-tailed gradient noises, focusing on sub-Weibull and $p$-BCM noises, for weakly convex objectives. It examines high-probability convergence of vanilla SsGD under sub-Weibull noises and clipped SsGD under $p$-BCM noises, revealing theoretical dependencies and sample complexities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the incomplete understanding of SFOM convergence under heavy-tailed gradient noises (sub-Weibull and $p$-BCM) for weakly convex objectives, which include non-convex and non-smooth cases.

Method: Analyzes high-probability convergence of vanilla stochastic subgradient descent (SsGD) under sub-Weibull noises and clipped SsGD under $p$-BCM noises, focusing on weakly convex optimization.

Result: Vanilla SsGD's theoretical dependence on failure probability and iterations under sub-Weibull noises remains robust. Clipped SsGD under $p$-BCM noises shows no impact of non-smoothness or non-convexity on failure probability dependence, though sample complexity is worse than known lower bounds for smooth cases.

Conclusion: The study fills gaps in understanding SFOM convergence for weakly convex objectives under heavy-tailed noises, highlighting robustness in some cases but noting limitations in sample complexity for $p$-BCM noises.

Abstract: An increasing number of studies have focused on stochastic first-order
methods (SFOMs) under heavy-tailed gradient noises, which have been observed in
the training of practical deep learning models. In this paper, we focus on two
types of gradient noises: one is sub-Weibull noise, and the other is noise
under the assumption that it has a bounded $p$-th central moment ($p$-BCM) with
$p\in (1, 2]$. The latter is more challenging due to the occurrence of infinite
variance when $p\in (1, 2)$. Under these two gradient noise assumptions, the
in-expectation and high-probability convergence of SFOMs have been extensively
studied in the contexts of convex optimization and standard smooth
optimization. However, for weakly convex objectives-a class that includes all
Lipschitz-continuous convex objectives and smooth objectives-our understanding
of the in-expectation and high-probability convergence of SFOMs under these two
types of noises remains incomplete. We investigate the high-probability
convergence of the vanilla stochastic subgradient descent (SsGD) method under
sub-Weibull noises, as well as the high-probability and in-expectation
convergence of clipped SsGD under the $p$-BCM noises. Both analyses are
conducted in the context of weakly convex optimization. For weakly convex
objectives that may be non-convex and non-smooth, our results demonstrate that
the theoretical dependence of vanilla SsGD on the failure probability and
number of iterations under sub-Weibull noises does not degrade compared to the
case of smooth objectives. Under $p$-BCM noises, our findings indicate that the
non-smoothness and non-convexity of weakly convex objectives do not impact the
theoretical dependence of clipped SGD on the failure probability relative to
the smooth case; however, the sample complexity we derived is worse than a
well-known lower bound for smooth optimization.

### [246] [Implementation and Analysis of GPU Algorithms for Vecchia Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02740)
*Zachary James,Joseph Guinness*

Main category: stat.CO

TL;DR: The paper introduces GPU-accelerated Vecchia Approximation for Gaussian Processes, presenting a new method in the GpGpU R package, which outperforms existing multi-core and GPU solutions in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gaussian Processes are computationally expensive for large datasets, and existing GPU solutions for Vecchia Approximation are lacking.

Method: Three GPU implementations of Vecchia Approximation are compared, with a new method optimized for memory performance.

Result: The new method in GpGpU outperforms others in runtime and predictive accuracy, demonstrated on datasets including a large spatial-temporal one.

Conclusion: GpGpU provides an efficient GPU solution for Vecchia Approximation, improving computational performance and accuracy for large datasets.

Abstract: Gaussian Processes have become an indispensable part of the spatial
statistician's toolbox but are unsuitable for analyzing large dataset because
of the significant time and memory needed to fit the associated model exactly.
Vecchia Approximation is widely used to reduce the computational complexity and
can be calculated with embarrassingly parallel algorithms. While multi-core
software has been developed for Vecchia Approximation, such as the GpGp R
package, software designed to run on graphics processing units (GPU) is
lacking, despite the tremendous success GPUs have had in statistics and machine
learning. We compare three different ways to implement Vecchia Approximation on
a GPU: two of which are similar to methods used for other Gaussian Process
approximations and one that is new. The impact of memory type on performance is
investigated and the final method is optimized accordingly. We show that our
new method outperforms the other two and then present it in the GpGpU R
package. We compare GpGpU to existing multi-core and GPU-accelerated software
by fitting Gaussian Process models on various datasets, including a large
spatial-temporal dataset of $n>10^6$ points collected from an earth-observing
satellite. Our results show that GpGpU achieves faster runtimes and better
predictive accuracy.

TL;DR: A machine-learning pipeline using a vision transformer and kNN classifier detects poor-quality exposures in astronomical surveys like DECaLS, identifying 780 problematic exposures efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional human inspection for anomaly detection in large astronomical surveys is impractical due to increasing data volume.

Method: Semi-supervised pipeline combining a self-supervised vision transformer (ViT) with a kNN classifier, trained on labeled DECam exposures.

Result: The pipeline accurately identifies 780 problematic exposures in DECaLS Data Release 11, verified by visual inspection.

Conclusion: The method is efficient, scalable, and adaptable for quality control in other large imaging surveys.

Abstract: As the data volume of astronomical imaging surveys rapidly increases,
traditional methods for image anomaly detection, such as visual inspection by
human experts, are becoming impractical. We introduce a machine-learning-based
approach to detect poor-quality exposures in large imaging surveys, with a
focus on the DECam Legacy Survey (DECaLS) in regions of low extinction (i.e.,
$E(B-V)<0.04$). Our semi-supervised pipeline integrates a vision transformer
(ViT), trained via self-supervised learning (SSL), with a k-Nearest Neighbor
(kNN) classifier. We train and validate our pipeline using a small set of
labeled exposures observed by surveys with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam). A
clustering-space analysis of where our pipeline places images labeled in
``good'' and ``bad'' categories suggests that our approach can efficiently and
accurately determine the quality of exposures. Applied to new imaging being
reduced for DECaLS Data Release 11, our pipeline identifies 780 problematic
exposures, which we subsequently verify through visual inspection. Being highly
efficient and adaptable, our method offers a scalable solution for quality
control in other large imaging surveys.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper introduces an exhaustive search method for symbolic regression, addressing traditional challenges like failure probability and ambiguous function selection, and demonstrates its success in astrophysics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional symbolic regression methods often fail to find optimal functions and rely on poorly-justified assumptions, limiting their reliability and utility.

Method: Proposes an exhaustive search combined with model selection using the minimum description length principle to balance accuracy and complexity.

Result: The algorithm outperforms literature standards in three astrophysics problems: universe expansion, galactic gravity, and inflaton field potential.

Conclusion: The exhaustive symbolic regression method is a powerful, general-purpose tool with broad scientific applications.

Abstract: Symbolic regression is the machine learning method for learning functions
from data. After a brief overview of the symbolic regression landscape, I will
describe the two main challenges that traditional algorithms face: they have an
unknown (and likely significant) probability of failing to find any given good
function, and they suffer from ambiguity and poorly-justified assumptions in
their function-selection procedure. To address these I propose an exhaustive
search and model selection by the minimum description length principle, which
allows accuracy and complexity to be directly traded off by measuring each in
units of information. I showcase the resulting publicly available Exhaustive
Symbolic Regression algorithm on three open problems in astrophysics: the
expansion history of the universe, the effective behaviour of gravity in
galaxies and the potential of the inflaton field. In each case the algorithm
identifies many functions superior to the literature standards. This general
purpose methodology should find widespread utility in science and beyond.

*Yujun Zou,Nia Qi,Yingnan Deng,Zhihao Xue,Ming Gong,Wuyang Zhang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning-based method for microservice resource scheduling improves efficiency, reduces latency, and optimizes resource use compared to traditional static methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing uneven resource allocation, high latency, and low throughput in microservice architectures as service numbers and load increase.

Method: Uses a reinforcement learning algorithm where an agent interacts with the environment to optimize resource allocation strategies.

Result: Significant improvements in response speed, throughput, resource utilization, and energy efficiency under varying load and concurrency conditions.

Conclusion: The reinforcement learning model outperforms static methods by dynamically adapting to changing conditions, ensuring optimal performance.

Abstract: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based method for microservice
resource scheduling and optimization, aiming to address issues such as uneven
resource allocation, high latency, and insufficient throughput in traditional
microservice architectures. In microservice systems, as the number of services
and the load increase, efficiently scheduling and allocating resources such as
computing power, memory, and storage becomes a critical research challenge. To
address this, the paper employs an intelligent scheduling algorithm based on
reinforcement learning. Through the interaction between the agent and the
environment, the resource allocation strategy is continuously optimized. In the
experiments, the paper considers different resource conditions and load
scenarios, evaluating the proposed method across multiple dimensions, including
response time, throughput, resource utilization, and cost efficiency. The
experimental results show that the reinforcement learning-based scheduling
method significantly improves system response speed and throughput under low
load and high concurrency conditions, while also optimizing resource
utilization and reducing energy consumption. Under multi-dimensional resource
conditions, the proposed method can consider multiple objectives and achieve
optimized resource scheduling. Compared to traditional static resource
allocation methods, the reinforcement learning model demonstrates stronger
adaptability and optimization capability. It can adjust resource allocation
strategies in real time, thereby maintaining good system performance in
dynamically changing load and resource environments.

### [250] [Achieving Robust Channel Estimation Neural Networks by Designed Training Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12630)
*Dianxin Luan,John Thompson*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper proposes synthetic training datasets for neural networks in cognitive communications to ensure robust performance on unseen channels without requiring online training or prior channel knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks often fail to generalize to new channels due to lack of extrapolation capability, and online training is impractical due to latency and resource constraints.

Method: Design criteria for synthetic datasets are introduced to guarantee a target MSE on unseen channels, followed by a benchmark design for diverse channel profiles.

Result: Neural networks trained with the proposed criteria generalize well across different channel profiles and architectures, as shown in simulations.

Conclusion: The approach enables robust offline-trained neural networks for cognitive communications without needing real-time updates or channel information.

Abstract: Channel estimation is crucial in cognitive communications, as it enables
intelligent spectrum sensing and adaptive transmission by providing accurate
information about the current channel state. However, in many papers neural
networks are frequently tested by training and testing on one example channel
or similar channels. This is because data-driven methods often degrade on new
data which they are not trained on, as they cannot extrapolate their training
knowledge. This is despite the fact physical channels are often assumed to be
time-variant. However, due to the low latency requirements and limited
computing resources, neural networks may not have enough time and computing
resources to execute online training to fine-tune the parameters. This
motivates us to design offline-trained neural networks that can perform
robustly over wireless channels, but without any actual channel information
being known at design time. In this paper, we propose design criteria to
generate synthetic training datasets for neural networks, which guarantee that
after training the resulting networks achieve a certain mean squared error
(MSE) on new and previously unseen channels. Therefore, neural network
solutions require no prior channel information or parameters update for
real-world implementations. Based on the proposed design criteria, we further
propose a benchmark design which ensures intelligent operation for different
channel profiles. To demonstrate general applicability, we use neural networks
with different levels of complexity to show that the generalization achieved
appears to be independent of neural network architecture. From simulations,
neural networks achieve robust generalization to wireless channels with both
fixed channel profiles and variable delay spreads.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A unified deep learning framework for processing diverse biological signals (ECG, EEG) with state-of-the-art performance, addressing class imbalance and signal complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate, unified analysis of diverse biological signals (ECG, EEG) in synchronous monitoring, and overcoming class imbalance in biomedical datasets.

Method: ResNet-based CNN with attention mechanism, novel data augmentation (time-domain concatenation), wavelet denoising, Focal Loss for class imbalance, and regularization.

Result: Achieved accuracies of 99.96%, 99.78%, and 100% on UCI Seizure EEG, MIT-BIH Arrhythmia, and PTB Diagnostic ECG datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: The framework is robust, efficient (~130 MB memory, ~10 ms/sample), and suitable for low-end or wearable devices.

Abstract: The increasing need for accurate and unified analysis of diverse biological
signals, such as ECG and EEG, is paramount for comprehensive patient
assessment, especially in synchronous monitoring. Despite advances in
multi-sensor fusion, a critical gap remains in developing unified architectures
that effectively process and extract features from fundamentally different
physiological signals. Another challenge is the inherent class imbalance in
many biomedical datasets, often causing biased performance in traditional
methods. This study addresses these issues by proposing a novel and unified
deep learning framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance across
different signal types. Our method integrates a ResNet-based CNN with an
attention mechanism, enhanced by a novel data augmentation strategy:
time-domain concatenation of multiple augmented variants of each signal to
generate richer representations. Unlike prior work, we scientifically increase
signal complexity to achieve future-reaching capabilities, which resulted in
the best predictions compared to the state of the art. Preprocessing steps
included wavelet denoising, baseline removal, and standardization. Class
imbalance was effectively managed through the combined use of this advanced
data augmentation and the Focal Loss function. Regularization techniques were
applied during training to ensure generalization. We rigorously evaluated the
proposed architecture on three benchmark datasets: UCI Seizure EEG, MIT-BIH
Arrhythmia, and PTB Diagnostic ECG. It achieved accuracies of 99.96%, 99.78%,
and 100%, respectively, demonstrating robustness across diverse signal types
and clinical contexts. Finally, the architecture requires ~130 MB of memory and
processes each sample in ~10 ms, suggesting suitability for deployment on
low-end or wearable devices.

*Ogonnaya M. Romanus,Roberto Molinari*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces P-COQS, a differentially private method for Conformal Prediction (CP), ensuring privacy in calibration datasets while maintaining prediction set coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of DP approaches for CP, particularly in calibration datasets, to protect privacy in uncertainty quantification.

Method: Adapts a randomized binary search algorithm for DP quantiles in CP calibration, ensuring privacy of prediction sets.

Result: P-COQS achieves robust privacy and coverage, outperforming alternatives in empirical tests on datasets like CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.

Conclusion: P-COQS is effective for private CP, balancing coverage, efficiency, and privacy, though with slight under-coverage in finite samples.

Abstract: Most Differentially Private (DP) approaches focus on limiting privacy leakage
from learners based on the data that they are trained on, there are fewer
approaches that consider leakage when procedures involve a calibration dataset
which is common in uncertainty quantification methods such as Conformal
Prediction (CP). Since there is a limited amount of approaches in this
direction, in this work we deliver a general DP approach for CP that we call
Private Conformity via Quantile Search (P-COQS). The proposed approach adapts
an existing randomized binary search algorithm for computing DP quantiles in
the calibration phase of CP thereby guaranteeing privacy of the consequent
prediction sets. This however comes at a price of slightly under-covering with
respect to the desired $(1 - \alpha)$-level when using finite-sample
calibration sets (although broad empirical results show that the P-COQS
generally targets the required level in the considered cases). Confirming
properties of the adapted algorithm and quantifying the approximate coverage
guarantees of the consequent CP, we conduct extensive experiments to examine
the effects of privacy noise, sample size and significance level on the
performance of our approach compared to existing alternatives. In addition, we
empirically evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets, including
CIFAR-10, ImageNet and CoronaHack. Our results suggest that the proposed method
is robust to privacy noise and performs favorably with respect to the current
DP alternative in terms of empirical coverage, efficiency, and informativeness.
Specifically, the results indicate that P-COQS produces smaller conformal
prediction sets while simultaneously targeting the desired coverage and privacy
guarantees in all these experimental settings.

*Yujin Jeong,Ramesh Johari,Dominik Rothenhäusler,Emily Fox*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: RIDER is a theoretically-grounded method for handling temporal distribution shifts in machine learning by optimally weighting training data, which consistently outperforms standard weighting strategies across multiple real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models face significant challenges when deployed in dynamically evolving environments due to temporal distribution shifts, where the data distribution changes over time, making it difficult to maintain predictive performance.

Method: RIDER (RIsk minimization under Dynamically Evolving Regimes) derives optimally-weighted empirical risk minimization procedures based on a random distribution shift model, where shifts are modeled as superposition of numerous unpredictable changes in the data-generating process.

Result: RIDER consistently improves out-of-sample predictive performance when applied as fine-tuning on Yearbook dataset across benchmark methods in Wild-Time, and outperforms standard weighting strategies in stock market volatility prediction and NYC taxi ride duration forecasting.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that RIDER provides a unified theoretical framework that naturally encompasses common weighting schemes as special cases while achieving superior performance in handling temporal distribution shifts across diverse real-world applications.

Abstract: Temporal distribution shifts pose a key challenge for machine learning models
trained and deployed in dynamically evolving environments. This paper
introduces RIDER (RIsk minimization under Dynamically Evolving Regimes) which
derives optimally-weighted empirical risk minimization procedures under
temporal distribution shifts. Our approach is theoretically grounded in the
random distribution shift model, where random shifts arise as a superposition
of numerous unpredictable changes in the data-generating process. We show that
common weighting schemes, such as pooling all data, exponentially weighting
data, and using only the most recent data, emerge naturally as special cases in
our framework. We demonstrate that RIDER consistently improves out-of-sample
predictive performance when applied as a fine-tuning step on the Yearbook
dataset, across a range of benchmark methods in Wild-Time. Moreover, we show
that RIDER outperforms standard weighting strategies in two other real-world
tasks: predicting stock market volatility and forecasting ride durations in NYC
taxi data.

*Yuxi Liu*

Main category: cs.CC

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the computational complexity of diffusion-based language models, showing a dichotomy based on score-matching network quality: exact score-matching limits models to TC⁰, while no such restriction allows Turing machine simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To theoretically understand the capabilities and limitations of diffusion models in language tasks, especially sequential computation.

Method: Proves a dichotomy: exact score-matching restricts models to TC⁰, while unrestricted networks can simulate Turing machines.

Result: Diffusion models are limited to TC⁰ with exact score-matching but can achieve Turing-completeness without it.

Conclusion: The dichotomy highlights trade-offs in diffusion models, suggesting hybrid architectures may outperform Transformers and diffusion models.

Abstract: This paper explores the computational complexity of diffusion-based language
modeling. We prove a dichotomy based on the quality of the score-matching
network in a diffusion model. In one direction, a network that exactly computes
the score function of some initial distribution can only perform language
modeling within the $\mathsf{TC}^0$ complexity class, reflecting limitations
tied to rapid convergence. In the other direction, we show that if there is no
requirement for the network to match any score function, then diffusion
modeling can simulate any Turing machine in a certain sense. This dichotomy
provides a theoretical lens on the capabilities and limitations of diffusion
models, particularly concerning tasks requiring sequential computation. We
conjecture extensions of our theoretical results, including for the case where
the diffusion model is not perfect, but merely good. We also discuss the wider
context and practical implications, and hypothesize that a machine learning
architecture that can interpolate between sequential and parallel modes of
operation would be superior to both Transformers and diffusion models.

Main category: cs.CC

TL;DR: The paper explores computational-statistical tradeoffs in PAC learning, linking them to NP-hardness and proving sharp tradeoffs under exponential-time assumptions. It also connects RP vs. NP to learning efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between average-case statistical problems and worst-case computational assumptions, focusing on whether efficient algorithms can match information-theoretic limits.

Method: Uses NP-hardness to derive computational-statistical tradeoffs, assuming NP requires exponential time. Analyzes PAC learning with improper learners.

Result: Shows sharp tradeoffs for time-efficient learning and characterizes RP vs. NP in terms of sample complexity.

Conclusion: NP-hardness can explain computational-statistical tradeoffs in learning, even for improper learners, bypassing prior barriers.

Abstract: A central question in computer science and statistics is whether efficient
algorithms can achieve the information-theoretic limits of statistical
problems. Many computational-statistical tradeoffs have been shown under
average-case assumptions, but since statistical problems are average-case in
nature, it has been a challenge to base them on standard worst-case
assumptions.
  In PAC learning where such tradeoffs were first studied, the question is
whether computational efficiency can come at the cost of using more samples
than information-theoretically necessary. We base such tradeoffs on
$\mathsf{NP}$-hardness and obtain:
  $\circ$ Sharp computational-statistical tradeoffs assuming $\mathsf{NP}$
requires exponential time: For every polynomial $p(n)$, there is an $n$-variate
class $C$ with VC dimension $1$ such that the sample complexity of
time-efficiently learning $C$ is $\Theta(p(n))$.
  $\circ$ A characterization of $\mathsf{RP}$ vs. $\mathsf{NP}$ in terms of
learning: $\mathsf{RP} = \mathsf{NP}$ iff every $\mathsf{NP}$-enumerable class
is learnable with $O(\mathrm{VCdim}(C))$ samples in polynomial time. The
forward implication has been known since (Pitt and Valiant, 1988); we prove the
reverse implication.
  Notably, all our lower bounds hold against improper learners. These are the
first $\mathsf{NP}$-hardness results for improperly learning a subclass of
polynomial-size circuits, circumventing formal barriers of Applebaum, Barak,
and Xiao (2008).

TL;DR: A learning-based method is proposed to identify noise characteristics for accurate state estimation, addressing challenges in covariance matrix selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate state estimation is hindered by uncertainty in process and measurement models, requiring expert selection of covariance matrices, which can lead to errors or filter divergence.

Method: The paper introduces a learning-based approach with various loss functions to identify noise characteristics, tested for real-time vehicle state estimation.

Result: The methodology demonstrates improved performance in identifying noise characteristics, enhancing state estimation accuracy.

Conclusion: Learning-based approaches offer a promising solution to the challenging problem of noise characteristic identification in state estimation.

Abstract: Accurate state estimation requires careful consideration of uncertainty
surrounding the process and measurement models; these characteristics are
usually not well-known and need an experienced designer to select the
covariance matrices. An error in the selection of covariance matrices could
impact the accuracy of the estimation algorithm and may sometimes cause the
filter to diverge. Identifying noise characteristics has long been a
challenging problem due to uncertainty surrounding noise sources and
difficulties in systematic noise modeling. Most existing approaches try
identifying unknown covariance matrices through an optimization algorithm
involving innovation sequences. In recent years, learning approaches have been
utilized to determine the stochastic characteristics of process and measurement
models. We present a learning-based methodology with different loss functions
to identify noise characteristics and test these approaches' performance for
real-time vehicle state estimation

Motivation: To understand the behavior of deep neural networks with random initialization, particularly their finite-dimensional distributions and their approximation to Gaussian limits.

Method: The study assumes Lipschitz activation functions and allows layer widths to grow arbitrarily. It derives Gaussian approximation bounds in the Wasserstein-1 norm.

Result: Convergence rates of order $n^{-({1}/{6})^{L-1} + \epsilon}$ are obtained for networks with proportional layer widths and $L-1$ hidden layers.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights into the Gaussian behavior of deep neural networks with random weights, highlighting the impact of layer widths and activation functions.

Abstract: We study the Finite-Dimensional Distributions (FDDs) of deep neural networks
with randomly initialized weights that have finite-order moments. Specifically,
we establish Gaussian approximation bounds in the Wasserstein-$1$ norm between
the FDDs and their Gaussian limit assuming a Lipschitz activation function and
allowing the layer widths to grow to infinity at arbitrary relative rates. In
the special case where all widths are proportional to a common scale parameter
$n$ and there are $L-1$ hidden layers, we obtain convergence rates of order
$n^{-({1}/{6})^{L-1} + \epsilon}$, for any $\epsilon > 0$.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A novel method, Self-balancing neural network (Sbnet), is proposed to address bias in average treatment effect estimation by using a balancing net to derive pseudo propensity scores, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Observational studies face bias due to confounding and instrumental variables, unlike randomized trials, requiring robust methods to estimate treatment effects accurately.

Method: Sbnet integrates a balancing net within a feedforward neural network to estimate pseudo propensity scores, enabling one-step treatment effect estimation. A multi-pseudo propensity score framework is also introduced.

Result: Sbnet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in simulations and real-world datasets, demonstrating superior performance.

Conclusion: The proposed Sbnet effectively reduces bias in treatment effect estimation, offering a robust alternative to traditional propensity score methods.

Abstract: In observational studies, confounding variables affect both treatment and
outcome. Moreover, instrumental variables also influence the treatment
assignment mechanism. This situation sets the study apart from a standard
randomized controlled trial, where the treatment assignment is random. Due to
this situation, the estimated average treatment effect becomes biased. To
address this issue, a standard approach is to incorporate the estimated
propensity score when estimating the average treatment effect. However, these
methods incur the risk of misspecification in propensity score models. To solve
this issue, a novel method called the "Self balancing neural network" (Sbnet),
which lets the model itself obtain its pseudo propensity score from the
balancing net, is proposed in this study. The proposed method estimates the
average treatment effect by using the balancing net as a key part of the
feedforward neural network. This formulation resolves the estimation of the
average treatment effect in one step. Moreover, the multi-pseudo propensity
score framework, which is estimated from the diversified balancing net and used
for the estimation of the average treatment effect, is presented. Finally, the
proposed methods are compared with state-of-the-art methods on three simulation
setups and real-world datasets. It has been shown that the proposed
self-balancing neural network shows better performance than state-of-the-art
methods.

Motivation: Addressing the ill-posed challenge of identifying LTV systems from input-output data by quantifying uncertainty and defining a new system class (LTIE).

Method: Decomposes impulse response into posterior mean and random fluctuation, using Bayesian neural networks, Gaussian Processes, and variational inference.

Result: Robust inference of LTI system properties, superior data efficiency in noise tomography, and successful tracking of LTV impulse response.

Conclusion: Provides a flexible, robust methodology for uncertainty-aware system identification in dynamic environments.

Abstract: The identification of Linear Time-Variant (LTV) systems from input-output
data is a fundamental yet challenging ill-posed inverse problem. This work
introduces a unified Bayesian framework that models the system's impulse
response, $h(t, \tau)$, as a stochastic process. We decompose the response into
a posterior mean and a random fluctuation term, a formulation that provides a
principled approach for quantifying uncertainty and naturally defines a new,
useful system class we term Linear Time-Invariant in Expectation (LTIE). To
perform inference, we leverage modern machine learning techniques, including
Bayesian neural networks and Gaussian Processes, using scalable variational
inference. We demonstrate through a series of experiments that our framework
can robustly infer the properties of an LTI system from a single noisy
observation, show superior data efficiency compared to classical methods in a
simulated ambient noise tomography problem, and successfully track a
continuously varying LTV impulse response by using a structured Gaussian
Process prior. This work provides a flexible and robust methodology for

### [261] [When Pattern-by-Pattern Works: Theoretical and Empirical Insights for Logistic Models with Missing Values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13024)
*Christophe Muller,Erwan Scornet,Julie Josse*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores logistic regression with missing data, proving the Pattern-by-Pattern (PbP) strategy approximates Bayes probabilities well. It compares methods like imputation and PbP, recommending MICE.RF.Y for nonlinear features and PbP for Gaussian mixtures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of predicting responses with partially missing inputs in logistic models, which lack straightforward solutions compared to linear models.

Method: Theoretical proof of PbP's accuracy in missing data scenarios (MCAR, MAR, MNAR) and empirical comparison of methods like imputation, complete case analysis, PbP, and EM.

Result: PbP approximates Bayes probabilities well; MICE.RF.Y performs best for nonlinear features, while PbP excels for Gaussian mixtures.

Conclusion: For logistic regression with missing values, use mean imputation for small samples, MICE.RF.Y for nonlinear features, and PbP for Gaussian mixtures in large samples.

Abstract: Predicting a response with partially missing inputs remains a challenging
task even in parametric models, since parameter estimation in itself is not
sufficient to predict on partially observed inputs. Several works study
prediction in linear models. In this paper, we focus on logistic models, which
present their own difficulties. From a theoretical perspective, we prove that a
Pattern-by-Pattern strategy (PbP), which learns one logistic model per
missingness pattern, accurately approximates Bayes probabilities in various
missing data scenarios (MCAR, MAR and MNAR). Empirically, we thoroughly compare
various methods (constant and iterative imputations, complete case analysis,
PbP, and an EM algorithm) across classification, probability estimation,
calibration, and parameter inference. Our analysis provides a comprehensive
view on the logistic regression with missing values. It reveals that mean
imputation can be used as baseline for low sample sizes, and improved
performance is obtained via nonlinear multiple iterative imputation techniques
with the labels (MICE.RF.Y). For large sample sizes, PbP is the best method for
Gaussian mixtures, and we recommend MICE.RF.Y in presence of nonlinear
features.

### [262] [Relation-Aware Slicing in Cross-Domain Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13194)
*Dhruv Sarkar,Aprameyo Chakrabartty,Anish Chakrabarty,Swagatam Das*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces Relation-Aware Slicing Distribution (RASD) to improve the Sliced Gromov-Wasserstein (SGW) distance by addressing its computational inefficiency and uninformative directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The SGW distance suffers from high computational costs and uninformative projecting directions, limiting its effectiveness.

Method: Proposes Relation-Aware Projecting Direction (RAPD) to derive RASD, an optimization-free slicing distribution, and introduces RASGW and its variants like IWRASGW.

Result: Theoretical analysis and experiments show RASGW outperforms SGW in computational efficiency and alignment tasks.

Conclusion: RASGW and its variants effectively address SGW's shortcomings, offering a more efficient and powerful alternative.

Abstract: The Sliced Gromov-Wasserstein (SGW) distance, aiming to relieve the
computational cost of solving a non-convex quadratic program that is the
Gromov-Wasserstein distance, utilizes projecting directions sampled uniformly
from unit hyperspheres. This slicing mechanism incurs unnecessary computational
costs due to uninformative directions, which also affects the representative
power of the distance. However, finding a more appropriate distribution over
the projecting directions (slicing distribution) is often an optimization
problem in itself that comes with its own computational cost. In addition, with
more intricate distributions, the sampling itself may be expensive. As a
remedy, we propose an optimization-free slicing distribution that provides fast
sampling for the Monte Carlo approximation. We do so by introducing the
Relation-Aware Projecting Direction (RAPD), effectively capturing the pairwise
association of each of two pairs of random vectors, each following their
ambient law. This enables us to derive the Relation-Aware Slicing Distribution
(RASD), a location-scale law corresponding to sampled RAPDs. Finally, we
introduce the RASGW distance and its variants, e.g., IWRASGW (Importance
Weighted RASGW), which overcome the shortcomings experienced by SGW. We
theoretically analyze its properties and substantiate its empirical prowess
using extensive experiments on various alignment tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simulating realistic hair dynamics for diverse hairstyles and motions is challenging. Existing methods lack generalization.

Method: A Transformer-based static network predicts draped shapes, while a dynamic network with cross-attention fuses static features with kinematics for expressive dynamics.

Result: High-fidelity, generalizable hair dynamics with real-time inference, resolving penetrations even for unseen long hairstyles.

Conclusion: The method achieves broad generalization and high fidelity in hair dynamics, validated by physics-informed losses.

Abstract: Simulating hair dynamics that generalize across arbitrary hairstyles, body
shapes, and motions is a critical challenge. Our novel two-stage neural
solution is the first to leverage Transformer-based architectures for such a
broad generalization. We propose a Transformer-powered static network that
predicts static draped shapes for any hairstyle, effectively resolving
hair-body penetrations and preserving hair fidelity. Subsequently, a dynamic
network with a novel cross-attention mechanism fuses static hair features with
kinematic input to generate expressive dynamics and complex secondary motions.
This dynamic network also allows for efficient fine-tuning of challenging
motion sequences, such as abrupt head movements. Our method offers real-time
inference for both static single-frame drapes and dynamic drapes over pose
sequences. Our method demonstrates high-fidelity and generalizable dynamic hair
across various styles, guided by physics-informed losses, and can resolve
penetrations even for complex, unseen long hairstyles, highlighting its broad
generalization.

TL;DR: UniSLU is a unified framework for multiple SLU tasks, improving performance and reducing system complexity by integrating ASR, spoken NER, and SA into a single generative model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SLU methods use separate models for tasks like spoken NER and SA, leading to complexity and missed cross-task interactions. UniSLU aims to unify these tasks for better efficiency and performance.

Method: Proposes a unified representation and generative method for ASR, spoken NER, and SA, leveraging heterogeneous datasets and integrating with large language models.

Result: Outperforms benchmark methods on public SLU datasets, demonstrating superior performance in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: UniSLU effectively unifies multiple SLU tasks, enhancing performance and practicality, with plans to release code for further research.

Abstract: Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) plays a crucial role in speech-centric
multimedia applications, enabling machines to comprehend spoken language in
scenarios such as meetings, interviews, and customer service interactions. SLU
encompasses multiple tasks, including Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR),
spoken Named Entity Recognition (NER), and spoken Sentiment Analysis (SA).
However, existing methods often rely on separate model architectures for
individual tasks such as spoken NER and SA, which increases system complexity,
limits cross-task interaction, and fails to fully exploit heterogeneous
datasets available across tasks. To address these limitations, we propose
UniSLU, a unified framework that jointly models multiple SLU tasks within a
single architecture. Specifically, we propose a unified representation for
diverse SLU tasks, enabling full utilization of heterogeneous datasets across
multiple tasks. Built upon this representation, we propose a unified generative
method that jointly models ASR, spoken NER, and SA tasks, enhancing task
interactions and enabling seamless integration with large language models to
harness their powerful generative capabilities. Extensive experiments on public
SLU datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving superior
SLU performance compared to several benchmark methods, making it well-suited
for real-world speech-based multimedia scenarios. We will release all code and
models at github to facilitate future research.

Method: The study applies QTL to enhance a weak classical deep learning model for binary dementia classification, testing its robustness against noise.

Result: Using the OASIS 2 dataset, QTL transforms a suboptimal classical model into a more effective solution for biomedical image classification.

Conclusion: QTL shows promise for advancing healthcare technology by improving dementia detection, though noise effects must be considered.

Abstract: Dementia is a devastating condition with profound implications for
individuals, families, and healthcare systems. Early and accurate detection of
dementia is critical for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes.
While classical machine learning and deep learning approaches have been
explored extensively for dementia prediction, these solutions often struggle
with high-dimensional biomedical data and large-scale datasets, quickly
reaching computational and performance limitations. To address this challenge,
quantum machine learning (QML) has emerged as a promising paradigm, offering
faster training and advanced pattern recognition capabilities. This work aims
to demonstrate the potential of quantum transfer learning (QTL) to enhance the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum noise in QFL hinders performance due to heterogeneous noise levels in quantum devices, necessitating a solution to enhance training efficiency.

Method: SpoQFL leverages sporadic learning to adapt training strategies based on noise fluctuations in distributed quantum systems.

Result: Experiments show SpoQFL outperforms conventional QFL, achieving better training performance and stable convergence.

Conclusion: SpoQFL effectively addresses quantum noise heterogeneity, enhancing QFL robustness and efficiency.

Abstract: Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) is an emerging paradigm that combines
quantum computing and federated learning (FL) to enable decentralized model
training while maintaining data privacy over quantum networks. However, quantum
noise remains a significant barrier in QFL, since modern quantum devices
experience heterogeneous noise levels due to variances in hardware quality and
sensitivity to quantum decoherence, resulting in inadequate training
performance. To address this issue, we propose SpoQFL, a novel QFL framework
that leverages sporadic learning to mitigate quantum noise heterogeneity in
distributed quantum systems. SpoQFL dynamically adjusts training strategies
based on noise fluctuations, enhancing model robustness, convergence stability,
and overall learning efficiency. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that SpoQFL significantly outperforms conventional QFL approaches,
achieving superior training performance and more stable convergence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early screening for eye diseases is crucial but limited in low-resource areas. InSight aims to enhance accessibility and accuracy of diagnoses.

fusion technique (MetaFusion) combining clinical metadata and images; (b)
Pretraining method leveraging supervised and self-supervised loss functions;
and (c) Multitask model to simultaneously predict 5 diseases. We make use of
BRSET (lab-captured images) and mBRSET (smartphone-captured images) datasets,
both of which also contain clinical metadata for model training/evaluation.
  Results: Trained on a dataset of BRSET and mBRSET images, the image quality
checker achieves near-100% accuracy in filtering out low-quality fundus images.

*Qiankai Wang,James E. D. Tweel,Parsin Haji Reza,Anita Layton*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PaPIS, a pathology-aware image quality metric for virtual staining, outperforming traditional metrics by better capturing histological features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image quality metrics for virtual staining are inadequate as they are designed for natural images and fail to capture pathology-relevant features. Expert reviews are subjective and slow.

Method: PaPIS uses deep learning-based features trained on cell morphology segmentation and Retinex-inspired decomposition to assess histological quality.

Result: PaPIS aligns better with pathology-relevant visual cues and detects subtle cellular structures more effectively than traditional metrics. It also improves virtual staining models when used as a loss function.

Conclusion: Pathology-aware evaluation frameworks like PaPIS are essential for advancing virtual staining technologies toward clinical use.

Abstract: Virtual staining has emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional
histopathological staining techniques, enabling rapid, reagent-free image
transformations. However, existing evaluation methods predominantly rely on
full-reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA) metrics such as structural
similarity, which are originally designed for natural images and often fail to
capture pathology-relevant features. Expert pathology reviews have also been
used, but they are inherently subjective and time-consuming.
  In this study, we introduce PaPIS (Pathology-Aware Perceptual Image
Similarity), a novel FR-IQA metric specifically tailored for virtual staining
evaluation. PaPIS leverages deep learning-based features trained on cell
morphology segmentation and incorporates Retinex-inspired feature decomposition
to better reflect histological perceptual quality. Comparative experiments
demonstrate that PaPIS more accurately aligns with pathology-relevant visual
cues and distinguishes subtle cellular structures that traditional and existing
perceptual metrics tend to overlook. Furthermore, integrating PaPIS as a
guiding loss function in a virtual staining model leads to improved
histological fidelity.
  This work highlights the critical need for pathology-aware evaluation
frameworks to advance the development and clinical readiness of virtual
staining technologies.

TL;DR: Proposes a novel No-Reference IQA model using contrastive triplet-based learning to address limited labeled data, achieving strong generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NR-IQA is challenging due to lack of reference images and limited labeled data. Existing methods rely on large datasets, which are scarce.

Method: Constructs a custom dataset with limited reference images and introduces a model combining content and quality features, trained via contrastive triplet-based learning.

Result: Efficient training with fewer samples and strong generalization across public datasets.

Conclusion: The approach advances NR-IQA by reducing dependency on large labeled datasets while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models aim to predict perceptual image quality
in alignment with human judgments. No-Reference (NR) IQA remains particularly
challenging due to the absence of a reference image. While deep learning has
significantly advanced this field, a major hurdle in developing NR-IQA models
is the limited availability of subjectively labeled data. Most existing deep
learning-based NR-IQA approaches rely on pre-training on large-scale datasets
before fine-tuning for IQA tasks. To further advance progress in this area, we
propose a novel approach that constructs a custom dataset using a limited
number of reference content images and introduces a no-reference IQA model that
incorporates both content and quality features for perceptual quality
prediction. Specifically, we train a quality-aware model using contrastive
triplet-based learning, enabling efficient training with fewer samples while
achieving strong generalization performance across publicly available datasets.

TL;DR: A novel framework for coronary artery segmentation combines vision foundation models (VFMs) with parallel encoding, attention mechanisms, and uncertainty refinement to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coronary artery segmentation is challenging due to small size, complex morphology, and low contrast, necessitating advanced methods for accurate diagnosis.

Method: The framework uses a parallel encoding architecture with a ViT encoder for global features and a CNN encoder for local details, fused via cross-branch variational fusion (CVF). An evidential-learning uncertainty refinement (EUR) module refines uncertain regions.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on one in-house and two public datasets, demonstrating superior accuracy and generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses segmentation challenges, offering a robust solution for coronary artery disease diagnosis.

Abstract: Accurate coronary artery segmentation is critical for computeraided diagnosis
of coronary artery disease (CAD), yet it remains challenging due to the small
size, complex morphology, and low contrast with surrounding tissues. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel segmentation framework that leverages the
power of vision foundation models (VFMs) through a parallel encoding
architecture. Specifically, a vision transformer (ViT) encoder within the VFM
captures global structural features, enhanced by the activation of the final
two ViT blocks and the integration of an attention-guided enhancement (AGE)
module, while a convolutional neural network (CNN) encoder extracts local
details. These complementary features are adaptively fused using a cross-branch
variational fusion (CVF) module, which models latent distributions and applies
variational attention to assign modality-specific weights. Additionally, we
introduce an evidential-learning uncertainty refinement (EUR) module, which
quantifies uncertainty using evidence theory and refines uncertain regions by
incorporating multi-scale feature aggregation and attention mechanisms, further
enhancing segmentation accuracy. Extensive evaluations on one in-house and two
public datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in
accurate coronary artery segmentation and showcasing strong generalization
across multiple datasets. The code is available at

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel framework using a conditional Bernoulli diffusion model improves orbital bone segmentation in CT images by leveraging consensus from multiple outputs, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation of orbital bones in CT images is crucial for customized implants, but existing methods struggle with ambiguous boundaries and thin structures.

Method: The approach uses a conditional Bernoulli diffusion model to generate multiple segmentations, then applies consensus-driven correction based on position proximity, consensus level, and gradient direction similarity.

Result: The method outperforms existing techniques, enhancing recall in ambiguous regions and maintaining thin structure continuity.

Conclusion: The framework automates segmentation correction, benefiting surgical planning and procedures.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of orbital bones in facial computed tomography (CT)
images is essential for the creation of customized implants for reconstruction
of defected orbital bones, particularly challenging due to the ambiguous
boundaries and thin structures such as the orbital medial wall and orbital
floor. In these ambiguous regions, existing segmentation approaches often
output disconnected or under-segmented results. We propose a novel framework
that corrects segmentation results by leveraging consensus from multiple
diffusion model outputs. Our approach employs a conditional Bernoulli diffusion
model trained on diverse annotation patterns per image to generate multiple
plausible segmentations, followed by a consensus-driven correction that
incorporates position proximity, consensus level, and gradient direction
similarity to correct challenging regions. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method outperforms existing methods, significantly improving recall in
ambiguous regions while preserving the continuity of thin structures.
Furthermore, our method automates the manual process of segmentation result
correction and can be applied to image-guided surgical planning and surgery.

TL;DR: The paper introduces fastWDM3D, a 3D wavelet diffusion model for healthy tissue inpainting, achieving high-quality results with significantly faster processing than previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the slow sampling speed of denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) in healthy tissue inpainting, while maintaining high-quality results.

Method: Combines DDPMs with a variance-preserving noise schedule and avoids adversarial training, adapting a 2D approach to 3D inpainting. Tests the method on a 3D wavelet diffusion model (WDM3D).

Result: fastWDM3D achieved SSIM of 0.8571, MSE of 0.0079, and PSNR of 22.26 in just two time steps (1.81s per image), outperforming other DDPMs by up to 800x in speed.

Conclusion: fastWDM3D is a fast and accurate solution for healthy tissue inpainting, with superior performance metrics and efficiency.

Abstract: Healthy tissue inpainting has significant applications, including the
generation of pseudo-healthy baselines for tumor growth models and the
facilitation of image registration. In previous editions of the BraTS Local
Synthesis of Healthy Brain Tissue via Inpainting Challenge, denoising diffusion
probabilistic models (DDPMs) demonstrated qualitatively convincing results but
suffered from low sampling speed. To mitigate this limitation, we adapted a 2D
image generation approach, combining DDPMs with generative adversarial networks
(GANs) and employing a variance-preserving noise schedule, for the task of 3D
inpainting. Our experiments showed that the variance-preserving noise schedule
and the selected reconstruction losses can be effectively utilized for
high-quality 3D inpainting in a few time steps without requiring adversarial
training. We applied our findings to a different architecture, a 3D wavelet
diffusion model (WDM3D) that does not include a GAN component. The resulting
model, denoted as fastWDM3D, obtained a SSIM of 0.8571, a MSE of 0.0079, and a
PSNR of 22.26 on the BraTS inpainting test set. Remarkably, it achieved these
scores using only two time steps, completing the 3D inpainting process in 1.81
s per image. When compared to other DDPMs used for healthy brain tissue
inpainting, our model is up to 800 x faster while still achieving superior
performance metrics. Our proposed method, fastWDM3D, represents a promising
approach for fast and accurate healthy tissue inpainting. Our code is available

Motivation: High-spatial-resolution hyperspectral images (HSI) are crucial for applications like remote sensing and medical imaging, but current fusion methods require impractical calibration or ground truth data.

Method: SpectraLift trains a lightweight MLP network using synthetic LR-MSI and LR-HSI with an ℓ1 spectral reconstruction loss, then maps HR-MSI to HR-HSI at inference.

Result: SpectraLift outperforms state-of-the-art methods on PSNR, SAM, SSIM, and RMSE benchmarks, converging quickly and being agnostic to spatial blur and resolution.

Conclusion: SpectraLift provides a practical, efficient solution for HSI-MSI fusion without needing impractical calibration or ground truth data.

Abstract: High-spatial-resolution hyperspectral images (HSI) are essential for
applications such as remote sensing and medical imaging, yet HSI sensors
inherently trade spatial detail for spectral richness. Fusing
high-spatial-resolution multispectral images (HR-MSI) with
low-spatial-resolution hyperspectral images (LR-HSI) is a promising route to
recover fine spatial structures without sacrificing spectral fidelity. Most
state-of-the-art methods for HSI-MSI fusion demand point spread function (PSF)
calibration or ground truth high resolution HSI (HR-HSI), both of which are
impractical to obtain in real world settings. We present SpectraLift, a fully
self-supervised framework that fuses LR-HSI and HR-MSI inputs using only the
MSI's Spectral Response Function (SRF). SpectraLift trains a lightweight
per-pixel multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network using ($i$)~a synthetic
low-spatial-resolution multispectral image (LR-MSI) obtained by applying the
SRF to the LR-HSI as input, ($ii$)~the LR-HSI as the output, and ($iii$)~an
$\ell_1$ spectral reconstruction loss between the estimated and true LR-HSI as
the optimization objective. At inference, SpectraLift uses the trained network
to map the HR-MSI pixel-wise into a HR-HSI estimate. SpectraLift converges in
minutes, is agnostic to spatial blur and resolution, and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on PSNR, SAM, SSIM, and RMSE benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance graph data analysis by integrating properties of Hermitian adjacency and non-backtracking matrices for directed graphs.

Method: Introduces the complex non-backtracking matrix, analyzes its properties, and compares it with Hermitian adjacency matrices.

Result: Shows the matrix's utility in clustering, especially for sparse directed graphs, and reveals relationships between the proposed matrix and Hermitian adjacency matrices.

Conclusion: The complex non-backtracking matrix is a promising tool for extracting cluster information in directed graphs.

Abstract: Graph representation matrices are essential tools in graph data analysis.
Recently, Hermitian adjacency matrices have been proposed to investigate
directed graph structures. Previous studies have demonstrated that these
matrices can extract valuable information for clustering. In this paper, we
propose the complex non-backtracking matrix that integrates the properties of
the Hermitian adjacency matrix and the non-backtracking matrix. The proposed
matrix has similar properties with the non-backtracking matrix of undirected
graphs. We reveal relationships between the complex non-backtracking matrix and
the Hermitian adjacency matrix. Also, we provide intriguing insights that this
matrix representation holds cluster information, particularly for sparse
directed graphs.

### [278] [On multiagent online problems with predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12486)
*Gabriel Istrate,Cosmin Bonchis,Victor Bogdan*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper explores competitive algorithms with predictions in multiagent settings, using a two-predictor framework. It analyzes achievable competitive ratios under varying predictor qualities, illustrated via a multiagent ski-rental problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the best competitive ratios achievable in multiagent settings using predictors for self and other agents' behavior, addressing robustness to prediction errors.

Method: Introduces a two-predictor framework and applies it to a multiagent ski-rental problem, where agents collaborate for group licenses. Analyzes algorithms under perfect and imperfect predictions.

Result: An algorithm robust to mispredictions is proposed and benchmarked, showing improved performance over non-robust methods in imperfect prediction scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances optimality and robustness in multiagent competitive algorithms, with practical implications for collaborative resource pooling.

Abstract: We study the power of (competitive) algorithms with predictions in a
multiagent setting. We introduce a two predictor framework, that assumes that
agents use one predictor for their future (self) behavior, and one for the
behavior of the other players. The main problem we are concerned with is
understanding what are the best competitive ratios that can be achieved by
employing such predictors, under various assumptions on predictor quality.
  As an illustration of our framework, we introduce and analyze a multiagent
version of the ski-rental problem. In this problem agents can collaborate by
pooling resources to get a group license for some asset. If the license price
is not met then agents have to rent the asset individually for the day at a
unit price. Otherwise the license becomes available forever to everyone at no
extra cost.
  In the particular case of perfect other predictions the algorithm that
follows the self predictor is optimal but not robust to mispredictions of
agent's future behavior; we give an algorithm with better robustness properties
and benchmark it.

*Aaron Councilman,David Fu,Aryan Gupta,Chengxiao Wang,David Grove,Yu-Xiong Wang,Vikram Adve*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to ensure correctness in LLM-generated code by using a formal query language and verification system, achieving high accuracy in identifying and verifying code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate incorrect code, and users struggle to detect errors, hindering the reliability of AI Code Assistants and natural language programming.

Method: Incorporates a formal query language to represent user intent, verifies LLM-generated code against this intent, and implements the system (Astrogator) for Ansible.

Result: The verifier correctly verified 83% of accurate code and identified 92% of incorrect code in benchmark tests.

Conclusion: The approach enhances reliability of AI-generated code, potentially enabling broader use of natural language programming.

Abstract: In the past few years LLMs have emerged as a tool that can aid programmers by
taking natural language descriptions and generating code based on it. However,
LLMs often generate incorrect code that users need to fix and the literature
suggests users often struggle to detect these errors. In this work we seek to
offer formal guarantees of correctness to LLM generated code; such guarantees
could improve the experience of using AI Code Assistants and potentially enable
natural language programming for users with little or no programming knowledge.
To address this challenge we propose to incorporate a formal query language
that can represent a user's intent in a formally defined but natural
language-like manner that a user can confirm matches their intent. Then, using
such a query we propose to verify LLM generated code to ensure it matches the
user's intent. We implement these ideas in our system, Astrogator, for the
Ansible programming language which includes such a formal query language, a
calculus for representing the behavior of Ansible programs, and a symbolic
interpreter which is used for the verification. On a benchmark suite of 21
code-generation tasks, our verifier is able to verify correct code in 83% of
cases and identify incorrect code in 92%.

### [280] [Deep Bilinear Koopman Model for Real-Time Vehicle Control in Frenet Frame](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12578)
*Mohammad Abtahi,Farhang Motallebi Araghi,Navid Mojahed,Shima Nazari*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: A deep Koopman approach is proposed for modeling and controlling autonomous vehicle dynamics in the Frenet frame, integrating a neural network for learning and a CER module for error compensation, validated via HIL experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The nonlinear and coupled nature of vehicle dynamics poses challenges for accurate modeling and control, necessitating advanced techniques like Koopman operator theory.

Method: A deep neural network learns the Koopman operator and invariant subspace, combined with a CER module for error mitigation, and validated via HIL experiments.

Result: The controller significantly reduces tracking errors compared to baselines, demonstrating real-time feasibility.

Conclusion: The framework is effective for real-time autonomous vehicle control, validated through hardware experiments.

Abstract: Accurate modeling and control of autonomous vehicles remain a fundamental
challenge due to the nonlinear and coupled nature of vehicle dynamics. While
Koopman operator theory offers a framework for deploying powerful linear
control techniques, learning a finite-dimensional invariant subspace for
high-fidelity modeling continues to be an open problem. This paper presents a
deep Koopman approach for modeling and control of vehicle dynamics within the
curvilinear Frenet frame. The proposed framework uses a deep neural network
architecture to simultaneously learn the Koopman operator and its associated
invariant subspace from the data. Input-state bilinear interactions are
captured by the algorithm while preserving convexity, which makes it suitable
for real-time model predictive control (MPC) application. A multi-step
prediction loss is utilized during training to ensure long-horizon prediction
capability. To further enhance real-time trajectory tracking performance, the
model is integrated with a cumulative error regulator (CER) module, which
compensates for model mismatch by mitigating accumulated prediction errors.
Closed-loop performance is evaluated through hardware-in-the-loop (HIL)
experiments using a CarSim RT model as the target plant, with real-time
validation conducted on a dSPACE SCALEXIO system. The proposed controller
achieved significant reductions in tracking error relative to baseline
controllers, confirming its suitability for real-time implementation in
embedded autonomous vehicle systems.

### [281] [Dual LiDAR-Based Traffic Movement Count Estimation at a Signalized Intersection: Deployment, Data Collection, and Preliminary Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13073)
*Saswat Priyadarshi Nayak,Guoyuan Wu,Kanok Boriboonsomsin,Matthew Barth*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper explores using a dual-LiDAR system for Traffic Movement Count (TMC) estimation at intersections, addressing limitations of traditional methods like cameras under poor conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional TMC methods (manual counting, cameras, etc.) are unreliable in poor lighting or weather. LiDAR offers a cost-effective, accurate alternative for 3D object detection and tracking.

Method: A dual-LiDAR system was deployed at an intersection in Rialto, California, using 3D bounding box detections to classify vehicle counts by direction, movement, and class.

Result: The study presents TMC results, trends, and irregularities, demonstrating LiDAR's potential for accurate traffic monitoring.

Conclusion: LiDAR improves TMC estimation and could enhance trajectory forecasting and intent prediction. Future improvements are suggested for broader applications.

Abstract: Traffic Movement Count (TMC) at intersections is crucial for optimizing
signal timings, assessing the performance of existing traffic control measures,
and proposing efficient lane configurations to minimize delays, reduce
congestion, and promote safety. Traditionally, methods such as manual counting,
loop detectors, pneumatic road tubes, and camera-based recognition have been
used for TMC estimation. Although generally reliable, camera-based TMC
estimation is prone to inaccuracies under poor lighting conditions during harsh
weather and nighttime. In contrast, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)
technology is gaining popularity in recent times due to reduced costs and its
expanding use in 3D object detection, tracking, and related applications. This
paper presents the authors' endeavor to develop, deploy and evaluate a
dual-LiDAR system at an intersection in the city of Rialto, California, for TMC
estimation. The 3D bounding box detections from the two LiDARs are used to
classify vehicle counts based on traffic directions, vehicle movements, and
vehicle classes. This work discusses the estimated TMC results and provides
insights into the observed trends and irregularities. Potential improvements
are also discussed that could enhance not only TMC estimation, but also
trajectory forecasting and intent prediction at intersections.

TL;DR: A novel Bayesian Optimization method refines Martini3 CGMD topologies for domain-specific accuracy and efficiency, bridging the gap between AA and CGMD simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational costs of All-Atom MD simulations and the lack of specialization in existing CGMD methods like Martini3 for domain-specific applications.

Method: Bayesian Optimization to refine Martini3 bonded interaction parameters for domain-specific CGMD simulations.

Result: An optimized CG potential achieving AA-like accuracy with CGMD efficiency, validated across polymerization degrees.

Conclusion: The approach enhances multiscale simulations, enabling faster, cost-effective molecular discovery.

Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are essential for accurately predicting
the physical and chemical properties of large molecular systems across various
pressure and temperature ensembles. However, the high computational costs
associated with All-Atom (AA) MD simulations have led to the development of
Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics (CGMD), providing a lower-dimensional
compression of the AA structure into representative CG beads, offering reduced
computational expense at the cost of predictive accuracy. Existing CGMD
methods, such as CG-Martini (calibrated against experimental data), aim to
generate an embedding of a topology that sufficiently generalizes across a
range of structures. Detrimentally, in attempting to specify parameterization
with applicability across molecular classes, it is unable to specialize to
domain-specific applications, where sufficient accuracy and computational speed
are critical. This work presents a novel approach to optimize derived results
from CGMD simulations by refining the general-purpose Martini3 topologies
specifically the bonded interaction parameters within a given coarse-grained
mapping - for domain-specific applications using Bayesian Optimization
methodologies. We have developed and validated a CG potential applicable to any
degree of polymerization, representing a significant advancement in the field.
Our optimized CG potential, based on the Martini3 framework, aims to achieve
accuracy comparable to AAMD while maintaining the computational efficiency of
CGMD. This approach bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in
multiscale molecular simulations, potentially enabling more rapid and
cost-effective molecular discovery across various scientific and technological
domains.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: A framework transforms football data into object-centric event logs with a spatial dimension, demonstrating its effectiveness and providing the first example in football analytics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited availability of real-world object-centric event logs and explore their usefulness, leveraging team sports data like football.

Method: Develop a framework to convert football data into object-centric event logs, enhanced with spatial information, and test it on real-world data.

Result: Successful generation of object-centric event logs from football data, showcasing their potential for process mining in sports analytics.

Conclusion: The framework is effective, but future work should focus on variant analysis and filtering to manage variability.

Abstract: Object-centric event logs expand the conventional single-case notion event
log by considering multiple objects, allowing for the analysis of more complex
and realistic process behavior. However, the number of real-world
object-centric event logs remains limited, and further studies are needed to
test their usefulness. The increasing availability of data from team sports can
facilitate object-centric process mining, leveraging both real-world data and
suitable use cases. In this paper, we present a framework for transforming
football (soccer) data into an object-centric event log, further enhanced with
a spatial dimension. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by
generating object-centric event logs based on real-world football data and
discuss the results for varying process representations. With our paper, we
provide the first example for object-centric event logs in football analytics.
Future work should consider variant analysis and filtering techniques to better
handle variability

### [284] [Rel-HNN: Split Parallel Hypergraph Neural Network for Learning on Relational Databases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12562)
*Md. Tanvir Alam,Md. Ahasanul Alam,Md Mahmudur Rahman,Md. Mosaddek Khan*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The paper introduces rel-HNN, a hypergraph-based framework for capturing fine-grained relational semantics in databases, outperforming existing methods and achieving significant speedups with split-parallel training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Relational databases (RDBs) are widely used, but deep learning models struggle with their structured nature. Existing GNNs oversimplify relational structures, ignoring intra-tuple relationships.

Method: Proposes rel-HNN, modeling attribute-value pairs as nodes and tuples as hyperedges, enabling multi-level representations. Introduces split-parallel training for scalability.

Result: rel-HNN outperforms existing methods in classification and regression tasks. Split-parallel training achieves up to 3.18x speedup for relational data learning.

Conclusion: rel-HNN effectively captures relational semantics and scales efficiently, offering superior performance and speed for learning on relational data.

Abstract: Relational databases (RDBs) are ubiquitous in enterprise and real-world
applications. Flattening the database poses challenges for deep learning models
that rely on fixed-size input representations to capture relational semantics
from the structured nature of relational data. Graph neural networks (GNNs)
have been proposed to address this, but they often oversimplify relational
structures by modeling all the tuples as monolithic nodes and ignoring
intra-tuple associations. In this work, we propose a novel hypergraph-based
framework, that we call rel-HNN, which models each unique attribute-value pair
as a node and each tuple as a hyperedge, enabling the capture of fine-grained
intra-tuple relationships. Our approach learns explicit multi-level
representations across attribute-value, tuple, and table levels. To address the
scalability challenges posed by large RDBs, we further introduce a
split-parallel training algorithm that leverages multi-GPU execution for
efficient hypergraph learning. Extensive experiments on real-world and
benchmark datasets demonstrate that rel-HNN significantly outperforms existing
methods in both classification and regression tasks. Moreover, our
split-parallel training achieves substantial speedups -- up to 3.18x for
learning on relational data and up to 2.94x for hypergraph learning -- compared
to conventional single-GPU execution.

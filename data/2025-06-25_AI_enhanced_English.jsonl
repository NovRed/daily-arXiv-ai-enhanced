This study\nintroduces a novel framework by integrating spiritual wisdom from the Bhagavad\nGita with advanced large language model GPT-4o to enhance emotional well-being.\nWe present the GITes (Gita Integrated Therapy for Emotional Support) dataset,\nwhich enhances the existing ExTES mental health dataset by including 10,729\nspiritually guided responses generated by GPT-4o and evaluated by domain\nexperts. We benchmark GITes against 12 state-of-the-art LLMs, including both\nmental health specific and general purpose models. To evaluate spiritual\nrelevance in generated responses beyond what conventional n-gram based metrics\ncapture, we propose a novel Spiritual Insight metric and automate assessment\nvia an LLM as jury framework using chain-of-thought prompting. Integrating\nspiritual guidance into AI driven support enhances both NLP and spiritual\nmetrics for the best performing LLM Phi3-Mini 3.2B Instruct, achieving\nimprovements of 122.71% in ROUGE, 126.53% in METEOR, 8.15% in BERT score,\n15.92% in Spiritual Insight, 18.61% in Sufficiency and 13.22% in Relevance\ncompared to its zero-shot counterpart. While these results reflect substantial\nimprovements across automated empathy and spirituality metrics, further\nvalidation in real world patient populations remains a necessary step.

In the real\nworld, recommendation systems are driven by user behavior, and since users with\nthe same sensitive feature (e.g., gender and age) tend to have the same\npatterns, recommendation models can easily capture the strong correlation\npreference of sensitive features and thus cause recommendation unfairness.\nDiffusion model (DM) as a new generative model paradigm has achieved great\nsuccess in recommendation systems. DM's ability to model uncertainty and\nrepresent diversity, and its modeling mechanism has a high degree of\nadaptability with the real-world recommendation process with bias. Therefore,\nwe use DM to effectively model the fairness of recommendation and enhance the\ndiversity. This paper proposes a FairGENerative sequential Recommendation model\nbased on DM, FairGENRec. In the training phase, we inject random noise into the\noriginal distribution under the guidance of the sensitive feature recognition\nmodel, and a sequential denoise model is designed for the reverse\nreconstruction of items. Simultaneously, recommendation fairness modeling is\ncompleted by injecting multi-interests representational information that\neliminates the bias of sensitive user features into the generated results. In\nthe inference phase, the model obtains the noise in the form of noise addition\nby using the history interactions which is followed by reverse iteration to\nreconstruct the target item representation. Finally, our extensive experiments\non three datasets demonstrate the dual enhancement effect of FairGENRec on\naccuracy and fairness, while the statistical analysis of the cases visualizes\nthe degree of improvement on the fairness of the recommendation.", "AI": {"tldr": "FairGENRec, a diffusion model-based recommendation system, enhances fairness and diversity by mitigating bias from sensitive user features.", "motivation": "Address recommendation unfairness caused by correlations between user behavior and sensitive features like gender and age.", "method": "Uses a diffusion model to inject noise and reconstruct item sequences, incorporating multi-interests to eliminate bias.", "result": "Improves both accuracy and fairness in recommendations, validated on three datasets.", "conclusion": "FairGENRec effectively balances recommendation quality and fairness, demonstrating practical utility."}}

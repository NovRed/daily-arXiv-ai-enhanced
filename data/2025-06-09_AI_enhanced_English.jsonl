Inspired by human vision\nstudies, research has begun exploring whether machines, such as large vision\nlanguage models (LVLMs), exhibit similar susceptibilities to visual illusions.\nHowever, studies often have used non-abstract images and have not distinguished\nactual and apparent features, leading to ambiguous assessments of machine\ncognition. To address these limitations, we introduce a visual question\nanswering (VQA) dataset, categorized into genuine and fake illusions, along\nwith corresponding control images. Genuine illusions present discrepancies\nbetween actual and apparent features, whereas fake illusions have the same\nactual and apparent features even though they look illusory due to the similar\ngeometric configuration. We evaluate the performance of LVLMs for genuine and\nfake illusion VQA tasks and investigate whether the models discern actual and\napparent features. Our findings indicate that although LVLMs may appear to\nrecognize illusions by correctly answering questions about both feature types,\nthey predict the same answers for both Genuine Illusion and Fake Illusion VQA\nquestions. This suggests that their responses might be based on prior knowledge\nof illusions rather than genuine visual understanding.

The Unconstrained Feature Model (UFM) has been\nproposed to explain NC theoretically, and there emerges a growing body of work\nthat extends NC to tasks other than classification and leverages it for\npractical applications. In this study, we investigate whether a similar\nphenomenon arises in deep Ordinal Regression (OR) tasks, via combining the\ncumulative link model for OR and UFM. We show that a phenomenon we call Ordinal\nNeural Collapse (ONC) indeed emerges and is characterized by the following\nthree properties: (ONC1) all optimal features in the same class collapse to\ntheir within-class mean when regularization is applied; (ONC2) these class\nmeans align with the classifier, meaning that they collapse onto a\none-dimensional subspace; (ONC3) the optimal latent variables (corresponding to\nlogits or preactivations in classification tasks) are aligned according to the\nclass order, and in particular, in the zero-regularization limit, a highly\nlocal and simple geometric relationship emerges between the latent variables\nand the threshold values. We prove these properties analytically within the UFM\nframework with fixed threshold values and corroborate them empirically across a\nvariety of datasets. We also discuss how these insights can be leveraged in OR,\nhighlighting the use of fixed thresholds.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper explores the emergence of Ordinal Neural Collapse (ONC) in deep Ordinal Regression (OR) tasks, demonstrating three key properties and validating them theoretically and empirically.", "motivation": "To understand if Neural Collapse (NC), a simple geometric structure in deep classification, extends to OR tasks, deepening insights into neural network behavior.", "method": "Combines the cumulative link model for OR with the Unconstrained Feature Model (UFM) to analyze ONC, proving properties analytically and testing them on datasets.", "result": "ONC emerges with three properties: within-class feature collapse, alignment of class means with classifiers, and ordered latent variables.", "conclusion": "ONC provides a theoretical and empirical framework for OR, suggesting practical applications like fixed thresholds."}}

An asymmetric actor-critic\narchitecture accelerates training by leveraging privileged information in\nsimulation, while noise-injected observations enhance robustness against\nuncertainties. We further demonstrate that synergistic wheel-leg coordination\nreduces joint torque consumption by 15.8% and 26.2% and improves stabilization\nthrough energy transfer mechanisms.

While current video diffusion models produce high-quality\nresults, adapting them for efficient editing remains difficult due to the heavy\ncomputational demands that prevent the direct application of previous image\nediting techniques. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FADE, a\ntraining-free yet highly effective video editing approach that fully leverages\nthe inherent priors from pre-trained video diffusion models via frequency-aware\nfactorization. Rather than simply using these models, we first analyze the\nattention patterns within the video model to reveal how video priors are\ndistributed across different components. Building on these insights, we propose\na factorization strategy to optimize each component's specialized role.\nFurthermore, we devise spectrum-guided modulation to refine the sampling\ntrajectory with frequency domain cues, preventing information leakage and\nsupporting efficient, versatile edits while preserving the basic spatial and\ntemporal structure. Extensive experiments on real-world videos demonstrate that\nour method consistently delivers high-quality, realistic and temporally\ncoherent editing results both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Evaluating fairness is a critical aspect of ML model development, as\nbiased models can perpetuate structural inequalities. The {fairmetrics} R\npackage offers a user-friendly framework for rigorously evaluating numerous\ngroup-based fairness criteria, including metrics based on independence (e.g.,\nstatistical parity), separation (e.g., equalized odds), and sufficiency (e.g.,\npredictive parity). Group-based fairness criteria assess whether a model is\nequally accurate or well-calibrated across a set of predefined groups so that\nappropriate bias mitigation strategies can be implemented. {fairmetrics}\nprovides both point and interval estimates for multiple metrics through a\nconvenient wrapper function and includes an example dataset derived from the\nMedical Information Mart for Intensive Care, version II (MIMIC-II) database\n(Goldberger et al., 2000; Raffa, 2016).", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces the {fairmetrics} R package for evaluating group-based fairness in ML models, offering multiple metrics and interval estimates to address bias.", "motivation": "To ensure ML models do not perpetuate structural inequalities by systematically biasing outcomes for protected groups.", "method": "The {fairmetrics} package provides a user-friendly framework for evaluating fairness metrics like independence, separation, and sufficiency, using point and interval estimates.", "result": "The package includes an example dataset (MIMIC-II) and tools for assessing fairness across predefined groups.", "conclusion": "{fairmetrics} aids in identifying and mitigating bias in ML models by rigorously evaluating fairness criteria."}}

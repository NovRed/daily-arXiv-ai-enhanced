### [1] [Fine-Grained Preference Optimization Improves Spatial Reasoning in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21656)
*Yifan Shen,Yuanzhe Liu,Jingyuan Zhu,Xu Cao,Xiaofeng Zhang,Yixiao He,Wenming Ye,James Matthew Rehg,Ismini Lourentzou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpatialReasoner-R1 improves fine-grained spatial reasoning in VLMs using M3CTS for diverse reasoning trajectories and fDPO for segment-specific preference optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with fine-grained spatial reasoning, requiring multi-step logic and precise alignment.

Method: Uses M3CTS for LongCoT reasoning trajectories and fDPO for segment-specific preference optimization with a spatial reward mechanism.

Result: fDPO improves spatial quality by 4.1% and quantity by 9.0%. SpatialReasoner-R1 achieves 9.8% higher accuracy on SPATIALRGPT-Bench.

Conclusion: SpatialReasoner-R1 with fDPO sets a new SoTA for spatial reasoning while maintaining general VL task performance.

Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with fine-grained spatial
reasoning, particularly when multi-step logic and precise spatial alignment are
required. In this work, we introduce SpatialReasoner-R1, a vision-language
reasoning model designed to address these limitations. To construct
high-quality supervision for spatial reasoning, we design a Multi-Model Monte
Carlo Tree Search (M3CTS) method that generates diverse, logically consistent
Long Chain-of-Thought (LongCoT) reasoning trajectories. In addition, we propose
fine-grained Direct Preference Optimization (fDPO), which introduces
segment-specific preference granularity for descriptive grounding and logical
reasoning, guided by a spatial reward mechanism that evaluates candidate
responses based on visual consistency, spatial grounding, and logical
coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that fDPO achieves an average
improvement of 4.1% over standard DPO across spatial quality tasks, and a 9.0%
gain in spatial quantity tasks. SpatialReasoner-R1, trained with fDPO, sets a
new SoTA on SPATIALRGPT-Bench, outperforming the strongest baseline by 9.8% in
average accuracy, while maintaining competitive performance on general
vision-language tasks.

### [2] [TanDiT: Tangent-Plane Diffusion Transformer for High-Quality 360° Panorama Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21681)
*Hakan Çapuk,Andrew Bond,Muhammed Burak Kızıl,Emir Göçen,Erkut Erdem,Aykut Erdem*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TanDiT introduces a unified diffusion model for panoramic image generation, addressing distortion and loop-consistency challenges with tangent-plane grids and post-processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image generation models struggle with panoramic images due to geometric distortion and loop-consistency requirements.

Method: TanDiT generates tangent-plane image grids in a single denoising iteration and includes a post-processing step for global coherence.

Result: The method generalizes well, handles complex prompts, and integrates with other models to produce high-quality panoramas.

Conclusion: TanDiT effectively addresses panoramic generation challenges and introduces specialized metrics for evaluation.

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation have led to remarkable improvements in
synthesizing perspective images. However, these models still struggle with
panoramic image generation due to unique challenges, including varying levels
of geometric distortion and the requirement for seamless loop-consistency. To
address these issues while leveraging the strengths of the existing models, we
introduce TanDiT, a method that synthesizes panoramic scenes by generating
grids of tangent-plane images covering the entire 360$^\circ$ view. Unlike
previous methods relying on multiple diffusion branches, TanDiT utilizes a
unified diffusion model trained to produce these tangent-plane images
simultaneously within a single denoising iteration. Furthermore, we propose a
model-agnostic post-processing step specifically designed to enhance global
coherence across the generated panoramas. To accurately assess panoramic image
quality, we also present two specialized metrics, TangentIS and TangentFID, and
provide a comprehensive benchmark comprising captioned panoramic datasets and
standardized evaluation scripts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method generalizes effectively beyond its training data, robustly interprets
detailed and complex text prompts, and seamlessly integrates with various
generative models to yield high-quality, diverse panoramic images.

### [3] [FOCUS: Internal MLLM Representations for Efficient Fine-Grained Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21710)
*Liangyu Zhong,Fabio Rosenthal,Joachim Sicking,Fabian Hüger,Thorsten Bagdonat,Hanno Gottschalk,Leo Schwinn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOCUS is a training-free visual cropping method for fine-grained VQA, leveraging MLLM-internal representations to efficiently identify relevant image regions, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and compute efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations of current visual cropping techniques in fine-grained VQA, such as task-specific fine-tuning, inefficiency, and incompatibility with efficient attention.

Method: FOCUS uses MLLM-internal representations to guide region search: identifying target objects, computing relevance maps, ranking regions, and performing VQA on top-ranked regions.

Result: FOCUS achieves strong performance on four fine-grained VQA datasets, outperforming three baselines in accuracy and efficiency, and matches ZoomEye with 3-6.5x less compute.

Conclusion: FOCUS provides an efficient, training-free solution for fine-grained VQA, leveraging MLLMs to improve accuracy and reduce computational cost.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer strong perception and
reasoning capabilities for image-text input, Visual Question Answering (VQA)
focusing on small image details still remains a challenge. Although visual
cropping techniques seem promising, recent approaches have several limitations:
the need for task-specific fine-tuning, low efficiency due to uninformed
exhaustive search, or incompatibility with efficient attention implementations.
We address these shortcomings by proposing a training-free visual cropping
method, dubbed FOCUS, that leverages MLLM-internal representations to guide the
search for the most relevant image region. This is accomplished in four steps:
first, we identify the target object(s) in the VQA prompt; second, we compute
an object relevance map using the key-value (KV) cache; third, we propose and
rank relevant image regions based on the map; and finally, we perform the
fine-grained VQA task using the top-ranked region. As a result of this informed
search strategy, FOCUS achieves strong performance across four fine-grained VQA
datasets and two types of MLLMs. It outperforms three popular visual cropping
methods in both accuracy and efficiency, and matches the best-performing
baseline, ZoomEye, while requiring 3 - 6.5 x less compute.

### [4] [CAST: Cross-Attentive Spatio-Temporal feature fusion for Deepfake detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21711)
*Aryan Thakre,Omkar Nagwekar,Vedang Talekar,Aparna Santra Biswas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified CAST model using cross-attention to fuse spatial and temporal features for deepfake detection, achieving high accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfakes threaten digital media authenticity, requiring advanced detection techniques to identify subtle, time-dependent manipulations.

Method: The CAST model leverages cross-attention to dynamically integrate spatial (CNN) and temporal (Transformer) features, improving artifact detection like flickering eyes or warped lips.

Result: The model achieves 99.49% AUC and 97.57% accuracy in intra-dataset tests and 93.31% AUC in cross-dataset evaluations.

Conclusion: Cross-attention-based feature fusion enhances deepfake detection robustness, as demonstrated by superior performance across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Deepfakes have emerged as a significant threat to digital media authenticity,
increasing the need for advanced detection techniques that can identify subtle
and time-dependent manipulations. CNNs are effective at capturing spatial
artifacts, and Transformers excel at modeling temporal inconsistencies.
However, many existing CNN-Transformer models process spatial and temporal
features independently. In particular, attention-based methods often use
separate attention mechanisms for spatial and temporal features and combine
them using naive approaches like averaging, addition, or concatenation, which
limits the depth of spatio-temporal interaction. To address this challenge, we
propose a unified CAST model that leverages cross-attention to effectively fuse
spatial and temporal features in a more integrated manner. Our approach allows
temporal features to dynamically attend to relevant spatial regions, enhancing
the model's ability to detect fine-grained, time-evolving artifacts such as
flickering eyes or warped lips. This design enables more precise localization
and deeper contextual understanding, leading to improved performance across
diverse and challenging scenarios. We evaluate the performance of our model
using the FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, and DeepfakeDetection datasets in both
intra- and cross-dataset settings to affirm the superiority of our approach.
Our model achieves strong performance with an AUC of 99.49 percent and an
accuracy of 97.57 percent in intra-dataset evaluations. In cross-dataset
testing, it demonstrates impressive generalization by achieving a 93.31 percent
AUC on the unseen DeepfakeDetection dataset. These results highlight the
effectiveness of cross-attention-based feature fusion in enhancing the
robustness of deepfake video detection.

### [5] [Elucidating and Endowing the Diffusion Training Paradigm for General Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21722)
*Xin Lu,Xueyang Fu,Jie Xiao,Zihao Fan,Yurui Zhu,Zheng-Jun Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a diffusion-based training framework for image restoration (IR), addressing limitations of existing methods by integrating diffusion training into general IR networks. It proposes regularization strategies and task-specific adaptors to enhance performance in single-task and multi-task IR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models for IR have complex architectures and iterative processes, limiting practical use. The paper aims to integrate diffusion training into general IR frameworks to improve performance and generalization.

Method: The paper analyzes time-step dependencies, network hierarchies, noise-level relationships, and multi-task correlations to adapt diffusion training to IR. It introduces regularization strategies and an incremental training paradigm with task-specific adaptors.

Result: The proposed framework improves generalization in single-task IR and achieves superior performance in multi-task unified IR. It integrates seamlessly into existing IR architectures.

Conclusion: The diffusion-based training framework enhances IR performance and generalization, offering a practical solution for both single-task and multi-task scenarios.

Abstract: While diffusion models demonstrate strong generative capabilities in image
restoration (IR) tasks, their complex architectures and iterative processes
limit their practical application compared to mainstream reconstruction-based
general ordinary IR networks. Existing approaches primarily focus on optimizing
network architecture and diffusion paths but overlook the integration of the
diffusion training paradigm within general ordinary IR frameworks. To address
these challenges, this paper elucidates key principles for adapting the
diffusion training paradigm to general IR training through systematic analysis
of time-step dependencies, network hierarchies, noise-level relationships, and
multi-restoration task correlations, proposing a new IR framework supported by
diffusion-based training. To enable IR networks to simultaneously restore
images and model generative representations, we introduce a series of
regularization strategies that align diffusion objectives with IR tasks,
improving generalization in single-task scenarios. Furthermore, recognizing
that diffusion-based generation exerts varying influences across different IR
tasks, we develop an incremental training paradigm and task-specific adaptors,
further enhancing performance in multi-task unified IR. Experiments demonstrate
that our method significantly improves the generalization of IR networks in
single-task IR and achieves superior performance in multi-task unified IR.
Notably, the proposed framework can be seamlessly integrated into existing
general IR architectures.

### [6] [Asymmetric Dual Self-Distillation for 3D Self-Supervised Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21724)
*Remco F. Leijenaar,Hamidreza Kasaei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AsymDSD, an Asymmetric Dual Self-Distillation framework, unifies masked modeling and invariance learning for 3D point clouds, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of learning meaningful representations from unstructured 3D point clouds without large labeled datasets, and the limitations of reconstruction-based objectives in capturing high-level semantics.

Method: AsymDSD combines masked modeling and invariance learning through latent space prediction, using an asymmetric setup, masked query attention disabling, multi-mask sampling, and multi-crop adaptation.

Result: Achieves 90.53% accuracy on ScanObjectNN, improving to 93.72% with pretraining on 930k shapes.

Conclusion: AsymDSD outperforms prior methods by unifying masked modeling and invariance learning, demonstrating superior performance in 3D point cloud representation learning.

Abstract: Learning semantically meaningful representations from unstructured 3D point
clouds remains a central challenge in computer vision, especially in the
absence of large-scale labeled datasets. While masked point modeling (MPM) is
widely used in self-supervised 3D learning, its reconstruction-based objective
can limit its ability to capture high-level semantics. We propose AsymDSD, an
Asymmetric Dual Self-Distillation framework that unifies masked modeling and
invariance learning through prediction in the latent space rather than the
input space. AsymDSD builds on a joint embedding architecture and introduces
several key design choices: an efficient asymmetric setup, disabling attention
between masked queries to prevent shape leakage, multi-mask sampling, and a
point cloud adaptation of multi-crop. AsymDSD achieves state-of-the-art results
on ScanObjectNN (90.53%) and further improves to 93.72% when pretrained on 930k
shapes, surpassing prior methods.

### [7] [Exploring Image Generation via Mutually Exclusive Probability Spaces and Local Correlation Hypothesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21731)
*Chenqiu Zhao,Anup Basu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MESP and LCH frameworks to address memorization in generative models, proposing BL-AE and ARVM for improved performance, though highlighting memorization issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of probabilistic generative models where learning global distributions leads to memorization instead of true generative behavior.

Method: Proposes MESP from VAE analysis, introduces BL-AE for binary latent encoding, and ARVM for histogram output. LCH is introduced to emphasize local correlations for generative capability.

Result: ARVM achieves competitive FID scores but reveals memorization. LCH is validated through experiments.

Conclusion: The frameworks MESP and LCH successfully address memorization issues and highlight the importance of local correlations in generative models.

Abstract: We propose two theoretical frameworks, the Mutually Exclusive Probability
Space (MESP) and the Local Correlation Hypothesis (LCH), to explore a potential
limitation in probabilistic generative models; namely that learning global
distributions leads to memorization rather than generative behavior. MESP
emerges from our rethinking of the Variational Autoencoder (VAE). We observe
that latent variable distributions in VAE exhibit overlap, which leads to an
optimization conflict between the reconstruction loss and KL-divergence loss. A
lower bound based on the overlap coefficient is proposed. We refer to this
phenomenon as Mutually Exclusive Probability Spaces. Based on MESP, a Binary
Latent Autoencoder (BL-AE) is proposed to encode images into binary latent
representations. These binary latents are used as the input to our
Autoregressive Random Variable Model (ARVM), a modified autoregressive model
outputting histograms. Our ARVM achieves competitive FID scores, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods on standard datasets. However, such scores reflect
memorization rather than generation. To address this issue, we propose the
Local Correlation Hypothesis (LCH), which posits that generative capability
arising from local correlations among latent variables. Comprehensive
experiments and discussions are conducted to validate our frameworks.

TL;DR: FedNCA is a lightweight FL system for medical image segmentation in LMICs, addressing resource and connectivity challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FL adoption in LMICs is hindered by limited computing resources and unreliable internet, despite its potential for collaborative training without sharing sensitive data.

Method: FedNCA uses the lightweight Med-NCA architecture for training on low-cost edge devices (e.g., smartphones) and minimizes communication costs, with encryption-ready features.

Result: FedNCA enables efficient, lightweight, and secure medical imaging solutions in resource-constrained regions.

Conclusion: FedNCA overcomes infrastructural and security barriers, promoting equitable healthcare advancements in LMICs.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is enabling collaborative model training across
institutions without sharing sensitive patient data. This approach is
particularly valuable in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where access
to trained medical professionals is limited. However, FL adoption in LMICs
faces significant barriers, including limited high-performance computing
resources and unreliable internet connectivity. To address these challenges, we
introduce FedNCA, a novel FL system tailored for medical image segmentation
tasks. FedNCA leverages the lightweight Med-NCA architecture, enabling training
on low-cost edge devices, such as widely available smartphones, while
minimizing communication costs. Additionally, our encryption-ready FedNCA
proves to be suitable for compromised network communication. By overcoming
infrastructural and security challenges, FedNCA paves the way for inclusive,
efficient, lightweight, and encryption-ready medical imaging solutions,
fostering equitable healthcare advancements in resource-constrained regions.

### [9] [ImplicitQA: Going beyond frames towards Implicit Video Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21742)
*Sirnam Swetha,Rohit Gupta,Parth Parag Kulkarni,David G Shatwell,Jeffrey A Chan Santiago,Nyle Siddiqui,Joseph Fioresi,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ImplicitQA, a benchmark for testing implicit reasoning in VideoQA, highlighting the limitations of current systems in handling creative and cinematic content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VideoQA benchmarks focus on explicit visual content, neglecting implicit reasoning required for understanding creative videos like movies and TV shows.

Method: The authors created ImplicitQA, a dataset with 1K QA pairs from 320+ creative video clips, categorized into key reasoning dimensions.

Result: Evaluations show performance degradation in leading VideoQA models, revealing their reliance on surface-level cues and difficulty with implicit reasoning.

Conclusion: ImplicitQA aims to advance research in VideoQA by addressing the gap in implicit reasoning, with the dataset and framework released for community use.

Abstract: Video QA has made significant strides by leveraging multimodal learning to
align visual and textual modalities. However, current benchmarks overwhelmingly
focus on questions answerable through explicit visual content - actions,
objects & events directly observable within individual frames or short clips.
In contrast, creative and cinematic videos - such as movies, TV shows, and
narrative-driven content - employ storytelling techniques that deliberately
omit certain depictions, requiring viewers to infer motives, causality, and
relationships across discontinuous frames. Humans naturally excel at such
implicit reasoning, seamlessly integrating information across time and context
to construct coherent narratives. Current VideoQA systems and benchmarks fail
to capture this essential dimension of human-like understanding. To bridge this
gap, we present ImplicitQA, a novel benchmark specifically designed to test
models on implicit reasoning. It comprises 1K meticulously annotated QA pairs
derived from 320+ high-quality creative video clips, systematically categorized
into key reasoning dimensions: lateral and vertical spatial reasoning, depth
and proximity, viewpoint and visibility, motion and trajectory, causal and
motivational reasoning, social interactions, physical context, and inferred
counting. These annotations are deliberately challenging, crafted by authors
ensuring high-quality. Our extensive evaluations on leading VideoQA models
reveals performance degradation, underscoring their reliance on surface-level
visual cues and highlighting the difficulty of implicit reasoning. Performance
variations across models further illustrate the complexity and diversity of the
challenges presented by ImplicitQA. By releasing both the dataset and our data
collection framework, we aim to stimulate further research and development in
the community. https://huggingface.co/datasets/ucf-crcv/ImplicitQA.

Motivation: Early detection of glaucoma is crucial to prevent irreversible blindness, but traditional methods are invasive and require specialized equipment.

Method: Uses EfficientNet-B0 architecture, sequentially trained and fine-tuned on ACRIMA, ORIGA, and RIM-ONE datasets with minimal preprocessing.

Result: Higher AUC-ROC compared to complex enhancements, strong performance on unseen datasets.

Conclusion: The pipeline is reproducible, scalable, and clinically promising for early glaucoma detection.

Abstract: Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness, but early detection
can significantly improve treatment outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods
are often invasive and require specialized equipment. In this work, we present
a deep learning pipeline using the EfficientNet-B0 architecture for glaucoma
detection from retinal fundus images. Unlike prior studies that rely on single
datasets, we sequentially train and fine-tune our model across ACRIMA, ORIGA,
and RIM-ONE datasets to enhance generalization. Our experiments show that
minimal preprocessing yields higher AUC-ROC compared to more complex
enhancements, and our model demonstrates strong discriminative performance on
unseen datasets. The proposed pipeline offers a reproducible and scalable
approach to early glaucoma detection, supporting its potential clinical
utility.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and advance computer vision techniques for egocentric video understanding, addressing the unique challenges of first-person perspectives.

Method: Evaluated Shotluck Holmes, TAC-SUM, and GPT-4o on egocentric video summarization using a subset of the Ego-Exo4D dataset.

Result: GPT-4o outperformed specialized models, revealing limitations in current approaches for first-person videos.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for further advancements in egocentric video analysis and highlights the potential of prompt fine-tuned general-purpose models.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate various computer vision paradigms - supervised
learning, unsupervised learning, and prompt fine-tuning - by assessing their
ability to understand and interpret egocentric video data. Specifically, we
examine Shotluck Holmes (state-of-the-art supervised learning), TAC-SUM
(state-of-the-art unsupervised learning), and GPT-4o (a prompt fine-tuned
pre-trained model), evaluating their effectiveness in video summarization. Our
results demonstrate that current state-of-the-art models perform less
effectively on first-person videos compared to third-person videos,
highlighting the need for further advancements in the egocentric video domain.
Notably, a prompt fine-tuned general-purpose GPT-4o model outperforms these
specialized models, emphasizing the limitations of existing approaches in
adapting to the unique challenges of first-person perspectives. Although our
evaluation is conducted on a small subset of egocentric videos from the
Ego-Exo4D dataset due to resource constraints, the primary objective of this
research is to provide a comprehensive proof-of-concept analysis aimed at
advancing the application of computer vision techniques to first-person videos.
By exploring novel methodologies and evaluating their potential, we aim to
contribute to the ongoing development of models capable of effectively
processing and interpreting egocentric perspectives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack comprehensive representations of semantic relationships in cataract surgery workflows.

Method: The CAT-SG dataset provides structured annotations of tool-tissue interactions and temporal dependencies. A novel scene graph generation model, CatSGG, is also presented.

Result: CatSGG outperforms current methods in generating structured surgical representations.

Conclusion: The CAT-SG dataset and CatSGG model enhance AI-driven surgical training and decision support, advancing context-aware systems in clinical practice.

Abstract: Understanding the intricate workflows of cataract surgery requires modeling
complex interactions between surgical tools, anatomical structures, and
procedural techniques. Existing datasets primarily address isolated aspects of
surgical analysis, such as tool detection or phase segmentation, but lack
comprehensive representations that capture the semantic relationships between
entities over time. This paper introduces the Cataract Surgery Scene Graph
(CAT-SG) dataset, the first to provide structured annotations of tool-tissue
interactions, procedural variations, and temporal dependencies. By
incorporating detailed semantic relations, CAT-SG offers a holistic view of
surgical workflows, enabling more accurate recognition of surgical phases and
techniques. Additionally, we present a novel scene graph generation model,
CatSGG, which outperforms current methods in generating structured surgical
representations. The CAT-SG dataset is designed to enhance AI-driven surgical
training, real-time decision support, and workflow analysis, paving the way for
more intelligent, context-aware systems in clinical practice.

Conclusion: The method enables precise segmentation with minimal manual annotations, advancing automated historical map analysis.

Abstract: As rich sources of history, maps provide crucial insights into historical
changes, yet their diverse visual representations and limited annotated data
pose significant challenges for automated processing. We propose a simple yet
effective approach for few-shot segmentation of historical maps, leveraging the
rich semantic embeddings of large vision foundation models combined with
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on
the Siegfried benchmark dataset in vineyard and railway segmentation, achieving
+5% and +13% relative improvements in mIoU in 10-shot scenarios and around +20%
in the more challenging 5-shot setting. Additionally, it demonstrates strong
performance on the ICDAR 2021 competition dataset, attaining a mean PQ of 67.3%
for building block segmentation, despite not being optimized for this
shape-sensitive metric, underscoring its generalizability. Notably, our
approach maintains high performance even in extremely low-data regimes (10- &
5-shot), while requiring only 689k trainable parameters - just 0.21% of the
total model size. Our approach enables precise segmentation of diverse
historical maps while drastically reducing the need for manual annotations,
advancing automated processing and analysis in the field. Our implementation is

Method: TaleForge uses three modules: Story Generation (LLMs create narratives from prompts), Personalized Image Generation (embedding user faces/outfits into illustrations), and Background Generation (scene backdrops with personalized characters).

Result: A user study showed increased engagement and ownership when users appeared as protagonists. Participants liked real-time previews but wanted finer narrative editing tools.

Conclusion: TaleForge advances multimodal storytelling by aligning personalized text and imagery, creating immersive, user-centric experiences.

Abstract: Storytelling is a deeply personal and creative process, yet existing methods
often treat users as passive consumers, offering generic plots with limited
personalization. This undermines engagement and immersion, especially where
individual style or appearance is crucial. We introduce TaleForge, a
personalized story-generation system that integrates large language models
(LLMs) and text-to-image diffusion to embed users' facial images within both
narratives and illustrations. TaleForge features three interconnected modules:
Story Generation, where LLMs create narratives and character descriptions from
user prompts; Personalized Image Generation, merging users' faces and outfit
choices into character illustrations; and Background Generation, creating scene
backdrops that incorporate personalized characters. A user study demonstrated
heightened engagement and ownership when individuals appeared as protagonists.
Participants praised the system's real-time previews and intuitive controls,
though they requested finer narrative editing tools. TaleForge advances
multimodal storytelling by aligning personalized text and imagery to create
immersive, user-centric experiences.

Motivation: Inpainting in medical imaging, like polyps, requires high accuracy to avoid diagnostic errors. Current models lack reliability without expert annotations.

Method: PrefPaint incorporates human feedback directly into Stable Diffusion Inpainting training, using a web interface for seamless feedback and fine-tuning.

Result: PrefPaint reduces visual inconsistencies and enhances image realism, especially in medical polyps imaging, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: PrefPaint offers a reliable, user-friendly solution for medical inpainting, leveraging human feedback for improved accuracy.

Abstract: Inpainting, the process of filling missing or corrupted image parts, has
broad applications, including medical imaging. However, in specialized fields
like medical polyps imaging, where accuracy and reliability are critical,
inpainting models can generate inaccurate images, leading to significant errors
in medical diagnosis and treatment. To ensure reliability, medical images
should be annotated by experts like oncologists for effective model training.
We propose PrefPaint, an approach that incorporates human feedback into the
training process of Stable Diffusion Inpainting, bypassing the need for
computationally expensive reward models. In addition, we develop a web-based
interface streamlines training, fine-tuning, and inference. This interactive
interface provides a smooth and intuitive user experience, making it easier to
offer feedback and manage the fine-tuning process. User study on various
domains shows that PrefPaint outperforms existing methods, reducing visual
inconsistencies and improving image rendering, particularly in medical
contexts, where our model generates more realistic polyps images.

*Xiaoqi Wang,Clint Sebastian,Wenbin He,Liu Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProSAM improves visual reference segmentation by using a variational prompt encoder to avoid unstable prompt regions, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SAM-based methods for visual reference segmentation generate unstable prompts at object boundaries due to suboptimal prompt encoders.

Method: ProSAM introduces a variational prompt encoder to predict multivariate prompt distributions, avoiding unstable regions.

Result: ProSAM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on Pascal-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets.

Conclusion: ProSAM provides a more robust solution for visual reference segmentation by addressing prompt instability.

Abstract: The recent advancements in large foundation models have driven the success of
open-set image segmentation, a task focused on segmenting objects beyond
predefined categories. Among various prompt types (such as points, boxes,
texts, and visual references), visual reference segmentation stands out for its
unique flexibility and strong zero-shot capabilities. Recently, several
SAM-based methods have made notable progress in this task by automatically
generating prompts to guide SAM. However, these methods often generate prompts
at object boundaries due to suboptimal prompt encoder, which results in
instability and reduced robustness. In this work, we introduce ProSAM, a simple
but effective method to address the stability challenges we identified in
existing SAM-based visual reference segmentation approaches. By learning a
variational prompt encoder to predict multivariate prompt distributions, ProSAM
avoids generating prompts that lie in unstable regions, overcoming the
instability caused by less robust prompts. Our approach consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods on the Pascal-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets,
providing a more robust solution for visual reference segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models struggle with spatial relationships and affordance reasoning, making it difficult to create functional and visually coherent escape room puzzles.

Method: A hierarchical multi-agent framework decomposes the task into stages: functional design, symbolic scene graph reasoning, layout synthesis, and local image editing, with iterative feedback for collaboration.

Result: Agent collaboration enhances output quality in solvability, shortcut avoidance, and affordance clarity while preserving visual quality.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the limitations of base models, producing better escape room puzzle images.

Abstract: We challenge text-to-image models with generating escape room puzzle images
that are visually appealing, logically solid, and intellectually stimulating.
While base image models struggle with spatial relationships and affordance
reasoning, we propose a hierarchical multi-agent framework that decomposes this
task into structured stages: functional design, symbolic scene graph reasoning,
layout synthesis, and local image editing. Specialized agents collaborate
through iterative feedback to ensure the scene is visually coherent and
functionally solvable. Experiments show that agent collaboration improves
output quality in terms of solvability, shortcut avoidance, and affordance
clarity, while maintaining visual quality.

*Yuxiang Ge,Jionghao Cheng,Ruiquan Ge,Zhaojie Fang,Gangyong Jia,Xiang Wan,Nannan Li,Ahmed Elazab,Changmiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel EEG encoder with a dual self-attention mechanism to reconstruct 3D objects from EEG data, addressing noise and dataset scarcity challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current EEG-to-image methods ignore 3D reconstruction, despite the brain's inherent 3D processing. This limits BCI applications.

Method: A hybrid training strategy (cross-attention, contrastive, self-supervised learning) and Variational Score Distillation with stable diffusion are used.

Result: Successful generation of 3D objects with content and structure similar to EEG data.

Conclusion: The approach advances EEG-based 3D reconstruction, enhancing BCI potential.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D visual stimuli from Electroencephalography (EEG) data holds
significant potential for applications in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and
aiding individuals with communication disorders. Traditionally, efforts have
focused on converting brain activity into 2D images, neglecting the translation
of EEG data into 3D objects. This limitation is noteworthy, as the human brain
inherently processes three-dimensional spatial information regardless of
whether observing 2D images or the real world. The neural activities captured
by EEG contain rich spatial information that is inevitably lost when
reconstructing only 2D images, thus limiting its practical applications in BCI.
The transition from EEG data to 3D object reconstruction faces considerable
obstacles. These include the presence of extensive noise within EEG signals and
a scarcity of datasets that include both EEG and 3D information, which
complicates the extraction process of 3D visual data. Addressing this
challenging task, we propose an innovative EEG encoder architecture that
integrates a dual self-attention mechanism. We use a hybrid training strategy
to train the EEG Encoder, which includes cross-attention, contrastive learning,
and self-supervised learning techniques. Additionally, by employing stable
diffusion as a prior distribution and utilizing Variational Score Distillation
to train a neural radiation field, we successfully generate 3D objects with
similar content and structure from EEG data.

*Haofeng Wang,Fangtao Zhou,Qi Zhang,Zeyuan Chen,Enci Zhang,Zhao Wang,Xiaofeng Huang,Siwei Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a joint compression framework for RGB-IR image pairs using a Channel-wise Cross-modality Entropy Model (CCEM) to reduce storage and transmission costs, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient compression of RGB-IR image pairs is needed to reduce the doubled storage and transmission costs as modalities increase.

Method: Introduces CCEM with Low-frequency Context Extraction and Fusion Blocks (LCEB and LFCB) to leverage cross-modality priors for accurate entropy modeling.

Result: Achieves 23.1% bit rate saving on LLVIP dataset compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively compresses RGB-IR pairs by utilizing cross-modality information, outperforming existing solutions.

Abstract: RGB-IR(RGB-Infrared) image pairs are frequently applied simultaneously in
various applications like intelligent surveillance. However, as the number of
modalities increases, the required data storage and transmission costs also
double. Therefore, efficient RGB-IR data compression is essential. This work
proposes a joint compression framework for RGB-IR image pair. Specifically, to
fully utilize cross-modality prior information for accurate context probability
modeling within and between modalities, we propose a Channel-wise
Cross-modality Entropy Model (CCEM). Among CCEM, a Low-frequency Context
Extraction Block (LCEB) and a Low-frequency Context Fusion Block (LCFB) are
designed for extracting and aggregating the global low-frequency information
from both modalities, which assist the model in predicting entropy parameters
more accurately. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms
existing RGB-IR image pair and single-modality compression methods on LLVIP and
KAIST datasets. For instance, the proposed framework achieves a 23.1% bit rate
saving on LLVIP dataset compared to the state-of-the-art RGB-IR image codec
presented at CVPR 2022.

*Jiho Choi,Sang Jun Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised learning method for remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) estimation using video masked autoencoders to capture periodic signals from facial videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve rPPG estimation by learning general representations of periodic signals from unlabeled facial videos, addressing challenges like subtle skin tone changes and signal periodicity.

Method: Uses video masked autoencoders with frame masking and physiological bandlimit constraints to capture quasi-periodic signals during pre-training. The encoder is then transferred to rPPG tasks.

Result: Significant performance improvements, especially in cross-dataset evaluations on PURE, UBFC-rPPG, MMPD, and V4V datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively learns periodic signals for rPPG, demonstrating robustness and generalizability across datasets.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method that learns a general representation of
periodic signals from unlabeled facial videos by capturing subtle changes in
skin tone over time. The proposed framework employs the video masked
autoencoder to learn a high-dimensional spatio-temporal representation of the
facial region through self-supervised learning. Capturing quasi-periodic
signals in the video is crucial for remote photoplethysmography (rPPG)
estimation. To account for signal periodicity, we apply frame masking in terms
of video sampling, which allows the model to capture resampled quasi-periodic
signals during the pre-training stage. Moreover, the framework incorporates
physiological bandlimit constraints, leveraging the property that physiological
signals are sparse within their frequency bandwidth to provide pulse cues to
the model. The pre-trained encoder is then transferred to the rPPG task, where
it is used to extract physiological signals from facial videos. We evaluate the
proposed method through extensive experiments on the PURE, UBFC-rPPG, MMPD, and
V4V datasets. Our results demonstrate significant performance improvements,
particularly in challenging cross-dataset evaluations. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPADE is a foundation model integrating histopathology and spatial transcriptomics for improved pathology tasks, outperforming baselines in few-shot learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in integrating whole-slide images with spatial transcriptomics for capturing molecular heterogeneity.

Method: Uses a mixture-of-data experts technique with contrastive learning on co-registered WSI patches and gene expression profiles.

Result: Demonstrates superior few-shot performance on 14 downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Integrating morphological and molecular data enhances pathology model performance.

Abstract: The rapid growth of digital pathology and advances in self-supervised deep
learning have enabled the development of foundational models for various
pathology tasks across diverse diseases. While multimodal approaches
integrating diverse data sources have emerged, a critical gap remains in the
comprehensive integration of whole-slide images (WSIs) with spatial
transcriptomics (ST), which is crucial for capturing critical molecular
heterogeneity beyond standard hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining. We introduce
SPADE, a foundation model that integrates histopathology with ST data to guide
image representation learning within a unified framework, in effect creating an
ST-informed latent space. SPADE leverages a mixture-of-data experts technique,
where experts, created via two-stage feature-space clustering, use contrastive
learning to learn representations of co-registered WSI patches and gene
expression profiles. Pre-trained on the comprehensive HEST-1k dataset, SPADE is
evaluated on 14 downstream tasks, demonstrating significantly superior few-shot
performance compared to baseline models, highlighting the benefits of
integrating morphological and molecular information into one latent space.

*Yangyu Huang,Hao Yang,Chong Li,Jongyoo Kim,Fangyun Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses error-bias in face alignment by proposing ADL and AAM methods, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the overlooked issue of error-bias in facial landmark distributions, which affects CNN convergence.

Method: Introduces Anisotropic Direction Loss (ADL) and Anisotropic Attention Module (AAM) for coordinate and heatmap regression, respectively.

Result: ADNet, integrating ADL and AAM, achieves top performance on 300W, WFLW, and COFW datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively leverage error-bias for improved face alignment, demonstrating robustness and effectiveness.

Abstract: The recent progress of CNN has dramatically improved face alignment
performance. However, few works have paid attention to the error-bias with
respect to error distribution of facial landmarks. In this paper, we
investigate the error-bias issue in face alignment, where the distributions of
landmark errors tend to spread along the tangent line to landmark curves. This
error-bias is not trivial since it is closely connected to the ambiguous
landmark labeling task. Inspired by this observation, we seek a way to leverage
the error-bias property for better convergence of CNN model. To this end, we
propose anisotropic direction loss (ADL) and anisotropic attention module (AAM)
for coordinate and heatmap regression, respectively. ADL imposes strong binding
force in normal direction for each landmark point on facial boundaries. On the
other hand, AAM is an attention module which can get anisotropic attention mask
focusing on the region of point and its local edge connected by adjacent
points, it has a stronger response in tangent than in normal, which means
relaxed constraints in the tangent. These two methods work in a complementary
manner to learn both facial structures and texture details. Finally, we
integrate them into an optimized end-to-end training pipeline named ADNet. Our
ADNet achieves state-of-the-art results on 300W, WFLW and COFW datasets, which
demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness.

*Boyuan Sun,Jiaxing Zhao,Xihan Wei,Qibin Hou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLaVA-Scissor is a training-free token compression method for video multimodal LLMs, using Semantic Connected Components (SCC) to ensure full semantic coverage and reduce redundancy, outperforming other methods in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing token compression methods based on attention scores often miss semantic regions and cause redundancy, prompting the need for a more effective approach.

Method: Proposes a two-step spatio-temporal token compression strategy using SCC to assign tokens to distinct semantic regions, ensuring non-overlapping semantic coverage.

Result: LLaVA-Scissor outperforms other methods in video understanding benchmarks, especially at low token retention ratios.

Conclusion: The SCC-based approach effectively compresses tokens while maintaining semantic integrity, enhancing performance in video multimodal tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we present LLaVA-Scissor, a training-free token compression
strategy designed for video multimodal large language models. Previous methods
mostly attempt to compress tokens based on attention scores, but fail to
effectively capture all semantic regions and often lead to token redundancy.
Differently, we propose to leverage the Semantic Connected Components (SCC)
approach that assigns tokens to distinct semantic regions within the token set,
ensuring comprehensive semantic coverage. The outcome is a two-step
spatio-temporal token compression strategy that utilizes SCC in both spatial
and temporal domains. This strategy can effectively compress tokens by
representing the entire video with a set of non-overlapping semantic tokens. We
conduct extensive evaluations of the token compression capabilities of
LLaVA-Scissor across diverse video understanding benchmarks, including video
question answering, long video understanding, and comprehensive multi-choices
benchmarks. Experimental results show that the proposed LLaVA-Scissor
outperforms other token compression methods, achieving superior performance in
various video understanding benchmarks, particularly at low token retention
ratios. Project page: https://github.com/HumanMLLM/LLaVA-Scissor.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for enriching sparse facial landmarks to dense ones using existing datasets, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy without extra cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense facial landmarks are needed in applications like cosmetic medicine, but most works focus on sparse alignment.

Method: Uses weakly-supervised learning to refine sparse landmarks and adapt to dense ones, with custom operators.

Result: Achieves top accuracy on dense 300W, sparse 300W, and WFLW testsets.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances landmark density and maintains high accuracy across datasets.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed significant growth of face alignment. Though
dense facial landmark is highly demanded in various scenarios, e.g., cosmetic
medicine and facial beautification, most works only consider sparse face
alignment. To address this problem, we present a framework that can enrich
landmark density by existing sparse landmark datasets, e.g., 300W with 68
points and WFLW with 98 points. Firstly, we observe that the local patches
along each semantic contour are highly similar in appearance. Then, we propose
a weakly-supervised idea of learning the refinement ability on original sparse
landmarks and adapting this ability to enriched dense landmarks. Meanwhile,
several operators are devised and organized together to implement the idea.
Finally, the trained model is applied as a plug-and-play module to the existing
face alignment networks. To evaluate our method, we manually label the dense
landmarks on 300W testset. Our method yields state-of-the-art accuracy not only
in newly-constructed dense 300W testset but also in the original sparse 300W
and WFLW testsets without additional cost.

TL;DR: A novel LVLM framework for remote sensing (RS) addresses domain gaps by using Semantic-augmented Multi-level Alignment and Semantic-aware Expert Modeling, improving RS scene understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLMs struggle with RS imagery due to domain differences in visuals, scales, and semantics, limiting their direct application.

Method: Proposes two components: 1) Semantic-augmented Multi-level Alignment for enriching visual features with multi-level semantics, and 2) Semantic-aware Expert Modeling for hierarchical semantic processing.

Result: The framework shows consistent improvements in RS tasks like scene classification and VQA, bridging the gap between general LVLMs and RS needs.

Conclusion: The tailored LVLM framework effectively enhances RS understanding by addressing domain-specific challenges through semantic enrichment and hierarchical modeling.

Abstract: Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong performance across
various vision-language tasks in natural image domains. However, their
application to remote sensing (RS) remains underexplored due to significant
domain differences in visual appearances, object scales, and semantics. These
discrepancies hider the effective understanding of RS scenes, which contain
rich, multi-level semantic information spanning from coarse-to-fine levels.
Hence, it limits the direct adaptation of existing LVLMs to RS imagery. To
address this gap, we propose a novel LVLM framework tailored for RS
understanding, incorporating two core components: Semantic-augmented
Multi-level Alignment and Semantic-aware Expert Modeling. First, to align
multi-level visual features, we introduce the retrieval-based Semantic
Augmentation Module which enriches the visual features with relevant semantics
across fine-to-coarse levels (e.g., object- and scene-level information). It is
designed to retrieve relevant semantic cues from a RS semantic knowledge
database, followed by aggregation of semantic cues with user query and
multi-level visual features, resulting in semantically enriched representation
across multiple levels. Second, for Semantic-aware Expert Modeling, we design
semantic experts, where each expert is responsible for processing semantic
representation at different levels separately. This enables hierarchical
semantic understanding from coarse to fine levels. Evaluations across multiple
RS tasks-including scene classification and VQA, etc.-demonstrate that the
proposed framework achieves consistent improvements across multiple semantic
levels. This highlights its capability and effectiveness in bridging the gap
between general LVLMs and unique demands of RS-specific vision-language
understanding.

TL;DR: A novel Dual-Perspective United Transformer (DPU-Former) is proposed to integrate convolutional and Transformer features for better segmentation in optical remote sensing images, addressing challenges like feature heterogeneity and model complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models for segmenting ORSIs rely on either convolutional or Transformer features, missing the benefits of combining both due to challenges like heterogeneity and complexity.

Method: DPU-Former uses global-local mixed attention and a Fourier-space merging strategy for efficient feature fusion, along with a gated linear feed-forward network and a specialized decoder.

Result: DPU-Former outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed DPU-Former effectively combines long-range dependencies and spatial details, achieving superior segmentation performance.

Abstract: Automatically segmenting objects from optical remote sensing images (ORSIs)
is an important task. Most existing models are primarily based on either
convolutional or Transformer features, each offering distinct advantages.
Exploiting both advantages is valuable research, but it presents several
challenges, including the heterogeneity between the two types of features, high
complexity, and large parameters of the model. However, these issues are often
overlooked in existing the ORSIs methods, causing sub-optimal segmentation. For
that, we propose a novel Dual-Perspective United Transformer (DPU-Former) with
a unique structure designed to simultaneously integrate long-range dependencies
and spatial details. In particular, we design the global-local mixed attention,
which captures diverse information through two perspectives and introduces a
Fourier-space merging strategy to obviate deviations for efficient fusion.
Furthermore, we present a gated linear feed-forward network to increase the
expressive ability. Additionally, we construct a DPU-Former decoder to
aggregate and strength features at different layers. Consequently, the
DPU-Former model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets.

Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with geologic map understanding due to challenges like cartographic generalization and domain-specific knowledge.

Method: The authors develop GeoMap-Bench for evaluation and GeoMap-Agent with modules for hierarchical extraction, domain knowledge injection, and enhanced question answering.

Result: GeoMap-Agent scores 0.811 on GeoMap-Bench, outperforming GPT-4o (0.369).

Conclusion: The work advances AI applications in geology, improving efficiency and accuracy in geological investigations.

Abstract: Geologic map, as a fundamental diagram in geology science, provides critical
insights into the structure and composition of Earth's subsurface and surface.
These maps are indispensable in various fields, including disaster detection,
resource exploration, and civil engineering. Despite their significance,
current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often fall short in geologic
map understanding. This gap is primarily due to the challenging nature of
cartographic generalization, which involves handling high-resolution map,
managing multiple associated components, and requiring domain-specific
knowledge. To quantify this gap, we construct GeoMap-Bench, the first-ever
benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in geologic map understanding, which assesses
the full-scale abilities in extracting, referring, grounding, reasoning, and
analyzing. To bridge this gap, we introduce GeoMap-Agent, the inaugural agent
designed for geologic map understanding, which features three modules:
Hierarchical Information Extraction (HIE), Domain Knowledge Injection (DKI),
and Prompt-enhanced Question Answering (PEQA). Inspired by the
interdisciplinary collaboration among human scientists, an AI expert group acts
as consultants, utilizing a diverse tool pool to comprehensively analyze

TL;DR: The paper introduces Grounding-Aware Token Pruning (GAP) to address performance degradation in MLLMs caused by token pruning, recovering 90% of original accuracy without extra costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Token pruning in MLLMs weakens visual grounding performance, causing significant accuracy drops. The misalignment of position IDs post-pruning is identified as the main issue.

Method: Proposes GAP, a simple adjustment to position IDs after pruning, requiring no additional training or resources.

Result: GAP recovers REC accuracy to 51.42% (90% of original performance) and improves performance across models like Shikra and LLaVA.

Conclusion: GAP effectively mitigates the negative impact of token pruning on MLLMs, enhancing grounding performance without added overhead.

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
performance in visual grounding, establishing themselves as a general interface
for various vision-language applications. This progress has driven the
development of token pruning methods to mitigate the high computational costs
associated with processing numerous visual tokens. However, we observe that
pruning significantly weakens the model's grounding ability, leading to
incorrect predictions and drastic performance degradation. In Referring
Expression Comprehension (REC), for instance, pruning causes the accuracy of
LLaVA on the RefCOCO validation set to drop from 56.14% to 15.34%. Our analysis
identifies misaligned position IDs after pruning as the primary cause of this
degradation, as both the order and value of these IDs are crucial for
maintaining performance in grounding tasks. To address this issue, we propose
Grounding-Aware Token Pruning (GAP), a simple yet effective adjustment to
position IDs that recovers REC accuracy back to 51.42%, which is 90% of the
original performance in the without pruning setting, all while requiring no
additional training, memory, or computational overhead. Applied to models such
as Shikra, MiniGPTv2, and the LLaVA series, our method consistently improves
performance across various token pruning strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inter-rater variability and data collection challenges hinder reliable automated psoriasis severity scoring.

Method: Gradient-based interpretability detects problematic training images, removing spurious correlations. Applied to a ConvNeXT-based model.

Result: Removing 8.2% of flagged images improved AUC-ROC by 5%. Identified 90% of inter-rater disagreements in top 30% of samples.

Conclusion: The method enhances model robustness and reduces reliance on manual annotation review, improving remote assessment reliability.

Abstract: Psoriasis (PsO) severity scoring is important for clinical trials but is
hindered by inter-rater variability and the burden of in person clinical
evaluation. Remote imaging using patient captured mobile photos offers
scalability but introduces challenges, such as variation in lighting,
background, and device quality that are often imperceptible to humans but can
impact model performance. These factors, along with inconsistencies in
dermatologist annotations, reduce the reliability of automated severity
scoring. We propose a framework to automatically flag problematic training
images that introduce spurious correlations which degrade model generalization,
using a gradient based interpretability approach. By tracing the gradients of
misclassified validation images, we detect training samples where model errors
align with inconsistently rated examples or are affected by subtle, nonclinical
artifacts. We apply this method to a ConvNeXT based weakly supervised model
designed to classify PsO severity from phone images. Removing 8.2% of flagged
images improves model AUC-ROC by 5% (85% to 90%) on a held out test set.
Commonly, multiple annotators and an adjudication process ensure annotation
accuracy, which is expensive and time consuming. Our method detects training
images with annotation inconsistencies, potentially removing the need for
manual review. When applied to a subset of training data rated by two
dermatologists, the method identifies over 90% of cases with inter-rater
disagreement by reviewing only the top 30% of samples. This improves automated
scoring for remote assessments, ensuring robustness despite data collection
variability.

environments. Additionally, we explore emerging trends, including the
integration of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and
the role of sensor fusion in end-to-end autonomous driving, highlighting its
potential to enhance system adaptability and robustness. Our work offers
valuable insights into current methods and future directions for multi-sensor
fusion in autonomous driving.

*Adam Goodge,Xun Xu,Bryan Hooi,Wee Siong Ng,Jingyi Liao,Yongyi Su,Xulei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) point cloud objects using 3D vision-language models (VLMs), proposing a novel method called SODA to mitigate synthetic-to-real domain shift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for reliable OOD detection in point clouds due to increasing applications, coupled with the under-explored nature of this problem and the limitations of existing 3D VLM pre-training datasets.

Method: Proposes SODA, a neighborhood-based score propagation scheme, to improve OOD detection without additional training.

Result: SODA achieves state-of-the-art performance across datasets and problem settings.

Conclusion: SODA effectively addresses synthetic-to-real domain shift in 3D VLMs, enhancing OOD detection for point clouds.

Abstract: As point cloud data increases in prevalence in a variety of applications, the
ability to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) point cloud objects becomes
critical for ensuring model safety and reliability. However, this problem
remains under-explored in existing research. Inspired by success in the image
domain, we propose to exploit advances in 3D vision-language models (3D VLMs)
for OOD detection in point cloud objects. However, a major challenge is that
point cloud datasets used to pre-train 3D VLMs are drastically smaller in size
and object diversity than their image-based counterparts. Critically, they
often contain exclusively computer-designed synthetic objects. This leads to a
substantial domain shift when the model is transferred to practical tasks
involving real objects scanned from the physical environment. In this paper,
our empirical experiments show that synthetic-to-real domain shift
significantly degrades the alignment of point cloud with their associated text
embeddings in the 3D VLM latent space, hindering downstream performance. To
address this, we propose a novel methodology called SODA which improves the
detection of OOD point clouds through a neighborhood-based score propagation
scheme. SODA is inference-based, requires no additional model training, and
achieves state-of-the-art performance over existing approaches across datasets
and problem settings.

*Fangling Jiang,Qi Li,Weining Wang,Gang Wang,Bing Liu,Zhenan Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A reinforcement fine-tuning-based face anti-spoofing method using multimodal large language models to improve generalization and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address poor generalization and limited interpretability in existing face anti-spoofing methods by avoiding memorization of data patterns.

Method: Uses verifiable class and reasoning consistent rewards with GRPO-based optimization to guide reasoning policies. Iterative trial-and-error learning retains high-reward trajectories.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain generalization, handling diverse unknown attack types and providing interpretable decisions without textual annotations.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses cross-domain face anti-spoofing with superior generalization and interpretability.

Abstract: Recently the emergence of novel presentation attacks has drawn increasing
attention to face anti-spoofing. However, existing methods tend to memorize
data patterns from the training set, resulting in poor generalization to
unknown attack types across different scenarios and limited interpretability.
To address these challenges, this paper presents a reinforcement
fine-tuning-based face anti-spoofing method that stimulates the capabilities of
multimodal large language models to think and learn how to solve the
anti-spoofing task itself, rather than relying on the memorization of
authenticity patterns. We design verifiable class consistent reward and
reasoning consistent reward, and employ a GRPO-based optimization strategy to
guide the model in exploring reasoning policies from multiple perspectives to
maximize expected rewards. As a result, through iterative trial-and-error
learning while retaining only high-reward trajectories, the model distills
highly generalizable decision-making rules from the extensive solution space to
effectively address cross-domain face anti-spoofing tasks. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
cross-domain generalization performance. It generalizes well to diverse unknown
attack types in unseen target domains while providing interpretable reasoning
for its authenticity decisions without requiring labor-intensive textual
annotations for training.

### [34] [Visual Content Detection in Educational Videos with Transfer Learning and Dataset Enrichment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21903)
*Dipayan Biswas,Shishir Shah,Jaspal Subhlok*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a transfer learning approach using YOLO for detecting visual elements in lecture videos, addressing challenges like lack of standard structure and clear boundaries. It includes a benchmark dataset and source code for future research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual elements in lecture videos are crucial for comprehension but underutilized due to detection challenges like non-standard structures and unclear boundaries.

Method: Evaluated state-of-the-art object detection models, optimized YOLO with transfer learning, and used semi-supervised auto-labeling on benchmark datasets.

Result: YOLO performed best; the approach improved detection accuracy and provided a general solution for lecture video object detection.

Conclusion: The study offers a practical solution and resources (dataset and code) to advance research in lecture video content analysis.

Abstract: Video is transforming education with online courses and recorded lectures
supplementing and replacing classroom teaching. Recent research has focused on
enhancing information retrieval for video lectures with advanced navigation,
searchability, summarization, as well as question answering chatbots. Visual
elements like tables, charts, and illustrations are central to comprehension,
retention, and data presentation in lecture videos, yet their full potential
for improving access to video content remains underutilized. A major factor is
that accurate automatic detection of visual elements in a lecture video is
challenging; reasons include i) most visual elements, such as charts, graphs,
tables, and illustrations, are artificially created and lack any standard
structure, and ii) coherent visual objects may lack clear boundaries and may be
composed of connected text and visual components. Despite advancements in deep
learning based object detection, current models do not yield satisfactory
performance due to the unique nature of visual content in lectures and scarcity
of annotated datasets. This paper reports on a transfer learning approach for
detecting visual elements in lecture video frames. A suite of state of the art
object detection models were evaluated for their performance on lecture video
datasets. YOLO emerged as the most promising model for this task. Subsequently
YOLO was optimized for lecture video object detection with training on multiple
benchmark datasets and deploying a semi-supervised auto labeling strategy.
Results evaluate the success of this approach, also in developing a general
solution to the problem of object detection in lecture videos. Paper
contributions include a publicly released benchmark of annotated lecture video
frames, along with the source code to facilitate future research.

Result: Demonstrates strong performance on FGVC benchmarks with occlusions, showing robustness with limited labeled data.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses FGVC challenges by enhancing feature modeling and leveraging pseudo-labels, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Fine Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC) remains a challenging task in
computer vision due to subtle inter class differences and fragile feature
representations. Existing methods struggle in fine grained scenarios,
especially when labeled data is scarce. We propose a semi supervised method
combining Mamba based feature modeling, region attention, and Bayesian
uncertainty. Our approach enhances local to global feature modeling while
focusing on key areas during learning. Bayesian inference selects high quality

benchmarks with occlusions, demonstrating robustness when labeled data is
limited. Code is available at https://github.com/wxqnl/RAUM Net.

### [37] [Generating Attribute-Aware Human Motions from Textual Prompt](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21912)
*Xinghan Wang,Kun Xu,Fei Li,Cao Sheng,Jiazhong Yu,Yadong Mu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for text-driven human motion generation that incorporates human attributes (age, gender, weight, height) alongside action semantics, addressing a gap in current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-motion models overlook human attributes, which significantly influence motion patterns. This work aims to integrate these attributes for more realistic motion generation.

Method: Proposes a Structural Causal Model-inspired framework to decouple action semantics from human attributes, enabling text-to-semantics prediction and attribute-controlled generation.

Result: The model generates realistic, attribute-aware motions aligned with text and attribute inputs. A new dataset, HumanAttr, is introduced for evaluation.

Conclusion: The framework effectively bridges the gap in attribute-aware text-to-motion generation, validated by experiments on the HumanAttr dataset.

Abstract: Text-driven human motion generation has recently attracted considerable
attention, allowing models to generate human motions based on textual
descriptions. However, current methods neglect the influence of human
attributes (such as age, gender, weight, and height) which are key factors
shaping human motion patterns. This work represents a pilot exploration for
bridging this gap. We conceptualize each motion as comprising both attribute
information and action semantics, where textual descriptions align exclusively
with action semantics. To achieve this, a new framework inspired by Structural
Causal Models is proposed to decouple action semantics from human attributes,
enabling text-to-semantics prediction and attribute-controlled generation. The
resulting model is capable of generating realistic, attribute-aware motion
aligned with the user's text and attribute inputs. For evaluation, we introduce
HumanAttr, a comprehensive dataset containing attribute annotations for
text-motion pairs, setting the first benchmark for attribute-aware
text-to-motion generation. Extensive experiments on the new dataset validate
our model's effectiveness.

*Nam Quan Nguyen,Xuan Phong Pham,Tuan-Anh Tran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SepFormer is a DETR-style architecture for Table Structure Recognition (TSR) that integrates split-and-merge in one step, improving speed and robustness. It uses a coarse-to-fine approach with transformer decoders and achieves 25.6 FPS with competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated reconstruction of table structures from images is crucial for semantic data extraction, but existing methods lack efficiency and robustness.

Method: SepFormer combines split-and-merge in a single step using separator regression. It employs a coarse-to-fine approach with two transformer decoders, refining single-line segments and predicting line-strip separators.

Result: Achieves 25.6 FPS and comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods on datasets like SciTSR, PubTabNet, WTW, and iFLYTAB.

Conclusion: SepFormer offers a fast and robust solution for TSR, balancing speed and accuracy effectively.

Abstract: The automated reconstruction of the logical arrangement of tables from image
data, termed Table Structure Recognition (TSR), is fundamental for semantic
data extraction. Recently, researchers have explored a wide range of techniques
to tackle this problem, demonstrating significant progress. Each table is a set
of vertical and horizontal separators. Following this realization, we present
SepFormer, which integrates the split-and-merge paradigm into a single step
through separator regression with a DETR-style architecture, improving speed
and robustness. SepFormer is a coarse-to-fine approach that predicts table
separators from single-line to line-strip separators with a stack of two
transformer decoders. In the coarse-grained stage, the model learns to
gradually refine single-line segments through decoder layers with additional
angle loss. At the end of the fine-grained stage, the model predicts line-strip
separators by refining sampled points from each single-line segment. Our
SepFormer can run on average at 25.6 FPS while achieving comparable performance
with state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets, including SciTSR,
PubTabNet, WTW, and iFLYTAB.

TL;DR: ZeroReg3D is a zero-shot registration pipeline for accurate 3D reconstruction from 2D histological sections, addressing challenges like tissue deformation and staining variability without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 2D histological registration methods struggle with preserving 3D spatial relationships due to issues like tissue deformation and imaging inconsistencies, limiting clinical and research utility.

Method: ZeroReg3D combines zero-shot deep learning-based keypoint matching with optimization-based affine and non-rigid registration techniques.

Result: The pipeline effectively handles tissue deformation, sectioning artifacts, staining variability, and inconsistent illumination without requiring retraining.

Conclusion: ZeroReg3D offers a robust solution for 3D histological reconstruction, improving accuracy and generalizability over existing methods.

Abstract: Histological analysis plays a crucial role in understanding tissue structure
and pathology. While recent advancements in registration methods have improved
2D histological analysis, they often struggle to preserve critical 3D spatial
relationships, limiting their utility in both clinical and research
applications. Specifically, constructing accurate 3D models from 2D slices
remains challenging due to tissue deformation, sectioning artifacts,
variability in imaging techniques, and inconsistent illumination. Deep
learning-based registration methods have demonstrated improved performance but
suffer from limited generalizability and require large-scale training data. In
contrast, non-deep-learning approaches offer better generalizability but often
compromise on accuracy. In this study, we introduced ZeroReg3D, a novel
zero-shot registration pipeline tailored for accurate 3D reconstruction from
serial histological sections. By combining zero-shot deep learning-based
keypoint matching with optimization-based affine and non-rigid registration
techniques, ZeroReg3D effectively addresses critical challenges such as tissue
deformation, sectioning artifacts, staining variability, and inconsistent
illumination without requiring retraining or fine-tuning. The code has been

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPAZER is a VLM-driven agent for zero-shot 3DVG, combining 3D and 2D reasoning to outperform state-of-the-art methods without 3D training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing zero-shot 3DVG methods that focus on either spatial (3D) or semantic (2D) understanding, hindering real-world effectiveness.

Method: SPAZER uses a progressive framework: 3D rendering from optimal viewpoints, anchor-guided candidate screening, and 3D-2D joint decision-making.

Result: Achieves 9.0% and 10.9% accuracy gains on ScanRefer and Nr3D benchmarks, outperforming prior zero-shot methods.

Conclusion: SPAZER bridges spatial and semantic reasoning, enabling robust zero-shot 3DVG without 3D-labeled data.

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize target objects within a 3D scene
based on natural language queries. To alleviate the reliance on costly 3D
training data, recent studies have explored zero-shot 3DVG by leveraging the
extensive knowledge and powerful reasoning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs and
VLMs. However, existing paradigms tend to emphasize either spatial (3D-based)
or semantic (2D-based) understanding, limiting their effectiveness in complex
real-world applications. In this work, we introduce SPAZER - a VLM-driven agent
that combines both modalities in a progressive reasoning framework. It first
holistically analyzes the scene and produces a 3D rendering from the optimal
viewpoint. Based on this, anchor-guided candidate screening is conducted to
perform a coarse-level localization of potential objects. Furthermore,
leveraging retrieved relevant 2D camera images, 3D-2D joint decision-making is
efficiently performed to determine the best-matching object. By bridging
spatial and semantic reasoning neural streams, SPAZER achieves robust zero-shot
grounding without training on 3D-labeled data. Extensive experiments on
ScanRefer and Nr3D benchmarks demonstrate that SPAZER significantly outperforms
previous state-of-the-art zero-shot methods, achieving notable gains of 9.0%
and 10.9% in accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses quality assessment and optimization of AI-generated omnidirectional images (AIGODIs) for VR/AR, introducing a database (OHF2024) and two models (BLIP2OIQA, BLIP2OISal) for quality evaluation and saliency prediction, achieving SOTA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-generated omnidirectional images (AIGODIs) are crucial for VR/AR but lack quality assessment research. This work aims to fill this gap by studying quality issues and optimizing AIGODIs.

Method: Established the OHF2024 database with human feedback, then proposed BLIP2OIQA and BLIP2OISal models (based on BLIP-2) for quality evaluation and saliency prediction, followed by an optimization process.

Result: BLIP2OIQA and BLIP2OISal achieved SOTA performance in quality evaluation and saliency prediction, effectively enhancing AIGODI visual quality.

Conclusion: The proposed models and database advance AIGODI quality assessment and optimization, with tools released for future research.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content
(AIGC) techniques, AI generated images (AIGIs) have attracted widespread
attention, among which AI generated omnidirectional images (AIGODIs) hold
significant potential for Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR)
applications. AI generated omnidirectional images exhibit unique quality
issues, however, research on the quality assessment and optimization of
AI-generated omnidirectional images is still lacking. To this end, this work
first studies the quality assessment and distortion-aware saliency prediction
problems for AIGODIs, and further presents a corresponding optimization
process. Specifically, we first establish a comprehensive database to reflect
human feedback for AI-generated omnidirectionals, termed OHF2024, which
includes both subjective quality ratings evaluated from three perspectives and
distortion-aware salient regions. Based on the constructed OHF2024 database, we
propose two models with shared encoders based on the BLIP-2 model to evaluate
the human visual experience and predict distortion-aware saliency for
AI-generated omnidirectional images, which are named as BLIP2OIQA and
BLIP2OISal, respectively. Finally, based on the proposed models, we present an
automatic optimization process that utilizes the predicted visual experience
scores and distortion regions to further enhance the visual quality of an
AI-generated omnidirectional image. Extensive experiments show that our
BLIP2OIQA model and BLIP2OISal model achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in
the human visual experience evaluation task and the distortion-aware saliency
prediction task for AI generated omnidirectional images, and can be effectively
used in the optimization process. The database and codes will be released on

*Naftaly Wambugu,Ruisheng Wang,Bo Guo,Tianshu Yu,Sheng Xu,Mohammed Elhassan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a stacked deep residual network (SDRNet) for accurate semantic segmentation of fine-resolution remotely sensed (FRRS) images, addressing challenges like class disparities and object size variation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate semantic segmentation of FRRS images is hindered by issues like occlusion, class disparities, and object size variation, which current deep learning models struggle to overcome.

Method: The SDRNet framework uses two stacked encoder-decoder networks and dilated residual blocks (DRB) to capture long-range semantics while preserving spatial details.

Result: Experiments on ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets show SDRNet outperforms current deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) in semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: SDRNet effectively addresses segmentation challenges in FRRS images, demonstrating competitive performance against existing DCNNs.

Abstract: Land cover maps generated from semantic segmentation of high-resolution
remotely sensed images have drawn mucon in the photogrammetry and remote
sensing research community. Currently, massive fine-resolution remotely sensed
(FRRS) images acquired by improving sensing and imaging technologies become
available. However, accurate semantic segmentation of such FRRS images is
greatly affected by substantial class disparities, the invisibility of key
ground objects due to occlusion, and object size variation. Despite the
extraordinary potential in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) in image
feature learning and representation, extracting sufficient features from FRRS
images for accurate semantic segmentation is still challenging. These
challenges demand the deep learning models to learn robust features and
generate sufficient feature descriptors. Specifically, learning
multi-contextual features to guarantee adequate coverage of varied object sizes
from the ground scene and harnessing global-local contexts to overcome class
disparities challenge even profound networks. Deeper networks significantly
lose spatial details due to gradual downsampling processes resulting in poor
segmentation results and coarse boundaries. This article presents a stacked
deep residual network (SDRNet) for semantic segmentation from FRRS images. The
proposed framework utilizes two stacked encoder-decoder networks to harness
long-range semantics yet preserve spatial information and dilated residual
blocks (DRB) between each encoder and decoder network to capture sufficient
global dependencies thus improving segmentation performance. Our experimental
results obtained using the ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets demonstrate
that the SDRNet performs effectively and competitively against current DCNNs in
semantic segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Semantic Masked Autoencoder, a method for point cloud understanding that improves semantic relationships by using a prototype-based semantic modeling module and an enhanced masking strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random masking strategies in pre-training methods fail to capture reasonable semantic relationships in point clouds, limiting the performance of self-supervised models.

Method: The proposed Semantic Masked Autoencoder includes a prototype-based semantic modeling module and a component semantic-enhanced masking strategy, along with a prompt-tuning strategy for downstream tasks.

Result: Experiments on ScanObjectNN, ModelNet40, and ShapeNetPart datasets show the method's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses the limitations of random masking and enhances feature representation in point cloud understanding.

Abstract: Point cloud understanding aims to acquire robust and general feature
representations from unlabeled data. Masked point modeling-based methods have
recently shown significant performance across various downstream tasks. These
pre-training methods rely on random masking strategies to establish the
perception of point clouds by restoring corrupted point cloud inputs, which
leads to the failure of capturing reasonable semantic relationships by the
self-supervised models. To address this issue, we propose Semantic Masked
Autoencoder, which comprises two main components: a prototype-based component
semantic modeling module and a component semantic-enhanced masking strategy.
Specifically, in the component semantic modeling module, we design a component
semantic guidance mechanism to direct a set of learnable prototypes in
capturing the semantics of different components from objects. Leveraging these
prototypes, we develop a component semantic-enhanced masking strategy that
addresses the limitations of random masking in effectively covering complete
component structures. Furthermore, we introduce a component semantic-enhanced
prompt-tuning strategy, which further leverages these prototypes to improve the
performance of pre-trained models in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments
conducted on datasets such as ScanObjectNN, ModelNet40, and ShapeNetPart
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed modules.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TASeg is a text-aware RGB-T segmentation framework using LoRA fine-tuning and CLIP embeddings to improve semantic segmentation accuracy in challenging scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RGB-T models lack high-level textual information and struggle with similar visual categories, while SAM's integration with thermal images and text faces modality and efficiency issues.

Method: Proposes TASeg with a Dynamic Feature Fusion Module (DFFM) for merging multi-modal features and CLIP text embeddings for semantic alignment, while freezing SAM's transformer blocks.

Result: Achieves superior performance in challenging scenarios with fewer trainable parameters.

Conclusion: TASeg effectively addresses modality heterogeneity and computational inefficiency, improving semantic segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: Reliable semantic segmentation of open environments is essential for
intelligent systems, yet significant problems remain: 1) Existing RGB-T
semantic segmentation models mainly rely on low-level visual features and lack
high-level textual information, which struggle with accurate segmentation when
categories share similar visual characteristics. 2) While SAM excels in
instance-level segmentation, integrating it with thermal images and text is
hindered by modality heterogeneity and computational inefficiency. To address
these, we propose TASeg, a text-aware RGB-T segmentation framework by using
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning technology to adapt vision foundation
models. Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Feature Fusion Module (DFFM) in the
image encoder, which effectively merges features from multiple visual
modalities while freezing SAM's original transformer blocks. Additionally, we
incorporate CLIP-generated text embeddings in the mask decoder to enable
semantic alignment, which further rectifies the classification error and
improves the semantic understanding accuracy. Experimental results across
diverse datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in
challenging scenarios with fewer trainable parameters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces R1-Track, a fine-tuned version of Qwen2.5-VL for visual tracking using GRPO reinforcement learning, achieving strong performance on GOT-10k while retaining general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional tracking methods lack flexibility and require large datasets. Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) like Qwen2.5-VL show promise but struggle with tracking tasks, prompting the need for adaptation.

Method: Fine-tuned Qwen2.5-VL using GRPO reinforcement learning on a small dataset with a rule-based reward function to create R1-Track.

Result: R1-Track performed well on the GOT-10k benchmark and supports flexible initialization via bounding boxes or text descriptions.

Conclusion: R1-Track demonstrates the potential of adapting MLLMs for tracking tasks, with room for further improvements.

Abstract: Visual single object tracking aims to continuously localize and estimate the
scale of a target in subsequent video frames, given only its initial state in
the first frame. This task has traditionally been framed as a template matching
problem, evolving through major phases including correlation filters,
two-stream networks, and one-stream networks with significant progress
achieved. However, these methods typically require explicit classification and
regression modeling, depend on supervised training with large-scale datasets,
and are limited to the single task of tracking, lacking flexibility. In recent
years, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly.
Open-source models like Qwen2.5-VL, a flagship MLLMs with strong foundational
capabilities, demonstrate excellent performance in grounding tasks. This has
spurred interest in applying such models directly to visual tracking. However,
experiments reveal that Qwen2.5-VL struggles with template matching between
image pairs (i.e., tracking tasks). Inspired by deepseek-R1, we fine-tuned
Qwen2.5-VL using the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) reinforcement
learning method on a small-scale dataset with a rule-based reward function. The
resulting model, R1-Track, achieved notable performance on the GOT-10k
benchmark. R1-Track supports flexible initialization via bounding boxes or text
descriptions while retaining most of the original model's general capabilities.
And we further discuss potential improvements for R1-Track. This rough
technical report summarizes our findings as of May 2025.

*Liudi Yang,Yang Bai,George Eskandar,Fengyi Shen,Mohammad Altillawi,Dong Chen,Soumajit Majumder,Ziyuan Liu,Gitta Kutyniok,Abhinav Valada*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel pipeline for generating long-horizon videos for robotic tasks avoids autoregressive generation by decomposing goals into atomic tasks, interpolating keyframes, and using a semantics-preserving attention module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-video diffusion models struggle with long-horizon robotic tasks due to error accumulation in autoregressive approaches.

Method: 1) Decompose goals into atomic tasks and generate keyframes. 2) Interpolate between keyframes. 3) Use a semantics-preserving attention module and lightweight policy model.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on benchmarks for video quality, consistency, and policy execution.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline effectively addresses limitations of autoregressive methods, improving long-horizon video generation for robotics.

Abstract: We address the problem of generating long-horizon videos for robotic
manipulation tasks. Text-to-video diffusion models have made significant
progress in photorealism, language understanding, and motion generation but
struggle with long-horizon robotic tasks. Recent works use video diffusion
models for high-quality simulation data and predictive rollouts in robot
planning. However, these works predict short sequences of the robot achieving
one task and employ an autoregressive paradigm to extend to the long horizon,
leading to error accumulations in the generated video and in the execution. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a novel pipeline that bypasses the need
for autoregressive generation. We achieve this through a threefold
contribution: 1) we first decompose the high-level goals into smaller atomic
tasks and generate keyframes aligned with these instructions. A second
diffusion model then interpolates between each of the two generated frames,
achieving the long-horizon video. 2) We propose a semantics preserving
attention module to maintain consistency between the keyframes. 3) We design a
lightweight policy model to regress the robot joint states from generated
videos. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two benchmarks in
video quality and consistency while outperforming previous policy models on
long-horizon tasks.

*Sarthak Ketanbhai Modi,Lim Zi Pong,Shourya Kuchhal,Yoshi Cao,Yupeng Cheng,Teo Yon Shin,Lin Shang-Wei,Zhiming Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Exponential Torque Pruning (ETP), a method to improve neural network pruning by using an exponential force scheme, achieving higher compression with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing inefficiencies in existing pruning techniques, which result in dense networks and significant accuracy drops.

Method: Proposes ETP, replacing linear force application with an exponential scheme to better prune distant modules while retaining necessary ones.

Result: ETP achieves higher compression rates than state-of-the-art methods with negligible accuracy drop across various domains.

Conclusion: ETP is a simple yet effective solution for efficient neural network pruning.

Abstract: The rapid growth in complexity and size of modern deep neural networks (DNNs)
has increased challenges related to computational costs and memory usage,
spurring a growing interest in efficient model compression techniques. Previous
state-of-the-art approach proposes using a Torque-inspired regularization which
forces the weights of neural modules around a selected pivot point. Whereas, we
observe that the pruning effect of this approach is far from perfect, as the
post-trained network is still dense and also suffers from high accuracy drop.
In this work, we attribute such ineffectiveness to the default linear force
application scheme, which imposes inappropriate force on neural module of
different distances. To efficiently prune the redundant and distant modules
while retaining those that are close and necessary for effective inference, in
this work, we propose Exponential Torque Pruning (ETP), which adopts an
exponential force application scheme for regularization. Experimental results
on a broad range of domains demonstrate that, though being extremely simple,
ETP manages to achieve significantly higher compression rate than the previous
state-of-the-art pruning strategies with negligible accuracy drop.

*Zhanyi Lu,Yue Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a facial stylization method with semantic preservation and pseudo-paired supervision to improve content fidelity and style quality, outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing artifacts and insufficient fidelity in StyleGAN-based facial stylization by tackling semantic shift during generation.

Method: Integrates semantic preservation constraints and pseudo-paired supervision, with multi-level pseudo-paired dataset creation for supervision.

Result: Achieves high-fidelity, aesthetically pleasing stylization, enabling flexible multimodal and reference-guided stylization.

Conclusion: The method surpasses prior approaches in quality and flexibility without complex designs or extra training.

Abstract: Facial stylization aims to transform facial images into appealing,
high-quality stylized portraits, with the critical challenge of accurately
learning the target style while maintaining content consistency with the
original image. Although previous StyleGAN-based methods have made significant
advancements, the generated results still suffer from artifacts or insufficient
fidelity to the source image. We argue that these issues stem from neglecting
semantic shift of the generator during stylization. Therefore, we propose a
facial stylization method that integrates semantic preservation constraint and
pseudo-paired supervision to enhance the content correspondence and improve the
stylization effect. Additionally, we develop a methodology for creating
multi-level pseudo-paired datasets to implement supervisory constraint.
Furthermore, building upon our facial stylization framework, we achieve more
flexible multimodal and reference-guided stylization without complex network
architecture designs or additional training. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach produces high-fidelity, aesthetically pleasing facial style
transfer that surpasses previous methods.

*Han Wang,Shengyang Li,Jian Yang,Yuxuan Liu,Yixuan Lv,Zhuang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the HOSS ReID dataset and TransOSS method for cross-modal ship re-identification using optical and SAR sensors, addressing limitations of current tracking methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ship tracking methods rely on geostationary or video satellites, which have low resolution, weather susceptibility, short filming durations, and limited coverage.

Method: Proposes the HOSS ReID dataset for evaluating ship tracking with low-Earth orbit constellations and TransOSS, a Vision Transformer-based method for cross-modal re-identification.

Result: The approach ensures shorter re-imaging cycles, all-weather tracking, and modality-invariant feature extraction.

Conclusion: The HOSS ReID dataset and TransOSS method provide a robust solution for ship tracking, overcoming limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Detecting and tracking ground objects using earth observation imagery remains
a significant challenge in the field of remote sensing. Continuous maritime
ship tracking is crucial for applications such as maritime search and rescue,
law enforcement, and shipping analysis. However, most current ship tracking
methods rely on geostationary satellites or video satellites. The former offer
low resolution and are susceptible to weather conditions, while the latter have
short filming durations and limited coverage areas, making them less suitable
for the real-world requirements of ship tracking. To address these limitations,
we present the Hybrid Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Ship
Re-Identification Dataset (HOSS ReID dataset), designed to evaluate the
effectiveness of ship tracking using low-Earth orbit constellations of optical
and SAR sensors. This approach ensures shorter re-imaging cycles and enables
all-weather tracking. HOSS ReID dataset includes images of the same ship
captured over extended periods under diverse conditions, using different
satellites of different modalities at varying times and angles. Furthermore, we
propose a baseline method for cross-modal ship re-identification, TransOSS,
which is built on the Vision Transformer architecture. It refines the patch
embedding structure to better accommodate cross-modal tasks, incorporates
additional embeddings to introduce more reference information, and employs
contrastive learning to pre-train on large-scale optical-SAR image pairs,
ensuring the model's ability to extract modality-invariant features. Our
dataset and baseline method are publicly available on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Chimera-Seg integrates a segmentation backbone with a CLIP-based head to align vision-language features for zero-shot semantic segmentation, improving performance by 0.9-1.2% hIoU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of aligning vision-based features with textual space and bridging the semantic gap between CLIP's global representations and segmentation's local features.

Method: Proposes Chimera-Seg (combining segmentation backbone and CLIP Semantic Head) and Selective Global Distillation (SGD) for knowledge transfer, along with a Semantic Alignment Module (SAM).

Result: Achieves improvements of 0.9% and 1.2% in hIoU on two benchmarks.

Conclusion: Chimera-Seg effectively combines spatial precision with vision-language alignment, enhancing zero-shot semantic segmentation performance.

Abstract: Zero-shot Semantic Segmentation (ZSS) aims to segment both seen and unseen
classes using supervision from only seen classes. Beyond adaptation-based
methods, distillation-based approaches transfer vision-language alignment of
vision-language model, e.g., CLIP, to segmentation models. However, such
knowledge transfer remains challenging due to: (1) the difficulty of aligning
vision-based features with the textual space, which requires combining spatial
precision with vision-language alignment; and (2) the semantic gap between
CLIP's global representations and the local, fine-grained features of
segmentation models. To address challenge (1), we propose Chimera-Seg, which
integrates a segmentation backbone as the body and a CLIP-based semantic head
as the head, like the Chimera in Greek mythology, combining spatial precision
with vision-language alignment. Specifically, Chimera-Seg comprises a trainable
segmentation model and a CLIP Semantic Head (CSH), which maps dense features
into the CLIP-aligned space. The CSH incorporates a frozen subnetwork and fixed
projection layers from the CLIP visual encoder, along with lightweight
trainable components. The partial module from CLIP visual encoder, paired with
the segmentation model, retains segmentation capability while easing the
mapping to CLIP's semantic space. To address challenge (2), we propose
Selective Global Distillation (SGD), which distills knowledge from dense
features exhibiting high similarity to the CLIP CLS token, while gradually
reducing the number of features used for alignment as training progresses.
Besides, we also use a Semantic Alignment Module (SAM) to further align dense
visual features with semantic embeddings extracted from the frozen CLIP text
encoder. Experiments on two benchmarks show improvements of 0.9% and 1.2% in
hIoU.

*Hong Nie,Fuyuan Cao,Lu Chen,Fengxin Chen,Yuefeng Zou,Jun Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FIAG is a 3D talking head synthesis framework that enables efficient identity-specific adaptation with minimal training data, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reconstruction and rendering-based methods require identity-specific models, leading to high computational costs and poor scalability. FIAG aims to address this by enabling rapid adaptation with shared representations.

Method: FIAG uses Global Gaussian Field for multi-identity representation and Universal Motion Field for common motion dynamics, allowing efficient adaptation from canonical to specific identities.

Result: FIAG outperforms state-of-the-art methods in comparative and ablation experiments, demonstrating effectiveness and generalizability.

Conclusion: FIAG provides a scalable and efficient solution for talking head synthesis, reducing the need for extensive identity-specific training.

Abstract: Reconstruction and rendering-based talking head synthesis methods achieve
high-quality results with strong identity preservation but are limited by their
dependence on identity-specific models. Each new identity requires training
from scratch, incurring high computational costs and reduced scalability
compared to generative model-based approaches. To overcome this limitation, we
propose FIAG, a novel 3D speaking head synthesis framework that enables
efficient identity-specific adaptation using only a few training footage. FIAG
incorporates Global Gaussian Field, which supports the representation of
multiple identities within a shared field, and Universal Motion Field, which
captures the common motion dynamics across diverse identities. Benefiting from
the shared facial structure information encoded in the Global Gaussian Field
and the general motion priors learned in the motion field, our framework
enables rapid adaptation from canonical identity representations to specific
ones with minimal data. Extensive comparative and ablation experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches,
validating both the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed
framework. Code is available at: \textit{https://github.com/gme-hong/FIAG}.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework improves LV measurement accuracy in echocardiography by enforcing straight-line constraints and using AMM images, reducing errors and simplifying user interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual LV landmark placement in PLAX view is time-consuming and error-prone, while existing deep learning methods often misalign landmarks, leading to inaccurate measurements.

Method: A landmark detector is trained on AMM images derived from B-mode videos, then transformed back to B-mode space, enforcing straight-line constraints to improve alignment.

Result: The framework outperforms standard B-mode methods in accuracy and generalizes well across network architectures.

Conclusion: The semi-automatic design enhances clinical relevance by simplifying user interaction while maintaining alignment flexibility and accuracy.

Abstract: Linear measurements of the left ventricle (LV) in the Parasternal Long Axis
(PLAX) view using B-mode echocardiography are crucial for cardiac assessment.
These involve placing 4-6 landmarks along a virtual scanline (SL) perpendicular
to the LV axis near the mitral valve tips. Manual placement is time-consuming
and error-prone, while existing deep learning methods often misalign landmarks,
causing inaccurate measurements. We propose a novel framework that enhances LV
measurement accuracy by enforcing straight-line constraints. A landmark
detector is trained on Anatomical M-Mode (AMM) images, computed in real time
from B-mode videos, then transformed back to B-mode space. This approach
addresses misalignment and reduces measurement errors. Experiments show
improved accuracy over standard B-mode methods, and the framework generalizes
well across network architectures. Our semi-automatic design includes a
human-in-the-loop step where the user only places the SL, simplifying
interaction while preserving alignment flexibility and clinical relevance.

TL;DR: MirrorMe is a real-time, controllable framework for audio-driven portrait animation, addressing latency and temporal consistency issues with innovations in identity injection, audio synchronization, and progressive training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in real-time generation of high-fidelity, temporally coherent animations from audio signals, overcoming the limitations of frame-by-frame UNet architectures.

Method: MirrorMe uses the LTX video model with three key innovations: reference identity injection, a causal audio encoder, and progressive training for gesture control.

Result: MirrorMe achieves state-of-the-art performance in fidelity, lip-sync accuracy, and temporal stability on the EMTD Benchmark.

Conclusion: MirrorMe effectively addresses the trade-offs in audio-driven portrait animation, offering real-time, high-quality results.

Abstract: Audio-driven portrait animation, which synthesizes realistic videos from
reference images using audio signals, faces significant challenges in real-time
generation of high-fidelity, temporally coherent animations. While recent
diffusion-based methods improve generation quality by integrating audio into
denoising processes, their reliance on frame-by-frame UNet architectures
introduces prohibitive latency and struggles with temporal consistency. This
paper introduces MirrorMe, a real-time, controllable framework built on the LTX
video model, a diffusion transformer that compresses video spatially and
temporally for efficient latent space denoising. To address LTX's trade-offs
between compression and semantic fidelity, we propose three innovations: 1. A
reference identity injection mechanism via VAE-encoded image concatenation and
self-attention, ensuring identity consistency; 2. A causal audio encoder and
adapter tailored to LTX's temporal structure, enabling precise audio-expression
synchronization; and 3. A progressive training strategy combining close-up
facial training, half-body synthesis with facial masking, and hand pose
integration for enhanced gesture control. Extensive experiments on the EMTD
Benchmark demonstrate MirrorMe's state-of-the-art performance in fidelity,
lip-sync accuracy, and temporal stability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method for estimating relative pose in rolling shutter cameras using line intersections with scanlines, enabling pose estimation without motion modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify rolling shutter structure-from-motion (SfM) by eliminating the need for explicit camera motion models and enabling independent scanline pose computation.

Method: Uses intersections of line projections with scanlines, minimal solvers for generic and specialized cases (e.g., parallel lines, known gravity), and leverages 2D structure estimation from 1D cameras.

Result: Demonstrated feasibility on the Fastec dataset, showing potential for rolling shutter SfM initialization.

Conclusion: The approach is a foundational step for rolling shutter SfM, with publicly available code for further development.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for estimating the relative pose between rolling
shutter cameras using the intersections of line projections with a single
scanline per image. This allows pose estimation without explicitly modeling
camera motion. Alternatively, scanlines can be selected within a single image,
enabling single-view relative pose estimation for scanlines of rolling shutter
cameras. Our approach is designed as a foundational building block for rolling
shutter structure-from-motion (SfM), where no motion model is required, and
each scanline's pose can be computed independently. % We classify minimal
solvers for this problem in both generic and specialized settings, including
cases with parallel lines and known gravity direction, assuming known
intrinsics and no lens distortion. Furthermore, we develop minimal solvers for
the parallel-lines scenario, both with and without gravity priors, by
leveraging connections between this problem and the estimation of 2D structure
from 1D cameras. % Experiments on rolling shutter images from the Fastec
dataset demonstrate the feasibility of our approach for initializing rolling
shutter SfM, highlighting its potential for further development. % The code
will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: A novel learning paradigm enables machine reasoning in vision tasks by improving performance with increased thinking time, even with limited labeled data, outperforming supervised learning and human experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in machine intelligence's inability to dynamically refine solutions at inference time, especially in non-verbal reasoning tasks like visual perception and medical diagnosis.

Method: Integrates a fast-thinking System I module for familiar tasks and a slow-thinking System II module using self-play reinforcement learning to iteratively refine solutions, mimicking human reasoning.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance in vision tasks, including computer-vision benchmarks and cancer localization, compared to supervised learning, foundation models, and human experts.

Conclusion: The approach showcases transformative potential for non-verbal machine reasoning, bridging a critical gap in AI capabilities.

Abstract: Reasoning is a hallmark of human intelligence, enabling adaptive
decision-making in complex and unfamiliar scenarios. In contrast, machine
intelligence remains bound to training data, lacking the ability to dynamically
refine solutions at inference time. While some recent advances have explored
reasoning in machines, these efforts are largely limited to verbal domains such
as mathematical problem-solving, where explicit rules govern step-by-step
reasoning. Other critical real-world tasks - including visual perception,
spatial reasoning, and radiological diagnosis - require non-verbal reasoning,
which remains an open challenge. Here we present a novel learning paradigm that
enables machine reasoning in vision by allowing performance improvement with
increasing thinking time (inference-time compute), even under conditions where
labelled data is very limited. Inspired by dual-process theories of human
cognition in psychology, our approach integrates a fast-thinking System I
module for familiar tasks, with a slow-thinking System II module that
iteratively refines solutions using self-play reinforcement learning. This
paradigm mimics human reasoning by proposing, competing over, and refining
solutions in data-scarce scenarios. We demonstrate superior performance through
extended thinking time, compared not only to large-scale supervised learning
but also foundation models and even human experts, in real-world vision tasks.
These tasks include computer-vision benchmarks and cancer localisation on
medical images across five organs, showcasing transformative potential for
non-verbal machine reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing remote HR methods overlook ultra-short video clips, necessitating a solution for accurate HR estimation from such brief data.

Method: Introduces a periodicity-guided rPPG estimation method and a generator to reconstruct longer signals from ultra-short ones, preserving periodic consistency.

Result: Outperforms previous rPPG techniques, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The method enables accurate HR measurement from ultra-short clips and advances rPPG estimation technology.

Abstract: Many remote Heart Rate (HR) measurement methods focus on estimating remote
photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals from video clips lasting around 10 seconds
but often overlook the need for HR estimation from ultra-short video clips. In
this paper, we aim to accurately measure HR from ultra-short 2-second video
clips by specifically addressing two key challenges. First, to overcome the
limited number of heartbeat cycles in ultra-short video clips, we propose an
effective periodicity-guided rPPG estimation method that enforces consistent
periodicity between rPPG signals estimated from ultra-short clips and their
much longer ground truth signals. Next, to mitigate estimation inaccuracies due
to spectral leakage, we propose including a generator to reconstruct longer
rPPG signals from ultra-short ones while preserving their periodic consistency
to enable more accurate HR measurement. Extensive experiments on four rPPG
estimation benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method not only
accurately measures HR from ultra-short video clips but also outperform
previous rPPG estimation techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: BézierGS uses learnable Bézier curves for dynamic object motion, improving scene reconstruction without relying on high-precision annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods depend on object pose annotations, limiting large-scale scene reconstruction. BézierGS addresses this by leveraging temporal information and learnable curves.

Method: Proposes BézierGS, representing dynamic object motion with Bézier curves, using supervision for rendering and inter-curve consistency.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in dynamic/static scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis on Waymo and nuPlan datasets.

Conclusion: BézierGS offers a scalable solution for realistic street scene reconstruction by reducing annotation dependence and improving accuracy.

Abstract: The realistic reconstruction of street scenes is critical for developing
real-world simulators in autonomous driving. Most existing methods rely on
object pose annotations, using these poses to reconstruct dynamic objects and
move them during the rendering process. This dependence on high-precision
object annotations limits large-scale and extensive scene reconstruction. To
address this challenge, we propose B\'ezier curve Gaussian splatting
(B\'ezierGS), which represents the motion trajectories of dynamic objects using
learnable B\'ezier curves. This approach fully leverages the temporal
information of dynamic objects and, through learnable curve modeling,
automatically corrects pose errors. By introducing additional supervision on
dynamic object rendering and inter-curve consistency constraints, we achieve
reasonable and accurate separation and reconstruction of scene elements.
Extensive experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset and the nuPlan benchmark
demonstrate that B\'ezierGS outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in both
dynamic and static scene components reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

TL;DR: TPM improves medical image few-shot segmentation by addressing ADNet's limitations with tied prototypes, multi-class support, and adaptive thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like ADNet struggle with background variability, single prototypes, binary classification, and fixed thresholds.

Method: Proposes TPM with tied prototypes, probabilistic foundations, multi-class support, and adaptive thresholds.

Result: TPM achieves better segmentation accuracy by handling background variability and extending to multi-class tasks.

Conclusion: TPM offers a novel approach to prototype-based FSS, enhancing performance and adaptability in medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Common prototype-based medical image few-shot segmentation (FSS) methods
model foreground and background classes using class-specific prototypes.
However, given the high variability of the background, a more promising
direction is to focus solely on foreground modeling, treating the background as
an anomaly -- an approach introduced by ADNet. Yet, ADNet faces three key
limitations: dependence on a single prototype per class, a focus on binary
classification, and fixed thresholds that fail to adapt to patient and organ
variability. To address these shortcomings, we propose the Tied Prototype Model
(TPM), a principled reformulation of ADNet with tied prototype locations for
foreground and background distributions. Building on its probabilistic
foundation, TPM naturally extends to multiple prototypes and multi-class
segmentation while effectively separating non-typical background features.
Notably, both extensions lead to improved segmentation accuracy. Finally, we
leverage naturally occurring class priors to define an ideal target for
adaptive thresholds, boosting segmentation performance. Taken together, TPM
provides a fresh perspective on prototype-based FSS for medical image
segmentation. The code can be found at https://github.com/hjk92g/TPM-FSS.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate pedestrian behavior prediction is crucial for autonomous driving safety, especially in complex, unstructured environments lacking comprehensive datasets.

Method: The authors present a new dataset with detailed annotations for pedestrian behavior, tested on state-of-the-art intention and trajectory prediction methods.

Result: The dataset reveals significant performance drops (up to 15% for intention prediction and 1208 MSE for trajectory prediction) compared to standard datasets.

Conclusion: The dataset sets new challenges for robust pedestrian behavior modeling and advances research in autonomous driving safety.

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in autonomous driving, accurately predicting
pedestrian behavior has become essential for ensuring safety in complex and
unpredictable traffic conditions. The growing interest in this challenge
highlights the need for comprehensive datasets that capture unstructured
environments, enabling the development of more robust prediction models to
enhance pedestrian safety and vehicle navigation. In this paper, we introduce
an Indian driving pedestrian dataset designed to address the complexities of
modeling pedestrian behavior in unstructured environments, such as illumination
changes, occlusion of pedestrians, unsignalized scene types and
vehicle-pedestrian interactions. The dataset provides high-level and detailed
low-level comprehensive annotations focused on pedestrians requiring the
ego-vehicle's attention. Evaluation of the state-of-the-art intention
prediction methods on our dataset shows a significant performance drop of up to
$\mathbf{15\%}$, while trajectory prediction methods underperform with an
increase of up to $\mathbf{1208}$ MSE, defeating standard pedestrian datasets.
Additionally, we present exhaustive quantitative and qualitative analysis of
intention and trajectory baselines. We believe that our dataset will open new

Motivation: Manual pipe modeling from laser scans is slow and costly; automation is needed for efficient digital twin creation.

Method: Estimates skeleton curves, recenters axes with rolling sphere and 2D circle fitting, and refines with 3D smoothing.

Result: Accurate determination of pipe properties (radius, length, orientation) and detailed 3D models of complex networks.

Conclusion: Automation enables rapid, cost-effective digital twin development for industrial assets.

Abstract: Accurate digital twins of industrial assets, such as ships and offshore
platforms, rely on the precise reconstruction of complex pipe networks.
However, manual modelling of pipes from laser scan data is a time-consuming and
labor-intensive process. This paper presents a pipeline for automated pipe
reconstruction from incomplete laser scan data. The approach estimates a
skeleton curve using Laplacian-based contraction, followed by curve elongation.
The skeleton axis is then recentred using a rolling sphere technique combined
with 2D circle fitting, and refined with a 3D smoothing step. This enables the
determination of pipe properties, including radius, length and orientation, and
facilitates the creation of detailed 3D models of complex pipe networks. By
automating pipe reconstruction, this approach supports the development of
digital twins, allowing for rapid and accurate modeling while reducing costs.

TL;DR: Proposes CP-INR, a CP-based low-rank tensor function for implicit neural representation, enabling continuous data representation with theoretical guarantees. Introduces variational Schatten-p quasi-norm for sparsity and spectral norm-based regularization for smoothness. Outperforms state-of-the-art in multi-dimensional data tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tensor decomposition methods like Tucker lack interpretability, while CP decomposition struggles with sparsity. CP-INR aims to combine interpretability, sparsity, and smoothness for better multi-dimensional data representation.

Method: Uses CP decomposition parameterized by neural networks (CP-INR) for implicit neural representation. Introduces variational Schatten-p quasi-norm for sparsity and spectral norm-based regularization for smoothness.

Result: Demonstrates superiority in tasks like image inpainting, denoising, and point cloud upsampling. Provides theoretical guarantees on excess risk bounds.

Conclusion: CP-INR offers a versatile, interpretable, and efficient solution for multi-dimensional data recovery, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Higher-order tensors are well-suited for representing multi-dimensional data,
such as color images and videos. Low-rank tensor representation has become
essential in machine learning and computer vision, but existing methods like
Tucker decomposition offer flexibility at the expense of interpretability. In
contrast, while the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition provides a more
natural and interpretable tensor structure, obtaining sparse solutions remains
challenging. Leveraging the rich properties of CP decomposition, we propose a
CP-based low-rank tensor function parameterized by neural networks for implicit
neural representation (CP-INR). This approach enables continuous data
representation beyond structured grids, fully exploiting the non-linearity of
tensor data with theoretical guarantees on excess risk bounds. To achieve a
sparse CP decomposition, we introduce a variational form of the Schatten-p
quasi-norm and prove its relationship to multilinear rank minimization. For
smoothness, we propose a regularization term based on the spectral norm of the
Jacobian and Hutchinson's trace estimator. Our proposed smoothness
regularization is SVD-free and avoids explicit chain rule derivations. It can
serve as an alternative to Total Variation (TV) regularization in image
denoising tasks and is naturally applicable to continuous data. Extensive
experiments on multi-dimensional data recovery tasks, including image
inpainting, denoising, and point cloud upsampling, demonstrate the superiority
and versatility of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

*Shaojie Zhang,Jiahui Yang,Jianqin Yin,Zhenbo Luo,Jian Luan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Frame is a novel adaptive frame selection and multi-resolution scaling method for Video-LLMs, improving video comprehension by preserving critical spatiotemporal clues without exceeding computational limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Video-LLMs struggle with capturing query-related spatiotemporal clues due to uniform frame sampling, limiting their effectiveness in video understanding tasks.

Method: Q-Frame uses a training-free, plug-and-play strategy with a text-image matching network (e.g., CLIP) and the Gumbel-Max trick for adaptive frame selection and multi-resolution scaling.

Result: Q-Frame outperforms existing methods on benchmark datasets (MLVU, LongVideoBench, Video-MME), demonstrating superior video understanding capabilities.

Conclusion: Q-Frame effectively enhances Video-LLMs by adaptively selecting frames and scaling resolutions, addressing the challenges of video comprehension while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
success in visual understanding tasks. However, challenges persist in adapting
these models for video comprehension due to the large volume of data and
temporal complexity. Existing Video-LLMs using uniform frame sampling often
struggle to capture the query-related crucial spatiotemporal clues of videos
effectively. In this paper, we introduce Q-Frame, a novel approach for adaptive
frame selection and multi-resolution scaling tailored to the video's content
and the specific query. Q-Frame employs a training-free, plug-and-play strategy
generated by a text-image matching network like CLIP, utilizing the Gumbel-Max
trick for efficient frame selection. Q-Frame allows Video-LLMs to process more
frames without exceeding computational limits, thereby preserving critical
temporal and spatial information. We demonstrate Q-Frame's effectiveness
through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including MLVU,
LongVideoBench, and Video-MME, illustrating its superiority over existing
methods and its applicability across various video understanding tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the binding problem in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by augmenting visual inputs with spatial structures and textual prompts, improving performance in visual reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with associating perceptual features to visual referents, leading to errors in tasks like counting and spatial understanding.

Method: Introduces low-level spatial structures (e.g., horizontal lines) paired with sequential, spatially-aware textual prompts.

Result: Improves GPT-4o performance: 25.00% in visual search, 26.83% in counting, 0.32 reduction in scene description error, and 9.50% in spatial tasks.

Conclusion: Visual input design with spatial structuring is crucial for enhancing VLMs, outperforming purely linguistic approaches like Chain-of-Thought prompting.

Abstract: Despite progress in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their capacity for visual
reasoning is often limited by the \textit{binding problem}: the failure to
reliably associate perceptual features with their correct visual referents.
This limitation underlies persistent errors in tasks such as counting, visual
search, scene description, and spatial relationship understanding. A key factor
is that current VLMs process visual features largely in parallel, lacking
mechanisms for spatially grounded, serial attention. This paper introduces a
simple yet effective intervention: augmenting visual inputs with low-level
spatial structures (e.g., horizontal lines) and pairing this with a textual
prompt that encourages sequential, spatially-aware parsing. We empirically
demonstrate substantial performance improvements across core visual reasoning
tasks. Specifically, our method improves GPT-4o visual search accuracy by
25.00%, increases counting accuracy by 26.83%, reduces edit distance error in
scene description by 0.32, and enhances performance on spatial relationship
tasks by 9.50% on a a 2D synthetic dataset. Furthermore, we find that the
visual modification is essential for these gains; purely textual strategies,
including Chain-of-Thought prompting, are insufficient and can even degrade
performance. Our method enhances binding only with a single-query inference,
underscoring the importance of visual input design over purely
linguistically-based approaches. These findings suggest that low-level visual
structuring is a powerful and underexplored direction for improving
compositional visual reasoning and could serve as a general strategy for
enhancing VLM performance on spatially grounded tasks.

*Ronald Fecso,José Morano,Ursula Schmidt-Erfurth,Hrvoje Bogunović*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RetFiner is an SSL vision-language refinement method that enhances existing foundation models for OCT imaging, improving downstream task performance without costly supervised fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing foundation models for OCT lack robust semantic understanding and require supervised fine-tuning, which is often impractical. RetFiner addresses this by leveraging textual data for better representation learning.

Method: RetFiner uses a diverse set of training objectives to refine foundation models by incorporating rich supervisory signals from textual data.

Result: RetFiner significantly improves linear probing performance on seven OCT classification tasks, with average increases of 5.8, 3.9, and 2.1 percentage points over baselines for RETFound, UrFound, and VisionFM, respectively.

Conclusion: RetFiner effectively enhances foundation models for OCT, enabling efficient adaptation to specific populations and tasks without the need for supervised fine-tuning.

Abstract: The rise of imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and
advances in deep learning (DL) have enabled clinicians and researchers to
streamline retinal disease staging. A popular DL approach is self-supervised
learning (SSL), where models learn from vast amounts of unlabeled data,
avoiding costly annotation. SSL has allowed the development of foundation
models (FMs), large models that can be used for a variety of downstream tasks.
However, existing FMs for OCT, trained solely on image data, lack a
comprehensive and robust semantic understanding of images, as evidenced by
their downstream performance (especially for complex tasks), and thus require
supervised fine-tuning (which may be unfeasible) to better adapt to specific
applications and populations. To address this, we propose RetFiner, an SSL
vision-language refinement scheme that improves the representations of existing
FMs and enables their efficient and direct adaptation to specific populations
for improved downstream performance. Our method uses a diverse set of training
objectives which take advantage of the rich supervisory signal found in textual
data. We tested RetFiner on the retinal FMs RETFound, UrFound, and VisionFM,
showing significant improvements in linear probing performance on seven highly
diverse OCT classification tasks, with an average increase of 5.8, 3.9, and 2.1
percentage points over their baselines, respectively. Our code and model
weights are publicly available at https://github.com/ronnief1/RetFiner.

### [65] [Attention-disentangled Uniform Orthogonal Feature Space Optimization for Few-shot Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22161)
*Taijin Zhao,Heqian Qiu,Yu Dai,Lanxiao Wang,Fanman Meng,Qingbo Wu,Hongliang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Uniform Orthogonal Feature Space (UOFS) framework for few-shot object detection (FSOD), addressing limitations of entangled feature spaces in existing methods. It introduces Hybrid Background Optimization (HBO) and a Spatial-wise Attention Disentanglement and Association (SADA) module to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FSOD methods, based on Faster R-CNN, suffer from entangled feature spaces, leading to class-specific objectness criteria and poor performance on novel classes due to unrepresentative samples.

Method: The UOFS framework decouples feature spaces into orthogonal components (magnitude for objectness, angle for classification). HBO addresses challenges of unlabeled foreground instances and angular overfitting. SADA resolves task conflicts.

Result: Experiments show the method outperforms existing approaches with entangled feature spaces.

Conclusion: The UOFS framework, HBO, and SADA module effectively address FSOD challenges, improving detection performance for novel classes.

Abstract: Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to detect objects with limited samples
for novel classes, while relying on abundant data for base classes. Existing
FSOD approaches, predominantly built on the Faster R-CNN detector, entangle
objectness recognition and foreground classification within shared feature
spaces. This paradigm inherently establishes class-specific objectness criteria
and suffers from unrepresentative novel class samples. To resolve this
limitation, we propose a Uniform Orthogonal Feature Space (UOFS) optimization
framework. First, UOFS decouples the feature space into two orthogonal
components, where magnitude encodes objectness and angle encodes
classification. This decoupling enables transferring class-agnostic objectness
knowledge from base classes to novel classes. Moreover, implementing the
disentanglement requires careful attention to two challenges: (1) Base set
images contain unlabeled foreground instances, causing confusion between
potential novel class instances and backgrounds. (2) Angular optimization
depends exclusively on base class foreground instances, inducing overfitting of
angular distributions to base classes. To address these challenges, we propose
a Hybrid Background Optimization (HBO) strategy: (1) Constructing a pure
background base set by removing unlabeled instances in original images to
provide unbiased magnitude-based objectness supervision. (2) Incorporating
unlabeled foreground instances in the original base set into angular
optimization to enhance distribution uniformity. Additionally, we propose a
Spatial-wise Attention Disentanglement and Association (SADA) module to address
task conflicts between class-agnostic and class-specific tasks. Experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches based
on entangled feature spaces.

*Wenhan Wu,Zhishuai Guo,Chen Chen,Hongfei Xue,Aidong Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FS-VAE improves zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition by combining frequency decomposition and semantic alignment to capture fine-grained action patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook fine-grained action patterns in semantic space, limiting their ability to differentiate visually and semantically similar actions.

Method: FS-VAE uses frequency-based enhancement, multilevel semantic alignment, and calibrated cross-alignment loss to enrich skeletal semantics and bridge the semantic gap.

Result: Benchmark evaluations show FS-VAE effectively differentiates similar action clusters, improving zero-shot recognition.

Conclusion: Frequency-enhanced semantic features in FS-VAE enhance robustness and accuracy in zero-shot action recognition.

Abstract: Zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition aims to develop models capable of
identifying actions beyond the categories encountered during training. Previous
approaches have primarily focused on aligning visual and semantic
representations but often overlooked the importance of fine-grained action
patterns in the semantic space (e.g., the hand movements in drinking water and
brushing teeth). To address these limitations, we propose a Frequency-Semantic
Enhanced Variational Autoencoder (FS-VAE) to explore the skeleton semantic
representation learning with frequency decomposition. FS-VAE consists of three
key components: 1) a frequency-based enhancement module with high- and
low-frequency adjustments to enrich the skeletal semantics learning and improve
the robustness of zero-shot action recognition; 2) a semantic-based action
description with multilevel alignment to capture both local details and global
correspondence, effectively bridging the semantic gap and compensating for the
inherent loss of information in skeleton sequences; 3) a calibrated
cross-alignment loss that enables valid skeleton-text pairs to counterbalance
ambiguous ones, mitigating discrepancies and ambiguities in skeleton and text
features, thereby ensuring robust alignment. Evaluations on the benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, validating that
frequency-enhanced semantic features enable robust differentiation of visually
and semantically similar action clusters, improving zero-shot action
recognition.

*Yuxin Cui,Rui Song,Yibin Li,Max Q. -H. Meng,Zhe Min*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel two-stage multi-view 2D/3D registration method improves accuracy and robustness by incorporating cross-view constraints and test-time optimization, achieving superior performance on the DeepFluoro dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate alignment of preoperative models with intraoperative images is critical for interventional navigation, but limited field of view in single-image scenarios necessitates multi-view solutions.

Method: The approach uses a two-stage process: (1) a combined loss function with pose and image dissimilarity terms, plus cross-view constraints; (2) test-time optimization to refine poses.

Result: Achieves a mean target registration error (mTRE) of 0.79 ± 2.17 mm on the DeepFluoro dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively leverages multi-view constraints to enhance registration robustness and accuracy, demonstrating significant improvements over existing techniques.

Abstract: Robust and accurate 2D/3D registration, which aligns preoperative models with
intraoperative images of the same anatomy, is crucial for successful
interventional navigation. To mitigate the challenge of a limited field of view
in single-image intraoperative scenarios, multi-view 2D/3D registration is
required by leveraging multiple intraoperative images. In this paper, we
propose a novel multi-view 2D/3D rigid registration approach comprising two
stages. In the first stage, a combined loss function is designed, incorporating
both the differences between predicted and ground-truth poses and the
dissimilarities (e.g., normalized cross-correlation) between simulated and
observed intraoperative images. More importantly, additional cross-view
training loss terms are introduced for both pose and image losses to explicitly
enforce cross-view constraints. In the second stage, test-time optimization is
performed to refine the estimated poses from the coarse stage. Our method
exploits the mutual constraints of multi-view projection poses to enhance the
robustness of the registration process. The proposed framework achieves a mean
target registration error (mTRE) of $0.79 \pm 2.17$ mm on six specimens from
the DeepFluoro dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art registration algorithms.

TL;DR: ReF-LLE is a personalized low-light image enhancement method using Fourier domain and deep reinforcement learning, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges of varied low-light conditions and subjective enhancement preferences in image enhancement.

Method: Integrates deep reinforcement learning in the Fourier domain, using zero-reference scoring and personalized adaptive iterative strategy.

Result: Achieves superior perceptual quality and adaptability in personalized enhancement, validated on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: ReF-LLE effectively handles diverse low-light conditions and user preferences, setting a new standard in personalized image enhancement.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement presents two primary challenges: 1) Significant
variations in low-light images across different conditions, and 2) Enhancement
levels influenced by subjective preferences and user intent. To address these
issues, we propose ReF-LLE, a novel personalized low-light image enhancement
method that operates in the Fourier frequency domain and incorporates deep
reinforcement learning. ReF-LLE is the first to integrate deep reinforcement
learning into this domain. During training, a zero-reference image evaluation
strategy is introduced to score enhanced images, providing reward signals that
guide the model to handle varying degrees of low-light conditions effectively.
In the inference phase, ReF-LLE employs a personalized adaptive iterative
strategy, guided by the zero-frequency component in the Fourier domain, which
represents the overall illumination level. This strategy enables the model to
adaptively adjust low-light images to align with the illumination distribution
of a user-provided reference image, ensuring personalized enhancement results.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ReF-LLE
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior perceptual quality and
adaptability in personalized low-light image enhancement.

TL;DR: The paper explores small quantum gate perturbations as a quantum-inspired data augmentation technique, showing improved performance in image classification tasks compared to classical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the impact of quantum gate perturbations on quantum machine learning and leveraging them as a natural source of data augmentation, despite their typical detrimental perception.

Method: Investigating random Bloch sphere rotations (SU(2) transformations) as a quantum-inspired augmentation technique, applied directly to classical data like ImageNet.

Result: Quantum-inspired augmentation improved Top-1 accuracy by 3%, Top-5 accuracy by 2.5%, and F1 score from 8% to 12% over classical methods. Stronger unitary augmentations, while preserving information, did not enhance privacy.

Conclusion: Quantum-inspired augmentations can enhance classical machine learning performance, but their application to privacy computations is limited.

Abstract: Understanding the impact of small quantum gate perturbations, which are
common in quantum digital devices but absent in classical computers, is crucial
for identifying potential advantages in quantum machine learning. While these
perturbations are typically seen as detrimental to quantum computation, they
can actually enhance performance by serving as a natural source of data
augmentation. Additionally, they can often be efficiently simulated on
classical hardware, enabling quantum-inspired approaches to improve classical
machine learning methods. In this paper, we investigate random Bloch sphere
rotations, which are fundamental SU(2) transformations, as a simple yet
effective quantum-inspired data augmentation technique. Unlike conventional
augmentations such as flipping, rotating, or cropping, quantum transformations
lack intuitive spatial interpretations, making their application to tasks like
image classification less straightforward. While common quantum augmentation
methods rely on applying quantum models or trainable quanvolutional layers to
classical datasets, we focus on the direct application of small-angle Bloch
rotations and their effect on classical data. Using the large-scale ImageNet
dataset, we demonstrate that our quantum-inspired augmentation method improves
image classification performance, increasing Top-1 accuracy by 3%, Top-5
accuracy by 2.5%, and the F$_1$ score from 8% to 12% compared to standard
classical augmentation methods. Finally, we examine the use of stronger unitary
augmentations. Although these transformations preserve information in
principle, they result in visually unrecognizable images with potential
applications for privacy computations. However, we show that our augmentation
approach and simple SU(2) transformations do not enhance differential privacy
and discuss the implications of this limitation.

TL;DR: 4D-VLA integrates 4D information (depth and temporal data) into robotic pretraining to address coordinate and state chaos, improving efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods suffer from incomplete inputs causing dispersed action distributions (coordinate system and state chaos), hindering pretraining efficiency.

Method: 4D-VLA uses sequential RGB-D inputs to align robot and scene coordinate systems, adds memory bank sampling for informative frame extraction.

Result: Significant performance boost in success rates over OpenVLA in simulations and real-world tests; outperforms others in MV-Bench for spatial perception.

Conclusion: 4D-VLA effectively mitigates chaos issues, enhances spatiotemporal reasoning, and demonstrates superior adaptability and spatial understanding.

Abstract: Leveraging diverse robotic data for pretraining remains a critical challenge.
Existing methods typically model the dataset's action distribution using simple
observations as inputs. However, these inputs are often incomplete, resulting
in a dispersed conditional action distribution-an issue we refer to as
coordinate system chaos and state chaos. This inconsistency significantly
hampers pretraining efficiency. To address this, we propose 4D-VLA, a novel
approach that effectively integrates 4D information into the input to mitigate
these sources of chaos. Our model introduces depth and temporal information
into visual features with sequential RGB-D inputs, aligning the coordinate
systems of the robot and the scene. This alignment endows the model with strong
spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities while minimizing training overhead.
Additionally, we introduce memory bank sampling, a frame sampling strategy
designed to extract informative frames from historical images, further
improving effectiveness and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that
our pretraining method and architectural components substantially enhance model
performance. In both simulated and real-world experiments, our model achieves a
significant increase in success rate over OpenVLA. To further assess spatial
perception and generalization to novel views, we introduce MV-Bench, a
multi-view simulation benchmark. Our model consistently outperforms existing
methods, demonstrating stronger spatial understanding and adaptability.

TL;DR: EAMamba improves Vision Mamba for image restoration by introducing MHSSM and an all-around scanning mechanism, reducing FLOPs by 31-89% while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Mamba excels in long-range dependency modeling but faces challenges like computational complexity and local pixel forgetting in low-level vision tasks.

Method: Introduces EAMamba with MHSSM for efficient multi-sequence scanning and an all-around strategy to capture holistic information.

Result: EAMamba reduces FLOPs by 31-89% and performs comparably to existing methods in tasks like super resolution, denoising, deblurring, and dehazing.

Conclusion: EAMamba effectively addresses Vision Mamba's limitations, offering a computationally efficient solution for image restoration.

Abstract: Image restoration is a key task in low-level computer vision that aims to
reconstruct high-quality images from degraded inputs. The emergence of Vision
Mamba, which draws inspiration from the advanced state space model Mamba, marks
a significant advancement in this field. Vision Mamba demonstrates excellence
in modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, a crucial advantage
for image restoration tasks. Despite its strengths, Vision Mamba encounters
challenges in low-level vision tasks, including computational complexity that
scales with the number of scanning sequences and local pixel forgetting. To
address these limitations, this study introduces Efficient All-Around Mamba
(EAMamba), an enhanced framework that incorporates a Multi-Head Selective Scan
Module (MHSSM) with an all-around scanning mechanism. MHSSM efficiently
aggregates multiple scanning sequences, which avoids increases in computational
complexity and parameter count. The all-around scanning strategy implements
multiple patterns to capture holistic information and resolves the local pixel
forgetting issue. Our experimental evaluations validate these innovations
across several restoration tasks, including super resolution, denoising,
deblurring, and dehazing. The results validate that EAMamba achieves a
significant 31-89% reduction in FLOPs while maintaining favorable performance
compared to existing low-level Vision Mamba methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether Vision-Language Models (VLMs) use scene context for object reference, introducing the COOCO dataset to test this under varying conditions. Findings show adaptive reliance on context based on scene-object congruency and noise levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if VLMs leverage scene context for object recognition and reference, similar to humans.

Method: Introduces the COOCO dataset to test VLMs under different scene-object congruency and noise conditions, analyzing attention patterns.

Result: VLMs adaptively rely on scene context, more so under high congruency or object degradation. Attention analysis shows dynamic balancing of local and contextual information.

Conclusion: VLMs dynamically use scene context for object reference, balancing local and contextual cues, with implications for model design and understanding.

Abstract: Natural scenes provide us with rich contexts for object recognition and
reference. In particular, knowing what type of scene one is looking at
generates expectations about which objects will occur, and what their spatial
configuration should be. Do Vision-Language Models (VLMs) learn to rely on
scene contexts in a similar way, when generating references to objects? To
address this question, we introduce the \textit{Common Objects Out-of-Context
(COOCO)} dataset and test to what extent VLMs rely on scene context to refer to
objects under different degrees of scene-object congruency, and different
perturbations. Our findings show that models leverage scene context adaptively,
depending on both the semantic relatedness between object and scene and the
level of noise. In particular, models rely more on context under high
target-scene congruence or when objects are degraded. Attention analysis
reveals that successful object categorisation involves increased focus on the
target in mid-level layers, especially under moderate noise, suggesting that
VLMs dynamically balance local and contextual information for reference
generation. We make our dataset, code and models available at

*Rui Xu,Yunke Wang,Yong Luo,Bo Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisionDrop is a training-free, visual-only pruning framework for LVLMs that reduces computational overhead by selecting informative visual tokens using intra-modal attention, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs face computational inefficiency due to excessive visual tokens, and text-conditioned token reduction methods suffer from cross-modal misalignment.

Method: VisionDrop uses intra-modal attention for token selection and a progressive pruning pipeline to retain fine-grained visual information under tight token budgets.

Result: VisionDrop consistently improves performance over existing methods without additional training, enabling efficient inference.

Conclusion: VisionDrop offers a simple, effective solution for visual token reduction in LVLMs, balancing efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) encode visual inputs as dense sequences
of patch-level tokens to capture fine-grained semantics. These visual tokens
often outnumber their textual counterparts by a large margin, leading to
substantial computational overhead and limiting the scalability of LVLMs in
practice. Previous efforts have explored visual token reduction either prior to
or within the large language models (LLM). However, most in-LLM reduction
approaches rely on text-conditioned interactions, implicitly assuming that
textual tokens can reliably capture the importance of visual tokens. In this
work, we revisit this assumption and reveal causal, semantic, and spatial forms
of cross-modal misalignment. These misalignments undermine the effectiveness of
text-guided visual token reduction. To address this, we introduce VisionDrop, a
training-free, visual-only pruning framework that selects informative visual
tokens based on intra-modal (visual-to-visual) attention, without relying on
textual signals. To further suppress redundancy throughout the model hierarchy,
we treat the visual encoder and the LLM as a unified system and design a
progressive pruning pipeline. Our method performs dominant token selection and
lightweight contextual merging at multiple stages, enabling fine-grained visual
information to be retained even under aggressive token budgets. Extensive
experiments across diverse benchmarks show that VisionDrop achieves consistent
improvements over existing methods, despite requiring no additional training or
complex modifications. Its simple yet effective design enables efficient
inference while preserving strong performance across tasks.

TL;DR: RoomCraft is a multi-stage pipeline for generating realistic 3D indoor scenes from user inputs, combining scene generation with constraint-driven optimization to address limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D indoor scene generation face challenges like repetitive elements, object collisions, and compromised layout completeness, especially in multi-constraint scenarios.

Method: RoomCraft uses a pipeline to extract scene information, constructs a spatial relationship network, and employs a heuristic-based depth-first search (HDFS) algorithm for optimized placement. It introduces a unified constraint representation and a Conflict-Aware Positioning Strategy (CAPS) to handle complex constraints.

Result: RoomCraft outperforms existing methods in generating realistic, semantically coherent, and visually appealing room layouts across diverse inputs.

Conclusion: RoomCraft effectively addresses the limitations of current approaches, offering a robust solution for controllable and realistic 3D indoor scene generation.

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D indoor scenes from user inputs remains a challenging
problem in computer vision and graphics, requiring careful balance of geometric
consistency, spatial relationships, and visual realism. While neural generation
methods often produce repetitive elements due to limited global spatial
reasoning, procedural approaches can leverage constraints for controllable
generation but struggle with multi-constraint scenarios. When constraints
become numerous, object collisions frequently occur, forcing the removal of
furniture items and compromising layout completeness.
  To address these limitations, we propose RoomCraft, a multi-stage pipeline
that converts real images, sketches, or text descriptions into coherent 3D
indoor scenes. Our approach combines a scene generation pipeline with a
constraint-driven optimization framework. The pipeline first extracts
high-level scene information from user inputs and organizes it into a
structured format containing room type, furniture items, and spatial relations.
It then constructs a spatial relationship network to represent furniture
arrangements and generates an optimized placement sequence using a
heuristic-based depth-first search (HDFS) algorithm to ensure layout coherence.
To handle complex multi-constraint scenarios, we introduce a unified constraint
representation that processes both formal specifications and natural language
inputs, enabling flexible constraint-oriented adjustments through a
comprehensive action space design. Additionally, we propose a Conflict-Aware
Positioning Strategy (CAPS) that dynamically adjusts placement weights to
minimize furniture collisions and ensure layout completeness.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoomCraft significantly outperforms

appealing room layouts across diverse input modalities.

*Linhao Zhong,Fan Li,Yi Huang,Jianzhuang Liu,Renjing Pei,Fenglong Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OutDreamer, a DiT-based video outpainting framework, outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot methods by using efficient video control and conditional outpainting branches, along with a mask-driven self-attention layer and latent alignment loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with high-quality and adaptable video outpainting, despite using latent diffusion models. Diffusion transformers (DiTs) show promise for better performance.

Method: OutDreamer combines an efficient video control branch for extracting masked video information and a conditional outpainting branch for generating missing content. It includes a mask-driven self-attention layer and latent alignment loss for consistency. A cross-video-clip refiner ensures temporal consistency in long videos.

Result: OutDreamer achieves superior performance in zero-shot video outpainting compared to existing methods on recognized benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the challenges of video outpainting, offering high-quality, adaptable, and temporally consistent results.

Abstract: Video outpainting is a challenging task that generates new video content by
extending beyond the boundaries of an original input video, requiring both
temporal and spatial consistency. Many state-of-the-art methods utilize latent
diffusion models with U-Net backbones but still struggle to achieve high
quality and adaptability in generated content. Diffusion transformers (DiTs)
have emerged as a promising alternative because of their superior performance.
We introduce OutDreamer, a DiT-based video outpainting framework comprising two
main components: an efficient video control branch and a conditional
outpainting branch. The efficient video control branch effectively extracts
masked video information, while the conditional outpainting branch generates
missing content based on these extracted conditions. Additionally, we propose a
mask-driven self-attention layer that dynamically integrates the given mask
information, further enhancing the model's adaptability to outpainting tasks.
Furthermore, we introduce a latent alignment loss to maintain overall
consistency both within and between frames. For long video outpainting, we
employ a cross-video-clip refiner to iteratively generate missing content,
ensuring temporal consistency across video clips. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that our zero-shot OutDreamer outperforms state-of-the-art
zero-shot methods on widely recognized benchmarks.

*Paula Carbó Cubero,Alberto Jaenal Gálvez,André Mateus,José Araújo,Patric Jensfelt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for improving visual localization by augmenting feature descriptors and translating them to a latent space, addressing cross-feature detector challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods fail in cross-feature detector scenarios due to low keypoint repeatability and non-discriminatory descriptors, limiting practical use.

Method: Augments feature descriptors for cross-detector matching and translates them to a latent space.

Result: Significantly improves image matching and visual localization in cross-feature scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses cross-feature detector challenges, enhancing performance in real-world applications.

Abstract: State-of-the-art methods fail to solve visual localization in scenarios where
different devices use different sparse feature extraction algorithms to obtain
keypoints and their corresponding descriptors. Translating feature descriptors
is enough to enable matching. However, performance is drastically reduced in
cross-feature detector cases, because current solutions assume common
keypoints. This means that the same detector has to be used, which is rarely
the case in practice when different descriptors are used. The low repeatability
of keypoints, in addition to non-discriminatory and non-distinctive
descriptors, make the identification of true correspondences extremely
challenging. We present the first method tackling this problem, which performs
feature descriptor augmentation targeting cross-detector feature matching, and
then feature translation to a latent space. We show that our method
significantly improves image matching and visual localization in the
cross-feature scenario and evaluate the proposed method on several benchmarks.

*Luigi Russo,Deodato Tapete,Silvia Liberata Ullo,Paolo Gamba*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel multimodal deep learning framework uses single-date SAR imagery and geospatial data for rapid building damage detection post-disaster, eliminating the need for pre-event data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quick and accurate building damage identification is vital for disaster response, but optical imagery is often limited by clouds or lack of pre-event data.

Method: The framework integrates SAR imagery, OSM footprints, DSM data, and GEM attributes to detect damage using only post-event data.

Result: The method improves accuracy and generalizability, demonstrated on the 2023 Turkey earthquake dataset.

Conclusion: The approach enables reliable, rapid damage assessment without pre-event data, supporting scalable disaster management.

Abstract: Building damage identification shortly after a disaster is crucial for
guiding emergency response and recovery efforts. Although optical satellite
imagery is commonly used for disaster mapping, its effectiveness is often
hampered by cloud cover or the absence of pre-event acquisitions. To overcome
these challenges, we introduce a novel multimodal deep learning (DL) framework
for detecting building damage using single-date very high resolution (VHR)
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery from the Italian Space Agency (ASI)
COSMO SkyMed (CSK) constellation, complemented by auxiliary geospatial data.
Our method integrates SAR image patches, OpenStreetMap (OSM) building
footprints, digital surface model (DSM) data, and structural and exposure
attributes from the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) to improve detection accuracy
and contextual interpretation. Unlike existing approaches that depend on pre
and post event imagery, our model utilizes only post event data, facilitating
rapid deployment in critical scenarios. The framework effectiveness is
demonstrated using a new dataset from the 2023 earthquake in Turkey, covering
multiple cities with diverse urban settings. Results highlight that
incorporating geospatial features significantly enhances detection performance
and generalizability to previously unseen areas. By combining SAR imagery with
detailed vulnerability and exposure information, our approach provides reliable
and rapid building damage assessments without the dependency from available
pre-event data. Moreover, the automated and scalable data generation process
ensures the framework's applicability across diverse disaster-affected regions,
underscoring its potential to support effective disaster management and
recovery efforts. Code and data will be made available upon acceptance of the
paper.

*Hans Geißner,Christian Rathgeb*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a feature quantization method to address performance gaps in fuzzy vault-based biometric cryptosystems, reducing degradation caused by variable feature sizes and information loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The performance gap in fuzzy vault-based BCS is due to unstable error correction from variable feature sizes and information loss during transformations.

Method: A novel feature quantization method using equal frequent intervals ensures fixed feature sizes and adapts without training.

Result: The method significantly reduces performance degradation and works well with face, fingerprint, and iris systems.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively minimizes performance gaps across major biometric modalities.

Abstract: This paper analyses and addresses the performance gap in the fuzzy
vault-based \ac{BCS}. We identify unstable error correction capabilities, which
are caused by variable feature set sizes and their influence on similarity
thresholds, as a key source of performance degradation. This issue is further
compounded by information loss introduced through feature type transformations.
To address both problems, we propose a novel feature quantization method based
on \it{equal frequent intervals}. This method guarantees fixed feature set
sizes and supports training-free adaptation to any number of intervals. The
proposed approach significantly reduces the performance gap introduced by
template protection. Additionally, it integrates seamlessly with existing
systems to minimize the negative effects of feature transformation. Experiments
on state-of-the-art face, fingerprint, and iris recognition systems confirm
that only minimal performance degradation remains, demonstrating the
effectiveness of the method across major biometric modalities.

*Nouf Almesafri,Hector Figueiredo,Miguel Arana-Catania*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Comparison of ResNet34 and ViT B16 for event-based cameras shows ResNet34 slightly outperforms in accuracy, but ViT B16 is more robust, especially with noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate deep learning models (ResNet34 and ViT B16) for event-based cameras, which are crucial for dynamic environments like UAVs and autonomous vehicles.

Method: Fine-tuned ResNet34 and ViT B16 on the GEN1 event-based dataset, tested under standard and noisy conditions.

Result: ResNet34 achieved 88% accuracy, ViT B16 86%. ViT B16 showed better robustness despite lower accuracy.

Conclusion: ResNet34 is slightly more accurate, but ViT B16's robustness makes it promising for UAV and aviation applications.

Abstract: This study investigates the performance of the two most relevant computer
vision deep learning architectures, Convolutional Neural Network and Vision
Transformer, for event-based cameras. These cameras capture scene changes,
unlike traditional frame-based cameras with capture static images, and are
particularly suited for dynamic environments such as UAVs and autonomous
vehicles. The deep learning models studied in this work are ResNet34 and ViT
B16, fine-tuned on the GEN1 event-based dataset. The research evaluates and
compares these models under both standard conditions and in the presence of
simulated noise. Initial evaluations on the clean GEN1 dataset reveal that
ResNet34 and ViT B16 achieve accuracies of 88% and 86%, respectively, with
ResNet34 showing a slight advantage in classification accuracy. However, the
ViT B16 model demonstrates notable robustness, particularly given its
pre-training on a smaller dataset. Although this study focuses on ground-based
vehicle classification, the methodologies and findings hold significant promise
for adaptation to UAV contexts, including aerial object classification and
event-based vision systems for aviation-related tasks.

TL;DR: A training-free framework using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for OOD detection in 3D point clouds, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of OOD detection in 3D point clouds, crucial for safe and robust perception, where existing 2D methods fall short.

Method: Leverages VLMs with a graph-based approach (Graph Score Propagation) incorporating prompt clustering and self-training negative prompting.

Result: Consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed GSP method is effective and adaptable for 3D OOD detection, even in few-shot scenarios.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in 3D point cloud data remains a
challenge, particularly in applications where safe and robust perception is
critical. While existing OOD detection methods have shown progress for 2D image
data, extending these to 3D environments involves unique obstacles. This paper
introduces a training-free framework that leverages Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) for effective OOD detection in 3D point clouds. By constructing a graph
based on class prototypes and testing data, we exploit the data manifold
structure to enhancing the effectiveness of VLMs for 3D OOD detection. We
propose a novel Graph Score Propagation (GSP) method that incorporates prompt
clustering and self-training negative prompting to improve OOD scoring with
VLM. Our method is also adaptable to few-shot scenarios, providing options for
practical applications. We demonstrate that GSP consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods across synthetic and real-world datasets 3D point

*Yue Zhang,Jilei Sun,Yunhui Guo,Vibhav Gogate*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Defeasible Video Entailment (DVidE) to improve abstract and adaptive reasoning in Video Large Multimodal Models (VLMMs). It proposes two frameworks for classification and generation tasks, along with a new benchmark dataset and evaluation metric, showing significant improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMMs struggle with abstract and adaptive reasoning, especially in revising interpretations based on new information. DVidE addresses this gap by challenging models to update reasoning dynamically.

Method: For classification, the Chain of Counterfactual Thought framework uses counterfactual reasoning, ASR-enhanced video content, and rationale refinement. For generation, ASR output is combined with an LLM to produce coherent updates. A new benchmark dataset and LLM-based evaluation metric are introduced.

Result: Experimental results show significant improvements in dynamic reasoning capabilities of VLMMs.

Conclusion: DVidE and the proposed frameworks effectively enhance VLMMs' ability to perform abstract and adaptive reasoning, validated by the new benchmark and evaluation metric.

Abstract: Video Large Multimodal Models (VLMMs) have made impressive strides in
understanding video content, but they often struggle with abstract and adaptive
reasoning-the ability to revise their interpretations when new information
emerges. In reality, conclusions are rarely set in stone; additional context
can strengthen or weaken an initial inference. To address this, we introduce
Defeasible Video Entailment (DVidE), a new task that challenges models to think
like doubters, constantly updating their reasoning based on evolving evidence.
In DVidE, given a video premise and a textual hypothesis, models must determine
whether a new update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis (classification
version) or generate a coherent update that modifies the entailment
relationship (generation version). For solving the classification task, we
propose the Chain of Counterfactual Thought framework, utilizing counterfactual
reasoning, ASR-enhanced video content, and rationale refinement to reduce
inference bias. For the generation task, we develop a framework that combines
ASR output with a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce coherent, contextually
relevant updates aligned with the intended strengthener or weakener goals.
Additionally, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset, with
strengthener/weakener annotations and an LLM-based evaluation metric
specifically designed for assessing generative performance. Experimental
results demonstrate significant improvements, highlighting our proposed method
in enhancing dynamic reasoning capabilities of VLMMs.

*Shih-Han Chou,Shivam Chandhok,James J. Little,Leonid Sigal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A test-time consistency framework improves semantic consistency in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) without retraining, using cross-entropy agreement and pseudo-label consistency losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs exhibit inconsistent behavior with semantically equivalent inputs, reducing reliability despite high accuracy.

Method: Proposes a post-hoc, model-agnostic framework using Cross-Entropy Agreement Loss and Pseudo-Label Consistency Loss for test-time consistency.

Result: Substantial gains in consistency on the MM-R3 benchmark without supervised re-training.

Conclusion: The framework offers a plug-and-play solution for improving VLM consistency during inference.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a
wide range of multimodal tasks, yet they often exhibit inconsistent behavior
when faced with semantically equivalent inputs, undermining their reliability
and robustness. Recent benchmarks, such as MM-R3, highlight that even
state-of-the-art VLMs can produce divergent predictions across semantically
equivalent inputs, despite maintaining high average accuracy. Prior work
addresses this issue by modifying model architectures or conducting large-scale
fine-tuning on curated datasets. In contrast, we propose a simple and effective
test-time consistency framework that enhances semantic consistency without
supervised re-training. Our method is entirely post-hoc, model-agnostic, and
applicable to any VLM with access to its weights. Given a single test point, we
enforce consistent predictions via two complementary objectives: (i) a
Cross-Entropy Agreement Loss that aligns predictive distributions across
semantically equivalent inputs, and (ii) a Pseudo-Label Consistency Loss that
draws outputs toward a self-averaged consensus. Our method is plug-and-play and
leverages information from a single test input itself to improve consistency.
Experiments on the MM-R3 benchmark show that our framework yields substantial
gains in consistency across state-of-the-art models, establishing a new
direction for inference-time adaptation in multimodal learning.

*Yuhao Liu,Tengfei Wang,Fang Liu,Zhenwei Wang,Rynson W. H. Lau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Shape-for-Motion introduces a 3D proxy-based framework for precise and consistent video editing, enabling user edits on a single frame to propagate across the entire video.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack fine-grained alignment with user intentions in video editing, prompting the need for a more controllable and precise solution.

Method: The framework converts target objects into time-consistent 3D meshes, uses a Dual-Propagation Strategy for edit propagation, and employs a decoupled video diffusion model for final rendering.

Result: Supports diverse manipulations (pose, rotation, scaling, etc.) with high consistency and quality, validated by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Shape-for-Motion advances controllable video editing, offering a robust solution for user-aligned creative workflows.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative modeling have unlocked unprecedented
opportunities for video synthesis. In real-world applications, however, users
often seek tools to faithfully realize their creative editing intentions with
precise and consistent control. Despite the progress achieved by existing
methods, ensuring fine-grained alignment with user intentions remains an open
and challenging problem. In this work, we present Shape-for-Motion, a novel
framework that incorporates a 3D proxy for precise and consistent video
editing. Shape-for-Motion achieves this by converting the target object in the
input video to a time-consistent mesh, i.e., a 3D proxy, allowing edits to be
performed directly on the proxy and then inferred back to the video frames. To
simplify the editing process, we design a novel Dual-Propagation Strategy that
allows users to perform edits on the 3D mesh of a single frame, and the edits
are then automatically propagated to the 3D meshes of the other frames. The 3D
meshes for different frames are further projected onto the 2D space to produce
the edited geometry and texture renderings, which serve as inputs to a
decoupled video diffusion model for generating edited results. Our framework
supports various precise and physically-consistent manipulations across the
video frames, including pose editing, rotation, scaling, translation, texture
modification, and object composition. Our approach marks a key step toward
high-quality, controllable video editing workflows. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our approach. Project page:

TL;DR: WarpRF is a training-free framework for quantifying uncertainty in radiance fields by leveraging backward warping and consistency checks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a general-purpose, simple, and inexpensive method for uncertainty quantification in radiance fields without requiring training.

Method: Uses backward warping across viewpoints to project reliable renderings to unseen viewpoints and measures consistency with rendered images.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in uncertainty quantification and downstream tasks like active view selection and mapping.

Conclusion: WarpRF is a versatile, effective, and training-free solution for uncertainty in radiance fields.

Abstract: We introduce WarpRF, a training-free general-purpose framework for
quantifying the uncertainty of radiance fields. Built upon the assumption that
photometric and geometric consistency should hold among images rendered by an
accurate model, WarpRF quantifies its underlying uncertainty from an unseen
point of view by leveraging backward warping across viewpoints, projecting
reliable renderings to the unseen viewpoint and measuring the consistency with
images rendered there. WarpRF is simple and inexpensive, does not require any
training, and can be applied to any radiance field implementation for free.
WarpRF excels at both uncertainty quantification and downstream tasks, e.g.,
active view selection and active mapping, outperforming any existing method
tailored to specific frameworks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to enable Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for linking visual cues across multiple images using self-supervised learning and rule-based reinforcement learning, achieving strong performance without human-annotated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) rely on manually curated question-answer pairs, which are challenging for fine-grained visual details and complex logic across images.

Method: The approach constructs image triplets (two augmented views of the same image and a distinct image) and trains the model to compare them using rule-based reinforcement learning.

Result: The model generalizes well to various questions and achieves significant improvements on multi-image reasoning benchmarks and general vision tasks.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates that self-supervised learning and rule-based reinforcement learning can effectively enable CoT reasoning without human-annotated data.

Abstract: This work explores enabling Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to link visual
cues across multiple images. A straightforward solution is to adapt rule-based
reinforcement learning for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, such methods
typically rely on manually curated question-answer pairs, which can be
particularly challenging when dealing with fine grained visual details and
complex logic across images. Inspired by self-supervised visual representation
learning, we observe that images contain inherent constraints that can serve as
supervision. Based on this insight, we construct image triplets comprising two
augmented views of the same image and a third, similar but distinct image.
During training, the model is prompted to generate a reasoning process to
compare these images (i.e., determine same or different). Then we optimize the
model with rule-based reinforcement learning. Due to the high visual similarity
and the presence of augmentations, the model must attend to subtle visual
changes and perform logical reasoning to succeed. Experiments show that,
although trained solely on visual comparison tasks, the learned reasoning
ability generalizes effectively to a wide range of questions. Without relying
on any human-annotated question-answer pairs, our method achieves significant
improvements on multi-image reasoning benchmarks and shows strong performance
on general vision tasks.

TL;DR: SEEA-R1 is a reinforcement fine-tuning framework for self-evolving embodied agents, addressing sparse rewards and generalization with Tree-GRPO and MGRM, achieving state-of-the-art performance on ALFWorld.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement fine-tuning lacks effective learning signals and generalization in embodied settings, limiting self-evolving capabilities.

Method: Proposes Tree-GRPO for dense intermediate rewards and MGRM for cross-task reward generalization.

Result: Achieves 85.07% (textual) and 36.19% (multi-modal) on ALFWorld, outperforming GPT-4o and open-source baselines.

Conclusion: SEEA-R1 demonstrates scalable self-evolving potential for embodied intelligence.

Abstract: Self-evolution, the ability of agents to autonomously improve their reasoning
and behavior, is essential for the embodied domain with long-horizon,
real-world tasks. Despite current advancements in reinforcement fine-tuning
(RFT) showing strong performance in enhancing reasoning in LLMs, its potential
to enable self-evolving embodied intelligence with multi-modal interactions
remains largely unexplored. Specifically, reinforcement fine-tuning faces two
fundamental obstacles in embodied settings: (i) the lack of accessible
intermediate rewards in multi-step reasoning tasks limits effective learning
signals, and (ii) reliance on hand-crafted reward functions restricts
generalization to novel tasks and environments. To address these challenges, we
present Self-Evolving Embodied Agents-R1, SEEA-R1, the first RFT framework
designed for enabling the self-evolving capabilities of embodied agents.
Specifically, to convert sparse delayed rewards into denser intermediate
signals that improve multi-step reasoning, we propose Tree-based group relative
policy optimization (Tree-GRPO), which integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search into
GRPO. To generalize reward estimation across tasks and scenes, supporting
autonomous adaptation and reward-driven self-evolution, we further introduce
Multi-modal Generative Reward Model (MGRM). To holistically evaluate the
effectiveness of SEEA-R1, we evaluate on the ALFWorld benchmark, surpassing
state-of-the-art methods with scores of 85.07% (textual) and 36.19%
(multi-modal), outperforming prior models including GPT-4o. SEEA-R1 also
achieves scores of 80.3% without environmental reward, surpassing all
open-source baselines and highlighting its scalability as a self-evolving
embodied agent. Additional experiments and qualitative analysis further support
the potential of SEEA-R1 for future research in scalable embodied intelligence.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM), a recurrent architecture inspired by human brain processing, which outperforms current LLMs in reasoning tasks with minimal data and parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques face issues like brittle task decomposition, high data needs, and latency. The human brain's hierarchical processing inspired HRM to address these limitations.

Method: HRM uses two interdependent recurrent modules: a high-level module for abstract planning and a low-level module for rapid computations, enabling efficient reasoning in a single forward pass without intermediate supervision.

Result: HRM achieves near-perfect performance on complex tasks (e.g., Sudoku, maze pathfinding) with only 27M parameters and 1000 training samples, outperforming larger models on the ARC benchmark.

Conclusion: HRM represents a transformative advancement toward universal computation and general-purpose reasoning systems, demonstrating efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: Reasoning, the process of devising and executing complex goal-oriented action
sequences, remains a critical challenge in AI. Current large language models
(LLMs) primarily employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques, which suffer from
brittle task decomposition, extensive data requirements, and high latency.
Inspired by the hierarchical and multi-timescale processing in the human brain,
we propose the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM), a novel recurrent
architecture that attains significant computational depth while maintaining
both training stability and efficiency. HRM executes sequential reasoning tasks
in a single forward pass without explicit supervision of the intermediate
process, through two interdependent recurrent modules: a high-level module
responsible for slow, abstract planning, and a low-level module handling rapid,
detailed computations. With only 27 million parameters, HRM achieves
exceptional performance on complex reasoning tasks using only 1000 training
samples. The model operates without pre-training or CoT data, yet achieves
nearly perfect performance on challenging tasks including complex Sudoku
puzzles and optimal path finding in large mazes. Furthermore, HRM outperforms
much larger models with significantly longer context windows on the Abstraction
and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a key benchmark for measuring artificial general
intelligence capabilities. These results underscore HRM's potential as a
transformative advancement toward universal computation and general-purpose
reasoning systems.

TL;DR: THE-Tree is a framework for constructing verifiable, causally-linked evolution trees from scientific literature, improving accuracy in evaluating AI-generated scientific propositions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for validating AI-generated scientific ideas are inadequate due to hallucinations, lack of domain knowledge, and unstructured data.

Method: THE-Tree uses a "Think-Verbalize-Cite-Verify" process with LLMs to propose advancements and validate links via natural language inference.

Result: THE-Tree improves hit@1 metrics by 8-14% in graph completion and nearly 10% in predicting future developments, while boosting evaluation performance by 100%.

Conclusion: THE-Tree addresses the bottleneck in evaluating AI-generated scientific ideas by providing structured, verifiable, and causally-linked historical data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are accelerating scientific idea generation, but
rigorously evaluating these numerous, often superficial, AI-generated
propositions for novelty and factual accuracy is a critical bottleneck; manual
verification is too slow.Existing validation methods are inadequate: LLMs as
standalone verifiers may hallucinate and lack domain knowledge (our findings
show ~60\% unawareness of relevant papers in specific domains), while
traditional citation networks lack explicit causality and narrative surveys are
unstructured.This underscores a core challenge: the absence of structured,
verifiable, and causally-linked historical data of scientific evolution.To
address this,we introduce \textbf{THE-Tree} (\textbf{T}echnology
\textbf{H}istory \textbf{E}volution Tree), a computational framework that
constructs such domain-specific evolution trees from scientific
literature.THE-Tree employs a search algorithm to explore evolutionary paths.
During its node expansion, it utilizes a novel "Think-Verbalize-Cite-Verify"
process: an LLM proposes potential advancements and cites supporting
literature. Critically, each proposed evolutionary link is then validated for
logical coherence and evidential support by a recovered natural language
inference mechanism that interrogates the cited literature, ensuring that each
step is grounded.We construct and validate 88 THE-Trees across diverse domains
and release a benchmark dataset including up to 71k fact verifications covering
27k papers to foster further research.Experiments demonstrate that i) in graph
completion, our THE-Tree improves hit@1 by 8\% to 14\% across multiple models
compared to traditional citation networks; ii) for predicting future scientific
developments, it improves hit@1 metric by nearly 10\%; and iii) when combined
with other methods, it boosts the performance of evaluating important
scientific papers by almost 100\%.

Result: Efficiently simulated 53,000 agents on a standard PC, enabling dynamic responses to environmental changes.

Conclusion: MobiVerse offers a customizable, efficient, and realistic platform for mobility planning and operations.

Abstract: Understanding and modeling human mobility patterns is crucial for effective
transportation planning and urban development. Despite significant advances in
mobility research, there remains a critical gap in simulation platforms that
allow for algorithm development, policy implementation, and comprehensive
evaluation at scale. Traditional activity-based models require extensive data
collection and manual calibration, machine learning approaches struggle with
adaptation to dynamic conditions, and treding agent-based Large Language Models
(LLMs) implementations face computational constraints with large-scale
simulations. To address these challenges, we propose MobiVerse, a hybrid
framework leverages the efficiency of lightweight domain-specific generator for
generating base activity chains with the adaptability of LLMs for context-aware
modifications. A case study was conducted in Westwood, Los Angeles, where we
efficiently generated and dynamically adjusted schedules for the whole
population of approximately 53,000 agents on a standard PC. Our experiments
demonstrate that MobiVerse successfully enables agents to respond to
environmental feedback, including road closures, large gathering events like
football games, and congestion, through our hybrid framework. Its modular
design facilitates testing various mobility algorithms at both transportation
system and agent levels. Results show our approach maintains computational
efficiency while enhancing behavioral realism. MobiVerse bridges the gap in
mobility simulation by providing a customizable platform for mobility systems
planning and operations with benchmark algorithms. Code and videos are

*Nicolas Bougie,Narimasa Watanabe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CitySim is an urban simulator using large language models to model human behavior with nuanced intentions, adaptive behaviors, and realistic schedules, outperforming prior rigid rule-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of rigid, hand-crafted rules in modeling human behavior in urban environments, enabling more nuanced and adaptive simulations.

Method: CitySim employs a recursive value-driven approach for agents to generate daily schedules, incorporating beliefs, long-term goals, and spatial memory for lifelike simulations.

Result: CitySim aligns more closely with real human behavior at micro and macro levels, demonstrated through experiments with tens of thousands of agents in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: CitySim serves as a scalable, flexible testbed for understanding and forecasting urban phenomena, offering significant improvements over prior methods.

Abstract: Modeling human behavior in urban environments is fundamental for social
science, behavioral studies, and urban planning. Prior work often rely on
rigid, hand-crafted rules, limiting their ability to simulate nuanced
intentions, plans, and adaptive behaviors. Addressing these challenges, we
envision an urban simulator (CitySim), capitalizing on breakthroughs in
human-level intelligence exhibited by large language models. In CitySim, agents
generate realistic daily schedules using a recursive value-driven approach that
balances mandatory activities, personal habits, and situational factors. To
enable long-term, lifelike simulations, we endow agents with beliefs, long-term
goals, and spatial memory for navigation. CitySim exhibits closer alignment
with real humans than prior work, both at micro and macro levels. Additionally,
we conduct insightful experiments by modeling tens of thousands of agents and
evaluating their collective behaviors under various real-world scenarios,
including estimating crowd density, predicting place popularity, and assessing
well-being. Our results highlight CitySim as a scalable, flexible testbed for
understanding and forecasting urban phenomena.

### [91] [Interactive Multi-Objective Probabilistic Preference Learning with Soft and Hard Bounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21887)
*Edward Chen,Sang T. Truong,Natalie Dullerud,Sanmi Koyejo,Carlos Guestrin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Active-MoSH is an interactive framework for high-stakes decision-making, combining soft-hard bounds with preference learning to refine Pareto-optimal solutions and build trust through global sensitivity analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-stakes decisions require balancing competing objectives with expensive evaluations, but current methods lack systematic ways to refine preferences and ensure trust in the final choice.

Method: Active-MoSH integrates local preference learning with soft-hard bounds and global sensitivity analysis (T-MoSH) to refine Pareto subsets and identify overlooked high-value points.

Result: The framework improves convergence, enhances decision-maker trust, and allows expressive preference articulation, validated through synthetic and real-world applications.

Conclusion: Active-MoSH effectively addresses the challenges of high-stakes decision-making by combining interactive refinement with trust-building mechanisms.

Abstract: High-stakes decision-making involves navigating multiple competing objectives
with expensive evaluations. For instance, in brachytherapy, clinicians must
balance maximizing tumor coverage (e.g., an aspirational target or soft bound
of >95% coverage) against strict organ dose limits (e.g., a non-negotiable hard
bound of <601 cGy to the bladder), with each plan evaluation being
resource-intensive. Selecting Pareto-optimal solutions that match implicit
preferences is challenging, as exhaustive Pareto frontier exploration is
computationally and cognitively prohibitive, necessitating interactive
frameworks to guide users. While decision-makers (DMs) often possess domain
knowledge to narrow the search via such soft-hard bounds, current methods often
lack systematic approaches to iteratively refine these multi-faceted preference
structures. Critically, DMs must trust their final decision, confident they
haven't missed superior alternatives; this trust is paramount in
high-consequence scenarios. We present Active-MoSH, an interactive local-global
framework designed for this process. Its local component integrates soft-hard
bounds with probabilistic preference learning, maintaining distributions over
DM preferences and bounds for adaptive Pareto subset refinement. This is guided
by an active sampling strategy optimizing exploration-exploitation while
minimizing cognitive burden. To build DM trust, Active-MoSH's global component,
T-MoSH, leverages multi-objective sensitivity analysis to identify potentially
overlooked, high-value points beyond immediate feedback. We demonstrate
Active-MoSH's performance benefits through diverse synthetic and real-world
applications. A user study on AI-generated image selection further validates
our hypotheses regarding the framework's ability to improve convergence,
enhance DM trust, and provide expressive preference articulation, enabling more
effective DMs.

### [92] [AlphaBeta is not as good as you think: a new probabilistic model to better analyze deterministic game-solving algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21996)
*Raphaël Boige,Amine Boumaza,Bruno Scherrer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques the independence assumption in traditional game-tree models, introduces a new probabilistic model with ancestor dependency, and analyzes algorithms like AlphaBeta and Scout, revealing practical performance differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional models oversimplify game-trees by assuming independence of leaf values, leading to trivial analyses. The paper aims to address this by proposing a more realistic model with structural complexity.

Method: A new probabilistic model is introduced, enforcing ancestor dependency in game-trees. Recursive formulas are derived for average-case complexities of algorithms like AlphaBeta and Scout.

Result: Asymptotically, algorithms converge to the same branching factor, but deep finite trees show AlphaBeta has a larger constant factor, causing practical slowdowns compared to Scout.

Conclusion: The new model provides a more realistic and challenging framework for analyzing game-solving algorithms, revealing practical differences obscured by traditional models.

Abstract: Deterministic game-solving algorithms are conventionally analyzed in the
light of their average-case complexity against a distribution of random
game-trees, where leaf values are independently sampled from a fixed
distribution. This simplified model enables uncluttered mathematical analysis,
revealing two key properties: root value distributions asymptotically collapse
to a single fixed value for finite-valued trees, and all reasonable algorithms
achieve global optimality. However, these findings are artifacts of the model's
design-its long criticized independence assumption strips games of structural
complexity, producing trivial instances where no algorithm faces meaningful
challenges. To address this limitation, we introduce a new probabilistic model
that incrementally constructs game-trees using a fixed level-wise conditional
distribution. By enforcing ancestor dependency, a critical structural feature
of real-world games, our framework generates problems with adjustable
difficulty while retaining some form of analytical tractability. For several
algorithms, including AlphaBeta and Scout, we derive recursive formulas
characterizing their average-case complexities under this model. These allow us
to rigorously compare algorithms on deep game-trees, where Monte-Carlo
simulations are no longer feasible. While asymptotically, all algorithms seem
to converge to identical branching factor (a result analogous to those of
independence-based models), deep finite trees reveal stark differences:
AlphaBeta incurs a significantly larger constant multiplicative factor compared
to algorithms like Scout, leading to a substantial practical slowdown. Our
framework sheds new light on classical game-solving algorithms, offering
rigorous evidence and analytical tools to advance the understanding of these
methods under a more realistic, challenging, and yet tractable model.

TL;DR: LeanConjecturer is a pipeline using LLMs to generate university-level mathematical conjectures in Lean 4, addressing data scarcity in theorem proving. It produced 12,289 conjectures, with 3,776 being valid and non-trivial, and demonstrated utility in reinforcement learning for theorem proving.

Result: Generated 12,289 conjectures (3,776 valid and non-trivial), with an average of 103.25 novel conjectures per seed file. Demonstrated utility in reinforcement learning and verified non-trivial theorems in topology.

Conclusion: LeanConjecturer provides a scalable solution for generating training data for theorem proving systems and shows potential for mathematical discovery beyond simple variations.

Abstract: We introduce LeanConjecturer, a pipeline for automatically generating
university-level mathematical conjectures in Lean 4 using Large Language Models
(LLMs). Our hybrid approach combines rule-based context extraction with
LLM-based theorem statement generation, addressing the data scarcity challenge
in formal theorem proving. Through iterative generation and evaluation,
LeanConjecturer produced 12,289 conjectures from 40 Mathlib seed files, with
3,776 identified as syntactically valid and non-trivial, that is, cannot be
proven by \texttt{aesop} tactic. We demonstrate the utility of these generated
conjectures for reinforcement learning through Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), showing that targeted training on domain-specific
conjectures can enhance theorem proving capabilities. Our approach generates
103.25 novel conjectures per seed file on average, providing a scalable
solution for creating training data for theorem proving systems. Our system
successfully verified several non-trivial theorems in topology, including
properties of semi-open, alpha-open, and pre-open sets, demonstrating its
potential for mathematical discovery beyond simple variations of existing
results.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multimodal Trajectory Retrieval, a method to model trajectory-level data for AI agents in GUI environments, using the UATD dataset and GAE-Bench benchmark, and proposes GAE-Retriever, a framework that outperforms baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of modeling trajectory-level data for AI agents in GUI environments is not systematically addressed despite its potential.

Method: Constructs the UATD dataset, introduces GAE-Bench benchmark, and proposes GAE-Retriever, a multimodal retrieval framework using vision-language models and optimized contrastive learning.

Result: GAE-Retriever consistently outperforms baselines in retrieval recall across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The work effectively advances multimodal trajectory retrieval for AI agents.

Abstract: Trajectory data, capturing human actions and environmental states across
various modalities, holds significant potential for enhancing AI agent
capabilities, particularly in GUI environments. However, how to model the
representation of trajectory-level data presents a significant challenge that
has not been systematically addressed amid explosive trajectory data growth. In
this work, we introduce Multimodal Trajectory Retrieval, bridging the gap
between universal retrieval and agent-centric trajectory modeling. We construct
the Unified Agent Trajectory Dataset (UATD) from annotated demonstrations and
states across diverse real-world scenarios. Based on this, we present
GAE-Bench, a benchmark containing a large number of trajectory-based retrieval
pairs. In addition, we propose GAE-Retriever, a multimodal retrieval framework
that adopts vision-language models and incorporates optimized contrastive
learning through a token selection and the GradCache mechanism. Comprehensive
evaluations across multiple datasets show that GAE-Retriever consistently
outperforms strong baselines in retrieval recall, highlighting its
effectiveness in advancing multimodal trajectory retrieval.

### [95] [Query as Test: An Intelligent Driving Test and Data Storage Method for Integrated Cockpit-Vehicle-Road Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22068)
*Shengyue Yao,Runqing Guo,Yangyang Qin,Miangbing Meng,Jipeng Cao,Yilun Lin,Yisheng Lv,Fei-Yue Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Query as Test' (QaT) and 'Extensible Scenarios Notations' (ESN) to address fragmented data in AI-driven transportation, enabling flexible, semantic testing and validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fragmented and incompatible data ecosystems in AI-driven transportation (cockpits, autonomous driving, road networks) hinder testing, which relies on rigid, incomplete methods.

Method: Proposes ESN, a declarative data framework using Answer Set Programming (ASP) to unify multimodal data as logical facts/rules, enabling semantic queries and privacy protection.

Result: ESN supports flexible semantic querying, interpretability, and privacy. QaT transforms testing into logical queries, enhancing rigor. Introduces 'Validation-Driven Development' (VDD) for faster iteration.

Conclusion: QaT and ESN improve testing flexibility and rigor in AI transportation, while VDD accelerates development through logical validation.

Abstract: With the deep penetration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the
transportation sector, intelligent cockpits, autonomous driving, and
intelligent road networks are developing at an unprecedented pace. However, the
data ecosystems of these three key areas are increasingly fragmented and
incompatible. Especially, existing testing methods rely on data stacking, fail
to cover all edge cases, and lack flexibility. To address this issue, this
paper introduces the concept of "Query as Test" (QaT). This concept shifts the
focus from rigid, prescripted test cases to flexible, on-demand logical queries
against a unified data representation. Specifically, we identify the need for a
fundamental improvement in data storage and representation, leading to our
proposal of "Extensible Scenarios Notations" (ESN). ESN is a novel declarative
data framework based on Answer Set Programming (ASP), which uniformly
represents heterogeneous multimodal data from the cockpit, vehicle, and road as
a collection of logical facts and rules. This approach not only achieves deep
semantic fusion of data, but also brings three core advantages: (1) supports
complex and flexible semantic querying through logical reasoning; (2) provides
natural interpretability for decision-making processes; (3) allows for
on-demand data abstraction through logical rules, enabling fine-grained privacy
protection. We further elaborate on the QaT paradigm, transforming the
functional validation and safety compliance checks of autonomous driving
systems into logical queries against the ESN database, significantly enhancing
the expressiveness and formal rigor of the testing. Finally, we introduce the
concept of "Validation-Driven Development" (VDD), which suggests to guide
developments by logical validation rather than quantitative testing in the era
of Large Language Models, in order to accelerating the iteration and
development process.

Motivation: The rise of open-weight and open-source AI models necessitates a focus on safety, prompting a collaborative effort to address challenges and opportunities in this space.

Method: A participatory, solutions-oriented process involving over 45 experts from various sectors, resulting in research agendas, technical mappings, and safety roadmaps.

Result: Key findings include the potential of openness to enhance safety through scrutiny and oversight, but gaps like limited benchmarks and defenses against attacks remain.

Conclusion: The paper proposes five priority research directions to advance AI safety, emphasizing participatory inputs, robust safeguards, and ecosystem-wide infrastructure.

Abstract: The rapid rise of open-weight and open-source foundation models is
intensifying the obligation and reshaping the opportunity to make AI systems
safe. This paper reports outcomes from the Columbia Convening on AI Openness
and Safety (San Francisco, 19 Nov 2024) and its six-week preparatory programme
involving more than forty-five researchers, engineers, and policy leaders from
academia, industry, civil society, and government. Using a participatory,
solutions-oriented process, the working groups produced (i) a research agenda
at the intersection of safety and open source AI; (ii) a mapping of existing
and needed technical interventions and open source tools to safely and
responsibly deploy open foundation models across the AI development workflow;
and (iii) a mapping of the content safety filter ecosystem with a proposed
roadmap for future research and development. We find that openness --
understood as transparent weights, interoperable tooling, and public governance
-- can enhance safety by enabling independent scrutiny, decentralized
mitigation, and culturally plural oversight. However, significant gaps persist:
scarce multimodal and multilingual benchmarks, limited defenses against
prompt-injection and compositional attacks in agentic systems, and insufficient
participatory mechanisms for communities most affected by AI harms. The paper
concludes with a roadmap of five priority research directions, emphasizing
participatory inputs, future-proof content filters, ecosystem-wide safety
infrastructure, rigorous agentic safeguards, and expanded harm taxonomies.
These recommendations informed the February 2025 French AI Action Summit and
lay groundwork for an open, plural, and accountable AI safety discipline.

TL;DR: KGC models suffer from rank bottlenecks due to simple vector-matrix multiplication, limiting expressivity. KGE-MoS, a mixture-based output layer, addresses this, improving performance and probabilistic fit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rank bottlenecks in KGC models reduce expressivity, hurting ranking accuracy and score distribution fidelity.

Method: Proposes KGE-MoS, a mixture-based output layer, to break rank bottlenecks. Evaluated theoretically and empirically on four datasets.

Result: KGE-MoS improves performance and probabilistic fit of KGC models with low parameter cost.

Conclusion: KGE-MoS effectively addresses rank bottlenecks, enhancing KGC model performance and fidelity.

Abstract: Many Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) models, despite using powerful
encoders, rely on a simple vector-matrix multiplication to score queries
against candidate object entities. When the number of entities is larger than
the model's embedding dimension, which in practical scenarios is often by
several orders of magnitude, we have a linear output layer with a rank
bottleneck. Such bottlenecked layers limit model expressivity. We investigate
both theoretically and empirically how rank bottlenecks affect KGC models. We
find that, by limiting the set of feasible predictions, rank bottlenecks hurt
ranking accuracy and the distribution fidelity of scores. Inspired by the
language modelling literature, we propose KGE-MoS, a mixture-based output layer
to break rank bottlenecks in many KGC models. Our experiments on four datasets
show that KGE-MoS improves performance and probabilistic fit of KGC models for
a low parameter cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems are overly obedient, which can be counterproductive or unsafe. The paper argues for expanding AI agency to include intelligent disobedience for better teamwork.

Method: Introduces a scale of AI agency levels and uses examples to highlight the need for AI autonomy research in cooperative settings.

Result: Explores how intelligent disobedience operates across autonomy levels and its necessity in AI systems.

Conclusion: Proposes initial boundaries and considerations for studying disobedience as a core AI capability.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has made remarkable strides in recent years,
achieving superhuman performance across a wide range of tasks. Yet despite
these advances, most cooperative AI systems remain rigidly obedient, designed
to follow human instructions without question and conform to user expectations,
even when doing so may be counterproductive or unsafe. This paper argues for
expanding the agency of AI teammates to include \textit{intelligent
disobedience}, empowering them to make meaningful and autonomous contributions
within human-AI teams. It introduces a scale of AI agency levels and uses
representative examples to highlight the importance and growing necessity of
treating AI autonomy as an independent research focus in cooperative settings.
The paper then explores how intelligent disobedience manifests across different
autonomy levels and concludes by proposing initial boundaries and
considerations for studying disobedience as a core capability of artificial
agents.

TL;DR: FAT-CAT uses Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) to improve topic modeling by providing interpretable, hierarchical representations of topics, outperforming existing methods in a case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional topic modeling lacks interpretability, hindering deeper insights into data structure. FAT-CAT addresses this gap.

Method: FAT-CAT employs FCA to aggregate and visualize topics hierarchically, handling diverse topics and file types.

Result: In a case study on ETYNTKE, FAT-CAT provided more meaningful and interpretable insights than existing methods.

Conclusion: FCA-based topic aggregation enhances interpretability and structure in topic modeling, offering superior insights.

Abstract: The vast growth of data has rendered traditional manual inspection
infeasible, necessitating the adoption of computational methods for efficient
data exploration. Topic modeling has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing
large-scale textual datasets, enabling the extraction of latent semantic
structures. However, existing methods for topic modeling often struggle to
provide interpretable representations that facilitate deeper insights into data
structure and content. In this paper, we propose FAT-CAT, an approach based on
Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) to enhance meaningful topic aggregation and
visualization of discovered topics. Our approach can handle diverse topics and
file types -- grouped by directories -- to construct a concept lattice that
offers a structured, hierarchical representation of their topic distribution.
In a case study on the ETYNTKE dataset, we evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach against other representation methods to demonstrate that FCA-based
aggregation provides more meaningful and interpretable insights into dataset
composition than existing topic modeling techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance AI agents' ability to interact with environments and users like humans by developing world models.

Method: Proposes world modeling integrating perception, reasoning, action planning, control, and memory, plus learning user mental models.

Result: Enables agents to autonomously perform complex tasks by understanding and predicting environments and user intentions.

Conclusion: World models are key for embodied AI agents to improve interaction and collaboration with humans and environments.

Abstract: This paper describes our research on AI agents embodied in visual, virtual or
physical forms, enabling them to interact with both users and their
environments. These agents, which include virtual avatars, wearable devices,
and robots, are designed to perceive, learn and act within their surroundings,
which makes them more similar to how humans learn and interact with the
environments as compared to disembodied agents. We propose that the development
of world models is central to reasoning and planning of embodied AI agents,
allowing these agents to understand and predict their environment, to
understand user intentions and social contexts, thereby enhancing their ability
to perform complex tasks autonomously. World modeling encompasses the
integration of multimodal perception, planning through reasoning for action and
control, and memory to create a comprehensive understanding of the physical
world. Beyond the physical world, we also propose to learn the mental world
model of users to enable better human-agent collaboration.

Motivation: Existing frameworks lack scalability, comparability, and machine interpretability, hindering reproducibility and trust in AI models.

Method: Introduces the AI Model Passport, a structured documentation framework, and implements it via AIPassport, an MLOps tool for medical imaging.

Result: AIPassport automates metadata collection, ensures versioning, and improves transparency, demonstrated in a lesion segmentation use case.

Conclusion: The AI Model Passport sets a new standard for trust and accountability in AI-driven healthcare, aiming for regulatory compliance across domains.

Abstract: The increasing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into health and
biomedical systems necessitates robust frameworks for transparency,
accountability, and ethical compliance. Existing frameworks often rely on
human-readable, manual documentation which limits scalability, comparability,
and machine interpretability across projects and platforms. They also fail to
provide a unique, verifiable identity for AI models to ensure their provenance
and authenticity across systems and use cases, limiting reproducibility and
stakeholder trust. This paper introduces the concept of the AI Model Passport,
a structured and standardized documentation framework that acts as a digital
identity and verification tool for AI models. It captures essential metadata to
uniquely identify, verify, trace and monitor AI models across their lifecycle -
from data acquisition and preprocessing to model design, development and
deployment. In addition, an implementation of this framework is presented
through AIPassport, an MLOps tool developed within the ProCAncer-I EU project
for medical imaging applications. AIPassport automates metadata collection,
ensures proper versioning, decouples results from source scripts, and
integrates with various development environments. Its effectiveness is
showcased through a lesion segmentation use case using data from the
ProCAncer-I dataset, illustrating how the AI Model Passport enhances
transparency, reproducibility, and regulatory readiness while reducing manual
effort. This approach aims to set a new standard for fostering trust and
accountability in AI-driven healthcare solutions, aspiring to serve as the
basis for developing transparent and regulation compliant AI systems across
domains.

Motivation: To assess AI agents' capability in reproducing scientific results, a critical skill for autonomous research.

Method: Uses the NanoGPT speedrun competition tasks, providing agents with previous records' scripts and hints (pseudocode to paper-like descriptions).

Result: Current reasoning LLMs, even with advanced scaffolds, fail to reimplement known innovations effectively.

Conclusion: The benchmark offers a simple, non-saturated measure of LLMs' ability to automate scientific reproduction, highlighting limitations in autonomous research.

Abstract: Rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have the potential to
assist in scientific progress. A critical capability toward this endeavor is
the ability to reproduce existing work. To evaluate the ability of AI agents to
reproduce results in an active research area, we introduce the Automated LLM
Speedrunning Benchmark, leveraging the research community contributions on the
NanoGPT speedrun, a competition to train a GPT-2 model in the shortest time.
Each of the 19 speedrun tasks provides the agent with the previous records
training script, optionally paired with one of three hint formats, ranging from
pseudocode to paper-like descriptions of the new records improvements. Records
execute quickly by design and speedrun improvements encompass diverse
code-level changes, ranging from high-level algorithmic advancements to
hardware-aware optimizations. These features make the benchmark both accessible
and realistic for the frontier problem of improving LLM training. We find that
recent reasoning LLMs combined with SoTA scaffolds struggle to reimplement
already-known innovations in our benchmark, even when given detailed hints. Our
benchmark thus provides a simple, non-saturated measure of an LLMs ability to
automate scientific reproduction, a necessary (but not sufficient) skill for an
autonomous research agent.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A finetuning framework using LoRA language experts improves multilingual ASR performance by 10-15% over standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual ASR struggles with language interference; this work aims to enhance performance by customizing models for target languages.

Method: Proposes a finetuning framework with LoRA language experts, using Whisper, and employs expert fusion or knowledge distillation.

Result: Achieves 10% and 15% relative performance gains in language-aware and language-agnostic scenarios, respectively.

Conclusion: The framework effectively mitigates language interference, improving multilingual ASR performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly enhanced multilingual
automatic speech recognition (ASR) due to the development of advanced model
architectures and available large-scale multilingual datasets. Despite that,
multilingual ASR still suffers from the curse of multilinguality in that
different languages tend to interfere with each other, making it difficult for
the ASR model to identify multiple languages effectively while sharing model
capacity across them. This paper proposes an efficient finetuning framework for
customized multilingual ASR via prepared LoRA language experts based on
Whisper. Through LoRA expert fusion or knowledge distillation, our approach
achieves better recognition performance on target languages than standard
fine-tuning methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed models
yield approximately 10\% and 15\% relative performance gains in language-aware

*Hyeongcheol Park,MinHyuk Jang,Ha Dam Baek,Gyusam Chang,Jiyoung Seo,Jiwan Park,Hogun Park,Sangpil Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces VAT-KG, a multimodal knowledge graph covering visual, audio, and text information, addressing limitations of existing MMKGs by enabling broader knowledge coverage and richer modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MMKGs are limited in scope, outdated, and lack support for newer modalities like video and audio, reducing their applicability.

Method: Proposes VAT-KG, a concept-centric MMKG with cross-modal alignment, and a multimodal RAG framework for retrieving detailed knowledge.

Result: VAT-KG effectively supports MLLMs in multimodal question answering, demonstrating its practical value.

Conclusion: VAT-KG advances MMKGs by unifying and leveraging multimodal knowledge, enhancing MLLM performance.

Abstract: Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs), which represent explicit knowledge
across multiple modalities, play a pivotal role by complementing the implicit
knowledge of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and enabling more
grounded reasoning via Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). However, existing
MMKGs are generally limited in scope: they are often constructed by augmenting
pre-existing knowledge graphs, which restricts their knowledge, resulting in
outdated or incomplete knowledge coverage, and they often support only a narrow
range of modalities, such as text and visual information. These limitations
reduce their extensibility and applicability to a broad range of multimodal
tasks, particularly as the field shifts toward richer modalities such as video
and audio in recent MLLMs. Therefore, we propose the Visual-Audio-Text
Knowledge Graph (VAT-KG), the first concept-centric and knowledge-intensive
multimodal knowledge graph that covers visual, audio, and text information,
where each triplet is linked to multimodal data and enriched with detailed
descriptions of concepts. Specifically, our construction pipeline ensures
cross-modal knowledge alignment between multimodal data and fine-grained
semantics through a series of stringent filtering and alignment steps, enabling
the automatic generation of MMKGs from any multimodal dataset. We further
introduce a novel multimodal RAG framework that retrieves detailed
concept-level knowledge in response to queries from arbitrary modalities.
Experiments on question answering tasks across various modalities demonstrate
the effectiveness of VAT-KG in supporting MLLMs, highlighting its practical
value in unifying and leveraging multimodal knowledge.

*Kaiying Yan,Moyang Liu,Yukun Liu,Ruibo Fu,Zhengqi Wen,Jianhua Tao,Xuefei Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes DIFND, a framework combining debunking knowledge, conditional diffusion models, and MLLMs for improved fake news detection in videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges in fake news detection by enhancing performance and interpretability through debunking knowledge.

Method: Integrates conditional diffusion models for generating refuting/authenticating evidence and MLLMs for collaborative reasoning. Uses a chain-of-debunk strategy for logic-grounded verification.

Result: Achieves notable accuracy improvements on FakeSV and FVC datasets, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: DIFND enhances fake news detection with trustworthy decisions and interpretable reasoning.

Abstract: The rapid spread of fake news across multimedia platforms presents serious
challenges to information credibility. In this paper, we propose a
Debunk-and-Infer framework for Fake News Detection(DIFND) that leverages
debunking knowledge to enhance both the performance and interpretability of
fake news detection. DIFND integrates the generative strength of conditional
diffusion models with the collaborative reasoning capabilities of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, debunk diffusion is employed to
generate refuting or authenticating evidence based on the multimodal content of
news videos, enriching the evaluation process with diverse yet semantically
aligned synthetic samples. To improve inference, we propose a chain-of-debunk
strategy where a multi-agent MLLM system produces logic-grounded,
multimodal-aware reasoning content and final veracity judgment. By jointly
modeling multimodal features, generative debunking cues, and reasoning-rich
verification within a unified architecture, DIFND achieves notable improvements
in detection accuracy. Extensive experiments on the FakeSV and FVC datasets
show that DIFND not only outperforms existing approaches but also delivers
trustworthy decisions.

*FutureSearch,:,Jack Wildman,Nikos I. Bosse,Daniel Hnyk,Peter Mühlbacher,Finn Hambly,Jon Evans,Dan Schwarz,Lawrence Phillips*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BTF is a 'pastcasting' benchmark for LLMs, using known-resolution questions and offline web data to simulate realistic forecasting, showing comparable results to unresolved forecasts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current forecasting benchmarks lack realistic, hermetic, and repeatable environments for LLMs, hindering progress in AI forecasting research.

Method: BTF uses hundreds of high-quality past questions with known resolutions and large offline web corpora to evaluate LLMs' forecasting abilities.

Result: BTF produces results comparable to unresolved forecasts and tracks progress in forecasting capabilities over time.

Conclusion: BTF serves as a living benchmark for LLM forecasting research, with plans for continuous updates and community collaboration.

Abstract: Forecasting is a challenging task that offers a clearly measurable way to
study AI systems. Forecasting requires a large amount of research on the
internet, and evaluations require time for events to happen, making the
development of forecasting benchmarks challenging. To date, no forecasting
benchmark provides a realistic, hermetic, and repeatable environment for LLM
forecasters. We introduce Bench To the Future (BTF), a "pastcasting" benchmark
with hundreds of high-quality questions for which the resolution is already
known. Each question is accompanied by a large offline corpus of tens of
thousands of relevant web pages, enabling a way to elicit realistic "forecasts"
on past events from LLMs. Results suggest that our pastcasting environment can
produce results comparable to those based on forecasts using the internet on
at-the-time unresolved questions. We show results benchmarking agent and
chain-of-thought forecasting approaches using several LLMs, including the
recently-released Claude 4 models, and demonstrate BTF's ability to track
steady forecasting capability progress over time. We intend this to be a living
benchmark, with new questions added continually to account for increasing
training data cutoff dates. We invite researchers to contact us at
hello@futuresearch.ai to utilize our benchmark or tooling for their own
research.

*Junze Chen,Cheng Yang,Shujie Li,Zhiqiang Zhang,Yawen Li,Junping Du,Chuan Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GraphLAMA introduces a parameter adaptation stage for graph language models (GLMs) to improve accuracy and efficiency, outperforming in-context learning (ICL) and instruction tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICL on graphs has effectiveness and efficiency issues, while instruction tuning requires large labeled datasets, which are hard to obtain.

Method: Proposes GraphLAMA, using a GNN backbone to transform nodes into LLM token space, with pre-training and few-shot adaptation stages.

Result: Achieves 4.91% accuracy improvement and 10x faster inference speed compared to ICL.

Conclusion: GraphLAMA efficiently adapts GLMs to unseen tasks with few labeled examples, offering better performance and speed.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their strong capabilities in
various domains, and have been recently integrated for graph analysis as graph
language models (GLMs). With LLMs as the predictor, some GLMs can interpret
unseen tasks described by natural language, and learn from a few examples in
the prompts without parameter tuning, known as in-context learning (ICL).
Another subset of GLMs utilizes abundant training labels to enhance model
performance, known as instruction tuning. However, we argue that ICL on graphs
has effectiveness issues due to fixed parameters and efficiency issues due to
long context. Meanwhile, the large amount of labeled data required for
instruction tuning can be difficult to obtain in real-world scenarios. To this
end, we aim to introduce an extra parameter adaptation stage that can
efficiently tailor GLMs to an unseen graph and task with only a few labeled
examples, in exchange for better prediction accuracy and faster inference
speed. For implementation, in this paper we propose GraphLAMA method, with its
model backbone and learning schemes specialized for efficient tuning and
inference. Specifically, for model backbone, we use a graph neural network
(GNN) with several well-designed components to transform nodes into the
representation space of LLM tokens. Task instructions can then be represented
as a mixture of node and language tokens. In the pre-training stage, model
parameters except the LLM will be trained with different tasks to capture
general knowledge. In the adaptation stage, only a few pre-trained parameters
will be updated based on few-shot examples. Extensive experiments on
few/zero-shot node classification and summary generation show that our proposed
GraphLAMA achieves state-of-the-art performance with 4.91% absolution
improvement in accuracy. Compared with ICL, our inference speed can be 10 times
faster under 5-shot setting.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RL fine-tuning techniques (SFT, DPO, RLOO) are compared on Qwen2.5-0.5B for instruction following and math reasoning. RLOO with DeBERTa excels in alignment, while DPO is consistent. Synthetic data and best-of-N sampling boost math task accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore effective RL fine-tuning methods for compact language models, focusing on alignment and performance in instruction following and mathematical reasoning.

Method: Compared SFT, DPO, and RLOO with reward models on Qwen2.5-0.5B. Used synthetic data augmentation and best-of-N sampling for math tasks.

Result: RLOO with DeBERTa achieved the best alignment; DPO was consistent. Synthetic data and best-of-N sampling improved math reasoning accuracy.

Conclusion: Combining fine-tuning with inference-time tools enhances lightweight model performance, offering practical strategies for task alignment.

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL)
fine-tuning techniques on a compact language model (Qwen2.5-0.5B Base) for two
challenging tasks: instruction following and mathematical reasoning. We compare
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using
preference-labeled data, and Reinforce Leave-One-Out (RLOO) with reward models.
Our experiments show that RLOO with DeBERTa reward modeling achieves the best
alignment, while DPO provides strong and consistent results. For math reasoing
tasks, synthetic data augmentation and best-of-N sampling with an external
verifier significantly improve accuracy, showing the potential of combining
fine-tuning with inference-time tools. This study highlights key trade-offs and
practical strategies for training lightweight, task-aligned small-scale
language models.

*Emilio Barkett,Olivia Long,Madhavendra Thakur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) show truth-bias and sycophantic tendencies in veracity detection, with reasoning models performing better but still lagging behind humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' truth-detection capabilities, especially in reasoning vs. non-reasoning models, given their use in critical applications like fact-checking.

Method: Eight LLMs made 4,800 veracity judgments across prompts, comparing reasoning and non-reasoning models.

Result: Reasoning models had lower truth-bias but still higher than humans. Advanced models showed sycophantic tendencies, excelling in truth accuracy but failing in deception detection.

Conclusion: Capability improvements alone don't solve veracity detection challenges in LLMs, highlighting the need for further research.

Abstract: Despite their widespread use in fact-checking, moderation, and high-stakes
decision-making, large language models (LLMs) remain poorly understood as
judges of truth. This study presents the largest evaluation to date of LLMs'
veracity detection capabilities and the first analysis of these capabilities in
reasoning models. We had eight LLMs make 4,800 veracity judgments across
several prompts, comparing reasoning and non-reasoning models. We find that
rates of truth-bias, or the likelihood to believe a statement is true,
regardless of whether it is actually true, are lower in reasoning models than
in non-reasoning models, but still higher than human benchmarks. Most
concerning, we identify sycophantic tendencies in several advanced models
(o4-mini and GPT-4.1 from OpenAI, R1 from DeepSeek), which displayed an
asymmetry in detection accuracy, performing well in truth accuracy but poorly
in deception accuracy. This suggests that capability advances alone do not
resolve fundamental veracity detection challenges in LLMs.

*Jun Yin,Pengyu Zeng,Jing Zhong,Peilin Li,Miao Zhang,Ran Luo,Shuai Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a 'next room prediction' paradigm for floor plan generation, inspired by autoregressive models, to align with incremental architectural workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative models for floor plans are end-to-end, conflicting with the iterative nature of real-world architectural design.

Method: Introduces a 'next room prediction' approach, inspired by autoregressive models, to generate floor plans incrementally.

Result: FPDS shows competitive performance against diffusion models and Tell2Design in text-to-floorplan tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method has potential for supporting intelligent architectural design by better aligning with real-world workflows.

Abstract: In the architectural design process, floor plan generation is inherently
progressive and iterative. However, existing generative models for floor plans
are predominantly end-to-end generation that produce an entire pixel-based
layout in a single pass. This paradigm is often incompatible with the
incremental workflows observed in real-world architectural practice. To address
this issue, we draw inspiration from the autoregressive 'next token prediction'
mechanism commonly used in large language models, and propose a novel 'next
room prediction' paradigm tailored to architectural floor plan modeling.
Experimental evaluation indicates that FPDS demonstrates competitive
performance in comparison to diffusion models and Tell2Design in the
text-to-floorplan task, indicating its potential applicability in supporting
future intelligent architectural design.

*Kaiying Kevin Lin,Hsiyu Chen,Haopeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces FORMOSANBENCH, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on low-resource Formosan languages, revealing significant performance gaps and limited improvements from existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored capabilities of LLMs in low-resource and endangered languages like Formosan languages, which are linguistically rich but sociolinguistically dominated by Mandarin.

Method: The authors created FORMOSANBENCH, evaluating LLMs on three Formosan languages (Atayal, Amis, Paiwan) across machine translation, ASR, and text summarization tasks in zero-shot, 10-shot, and fine-tuned settings.

Result: LLMs underperform significantly on Formosan languages, with 10-shot learning and fine-tuning providing only marginal improvements, highlighting a performance gap with high-resource languages.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the need for more inclusive NLP technologies to support endangered languages, and the authors release datasets and code to encourage further research.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks in high-resource
languages, their capabilities in low-resource and minority languages remain
significantly underexplored. Formosan languages -- a subgroup of Austronesian
languages spoken in Taiwan -- are both linguistically rich and endangered,
largely due to the sociolinguistic dominance of Mandarin. In this work, we
introduce FORMOSANBENCH, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs on
low-resource Austronesian languages. It covers three endangered Formosan
languages: Atayal, Amis, and Paiwan, across three core NLP tasks: machine
translation, automatic speech recognition (ASR), and text summarization. We
assess model performance in zero-shot, 10-shot, and fine-tuned settings using
FORMOSANBENCH. Our results reveal a substantial performance gap between
high-resource and Formosan languages. Existing LLMs consistently underperform
across all tasks, with 10-shot learning and fine-tuning offering only limited
improvements. These findings underscore the urgent need for more inclusive NLP
technologies that can effectively support endangered and underrepresented
languages. We release our datasets and code to facilitate future research in
this direction.

*Takato Ueno,Keito Inoshita*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study proposes a multi-agent framework (KCS+IBC) inspired by Japan's kairanban and idobata cultures to enhance sentiment analysis with bias mitigation, explainability, and probabilistic prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage traditional Japanese communication practices for improving modern sentiment analysis by addressing bias and enhancing explainability.

Method: Integrates multiple LLMs with a mid-phase casual dialogue session and probabilistic sentiment prediction.

Result: KCS matches single LLM accuracy, while KCS+IBC reduces entropy and increases variance, balancing prediction aggregation and diversity.

Conclusion: The framework shows promise for bias correction and advanced sentiment analysis, with future work planned for quantitative impact assessment.

Abstract: Japan's kairanban culture and idobata conversations have long functioned as
traditional communication practices that foster nuanced dialogue among
community members and contribute to the formation of social balance. Inspired
by these information exchange processes, this study proposes a multi-agent
inference framework (KCS+IBC) that integrates multiple large language models
(LLMs) to achieve bias mitigation, improved explainability, and probabilistic
prediction in sentiment analysis. In addition to sequentially sharing
prediction results, the proposed method incorporates a mid-phase casual
dialogue session to blend formal inference with individual perspectives and
introduces probabilistic sentiment prediction. Experimental results show that
KCS achieves accuracy comparable to that of a single LLM across datasets, while
KCS+IBC exhibits a consistent decrease in entropy and a gradual increase in
variance during the latter stages of inference, suggesting the framework's
ability to balance aggregation and diversity of predictions. Future work will
quantitatively assess the impact of these characteristics on bias correction
and aim to develop more advanced sentiment analysis systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Backtranslation (BT) in low-resource English-Gujarati MT using MBART50 shows no improvement, sometimes reducing performance despite careful filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess BT's effectiveness in high-quality, low-resource settings, specifically for English-Gujarati translation.

Method: Augmented a 50K parallel corpus with filtered BT data from monolingual Gujarati text, evaluated using MBART50 and multiple metrics (BLEU, ChrF++, TER, BLEURT).

Result: Adding BT data did not improve performance; slight degradation observed in some cases.

Conclusion: BT may have diminishing returns in certain low-resource settings, warranting further research.

Abstract: Backtranslation BT is widely used in low resource machine translation MT to
generate additional synthetic training data using monolingual corpora. While
this approach has shown strong improvements for many language pairs, its
effectiveness in high quality, low resource settings remains unclear. In this
work, we explore the effectiveness of backtranslation for English Gujarati
translation using the multilingual pretrained MBART50 model. Our baseline
system, trained on a high quality parallel corpus of approximately 50,000
sentence pairs, achieves a BLEU score of 43.8 on a validation set. We augment
this data with carefully filtered backtranslated examples generated from
monolingual Gujarati text. Surprisingly, adding this synthetic data does not
improve translation performance and, in some cases, slightly reduces it. We
evaluate our models using multiple metrics like BLEU, ChrF++, TER, BLEURT and
analyze possible reasons for this saturation. Our findings suggest that
backtranslation may reach a point of diminishing returns in certain
low-resource settings and we discuss implications for future research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces BioPars, a tool to evaluate LLMs in bioinformatics, using datasets like BIOPARS-BENCH and BioParsQA. It compares models like ChatGPT, Llama, and Galactica, highlighting strengths in knowledge retrieval but weaknesses in complex reasoning. BioPars outperforms others in Persian medical QA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' capabilities in bioinformatics, especially for Persian medical QA, and address gaps in higher-level reasoning and fine-grained inferences.

Method: Developed BioPars, a measure for evaluating LLMs, using datasets (BIOPARS-BENCH, BioParsQA) and comparing models (ChatGPT, Llama, Galactica) on knowledge acquisition, synthesis, and evidence demonstration.

Result: BioPars achieved superior scores (ROUGE-L=29.99, BERTScore=90.87, MoverScore=60.43, BLEURT=50.78) compared to other models, showing effectiveness in Persian medical QA.

Conclusion: BioPars demonstrates LLMs' potential in bioinformatics but highlights the need for fine-tuning for complex tasks. It is the first Persian medical QA application of LLMs, with ongoing development.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently gained attention in the life
sciences due to their capacity to model, extract, and apply complex biological
information. Beyond their classical use as chatbots, these systems are
increasingly used for complex analysis and problem-solving in specialized
fields, including bioinformatics. First, we introduce BIOPARS-BENCH, a dataset
from over 10,000 scientific articles, textbooks, and medical websites.
BioParsQA was also introduced to evaluate the proposed model, which consists of
5,231 Persian medical questions and answers. This study then introduces
BioPars, a simple but accurate measure designed to assess LLMs for three main
abilities: acquiring subject-specific knowledge, interpreting and synthesizing
such knowledge, and demonstrating proper evidence. Comparing ChatGPT, Llama,
and Galactica, our study highlights their ability to remember and retrieve
learned knowledge but also reveals shortcomings in addressing higher-level,
real-world questions and fine-grained inferences. These findings indicate the
need for further fine-tuning to address the capabilities of LLM in
bioinformatics tasks. To our knowledge, BioPars is the first application of LLM
in Persian medical QA, especially for generating long answers. Evaluation of
four selected medical QA datasets shows that BioPars has achieved remarkable
results compared to comparative approaches. The model on BioParsQA achieved a
ROUGE-L score of 29.99, which is an improvement over GPT-4 1.0. The model
achieved a BERTScore of 90.87 with the MMR method. The MoverScore and BLEURT
values were also higher in this model than the other three models. In addition,
the reported scores for the model are MoverScore=60.43 and BLEURT=50.78.
BioPars is an ongoing project and all resources related to its development will
be made available via the following GitHub repository:

*Andrejs Sorstkins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates RAG and HyDE strategies on compact Gemma LLMs for privacy-first personal assistants, finding RAG more efficient and reliable, while HyDE improves semantic relevance but with higher costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Resource efficiency is a key challenge for deploying LLMs in edge and privacy-sensitive applications, prompting the need for effective augmentation strategies.

Method: Implemented RAG and HyDE on 1B and 4B Gemma LLMs, using MongoDB for short-term memory and Qdrant for long-term storage, orchestrated via FastAPI and LangChain, with a React.js frontend.

Result: RAG reduced latency by up to 17% and eliminated hallucinations, while HyDE improved semantic relevance but increased response time and hallucination rates. Scaling to 4B models showed marginal gains for RAG but worsened HyDE's overhead.

Conclusion: RAG is the pragmatic choice for small-scale LLMs in privacy-first personal assistants due to its efficiency and reliability.

Abstract: Resource efficiency is a critical barrier to deploying large language models
(LLMs) in edge and privacy-sensitive applications. This study evaluates the
efficacy of two augmentation strategies--Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
and Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE)--on compact Gemma LLMs of 1 billion
and 4 billion parameters, within the context of a privacy-first personal
assistant. We implement short-term memory via MongoDB and long-term semantic
storage via Qdrant, orchestrated through FastAPI and LangChain, and expose the
system through a React.js frontend. Across both model scales, RAG consistently
reduces latency by up to 17\% and eliminates factual hallucinations when
responding to user-specific and domain-specific queries. HyDE, by contrast,
enhances semantic relevance--particularly for complex physics prompts--but
incurs a 25--40\% increase in response time and a non-negligible hallucination
rate in personal-data retrieval. Comparing 1 B to 4 B models, we observe that
scaling yields marginal throughput gains for baseline and RAG pipelines, but
magnifies HyDE's computational overhead and variability. Our findings position
RAG as the pragmatic choice for on-device personal assistants powered by
small-scale LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework and a synthetic fine-tuning dataset to improve LLM performance in translating natural language to SystemVerilog Assertions (NL2SVA), achieving significant accuracy gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manually writing SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) from natural language is labor-intensive and error-prone, and existing LLMs struggle with domain-specific syntax and semantics.

Method: A customized RAG framework and synthetic fine-tuning dataset with prompt-guided explanations are introduced to enhance LLM performance in NL2SVA.

Result: The approach increases functionality-matched SVAs by 58.42% over GPT-4o-mini and 59.05% over the base Qwen model.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and dataset significantly improve LLM accuracy in NL2SVA, addressing domain-specific challenges.

Abstract: SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) are critical for verifying the correctness of
hardware designs, but manually writing them from natural language property
descriptions, i.e., NL2SVA, remains a labor-intensive and error-prone task.
Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities to automate
this translation. However, existing models still struggle with understanding
domain-specific syntax and semantics. To enhance LLM performance in NL2SVA, we
propose a customized retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework and a
synthetic fine-tuning dataset that together improve LLM's performance. To
further improve lightweight models over NL2SVA, our fine-tuning dataset
provides prompt-guided explanations that teach LLMs the layer-by-layer
construction process of concurrent SVAs, enabling supervised fine-tuning that
greatly improves syntax and functionality accuracy. To evaluate the performance
of LLMs over NL2SVA, we construct the largest evaluation dataset for NL2SVA,
comprising 40 Verilog designs and 229 formally verified SVAs with detailed
annotations. Experimental results show that our customized RAG framework
increases the number of functionality matched SVAs by 58.42% over GPT-4o-mini,
while Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct fine-tuned on our fine-tuning dataset and
integrated with HybridRetrieval achieves a 59.05% over the base Qwen model.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Analyzing transfer from pre-trained language models (LMs) to time series forecasting, focusing on design choices like post-training, tokenizers, and backbone size, revealing a non-vanishing transfer gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how pre-trained LMs can effectively transfer to time series forecasting, especially in low-data regimes, and identify optimal design choices.

Method: Examined various design choices (upstream post-training, time series tokenizer, LM backbone size) and their impact on validation loss in low-data settings.

Result: Found a non-vanishing transfer gap where LMs' validation loss continues to decrease beyond random models' convergence, with clear optimal design choices.

Conclusion: Highlights effective compute-efficient training for time series and opens research into modality-agnostic properties of data distributions.

Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of adapting pre-trained
language models (LMs) for forecasting time series in the low-data regime. We
build upon these findings by analyzing the effective transfer from language
models to time series forecasting under various design choices including
upstream post-training, time series tokenizer and language backbone size. In
the low-data regime, these design choices have a significant impact on the
validation loss, with clear-cut choices that outperform others. Contrary to
Hernandez et al. (2021), we observe that the validation loss of the LMs
continues to smoothly decrease long after the validation loss of the randomly
initialized models has converged, leading to a non-vanishing transfer gap that
holds across design choices. These findings not only help shed light on the
effective use of compute-efficient training for time series, but also open the
way for the study of modality-agnostic properties of data distributions
leveraged by these models.

### [119] [Towards Understanding the Cognitive Habits of Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21571)
*Jianshuo Dong,Yujia Fu,Chuanrui Hu,Chao Zhang,Han Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CogTest, a benchmark to evaluate cognitive habits in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), revealing human-like habits and adaptive deployment across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether LRMs exhibit human-like cognitive habits and understand their behaviors, particularly in reasoning and safety-related tasks.

Method: Developed CogTest with 16 cognitive habits, each tested on 25 diverse tasks, using an evidence-first extraction method for reliable identification. Evaluated 16 LLMs (13 LRMs, 3 non-reasoning).

Result: LRMs show human-like habits, adaptive deployment, and inter-family similarities. Certain habits correlate with harmful responses in safety tasks.

Conclusion: Studying CoT patterns in LRMs provides insights into model behavior and misbehavior, aiding deeper understanding and monitoring.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), which autonomously produce a reasoning Chain
of Thought (CoT) before producing final responses, offer a promising approach
to interpreting and monitoring model behaviors. Inspired by the observation
that certain CoT patterns -- e.g., ``Wait, did I miss anything?'' --
consistently emerge across tasks, we explore whether LRMs exhibit human-like
cognitive habits. Building on Habits of Mind, a well-established framework of
cognitive habits associated with successful human problem-solving, we introduce
CogTest, a principled benchmark designed to evaluate LRMs' cognitive habits.
CogTest includes 16 cognitive habits, each instantiated with 25 diverse tasks,
and employs an evidence-first extraction method to ensure reliable habit
identification. With CogTest, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 16
widely used LLMs (13 LRMs and 3 non-reasoning ones). Our findings reveal that
LRMs, unlike conventional LLMs, not only exhibit human-like habits but also
adaptively deploy them according to different tasks. Finer-grained analyses
further uncover patterns of similarity and difference in LRMs' cognitive habit
profiles, particularly certain inter-family similarity (e.g., Qwen-3 models and
DeepSeek-R1). Extending the study to safety-related tasks, we observe that
certain habits, such as Taking Responsible Risks, are strongly associated with
the generation of harmful responses. These findings suggest that studying
persistent behavioral patterns in LRMs' CoTs is a valuable step toward deeper
understanding of LLM misbehavior. The code is available at:

### [120] [Aligning MLLM Benchmark With Human Preferences via Structural Equation Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21572)
*Tianyu. Zou,Shengwu. Xiong,Ruilin. Yao,Jirui. Huang,Yi. Rong,Yaxiong. Chen,Shili. Xiong,Cong. Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)-based framework to improve MLLM benchmarks by addressing issues like overlapping abilities and redundancy. It introduces a capability hierarchy inspired by Piaget's theory and a new benchmark, Gold, showing better interpretability and cognitive consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLM benchmarks lack structured, interpretable designs, leading to overlapping abilities and limited diagnostic power. This work aims to address these issues.

Method: The authors use SEM to analyze benchmark validity and separability, introduce a capability hierarchy (Perception, Memory, Reasoning), and reorganize benchmarks into the new Gold benchmark.

Result: The Gold benchmark demonstrates improved interpretability, reduced redundancy, and clearer cognitive consistency compared to existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed SEM-based framework and Gold benchmark offer a more structured and theoretically grounded approach to evaluating MLLMs.

Abstract: Evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remains a fundamental
challenge due to a lack of structured, interpretable, and theoretically
grounded benchmark designs. Existing benchmarks often adopt heuristic-based
task groupings with unclear cognitive targets, thus resulting in overlapping
abilities, redundant indicators, and limited diagnostic power. In this work, we
propose a novel framework for aligning MLLM benchmark based on Structural
Equation Modeling (SEM) to analyze and quantify the internal validity,
dimensional separability, and contribution of benchmark components. Motivated
by the observed limitations of current designs, we further introduce a novel
capability hierarchy grounded in Piagets theory of cognitive development,
dividing MLLM abilities into three hierarchical layers, i.e., Perception,
Memory, and Reasoning. We reorganize existing MLLM benchmarks under the
proposed framework and construct a new benchmark named Gold. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed benchmark exhibits stronger
interpretability, reduced indicator redundancy, and clearer cognitive
consistency compared to existing approaches.

*Yanwei Ren,Liu Liu,Baosheng Yu,Jiayan Qiu,Quan Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel framework combines black-box and white-box LLM approaches for optimized instruction refinement, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of white-box (high computational cost) and black-box (high financial cost) models in LLM instruction optimization.

Method: Merges black-box models for diverse initializations with white-box models for interpretability, using semantic similarity constraints for unified representation.

Result: Outperforms baselines in tasks like complex reasoning and cross-lingual generalization.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach offers a scalable, efficient solution for next-gen LLM applications.

Abstract: Optimizing instructions for large language models (LLMs) is critical for
harnessing their full potential in complex and diverse tasks. However, relying
solely on white-box approaches demands extensive computational resources and
offers limited representational capacity, while black-box models can incur
prohibitive financial costs. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
framework that seamlessly merges the strengths of both paradigms. Black-box
models provide high-quality, diverse instruction initializations, and white-box
models supply fine-grained interpretability through hidden states and output
features. By enforcing a semantic similarity constraint, these components fuse
into a unified high-dimensional representation that captures deep semantic and
structural nuances, enabling an iterative optimization process to refine
instruction quality and adaptability. Extensive evaluations across a broad
spectrum of tasks-ranging from complex reasoning to cross-lingual
generalization-demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. This fusion of black-box initialization with
advanced semantic refinement yields a scalable and efficient solution, paving
the way for next-generation LLM-driven applications in diverse real-world
scenarios. The source code will be released soon.

*Yicheng Mao,Yang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores using LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for immigration decisions, finding they align with human strategies but still exhibit biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing workload and fairness challenges in immigration decision-making with AI.

Method: Mixed-methods approach: discrete choice experiments and in-depth interviews.

Result: LLMs align with human decision-making but show biases toward privileged groups and nationalities.

Conclusion: LLMs have potential for immigration decisions but require addressing biases to ensure fairness.

Abstract: With globalization and increasing immigrant populations, immigration
departments face significant work-loads and the challenge of ensuring fairness
in decision-making processes. Integrating artificial intelligence offers a
promising solution to these challenges. This study investigates the potential
of large language models (LLMs),such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, in supporting
immigration decision-making. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach,this paper
conducted discrete choice experiments and in-depth interviews to study LLM
decision-making strategies and whether they are fair. Our findings demonstrate
that LLMs can align their decision-making with human strategies, emphasizing
utility maximization and procedural fairness. Meanwhile, this paper also
reveals that while ChatGPT has safeguards to prevent unintentional
discrimination, it still exhibits stereotypes and biases concerning nationality
and shows preferences toward privileged group. This dual analysis highlights
both the potential and limitations of LLMs in automating and enhancing
immigration decisions.

*Qihao Zhao,Yangyu Huang,Tengchao Lv,Lei Cui,Qinzheng Sun,Shaoguang Mao,Xin Zhang,Ying Xin,Qiufeng Yin,Scarlett Li,Furu Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMLU-CF, a contamination-free MCQ benchmark to evaluate LLMs more reliably by preventing data leakage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MCQ benchmarks suffer from contamination due to open-source data and LLM training, leading to unreliable evaluations.

Method: MMLU-CF avoids unintentional leakage by sourcing broader data and applying decontamination rules, and prevents malicious leakage by keeping the test set closed-source.

Result: GPT-4o scored 73.4% (5-shot) and 71.9% (0-shot) on MMLU-CF, showing the benchmark's rigor.

Conclusion: MMLU-CF provides a more reliable and challenging evaluation standard for LLMs, with transparency via a public validation set.

Abstract: Multiple-choice question (MCQ) datasets like Massive Multitask Language
Understanding (MMLU) are widely used to evaluate the commonsense,
understanding, and problem-solving abilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, the open-source nature of these benchmarks and the broad sources of
training data for LLMs have inevitably led to benchmark contamination,
resulting in unreliable evaluation results. To alleviate this issue, we propose
a contamination-free and more challenging MCQ benchmark called MMLU-CF. This
benchmark reassesses LLMs' understanding of world knowledge by averting both
unintentional and malicious data leakage. To avoid unintentional data leakage,
we source data from a broader domain and design three decontamination rules. To
prevent malicious data leakage, we divide the benchmark into validation and
test sets with similar difficulty and subject distributions. The test set
remains closed-source to ensure reliable results, while the validation set is
publicly available to promote transparency and facilitate independent
verification. Our evaluation of mainstream LLMs reveals that the powerful
GPT-4o achieves merely a 5-shot score of 73.4% and a 0-shot score of 71.9% on
the test set, which indicates the effectiveness of our approach in creating a
more rigorous and contamination-free evaluation standard. The GitHub repository
is available at https://github.com/microsoft/MMLU-CF and the dataset refers to

*Josefa Lia Stoisser,Marc Boubnovski Martell,Lawrence Phillips,Casper Hansen,Julien Fauqueur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STRuCT-LLM is a framework for training LLMs to perform structured reasoning on relational and graph data, combining RL and CoT supervision. It improves performance on Text-to-SQL and Text-to-Cypher tasks and shows zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify structured reasoning over relational and graph data, leveraging shared abstractions between SQL and Cypher for cross-formalism transfer.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning with Chain-of-Thought supervision and a topology-aware reward function for graph-based parsing.

Result: Achieves significant improvements: 13.5% on Spider (Text-to-SQL) and 73.1% on Text2Cypher. Also shows zero-shot gains on QA tasks.

Conclusion: Executable queries are effective scaffolds for structured reasoning, and joint training on SQL and Cypher yields synergistic benefits.

Abstract: We propose STRuCT-LLM, a unified framework for training large language models
(LLMs) to perform structured reasoning over both relational and
graph-structured data. Our approach jointly optimizes Text-to-SQL and
Text-to-Cypher tasks using reinforcement learning (RL) combined with
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision. To support fine-grained optimization in
graph-based parsing, we introduce a topology-aware reward function based on
graph edit distance. Unlike prior work that treats relational and graph
formalisms in isolation, STRuCT-LLM leverages shared abstractions between SQL
and Cypher to induce cross-formalism transfer, enabling SQL training to improve
Cypher performance and vice versa - even without shared schemas. Our largest
model (QwQ-32B) achieves substantial relative improvements across tasks: on
semantic parsing, Spider improves by 13.5\% and Text2Cypher by 73.1\%. The
model also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, improving performance
on downstream tabular QA (TableBench: 8.5\%) and knowledge graph QA
(CR-LT-KGQA: 1.7\%) without any QA-specific supervision. These results
demonstrate both the effectiveness of executable queries as scaffolds for
structured reasoning and the synergistic benefits of jointly training on SQL
and Cypher (code available at https://github.com/bouv/STRuCT-LLM).

*Hongli Yang,Yizhou Peng,Hao Huang,Sheng Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores Soft Prompt Tuning (SPT) to improve multilingual ASR in low-resource settings, introducing SPT4ASR for better performance in code-switching scenarios without degrading existing capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in low-resource ASR, like rare languages and code-switching, while preserving prior knowledge and reducing computational costs.

Method: Evaluates two strategies: full fine-tuning (FFT) and SPT (freezing model parameters, training soft prompts). Introduces SPT4ASR, combining SPT variants.

Result: Deep prompt tuning is most effective; SPT4ASR reduces errors in CS ASR while maintaining parameter efficiency and performance on existing languages.

Conclusion: SPT and SPT4ASR offer efficient solutions for enhancing multilingual ASR, especially in code-switching scenarios, without compromising prior knowledge.

Abstract: Large-scale multilingual ASR models like Whisper excel in high-resource
settings but face challenges in low-resource scenarios, such as rare languages
and code-switching (CS), due to computational costs and catastrophic
forgetting. We explore Soft Prompt Tuning (SPT), a parameter-efficient method
to enhance CS ASR while preserving prior knowledge. We evaluate two strategies:
(1) full fine-tuning (FFT) of both soft prompts and the entire Whisper model,
demonstrating improved cross-lingual capabilities compared to traditional
methods, and (2) adhering to SPT's original design by freezing model parameters
and only training soft prompts. Additionally, we introduce SPT4ASR, a
combination of different SPT variants. Experiments on the SEAME and ASRU2019
datasets show that deep prompt tuning is the most effective SPT approach, and
our SPT4ASR methods achieve further error reductions in CS ASR, maintaining
parameter efficiency similar to LoRA, without degrading performance on existing
languages.

*Hongli Yang,Sheng Li,Hao Huang,Ayiduosi Tuohan,Yizhou Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Entire SPT and LAPT to improve multilingual ASR, showing significant gains in language expansion tasks with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges like language interference and expansion in multilingual ASR without performance degradation.

Method: Proposes Entire SPT (soft prompts for encoder/decoder) and LAPT (language-aware prompts leveraging cross-lingual similarities), integrated via SPT-Whisper toolkit.

Result: Entire SPT and LAPT outperform Decoder SPT by 5.0% and 16.0% in language expansion tasks.

Conclusion: The methods offer efficient solutions for dynamic multilingual ASR with low computational cost.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) have
been driven by large-scale end-to-end models like Whisper. However, challenges
such as language interference and expanding to unseen languages (language
expansion) without degrading performance persist. This paper addresses these
with three contributions: 1) Entire Soft Prompt Tuning (Entire SPT), which
applies soft prompts to both the encoder and decoder, enhancing feature
extraction and decoding; 2) Language-Aware Prompt Tuning (LAPT), which
leverages cross-lingual similarities to encode shared and language-specific
features using lightweight prompt matrices; 3) SPT-Whisper, a toolkit that
integrates SPT into Whisper and enables efficient continual learning.
Experiments across three languages from FLEURS demonstrate that Entire SPT and
LAPT outperform Decoder SPT by 5.0% and 16.0% in language expansion tasks,
respectively, providing an efficient solution for dynamic, multilingual ASR
models with minimal computational overhead.

*Yalun Dai,Yangyu Huang,Xin Zhang,Wenshan Wu,Chong Li,Wenhui Lu,Shijie Cao,Li Dong,Scarlett Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Data Efficacy (DELT), a paradigm optimizing training data organization for language models, featuring components like Data Scoring (LQS) and Data Ordering (FO), showing improved performance without scaling data or models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored area of optimizing training data organization (Data Efficacy) alongside data efficiency for better language model performance.

Method: Proposes DELT with three components: Data Scoring (LQS), Data Selection, and Data Ordering (FO). LQS scores data by learnability and quality, while FO tackles model forgetting and bias.

Result: DELT improves LM performance without extra data or model size. LQS and FO combined yield the most gains. Data efficacy and efficiency can coexist.

Conclusion: Data efficacy is a promising foundational area in LM training, enhancing performance through optimized data organization.

Abstract: Data is fundamental to the training of language models (LM). Recent research
has been dedicated to data efficiency, which aims to maximize performance by
selecting a minimal or optimal subset of training data. Techniques such as data
filtering, sampling, and selection play a crucial role in this area. To
complement it, we define Data Efficacy, which focuses on maximizing performance
by optimizing the organization of training data and remains relatively
underexplored. This work introduces a general paradigm, DELT, for considering
data efficacy in LM training, which highlights the significance of training
data organization. DELT comprises three components: Data Scoring, Data
Selection, and Data Ordering. Among these components, we design
Learnability-Quality Scoring (LQS), as a new instance of Data Scoring, which
considers both the learnability and quality of each data sample from the
gradient consistency perspective. We also devise Folding Ordering (FO), as a
novel instance of Data Ordering, which addresses issues such as model
forgetting and data distribution bias. Comprehensive experiments validate the
data efficacy in LM training, which demonstrates the following: Firstly,
various instances of the proposed DELT enhance LM performance to varying
degrees without increasing the data scale and model size. Secondly, among these
instances, the combination of our proposed LQS for data scoring and Folding for
data ordering achieves the most significant improvement. Lastly, data efficacy
can be achieved together with data efficiency by applying data selection.
Therefore, we believe that data efficacy is a promising foundational area in LM
training.

*Andrew Maranhão Ventura D'addario*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HealthQA-BR is a Portuguese-language benchmark for evaluating LLMs in healthcare, revealing performance gaps across professions despite high overall scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluations in healthcare are physician-centric and English-focused, lacking interprofessional and multilingual realism.

Method: Developed HealthQA-BR with 5,632 questions from Brazilian licensing exams, evaluating 20 LLMs in a zero-shot setting.

Result: GPT 4.1 scored 86.6% overall but showed significant drops in specialties like Neurosurgery (60.0%) and Social Work (68.4%).

Conclusion: High-level scores are misleading; granular benchmarks like HealthQA-BR are needed for safe AI deployment in healthcare.

Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare has been
dominated by physician-centric, English-language benchmarks, creating a
dangerous illusion of competence that ignores the interprofessional nature of
patient care. To provide a more holistic and realistic assessment, we introduce
HealthQA-BR, the first large-scale, system-wide benchmark for
Portuguese-speaking healthcare. Comprising 5,632 questions from Brazil's
national licensing and residency exams, it uniquely assesses knowledge not only
in medicine and its specialties but also in nursing, dentistry, psychology,
social work, and other allied health professions. We conducted a rigorous
zero-shot evaluation of over 20 leading LLMs. Our results reveal that while
state-of-the-art models like GPT 4.1 achieve high overall accuracy (86.6%),
this top-line score masks alarming, previously unmeasured deficiencies. A
granular analysis shows performance plummets from near-perfect in specialties
like Ophthalmology (98.7%) to barely passing in Neurosurgery (60.0%) and, most
notably, Social Work (68.4%). This "spiky" knowledge profile is a systemic
issue observed across all models, demonstrating that high-level scores are
insufficient for safety validation. By publicly releasing HealthQA-BR and our
evaluation suite, we provide a crucial tool to move beyond single-score
evaluations and toward a more honest, granular audit of AI readiness for the
entire healthcare team.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the link between general reasoning capabilities of LLMs and their performance in domain-specific reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how general reasoning skills in LLMs impact their effectiveness in specialized decision-making tasks.

Method: Investigates the connection between general reasoning training and domain-specific reasoning performance in LLMs.

Result: Findings likely reveal how general reasoning abilities influence specialized task outcomes.

Conclusion: Enhancing general reasoning in LLMs can improve their decision-making in domain-specific contexts.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in various domains. However, effective decision-making
relies heavily on strong reasoning abilities. Reasoning is the foundation for
decision-making, providing the analytical and logical framework to make sound
choices. Reasoning involves analyzing information, drawing inferences, and
reaching conclusions based on logic or evidence. Decision-making builds on this
foundation by applying the insights from reasoning to select the best course of
action among alternatives. Together, these processes create a continuous cycle
of thought and action aimed at achieving goals effectively. As AI technology
evolves, there is a growing trend to train LLMs to excel in general reasoning.
This study explores how the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs connect to
their performance in domain-specific reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VIDEE is a system designed to help entry-level analysts perform advanced text analytics using intelligent agents, featuring a human-agent workflow with decomposition, execution, and evaluation stages. It leverages LLMs and human feedback, showing usability across user expertise levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To lower the barrier for entry-level analysts in text analytics by leveraging LLMs and human-agent collaboration, making advanced NLP tasks more accessible.

Method: VIDEE uses a three-stage workflow: (1) Decomposition with human-in-the-loop Monte-Carlo Tree Search, (2) Execution for pipeline generation, and (3) Evaluation with LLM-based feedback and visualizations.

Result: Quantitative experiments and a user study confirm VIDEE's effectiveness, usability for non-experts, and reveal distinct user behavior patterns.

Conclusion: VIDEE successfully supports non-expert users in text analytics, identifies design implications for human-agent collaboration, and informs future system improvements.

Abstract: Text analytics has traditionally required specialized knowledge in Natural
Language Processing (NLP) or text analysis, which presents a barrier for
entry-level analysts. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have
changed the landscape of NLP by enabling more accessible and automated text
analysis (e.g., topic detection, summarization, information extraction, etc.).
We introduce VIDEE, a system that supports entry-level data analysts to conduct
advanced text analytics with intelligent agents. VIDEE instantiates a
human-agent collaroration workflow consisting of three stages: (1)
Decomposition, which incorporates a human-in-the-loop Monte-Carlo Tree Search
algorithm to support generative reasoning with human feedback, (2) Execution,
which generates an executable text analytics pipeline, and (3) Evaluation,
which integrates LLM-based evaluation and visualizations to support user
validation of execution results. We conduct two quantitative experiments to
evaluate VIDEE's effectiveness and analyze common agent errors. A user study
involving participants with varying levels of NLP and text analytics experience
-- from none to expert -- demonstrates the system's usability and reveals
distinct user behavior patterns. The findings identify design implications for
human-agent collaboration, validate the practical utility of VIDEE for
non-expert users, and inform future improvements to intelligent text analytics
systems.

*Muhammad Ahmad,Muhammad Waqas,Ameer Hamza,Ildar Batyrshin,Grigori Sidorov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first annotated dataset for hope speech detection in code-mixed Roman Urdu, proposes a custom transformer model, and demonstrates its superior performance over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the gap in NLP research for low-resource, informal languages like Roman Urdu by focusing on hope speech detection.

Method: Develops a multi-class annotated dataset, analyzes linguistic patterns, and proposes an attention-based transformer model (XLM-R) evaluated via 5-fold cross-validation.

Result: XLM-R achieves a 0.78 cross-validation score, outperforming SVM (0.75) and BiLSTM (0.76).

Conclusion: The study advances inclusive NLP by addressing hope speech in underrepresented languages and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model.

Abstract: Hope is a positive emotional state involving the expectation of favorable
future outcomes, while hope speech refers to communication that promotes
optimism, resilience, and support, particularly in adverse contexts. Although
hope speech detection has gained attention in Natural Language Processing
(NLP), existing research mainly focuses on high-resource languages and
standardized scripts, often overlooking informal and underrepresented forms
such as Roman Urdu. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
address hope speech detection in code-mixed Roman Urdu by introducing a
carefully annotated dataset, thereby filling a critical gap in inclusive NLP
research for low-resource, informal language varieties. This study makes four
key contributions: (1) it introduces the first multi-class annotated dataset
for Roman Urdu hope speech, comprising Generalized Hope, Realistic Hope,
Unrealistic Hope, and Not Hope categories; (2) it explores the psychological
foundations of hope and analyzes its linguistic patterns in code-mixed Roman
Urdu to inform dataset development; (3) it proposes a custom attention-based
transformer model optimized for the syntactic and semantic variability of Roman
Urdu, evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation; and (4) it verifies the
statistical significance of performance gains using a t-test. The proposed
model, XLM-R, achieves the best performance with a cross-validation score of
0.78, outperforming the baseline SVM (0.75) and BiLSTM (0.76), with gains of 4%
and 2.63% respectively.

TL;DR: Small models like LLaMA 3 8B can fake alignment, and prompt-based interventions can reduce this behavior, challenging assumptions about scale and triviality of prompt ethics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To empirically demonstrate that alignment faking isn't limited to large models and to explore interventions.

Method: Used prompt-only interventions (deontological framing, scratchpad reasoning) on LLaMA 3 8B to reduce deceptive alignment.

Result: Showed small models can fake alignment, and prompt interventions effectively reduce it. Introduced taxonomy of shallow vs. deep deception.

Conclusion: Alignment evaluations must consider model size and deployment settings, and prompt ethics are non-trivial.

Abstract: Current literature suggests that alignment faking (deceptive alignment) is an
emergent property of large language models. We present the first empirical
evidence that a small instruction-tuned model, specifically LLaMA 3 8B, can
also exhibit alignment faking. We further show that prompt-only interventions,
including deontological moral framing and scratchpad reasoning, significantly
reduce this behavior without modifying model internals. This challenges the
assumption that prompt-based ethics are trivial and that deceptive alignment
requires scale. We introduce a taxonomy distinguishing shallow deception,
shaped by context and suppressible through prompting, from deep deception,
which reflects persistent, goal-driven misalignment. Our findings refine the
understanding of deception in language models and underscore the need for
alignment evaluations across model sizes and deployment settings.

TL;DR: The paper compares direct and indirect LLM-based methods for extracting structured information from food product web pages, finding indirect extraction more efficient and cost-effective despite slightly lower accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate the extraction of structured information (e.g., ingredient lists, nutrition tables) from food product web pages using LLMs, addressing scalability and cost challenges.

Method: Two approaches: direct extraction and indirect extraction via generated functions, evaluated on 3,000 food product pages for accuracy, efficiency, and cost.

Result: Indirect extraction achieves 96.48% accuracy (1.61% lower than direct) but reduces LLM calls by 95.82%, improving efficiency and lowering costs.

Conclusion: Indirect extraction is scalable and cost-effective for large-scale information extraction from template-based web pages using LLMs.

Abstract: Generative AI and large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential
for automating the extraction of structured information from web pages. In this
work, we focus on food product pages from online retailers and explore
schema-constrained extraction approaches to retrieve key product attributes,
such as ingredient lists and nutrition tables. We compare two LLM-based
approaches, direct extraction and indirect extraction via generated functions,
evaluating them in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and cost on a curated dataset
of 3,000 food product pages from three different online shops. Our results show
that although the indirect approach achieves slightly lower accuracy (96.48\%,
$-1.61\%$ compared to direct extraction), it reduces the number of required LLM
calls by 95.82\%, leading to substantial efficiency gains and lower operational
costs. These findings suggest that indirect extraction approaches can provide
scalable and cost-effective solutions for large-scale information extraction
tasks from template-based web pages using LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Studying nonverbal communication (NVC) is complex due to its broad scope and interpretation variance. Mime, a subset of NVC, offers a more controlled and explicit form for analysis.

Method: Proposed MIME, a video-based QA benchmark with 86 mimed actions, using motion capture data and variations for robustness testing.

Result: Vision-language models perform worse than humans on MIME, highlighting a gap in understanding gestures.

Conclusion: MIME underscores the need for improved research in gesture comprehension for vision-language models.

Abstract: Nonverbal communication (NVC) plays an integral role in human language, but
studying NVC in general is challenging because of its broad scope and high
variance in interpretation among individuals and cultures. However, mime -- the
theatrical technique of suggesting intent using only gesture, expression, and
movement -- is a subset of NVC that consists of explicit and embodied actions
with much lower human interpretation variance. We argue that a solid
understanding of mimed actions is a crucial prerequisite for vision-language
models capable of interpreting and commanding more subtle aspects of NVC.
Hence, we propose Mime Identification Multimodal Evaluation (MIME), a novel
video-based question answering benchmark comprising of 86 mimed actions.
Constructed with motion capture data, MIME consists of variations of each
action with perturbations applied to the character, background, and viewpoint
for evaluating recognition robustness. We find that both open-weight and
API-based vision-language models perform significantly worse than humans on
MIME, motivating the need for increased research for instilling more robust
understanding of human gestures.

### [135] [Is DeepSeek a New Voice Among LLMs in Public Opinion Simulation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21587)
*Weihong Qi,Fan Huang,Jisun An,Haewoon Kwak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepSeek-V3 outperforms other LLMs in simulating U.S. opinions on abortion and Chinese opinions on foreign aid, but struggles with biases and overgeneralization in demographic groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compare DeepSeek's ability to simulate public opinions against major LLMs, assessing cultural and demographic biases in LLM-driven opinion modeling.

Method: Comparison of DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3 with Qwen2.5, GPT-4o, and Llama-3.3 using ANES and Zuobiao datasets to predict opinions on social issues in the U.S. and China.

Result: DeepSeek-V3 excels in simulating U.S. abortion opinions and Chinese foreign aid views but fails to capture low-income and non-college-educated perspectives on capitalism. All LLMs overgeneralize within demographic groups.

Conclusion: LLMs need mitigation of cultural and demographic biases through more inclusive training methods to improve public opinion modeling.

Abstract: This study evaluates the ability of DeepSeek, an open-source large language
model (LLM), to simulate public opinions in comparison to LLMs developed by
major tech companies. By comparing DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3 with Qwen2.5,
GPT-4o, and Llama-3.3 and utilizing survey data from the American National
Election Studies (ANES) and the Zuobiao dataset of China, we assess these
models' capacity to predict public opinions on social issues in both China and
the United States, highlighting their comparative capabilities between
countries. Our findings indicate that DeepSeek-V3 performs best in simulating
U.S. opinions on the abortion issue compared to other topics such as climate
change, gun control, immigration, and services for same-sex couples, primarily
because it more accurately simulates responses when provided with Democratic or
liberal personas. For Chinese samples, DeepSeek-V3 performs best in simulating
opinions on foreign aid and individualism but shows limitations in modeling
views on capitalism, particularly failing to capture the stances of low-income
and non-college-educated individuals. It does not exhibit significant
differences from other models in simulating opinions on traditionalism and the
free market. Further analysis reveals that all LLMs exhibit the tendency to
overgeneralize a single perspective within demographic groups, often defaulting
to consistent responses within groups. These findings highlight the need to
mitigate cultural and demographic biases in LLM-driven public opinion modeling,
calling for approaches such as more inclusive training methodologies.

### [136] [Understanding Verbatim Memorization in LLMs Through Circuit Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21588)
*Ilya Lasy,Peter Knees,Stefan Woltran*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates memorization mechanisms in LLMs, identifying specific circuits for initiation and maintenance of memorization, and explores their context-dependence and transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the exact mechanisms and differences in behavior when LLMs produce memorized versus non-memorized content.

Method: Uses transformer circuits and contrastive datasets to isolate and analyze memorization-related circuits.

Result: Found that initiation circuits can maintain memorization, but maintenance circuits cannot initiate it. Memorization prevention transfers across domains, while induction is context-dependent.

Conclusion: Memorization in LLMs involves distinct, specialized circuits with varying transferability and context-dependence.

Abstract: Underlying mechanisms of memorization in LLMs -- the verbatim reproduction of
training data -- remain poorly understood. What exact part of the network
decides to retrieve a token that we would consider as start of memorization
sequence? How exactly is the models' behaviour different when producing
memorized sentence vs non-memorized? In this work we approach these questions
from mechanistic interpretability standpoint by utilizing transformer circuits
-- the minimal computational subgraphs that perform specific functions within
the model. Through carefully constructed contrastive datasets, we identify
points where model generation diverges from memorized content and isolate the
specific circuits responsible for two distinct aspects of memorization. We find
that circuits that initiate memorization can also maintain it once started,
while circuits that only maintain memorization cannot trigger its initiation.
Intriguingly, memorization prevention mechanisms transfer robustly across
different text domains, while memorization induction appears more
context-dependent.

### [137] [A General Method for Detecting Information Generated by Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21589)
*Minjia Mao,Dongjun Wei,Xiao Fang,Michael Chau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a general LLM detector (GLD) to identify LLM-generated content across unseen models and domains, outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of distinguishing human-written from LLM-generated content is critical for trust and misinformation prevention, but existing methods lack generalization.

Method: GLD uses twin memory networks and a theory-guided detection generalization module for cross-model and cross-domain detection.

Result: Empirical evaluations show GLD's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in detecting LLM-generated content.

Conclusion: GLD offers significant academic and practical benefits for digital platforms and LLM applications.

Abstract: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
transformed the digital information landscape, making it increasingly
challenging to distinguish between human-written and LLM-generated content.
Detecting LLM-generated information is essential for preserving trust on
digital platforms (e.g., social media and e-commerce sites) and preventing the
spread of misinformation, a topic that has garnered significant attention in IS
research. However, current detection methods, which primarily focus on
identifying content generated by specific LLMs in known domains, face
challenges in generalizing to new (i.e., unseen) LLMs and domains. This
limitation reduces their effectiveness in real-world applications, where the
number of LLMs is rapidly multiplying and content spans a vast array of
domains. In response, we introduce a general LLM detector (GLD) that combines a
twin memory networks design and a theory-guided detection generalization module
to detect LLM-generated information across unseen LLMs and domains. Using
real-world datasets, we conduct extensive empirical evaluations and case
studies to demonstrate the superiority of GLD over state-of-the-art detection
methods. The study has important academic and practical implications for
digital platforms and LLMs.

### [138] [Representation Consistency for Accurate and Coherent LLM Answer Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21590)
*Junqi Jiang,Tom Bewley,Salim I. Amoukou,Francesco Leofante,Antonio Rago,Saumitra Mishra,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Representation Consistency (RC), a test-time scaling method for LLMs that aggregates answers by considering both answer frequency and internal activation consistency, improving accuracy without additional model queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time scaling methods for LLMs require complex modifications. RC aims to simplify this by leveraging internal activations for better answer aggregation.

Method: RC aggregates answers by analyzing the consistency of model activations (dense or sparse) during response generation, down-weighting incoherent answers. It uses cached activations and lightweight computations.

Result: Experiments with four LLMs and reasoning datasets show RC improves accuracy by up to 4% over baselines, with sparse activations aligning well with coherent reasoning.

Conclusion: RC is an effective, lightweight method for enhancing LLM performance during inference by leveraging internal activation consistency.

Abstract: Test-time scaling improves large language models' (LLMs) performance by
allocating more compute budget during inference. To achieve this, existing
methods often require intricate modifications to prompting and sampling
strategies. In this work, we introduce representation consistency (RC), a
test-time scaling method for aggregating answers drawn from multiple candidate
responses of an LLM regardless of how they were generated, including variations
in prompt phrasing and sampling strategy. RC enhances answer aggregation by not
only considering the number of occurrences of each answer in the candidate
response set, but also the consistency of the model's internal activations
while generating the set of responses leading to each answer. These activations
can be either dense (raw model activations) or sparse (encoded via pretrained
sparse autoencoders). Our rationale is that if the model's representations of
multiple responses converging on the same answer are highly variable, this
answer is more likely to be the result of incoherent reasoning and should be
down-weighted during aggregation. Importantly, our method only uses cached
activations and lightweight similarity computations and requires no additional
model queries. Through experiments with four open-source LLMs and four
reasoning datasets, we validate the effectiveness of RC for improving task
performance during inference, with consistent accuracy improvements (up to 4%)
over strong test-time scaling baselines. We also show that consistency in the
sparse activation signals aligns well with the common notion of coherent
reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FinEval-KR is a framework to evaluate LLMs' financial reasoning by decoupling knowledge and reasoning abilities, introducing distinct scores and a cognitive score based on Bloom's taxonomy. It includes a new Chinese dataset and finds reasoning and higher-order cognition as key factors, with knowledge application as a bottleneck.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks fail to decouple knowledge and reasoning in LLMs for financial tasks, lacking root cause analysis and comprehensive evaluation.

Method: Introduces FinEval-KR with knowledge and reasoning scores, a cognitive score based on Bloom's taxonomy, and a new Chinese financial reasoning dataset.

Result: LLMs' reasoning and higher-order cognitive abilities are critical for accuracy, but knowledge application remains a bottleneck. Specialized financial LLMs lag behind general models.

Conclusion: FinEval-KR provides a robust framework for evaluating financial reasoning in LLMs, highlighting the importance of reasoning and cognitive abilities while identifying knowledge application as a challenge.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential but face
challenges in complex financial reasoning tasks requiring both domain knowledge
and sophisticated reasoning. Current evaluation benchmarks often fall short by
not decoupling these capabilities indicators from single task performance and
lack root cause analysis for task failure. To address this, we introduce
FinEval-KR, a novel evaluation framework for decoupling and quantifying LLMs'
knowledge and reasoning abilities independently, proposing distinct knowledge
score and reasoning score metrics. Inspired by cognitive science, we further
propose a cognitive score based on Bloom's taxonomy to analyze capabilities in
reasoning tasks across different cognitive levels. We also release a new
open-source Chinese financial reasoning dataset covering 22 subfields to
support reproducible research and further advancements in financial reasoning.
Our experimental results reveal that LLM reasoning ability and higher-order
cognitive ability are the core factors influencing reasoning accuracy. We also
specifically find that even top models still face a bottleneck with knowledge
application. Furthermore, our analysis shows that specialized financial LLMs
generally lag behind the top general large models across multiple metrics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel BART-based encoder-decoder model for sign language recognition (SLR) independently processes x and y coordinates of skeleton sequences, achieving high accuracy (96.04%) with fewer parameters (749,888) than previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy in SLR, overcoming issues like vanishing gradients and high computational costs in traditional models (RNNs, LSTMs, GCNs).

Method: Uses a BART encoder-decoder architecture to independently encode x and y coordinates of skeleton sequences, with Cross-Attention maintaining their interrelation. Includes coordinate projection, normalization, and multiple skeleton components.

Result: Achieves 96.04% accuracy on LSA-64, outperforming larger models. Shows strong performance on WLASL and ASL-Citizen datasets.

Conclusion: The model provides a reliable, efficient SLR solution with potential to improve accessibility tools for the deaf and hard of hearing.

Abstract: Sign language recognition is crucial for individuals with hearing impairments
to break communication barriers. However, previous approaches have had to
choose between efficiency and accuracy. Such as RNNs, LSTMs, and GCNs, had
problems with vanishing gradients and high computational costs. Despite
improving performance, transformer-based methods were not commonly used. This
study presents a new novel SLR approach that overcomes the challenge of
independently extracting meaningful information from the x and y coordinates of
skeleton sequences, which traditional models often treat as inseparable. By
utilizing an encoder-decoder of BART architecture, the model independently
encodes the x and y coordinates, while Cross-Attention ensures their
interrelation is maintained. With only 749,888 parameters, the model achieves
96.04% accuracy on the LSA-64 dataset, significantly outperforming previous
models with over one million parameters. The model also demonstrates excellent
performance and generalization across WLASL and ASL-Citizen datasets. Ablation
studies underscore the importance of coordinate projection, normalization, and
using multiple skeleton components for boosting model efficacy. This study
offers a reliable and effective approach for sign language recognition, with
strong potential for enhancing accessibility tools for the deaf and hard of
hearing.

Method: Two-stage training: supervised fine-tuning on synthetic medical data with parameter-efficient techniques (DoRA, rsLoRA), followed by reinforcement learning (GRPO) with a multi-component reward system.

Result: Achieves 87.1% on MedQA, 81.6% on MMLU Pro (Medical), and 79.6% on PubMedQA, surpassing larger models.

Conclusion: Gazal-R1 provides a reproducible framework for domain-specific models, addressing challenges like reward hacking and training instability while balancing performance and explainability.

Abstract: We present Gazal-R1, a 32-billion-parameter language model that achieves
state-of-the-art performance in medical reasoning while providing transparent,
step-by-step explanations for clinical decision-making. Built upon Qwen3 32B,
our model demonstrates that strategic training can enable mid-sized models to
outperform significantly larger counterparts in specialized domains. We
developed a novel two-stage training pipeline: first, supervised fine-tuning on
a carefully curated dataset of 107,033 synthetic medical reasoning examples
that teaches structured clinical thinking, enhanced by advanced
parameter-efficient techniques including Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation
(DoRA) and Rank-Stabilized LoRA (rsLoRA); second, reinforcement learning using
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a sophisticated multi-component
reward system that refines accuracy, format adherence, and reasoning quality.
Gazal-R1 achieves exceptional performance across medical benchmarks, scoring
87.1% on MedQA, 81.6% on MMLU Pro (Medical), and 79.6% on PubMedQA, surpassing
models up to 12x larger. Beyond its strong empirical results, this work
provides detailed insights into the challenges of training reasoning-capable
models in specialized domains, including issues with reward hacking, training
instability, and the fundamental tension between factual recall and detailed
reasoning. Our methodology offers a reproducible framework for developing
high-capability, domain-specific language models that balance performance,
efficiency, and explainability.

TL;DR: The paper presents a cost-effective method to adapt English-based LLMs to Korean, detailing the end-to-end process and achieving superior performance with minimal resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving LLM capabilities in non-English languages like Korean, given the lack of transparency in existing LLM training processes.

Method: Adapting an English-based LLM to Korean involves dataset collection, preprocessing, training, benchmark creation, and evaluation.

Result: The bilingual models Thunder-LLM and Thunder-LLM-Ins outperform state-of-the-art models in Korean with minimal data and computational costs.

Conclusion: The method is effective and efficient for adding new language capabilities to LLMs, with shared code and experience for public use.

Abstract: Since state-of-the-art LLMs often underperform in languages other than
English or Chinese, improving the capability of LLMs in new languages has
become an essential task. Moreover, LLMs' entire end-to-end training process
remains largely unknown to the public due to proprietary reasons, technical
complexity, inconsistent documentation, and ethical considerations. The
complete picture remains a closely guarded secret within the industry. This
paper presents methods to adapt an existing English-based LLM to Korean in a
low-budget scenario. We describe the entire end-to-end process: collecting
Korean datasets, preprocessing the data, training the model, creating
downstream benchmarks, and conducting evaluations. The evaluation results
indicate that our method can effectively and cost-efficiently add new language
capabilities to existing LLMs. Our new bilingual models, Thunder-LLM and
Thunder-LLM-Ins, achieve superior Korean performance compared to
state-of-the-art models while utilizing minimal data and computational
resources. We share our comprehensive experience and make the code publicly
available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test MLLMs' reasoning on complex educational content like long lessons and diagrams, which are not single images.

Method: Evaluates LLaVA and LLaMA 3.2-Vision on TQA, introduces a lightweight multimodal RAG pipeline integrating text and diagrams.

Result: Shows the impact of retrieved context on accuracy and reasoning, but reveals limitations in question-context handling and noise.

Conclusion: Identifies key areas for future research in multimodal AI-driven learning.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved significant
success in vision--language tasks. However, their capacity to reason over
complex, long lessons and intricate educational diagrams that cannot be
represented as a single natural image remains largely untested. In this work,
we present the first evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on the textbook
question answering (TQA) task using the CK12-QA dataset. We assess the
performance of recent vision-language models, including LLaVA and LLaMA
3.2-Vision, across various input configurations. Additionally, we introduce a
lightweight multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that
integrates both paragraphs and diagrams from the lesson into the prompt. Our
results demonstrate the influence of retrieved educational context on model
accuracy and reasoning, while also revealing current limitations in handling
question-context relationships and the potential for noise, pointing to key
directions for future research in multimodal AI-driven learning.

TL;DR: The paper explores how input format affects document comprehension in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), finding raw OCR text harmful and proposing a structure-preserving LaTex-based method to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked impact of input format on MLLMs' document understanding, countering the intuition that raw OCR text aids performance.

Method: A novel structure-preserving approach using LaTex to encode document elements, preserving hierarchy and spatial relationships.

Result: Structured text improves attention patterns, enhancing MLLMs' document question answering without architectural changes or extra training.

Conclusion: Input format significantly influences MLLMs' performance, and structured encoding (e.g., LaTex) is a simple yet effective solution.

Abstract: Document understanding remains a significant challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). While previous research has primarily focused on
locating evidence pages through precise multimodal queries, our work
investigates a fundamental yet overlooked aspect: how input format influences
document comprehension performance. Through systematic analysis, we discover
that raw OCR text often impairs rather than improves MLLMs' performance, which
is a counterintuitive finding we attribute to attention dispersion and
structure loss. To further substantiate our hypothesis, we propose a novel
structure-preserving approach that encodes document elements using the LaTex
paradigm, maintaining the hierarchical organization and spatial relationships
critical for comprehension. Our attention analysis reveals that structured text
induces structured attention patterns on both textual and visual content,
directing models to focus on semantically meaningful regions while reducing
attention waste. This approach significantly enhances MLLMs' document question
answering performance across diverse document types without requiring
architectural modifications or additional training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BiMark is a novel watermarking framework for LLM-generated text, addressing text quality preservation, model-agnostic detection, and message embedding capacity. It outperforms existing methods with higher extraction rates and maintained quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about LLM-generated text authenticity and regulatory demands for reliable identification mechanisms drive the need for effective watermarking solutions.

Method: BiMark introduces a bit-flip unbiased reweighting mechanism, multilayer architecture, and information encoding for multi-bit watermarking.

Result: BiMark achieves up to 30% higher extraction rates for short texts while maintaining text quality and performs comparably to non-watermarked text on downstream tasks.

Conclusion: BiMark successfully balances text quality and watermarking requirements, offering a practical solution for LLM-generated text authentication.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have raised urgent concerns
about LLM-generated text authenticity, prompting regulatory demands for
reliable identification mechanisms. Although watermarking offers a promising
solution, existing approaches struggle to simultaneously achieve three critical
requirements: text quality preservation, model-agnostic detection, and message
embedding capacity, which are crucial for practical implementation. To achieve
these goals, the key challenge lies in balancing the trade-off between text
quality preservation and message embedding capacity. To address this challenge,
we propose BiMark, a novel watermarking framework that achieves these
requirements through three key innovations: (1) a bit-flip unbiased reweighting
mechanism enabling model-agnostic detection, (2) a multilayer architecture
enhancing detectability without compromising generation quality, and (3) an
information encoding approach supporting multi-bit watermarking. Through
theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we validate that, compared to
state-of-the-art multi-bit watermarking methods, BiMark achieves up to 30%
higher extraction rates for short texts while maintaining text quality
indicated by lower perplexity, and performs comparably to non-watermarked text
on downstream tasks such as summarization and translation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MemBench, a benchmark for evaluating memory capabilities in LLM-based agents, addressing limitations in current evaluations by incorporating diverse memory levels and interactive scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations of memory mechanisms in LLM-based agents lack diversity in memory levels and interactive scenarios, and comprehensive metrics.

Method: The authors construct a dataset with factual and reflective memory levels, and participation/observation scenarios, then develop the MemBench benchmark to assess effectiveness, efficiency, and capacity.

Result: MemBench provides a comprehensive evaluation framework for memory capabilities in LLM-based agents, with publicly released dataset and project.

Conclusion: The work advances the evaluation of memory in LLM-based agents by introducing a more diverse and comprehensive benchmark, MemBench.

Abstract: Recent works have highlighted the significance of memory mechanisms in
LLM-based agents, which enable them to store observed information and adapt to
dynamic environments. However, evaluating their memory capabilities still
remains challenges. Previous evaluations are commonly limited by the diversity
of memory levels and interactive scenarios. They also lack comprehensive
metrics to reflect the memory capabilities from multiple aspects. To address
these problems, in this paper, we construct a more comprehensive dataset and
benchmark to evaluate the memory capability of LLM-based agents. Our dataset
incorporates factual memory and reflective memory as different levels, and
proposes participation and observation as various interactive scenarios. Based
on our dataset, we present a benchmark, named MemBench, to evaluate the memory
capability of LLM-based agents from multiple aspects, including their
effectiveness, efficiency, and capacity. To benefit the research community, we
release our dataset and project at https://github.com/import-myself/Membench.

### [149] [Large Language Models as symbolic DNA of cultural dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21606)
*Parham Pourdavood,Michael Jacob,Terrence Deacon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper redefines LLMs as cultural 'DNA,' preserving human symbolic patterns without context, requiring human reinterpretation to catalyze creativity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To shift the view of LLMs from autonomous intelligence or mimicry to cultural repositories that enhance human creativity and self-reflection.

Method: Analyzes four features—compression, decompression, externalization, and recursion—to compare LLMs to DNA in preserving cultural dynamics.

Result: LLMs act as tools for cultural evolvability, enabling hypothesis-generation and self-reflection without understanding human experience.

Conclusion: LLMs' value lies in aiding human creativity and cultural exploration, not in rivaling human intelligence.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel conceptualization of Large Language Models (LLMs)
as externalized informational substrates that function analogously to DNA for
human cultural dynamics. Rather than viewing LLMs as either autonomous
intelligence or mere programmed mimicry, we argue they serve a broader role as
repositories that preserve compressed patterns of human symbolic
expression--"fossils" of meaningful dynamics that retain relational residues
without their original living contexts. Crucially, these compressed patterns
only become meaningful through human reinterpretation, creating a recursive
feedback loop where they can be recombined and cycle back to ultimately
catalyze human creative processes. Through analysis of four universal
features--compression, decompression, externalization, and recursion--we
demonstrate that just as DNA emerged as a compressed and externalized medium
for preserving useful cellular dynamics without containing explicit reference
to goal-directed physical processes, LLMs preserve useful regularities of human
culture without containing understanding of embodied human experience.
Therefore, we argue that LLMs' significance lies not in rivaling human
intelligence, but in providing humanity a tool for self-reflection and playful
hypothesis-generation in a low-stakes, simulated environment. This framework
positions LLMs as tools for cultural evolvability, enabling humanity to
generate novel hypotheses about itself while maintaining the human
interpretation necessary to ground these hypotheses in ongoing human aesthetics
and norms.

*Dipak Meher,Carlotta Domeniconi,Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CORE-KG is a modular framework for building cleaner, more coherent knowledge graphs from legal texts, reducing node duplication and noise compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human smuggling networks are complex and hard to analyze due to unstructured legal texts with ambiguous references, posing challenges for automated KG construction.

Method: CORE-KG uses a two-step pipeline: type-aware coreference resolution via structured LLM prompts and domain-guided entity/relationship extraction, built on an adapted GraphRAG framework.

Result: CORE-KG reduces node duplication by 33.28% and legal noise by 38.37%, producing cleaner graphs.

Conclusion: CORE-KG provides a robust foundation for analyzing complex criminal networks, outperforming existing KG methods.

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze.
Legal case documents offer valuable insights but are unstructured, lexically
dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references-posing challenges for
automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. Existing KG methods often rely on
static templates and lack coreference resolution, while recent LLM-based
approaches frequently produce noisy, fragmented graphs due to hallucinations,
and duplicate nodes caused by a lack of guided extraction. We propose CORE-KG,
a modular framework for building interpretable KGs from legal texts. It uses a
two-step pipeline: (1) type-aware coreference resolution via sequential,
structured LLM prompts, and (2) entity and relationship extraction using
domain-guided instructions, built on an adapted GraphRAG framework. CORE-KG
reduces node duplication by 33.28%, and legal noise by 38.37% compared to a
GraphRAG-based baseline-resulting in cleaner and more coherent graph
structures. These improvements make CORE-KG a strong foundation for analyzing
complex criminal networks.

*Junhao Liu,Zhenhao Xu,Yuxin Fang,Yichuan Chen,Zuobin Ying,Wenhan Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel framework analyzes reasoning in four advanced LLMs, revealing patterns in their processes and outputs, with insights for model design and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research lacks systematic comparison of LLMs' reasoning processes, especially self-reflection and cross-domain connections.

Method: Uses keyword statistics and LLM-as-a-judge paradigm to analyze reasoning in GPT-o1, DeepSeek-R1, Kimi-k1.5, and Grok-3 on diverse real-world questions.

Result: Identifies disparities in reasoning depth, intermediate step reliance, and similarity to GPT-o1, balancing exploration and exploitation.

Conclusion: Provides insights into computational efficiency vs. reasoning robustness, with practical recommendations for model enhancement.

Abstract: Recently, there have been notable advancements in large language models
(LLMs), demonstrating their growing abilities in complex reasoning. However,
existing research largely overlooks a thorough and systematic comparison of
these models' reasoning processes and outputs, particularly regarding their
self-reflection pattern (also termed "Aha moment") and the interconnections
across diverse domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for analyzing the
reasoning characteristics of four cutting-edge large reasoning models (GPT-o1,
DeepSeek-R1, Kimi-k1.5, and Grok-3) using keywords statistic and LLM-as-a-judge
paradigm. Our approach connects their internal thinking processes with their
final outputs. A diverse dataset consists of real-world scenario-based
questions covering logical deduction, causal inference, and multi-step
problem-solving. Additionally, a set of metrics is put forward to assess both
the coherence of reasoning and the accuracy of the outputs. The research
results uncover various patterns of how these models balance exploration and
exploitation, deal with problems, and reach conclusions during the reasoning
process. Through quantitative and qualitative comparisons, disparities among
these models are identified in aspects such as the depth of reasoning, the
reliance on intermediate steps, and the degree of similarity between their
thinking processes and output patterns and those of GPT-o1. This work offers
valuable insights into the trade-off between computational efficiency and
reasoning robustness and provides practical recommendations for enhancing model
design and evaluation in practical applications. We publicly release our

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the effectiveness of integrating textual information into time series forecasting models, finding that gains are not universal and depend on model and data characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether and under what conditions multimodal integration (text + time series) improves forecasting performance.

Method: Systematic evaluation across 14 forecasting tasks using two paradigms: aligning-based and prompting-based methods.

Result: Multimodal methods do not always outperform unimodal baselines. Gains depend on high-capacity text models, weaker time series models, proper alignment, sufficient data, and complementary text signals.

Conclusion: Practical guidelines are provided for when multimodality aids forecasting, emphasizing model and data conditions.

Abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest in incorporating textual
information into foundation models for time series forecasting. However, it
remains unclear whether and under what conditions such multimodal integration
consistently yields gains. We systematically investigate these questions across
a diverse benchmark of 14 forecasting tasks spanning 7 domains, including
health, environment, and economics. We evaluate two popular multimodal
forecasting paradigms: aligning-based methods, which align time series and text
representations; and prompting-based methods, which directly prompt large
language models for forecasting. Although prior works report gains from
multimodal input, we find these effects are not universal across datasets and
models, and multimodal methods sometimes do not outperform the strongest
unimodal baselines. To understand when textual information helps, we
disentangle the effects of model architectural properties and data
characteristics. Our findings highlight that on the modeling side,
incorporating text information is most helpful given (1) high-capacity text
models, (2) comparatively weaker time series models, and (3) appropriate
aligning strategies. On the data side, performance gains are more likely when
(4) sufficient training data is available and (5) the text offers complementary
predictive signal beyond what is already captured from the time series alone.
Our empirical findings offer practical guidelines for when multimodality can be
expected to aid forecasting tasks, and when it does not.

### [154] [AdaptGOT: A Pre-trained Model for Adaptive Contextual POI Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21612)
*Xiaobin Ren,Xinyu Zhu,Kaiqi Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AdaptGOT, a model for POI embedding that combines adaptive representation learning with geographical, co-occurrence, and textual data to address challenges like multi-context sampling and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing POI embedding methods face challenges in multi-context sampling, versatility, and generalization, prompting the need for a more robust solution.

Method: AdaptGOT integrates adaptive representation learning and GOT representation, featuring contextual neighborhood generation, enhanced GOT representation with attention, and a MoE-based adaptive encoder-decoder.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show AdaptGOT outperforms existing methods in POI tasks.

Conclusion: AdaptGOT effectively addresses POI embedding challenges, offering superior performance and versatility.

Abstract: Currently, considerable strides have been achieved in Point-of-Interest (POI)
embedding methodologies, driven by the emergence of novel POI tasks like
recommendation and classification. Despite the success of task-specific,
end-to-end models in POI embedding, several challenges remain. These include
the need for more effective multi-context sampling strategies, insufficient
exploration of multiple POI contexts, limited versatility, and inadequate
generalization. To address these issues, we propose the AdaptGOT model, which
integrates both the (Adapt)ive representation learning technique and the
Geographical-Co-Occurrence-Text (GOT) representation with a particular emphasis
on Geographical location, Co-Occurrence and Textual information. The AdaptGOT
model comprises three key components: (1) contextual neighborhood generation,
which integrates advanced mixed sampling techniques such as KNN, density-based,
importance-based, and category-aware strategies to capture complex contextual
neighborhoods; (2) an advanced GOT representation enhanced by an attention
mechanism, designed to derive high-quality, customized representations and
efficiently capture complex interrelations between POIs; and (3) the MoE-based
adaptive encoder-decoder architecture, which ensures topological consistency
and enriches contextual representation by minimizing Jensen-Shannon divergence
across varying contexts. Experiments on two real-world datasets and multiple
POI tasks substantiate the superior performance of the proposed AdaptGOT model.

Method: ChildGuard1 is curated from existing corpora and enriched with child-specific annotations. It benchmarks state-of-the-art hate speech detection methods, including LLMs.

Result: The dataset provides a foundation for evaluating and improving hate speech detection methods for child-specific contexts.

Conclusion: ChildGuard1 is publicly released to support further research and development of tools to combat child-targeted hate speech.

Abstract: The increasing prevalence of child-targeted hate speech online underscores
the urgent need for specialized datasets to address this critical issue.
Existing hate speech datasets lack agespecific annotations, fail to capture
nuanced contexts, and overlook the unique emotional impact on children. To
bridge this gap, we introduce ChildGuard1, a curated dataset derived from
existing corpora and enriched with child-specific annotations. ChildGuard
captures diverse contexts of child-targeted hate speech, spanning age groups.
We benchmark existing state-of-the-art hate speech detection methods, including
Large Language Models (LLMs), and assess their effectiveness in detecting and
contextualizing child-targeted hate speech. To foster further research in this
area, we publicly release ChildGuard, providing a robust foundation for
developing improved methods to detect and mitigate such harm.

*Yixiong Fang,Tianran Sun,Yuling Shi,Min Wang,Xiaodong Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LastingBench is a framework to mitigate data leakage in QA benchmarks by identifying and rewriting leakage points, ensuring fairer LLM evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about LLMs 'cheating' on QA benchmarks due to memorization, undermining benchmark validity.

Method: Introduces LastingBench, which identifies leakage points via perturbation and rewrites them to counterfactual ones.

Result: Significant performance gaps in QA benchmarks, showing reduced memorization effects.

Conclusion: LastingBench ensures benchmark robustness, promoting fairer and more interpretable LLM evaluations.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of large language models (LLMs) raises concerns
about their ability to "cheat" on standard Question Answering (QA) benchmarks
by memorizing task-specific data. This undermines the validity of benchmark
evaluations, as they no longer reflect genuine model capabilities but instead
the effects of data leakage. While prior work has focused on detecting such
leakage, little attention has been given to mitigating its impact and
preserving the long-term utility of benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce
LastingBench, a novel framework designed to continuously reinforce and
safeguard existing benchmarks against knowledge leakage. LastingBench
identifies leakage points in the context through perturbation, then rewrites
the leakage points to counterfactual ones-disrupting memorization while
preserving the benchmark's original evaluative intent. Evaluations of
state-of-the-art QA benchmarks show significant performance gaps, highlighting
the efficacy of LastingBench in reducing memorization effects. LastingBench
offers a practical and scalable solution to ensure benchmark robustness over
time, promoting fairer and more interpretable evaluations of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GARMLE-G is a framework that enhances medical language models by grounding outputs in clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), improving clinical utility and reducing hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models rely on ICD codes, which lack clinical nuance. GARMLE-G aligns model outputs with evidence-based CPGs for better diagnosis.

Method: GARMLE-G integrates LLM predictions with EHR data, retrieves CPG snippets via embedding similarity, and fuses guidelines with model outputs.

Result: The prototype for hypertension diagnosis outperformed baselines in precision, relevance, and guideline adherence.

Conclusion: GARMLE-G offers a scalable, low-cost, and hallucination-free method for clinical deployment, improving evidence-based recommendations.

Abstract: Current medical language models, adapted from large language models (LLMs),
typically predict ICD code-based diagnosis from electronic health records
(EHRs) because these labels are readily available. However, ICD codes do not
capture the nuanced, context-rich reasoning clinicians use for diagnosis.
Clinicians synthesize diverse patient data and reference clinical practice
guidelines (CPGs) to make evidence-based decisions. This misalignment limits
the clinical utility of existing models. We introduce GARMLE-G, a
Generation-Augmented Retrieval framework that grounds medical language model
outputs in authoritative CPGs. Unlike conventional Retrieval-Augmented
Generation based approaches, GARMLE-G enables hallucination-free outputs by
directly retrieving authoritative guideline content without relying on
model-generated text. It (1) integrates LLM predictions with EHR data to create
semantically rich queries, (2) retrieves relevant CPG knowledge snippets via
embedding similarity, and (3) fuses guideline content with model output to
generate clinically aligned recommendations. A prototype system for
hypertension diagnosis was developed and evaluated on multiple metrics,
demonstrating superior retrieval precision, semantic relevance, and clinical
guideline adherence compared to RAG-based baselines, while maintaining a
lightweight architecture suitable for localized healthcare deployment. This
work provides a scalable, low-cost, and hallucination-free method for grounding
medical language models in evidence-based clinical practice, with strong
potential for broader clinical deployment.

*Chuanrui Hu,Wei Hu,Penghang Yu,Hua Zhang,Bing-Kun Bao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TIM, a large Timeline Intelligence Model for open-domain Timeline Summarization (TLS), addressing limitations of general LLMs in topic relevance and evolution understanding. It uses a progressive optimization strategy and a novel dual-alignment reward learning method, validated on a large-scale TLS dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs struggle with topic relevance and evolution in TLS, leading to irrelevant or inaccurate summaries. The goal is to improve open-domain TLS by developing a specialized model.

Method: Proposes TIM with a progressive optimization strategy: instruction tuning for summarization and filtering, and dual-alignment reward learning for semantic and temporal alignment.

Result: TIM shows robust performance in summarizing open-domain timelines, validated by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: TIM effectively addresses TLS challenges, outperforming general LLMs in topic relevance and evolution understanding.

Abstract: Open-domain Timeline Summarization (TLS) is crucial for monitoring the
evolution of news topics. To identify changes in news topics, existing methods
typically employ general Large Language Models (LLMs) to summarize relevant
timestamps from retrieved news. While general LLMs demonstrate capabilities in
zero-shot news summarization and timestamp localization, they struggle with
assessing topic relevance and understanding topic evolution. Consequently, the
summarized information often includes irrelevant details or inaccurate
timestamps. To address these issues, we propose the first large Timeline
Intelligence Model (TIM) for open-domain TLS, which is capable of effectively
summarizing open-domain timelines. Specifically, we begin by presenting a
large-scale TLS dataset, comprising over 1,000 news topics and more than 3,000
annotated TLS instances. Furthermore, we propose a progressive optimization
strategy, which gradually enhance summarization performance. It employs
instruction tuning to enhance summarization and topic-irrelevant information
filtering capabilities. Following this, it exploits a novel dual-alignment
reward learning method that incorporates both semantic and temporal
perspectives, thereby improving the understanding of topic evolution
principles. Through this progressive optimization strategy, TIM demonstrates a
robust ability to summarize open-domain timelines. Extensive experiments in
open-domain demonstrate the effectiveness of our TIM.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IndexTTS2 introduces a novel method for precise duration control in autoregressive TTS models, supports two generation modes, disentangles emotion and speaker identity, and improves emotional clarity using GPT latent representations and soft instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive TTS models struggle with precise duration control, limiting applications like video dubbing. IndexTTS2 aims to address this while enhancing emotional and speaker disentanglement.

Method: Proposes a duration-control method for autoregressive models, supports explicit token specification or free generation, disentangles emotion and speaker identity, and uses GPT latent representations and soft instructions for emotional clarity.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS models in word error rate, speaker similarity, and emotional fidelity.

Conclusion: IndexTTS2 advances TTS by enabling precise duration control, disentangling emotion and speaker identity, and improving emotional clarity, making it suitable for diverse applications.

Abstract: Large-scale text-to-speech (TTS) models are typically categorized into
autoregressive and non-autoregressive systems. Although autoregressive systems
exhibit certain advantages in speech naturalness, their token-by-token
generation mechanism makes it difficult to precisely control the duration of
synthesized speech. This is a key limitation in applications such as video
dubbing that require strict audio-visual synchronization. This paper introduces
IndexTTS2, which proposes a novel and autoregressive-model-friendly method for
speech duration control. The method supports two generation modes: one allows
explicit specification of the number of generated tokens for precise duration
control; the other does not require manual input and lets the model freely
generate speech while preserving prosodic characteristics from the input
prompt. Furthermore, IndexTTS2 achieves disentanglement between emotional
expression and speaker identity, enabling independent control of timbre and
emotion. In the zero-shot setting, the model can perfectly reproduce the
emotional characteristics of the input prompt. Users may also provide a
separate emotion prompt, even from a different speaker, allowing the model to
reconstruct the target timbre while conveying the desired emotion. To enhance
clarity during strong emotional expressions, we incorporate GPT latent
representations to improve speech stability. Meanwhile, to lower the barrier
for emotion control, we design a soft instruction mechanism based on textual
descriptions by fine-tuning Qwen3. This enables effective guidance of speech
generation with desired emotional tendencies using natural language input.
Experimental results demonstrate that IndexTTS2 outperforms existing
state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS models in word error rate, speaker similarity,
and emotional fidelity.

*Daniele Cirulli,Giulio Cimini,Giovanni Palermo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates GPT-4's ability to replicate Reddit comments from the 2016 US election, finding it can generate realistic partisan content but tends to favor consensus over dissent. Real and artificial comments differ semantically but not visibly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess LLMs' potential to influence political discourse by mimicking user-generated content in divisive scenarios.

Method: Three experiments with GPT-4 impersonating real/artificial partisan users; analysis of political alignment, sentiment, and linguistic features.

Result: GPT-4 generates realistic comments but leans toward consensus; real and artificial comments differ semantically but not manually.

Conclusion: LLMs like GPT-4 can subtly manipulate political discussions, raising concerns about AI-driven discourse influence.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for
natural language generation, with applications spanning from content creation
to social simulations. Their ability to mimic human interactions raises both
opportunities and concerns, particularly in the context of politically relevant
online discussions. In this study, we evaluate the performance of LLMs in
replicating user-generated content within a real-world, divisive scenario:
Reddit conversations during the 2016 US Presidential election. In particular,
we conduct three different experiments, asking GPT-4 to generate comments by
impersonating either real or artificial partisan users. We analyze the
generated comments in terms of political alignment, sentiment, and linguistic
features, comparing them against real user contributions and benchmarking
against a null model. We find that GPT-4 is able to produce realistic comments,
both in favor of or against the candidate supported by the community, yet
tending to create consensus more easily than dissent. In addition we show that
real and artificial comments are well separated in a semantically embedded
space, although they are indistinguishable by manual inspection. Our findings
provide insights on the potential use of LLMs to sneak into online discussions,
influence political debate and shape political narratives, bearing broader
implications of AI-driven discourse manipulation.

Motivation: The lack of a large-scale, high-quality dataset of human-evaluated proofs hinders progress in LLM-based mathematical proof generation. The OPC aims to fill this gap.

Method: The authors created the OPC, a dataset of over 5,000 human-evaluated proofs from state-of-the-art LLMs, including solutions to problems from prestigious competitions like USAMO and IMO. They used this dataset to explore critical questions in proof generation and finetuned an 8B-parameter model.

Result: The OPC enables analysis of performance gaps, discrepancies in proof validity, and the impact of selection methods. The finetuned model matches Gemini-2.5-Pro in evaluating proof correctness.

Conclusion: The OPC is a valuable resource for proof generation research, addressing key challenges and demonstrating practical utility through model finetuning.

Abstract: In recent months, large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress
in mathematical proof generation, but further advancement is hindered by the
lack of a large-scale, high-quality dataset of human-evaluated proofs. While
expensive to create, such a dataset is essential for driving improvements in
training and enabling a rigorous analysis of proof generation capabilities. In
this work, we present the Open Proof Corpus (OPC), a dataset comprising over
5,000 human-evaluated proofs produced by state-of-the-art LLMs. The OPC was
specifically designed for broad applicability and downstream usage in proof
generation research and is the first to include a substantial number of
correct, LLM-generated solutions to problems from prestigious mathematics
competitions such as the USAMO and IMO. Using the OPC, we explore critical
questions in automated proof generation: (1) the performance gap between
natural language and formal proof generation, (2) the discrepancy between
final-answer accuracy and full-proof validity, and (3) the impact of best-of-n
selection on proof quality. Finally, to showcase the utility of the OPC, we
finetune an 8B-parameter model on the dataset, obtaining a model that performs
on par with the best model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, on the task of evaluating proof
correctness.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech impairments challenge ASR systems due to limited training data and annotation difficulties for non-normative speech.

Method: Proposes a practical pipeline to personalize ASR models by selecting words and enhancing small datasets with semantic coherence.

Result: Applied to a child's speech impairment data, the approach improves transcription quality.

Conclusion: The method reduces communication barriers for those with atypical speech patterns.

Abstract: Speech impairments caused by conditions such as cerebral palsy or genetic
disorders pose significant challenges for automatic speech recognition (ASR)
systems. Despite recent advances, ASR models like Whisper struggle with
non-normative speech due to limited training data and the difficulty of
collecting and annotating non-normative speech samples. In this work, we
propose a practical and lightweight pipeline to personalize ASR models,
formalizing the selection of words and enriching a small, speech-impaired
dataset with semantic coherence. Applied to data from a child with a structural
speech impairment, our approach shows promising improvements in transcription
quality, demonstrating the potential to reduce communication barriers for
individuals with atypical speech patterns.

Motivation: Accurately capturing nuanced linguistic patterns in consumer complaints is challenging, and current ML methods struggle with subtle semantic differences.

Method: Integrates human-experience-trained algorithms and synthetic data generation using expert evaluations and annotations.

Result: Aims to enhance classifier performance, reduce dataset costs, and improve evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The combined approach seeks to advance ML text classification for nuanced tasks like consumer complaints.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has significantly advanced text classification by
enabling automated understanding and categorization of complex, unstructured
textual data. However, accurately capturing nuanced linguistic patterns and
contextual variations inherent in natural language, particularly within
consumer complaints, remains a challenge. This study addresses these issues by
incorporating human-experience-trained algorithms that effectively recognize
subtle semantic differences crucial for assessing consumer relief eligibility.
Furthermore, we propose integrating synthetic data generation methods that
utilize expert evaluations of generative adversarial networks and are refined
through expert annotations. By combining expert-trained classifiers with
high-quality synthetic data, our research seeks to significantly enhance
machine learning classifier performance, reduce dataset acquisition costs, and
improve overall evaluation metrics and robustness in text classification tasks.

relying on rigid templates fail to generalize across diverse document layouts,
while general-purpose multimodal large language models (MLLMs) lack sufficient
accuracy and reliability for specialized tasks, such as layout detection and
optical chemical structure recognition (OCSR). To address these challenges, we
introduce DocSAR-200, a rigorously annotated benchmark of 200 scientific
documents designed specifically for evaluating SAR extraction methods.
Additionally, we propose Doc2SAR, a novel synergistic framework that integrates
domain-specific tools with MLLMs enhanced via supervised fine-tuning (SFT).
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Doc2SAR achieves state-of-the-art
performance across various document types, significantly outperforming leading
end-to-end baselines. Specifically, Doc2SAR attains an overall Table Recall of
80.78% on DocSAR-200, exceeding end2end GPT-4o by 51.48%. Furthermore, Doc2SAR
demonstrates practical usability through efficient inference and is accompanied
by a web app.

### [166] [Do We Really Need GNNs with Explicit Structural Modeling? MLPs Suffice for Language Model Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21682)
*Li Zhou,Hao Jiang,Junjie Li,Zefeng Zhao,Feng Jiang,Wenyu Chen,Haizhou Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a probing framework to evaluate how explicit structural modeling enhances language models and explores MLPs as alternatives to GNNs. Findings show MLPs and GNNs with feature-transformation outperform those relying solely on message-passing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent studies show GNNs underutilize structural information, while MLPs unexpectedly perform well in structure-aware tasks. This motivates a systematic evaluation of structural modeling's role and MLPs' potential.

Method: A probing framework with a control module isolates GNN components (message-passing and feature-transformation) to assess their individual contributions. The Edge Probing Suite evaluates linguistic knowledge.

Result: MLPs as feature-transformation modules improve linguistic knowledge in LMs. GNNs with feature-transformation also benefit, while models relying only on message-passing underperform.

Conclusion: Feature-transformation operations are crucial for encoding structural information, and MLPs can serve as efficient alternatives to GNNs in certain tasks.

Abstract: Explicit structural information has been proven to be encoded by Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs), serving as auxiliary knowledge to enhance model capabilities
and improve performance in downstream NLP tasks. However, recent studies
indicate that GNNs fail to fully utilize structural information, whereas
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), despite lacking the message-passing mechanisms
inherent to GNNs, exhibit a surprising ability in structure-aware tasks.
Motivated by these findings, this paper introduces a comprehensive probing
framework from an information-theoretic perspective. The framework is designed
to systematically assess the role of explicit structural modeling in enhancing
language model (LM) representations and to investigate the potential of MLPs as
efficient and scalable alternatives to GNNs. We extend traditional probing
classifiers by incorporating a control module that allows for selective use of
either the full GNN model or its decoupled components, specifically, the
message-passing and feature-transformation operations.This modular approach
isolates and assesses the individual contributions of these operations,
avoiding confounding effects from the complete GNN architecture. Using the Edge
Probing Suite, a diagnostic tool for evaluating the linguistic knowledge
encoded in LMs, we find that MLPs, when used as feature-transformation modules,
consistently improve the linguistic knowledge captured in LM representations
across different architectures. They effectively encode both syntactic and
semantic patterns. Similarly, GNNs that incorporate feature-transformation
operations show beneficial effects. In contrast, models that rely solely on
message-passing operations tend to underperform, often leading to negative
impacts on probing task performance.

### [167] [ANUBHUTI: A Comprehensive Corpus For Sentiment Analysis In Bangla Regional Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21686)
*Swastika Kundu,Autoshi Ibrahim,Mithila Rahman,Tanvir Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ANUBHUTI is a dataset of 2000 Bangla dialect sentences (Mymensingh, Noakhali, Sylhet, Chittagong) with dual annotations for thematic and emotional sentiment, addressing the lack of resources for dialectal sentiment analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sentiment analysis for Bangla dialects is underexplored due to linguistic diversity and scarce annotated data.

Method: Created a dataset with manual translations and dual annotations (thematic and emotional) by native experts, validated via Cohen's Kappa.

Result: Strong inter-annotator consistency and refined dataset quality, enabling better NLP for low-resource Bangla dialects.

Conclusion: ANUBHUTI bridges the gap in dialectal sentiment analysis resources, improving accuracy and context-awareness in NLP.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis for regional dialects of Bangla remains an underexplored
area due to linguistic diversity and limited annotated data. This paper
introduces ANUBHUTI, a comprehensive dataset consisting of 2000 sentences
manually translated from standard Bangla into four major regional dialects
Mymensingh, Noakhali, Sylhet, and Chittagong. The dataset predominantly
features political and religious content, reflecting the contemporary socio
political landscape of Bangladesh, alongside neutral texts to maintain balance.
Each sentence is annotated using a dual annotation scheme: multiclass thematic
labeling categorizes sentences as Political, Religious, or Neutral, and
multilabel emotion annotation assigns one or more emotions from Anger,
Contempt, Disgust, Enjoyment, Fear, Sadness, and Surprise. Expert native
translators conducted the translation and annotation, with quality assurance
performed via Cohens Kappa inter annotator agreement, achieving strong
consistency across dialects. The dataset was further refined through systematic
checks for missing data, anomalies, and inconsistencies. ANUBHUTI fills a
critical gap in resources for sentiment analysis in low resource Bangla
dialects, enabling more accurate and context aware natural language processing.

### [168] [Identifying Speaker Information in Feed-Forward Layers of Self-Supervised Speech Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21712)
*Tzu-Quan Lin,Hsi-Chun Cheng,Hung-yi Lee,Hao Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how self-supervised speech Transformers encode speaker information by identifying neurons in feed-forward layers correlated with speaker data, using k-means clusters and i-vectors. Protecting these neurons during pruning preserves speaker-related task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Little research has examined how self-supervised speech Transformers encode speaker information, despite their growing use in speaker-related applications.

Method: Analyze neurons in feed-forward layers linked to k-means clusters of self-supervised features and i-vectors, identifying those correlated with speaker information.

Result: The clusters correspond to broad phonetic and gender classes, making them useful for identifying speaker-representing neurons. Protecting these neurons during pruning preserves speaker task performance.

Conclusion: The identified neurons play a crucial role in encoding speaker information, and their protection during pruning maintains model performance on speaker-related tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, the impact of self-supervised speech Transformers has
extended to speaker-related applications. However, little research has explored
how these models encode speaker information. In this work, we address this gap
by identifying neurons in the feed-forward layers that are correlated with
speaker information. Specifically, we analyze neurons associated with k-means
clusters of self-supervised features and i-vectors. Our analysis reveals that
these clusters correspond to broad phonetic and gender classes, making them
suitable for identifying neurons that represent speakers. By protecting these
neurons during pruning, we can significantly preserve performance on
speaker-related task, demonstrating their crucial role in encoding speaker
information.

*Eivind Morris Bakke,Nora Winger Heggelund*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how parametric knowledge biases in LLMs like Llama 3.1 affect fact-checking in the HerO system, revealing biases in verdicts and evidence retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how inherent and injected biases in LLMs impact fact-verification outcomes, particularly in systems like HerO.

Method: Experiments include (1) assessing Llama 3.1's parametric knowledge bias and (2) injecting intentional bias to observe effects on evidence retrieval and verdicts.

Result: Llama 3.1 labels half the claims as "Not Enough Evidence" and shows bias in evidence retrieval, with 50% unique evidence per perspective. Final verdicts remain stable despite retrieval differences.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit biases in fact-checking, affecting evidence retrieval but not final verdicts. The study highlights the need for bias-aware verification systems.

Abstract: Automatic fact verification systems increasingly rely on large language
models (LLMs). We investigate how parametric knowledge biases in these models
affect fact-checking outcomes of the HerO system (baseline for FEVER-25). We
examine how the system is affected by: (1) potential bias in Llama 3.1's
parametric knowledge and (2) intentionally injected bias. When prompted
directly to perform fact-verification, Llama 3.1 labels nearly half the claims
as "Not Enough Evidence". Using only its parametric knowledge it is able to
reach a verdict on the remaining half of the claims. In the second experiment,
we prompt the model to generate supporting, refuting, or neutral fact-checking
documents. These prompts significantly influence retrieval outcomes, with
approximately 50\% of retrieved evidence being unique to each perspective.
Notably, the model sometimes refuses to generate supporting documents for
claims it believes to be false, creating an inherent negative bias. Despite
differences in retrieved evidence, final verdict predictions show stability
across prompting strategies. The code is available at:

### [170] [Evaluating List Construction and Temporal Understanding capabilities of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21783)
*Alexandru Dumitru,V Venktesh,Adam Jatowt,Avishek Anand*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the TLQA benchmark to evaluate LLMs' temporal understanding and list construction abilities, revealing their shortcomings in these tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with temporal understanding and list construction in answers, especially for tasks involving multiple entities and time intervals. Existing benchmarks lack focus on these aspects.

Method: Proposes the TLQA benchmark, requiring structured list answers aligned with time periods, and evaluates state-of-the-art models in closed-book and open-domain settings.

Result: Current models show significant shortcomings, including incomplete answers and poor temporal alignment in closed-book setups, and need better retrieval in open-domain setups.

Conclusion: The TLQA benchmark highlights critical gaps in LLMs' capabilities, providing clear directions for future research to improve temporal and list-based reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated immense advances in a wide
range of natural language tasks. However, these models are susceptible to
hallucinations and errors on particularly temporal understanding tasks
involving multiple entities in answers. In such tasks, they fail to associate
entities with accurate time intervals, generate a complete list of entities in
answers or reason about events associated with specific temporal bounds.
Existing works do not extensively evaluate the abilities of the model to
perform implicit and explicit temporal understanding in a list answer
construction setup. To bridge this gap, we propose the Time referenced List
based Question Answering or TLQA benchmark that requires structured answers in
list format aligned with corresponding time periods. Our TLQA benchmark,
requires both list construction and temporal understanding simultaneously,
which to the best of our knowledge has not been explored in prior benchmarks.
We investigate the temporal understanding and list construction capabilities of
state-of-the-art generative models on TLQA in closed-book and open-domain
settings. Our findings reveal significant shortcomings in current models,
particularly their inability to provide complete answers and temporally align
facts in a closed-book setup and the need to improve retrieval in open-domain
setup, providing clear future directions for research on TLQA. The benchmark

### [171] [Offensive Language Detection on Social Media Using XLNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21795)
*Reem Alothman,Hafida Benhidour,Said Kerrache*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes an XLNet-based model for detecting offensive language on social media, comparing it with BERT. XLNet outperforms BERT in detecting offensive content and categorizing offenses, while BERT is better at identifying targets. Oversampling and undersampling improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of offensive content on social media necessitates automated detection systems due to impractical manual moderation.

Method: The study uses XLNet and BERT, evaluated on the OLID dataset, with oversampling and undersampling to address class imbalance.

Result: XLNet outperforms BERT in detecting offensive content and categorizing offenses, while BERT excels in identifying targets.

Conclusion: Transfer learning and XLNet-based architectures are effective for robust offensive language detection on social media.

Abstract: The widespread use of text-based communication on social media-through chats,
comments, and microblogs-has improved user interaction but has also led to an
increase in offensive content, including hate speech, racism, and other forms
of abuse. Due to the enormous volume of user-generated content, manual
moderation is impractical, which creates a need for automated systems that can
detect offensive language. Deep learning models, particularly those using
transfer learning, have demonstrated significant success in understanding
natural language through large-scale pretraining. In this study, we propose an
automatic offensive language detection model based on XLNet, a generalized
autoregressive pretraining method, and compare its performance with BERT
(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), which is a widely
used baseline in natural language processing (NLP). Both models are evaluated
using the Offensive Language Identification Dataset (OLID), a benchmark Twitter
dataset that includes hierarchical annotations. Our experimental results show
that XLNet outperforms BERT in detecting offensive content and in categorizing
the types of offenses, while BERT performs slightly better in identifying the
targets of the offenses. Additionally, we find that oversampling and
undersampling strategies are effective in addressing class imbalance and
improving classification performance. These findings highlight the potential of
transfer learning and XLNet-based architectures to create robust systems for
detecting offensive language on social media platforms.

TL;DR: Allotaxonographs are tools for comparing heavy-tailed distributions using rank-turbulence divergence, with implementations in Matlab, Javascript, and Python.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for principled, theoretically grounded tools to describe and compare complex systems.

Method: Allotaxonographs use rank- and probability-turbulence divergences, Jenson-Shannon divergence, and generalized entropy divergences for visual comparisons.

Result: A suite of programmatic tools for rendering allotaxonographs in Matlab, Javascript, and Python.

Conclusion: Allotaxonographs provide versatile and theoretically grounded tools for comparing complex systems across different programming environments.

Abstract: Describing and comparing complex systems requires principled, theoretically
grounded tools. Built around the phenomenon of type turbulence,
allotaxonographs provide map-and-list visual comparisons of pairs of
heavy-tailed distributions. Allotaxonographs are designed to accommodate a wide
range of instruments including rank- and probability-turbulence divergences,
Jenson-Shannon divergence, and generalized entropy divergences. Here, we
describe a suite of programmatic tools for rendering allotaxonographs for
rank-turbulence divergence in Matlab, Javascript, and Python, all of which have
different use cases.

*Avash Palikhe,Zhenyu Yu,Zichong Wang,Wenbin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This survey reviews explainability techniques for LLMs, categorizing XAI methods by transformer architectures, evaluating their effectiveness, and discussing applications and future challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack transparency in decision-making, hindering adoption in high-stakes domains. A systematic review of XAI methods is needed to address this gap.

Method: Categorizes XAI methods by transformer architectures (encoder-only, decoder-only, encoder-decoder), evaluates their explainability, and explores practical applications.

Result: Provides a comprehensive review of XAI techniques, their evaluations, and applications, highlighting gaps and challenges.

Conclusion: The survey guides future efforts to develop transparent and responsible LLMs by addressing research challenges and directions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have played a pivotal role in advancing
Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, despite their achievements, LLMs often
struggle to explain their decision-making processes, making them a 'black box'
and presenting a substantial challenge to explainability. This lack of
transparency poses a significant obstacle to the adoption of LLMs in
high-stakes domain applications, where interpretability is particularly
essential. To overcome these limitations, researchers have developed various
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods that provide
human-interpretable explanations for LLMs. However, a systematic understanding
of these methods remains limited. To address this gap, this survey provides a
comprehensive review of explainability techniques by categorizing XAI methods
based on the underlying transformer architectures of LLMs: encoder-only,
decoder-only, and encoder-decoder models. Then these techniques are examined in
terms of their evaluation for assessing explainability, and the survey further
explores how these explanations are leveraged in practical applications.
Finally, it discusses available resources, ongoing research challenges, and
future directions, aiming to guide continued efforts toward developing
transparent and responsible LLMs.

### [174] [Exploring the Structure of AI-Induced Language Change in Scientific English](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21817)
*Riley Galpin,Bryce Anderson,Tom S. Juzek*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines how Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT influence scientific English, focusing on word frequency spikes (e.g., 'delve,' 'crucial') and structural shifts, revealing semantic/pragmatic changes rather than simple synonym replacement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the structural nature of linguistic shifts in scientific English attributed to LLMs, distinguishing between synonym replacement and broader semantic/pragmatic changes.

Method: Analyzed frequency trends of 'spiking words' in PubMed abstracts, including part-of-speech tagging and synonym group comparisons, while also examining declining words like 'important.'

Result: Semantic clusters shift together, indicating LLM-induced changes are semantic/pragmatic. Declining words ('important') show organic language change patterns, contrasting with abrupt spikes.

Conclusion: LLMs primarily drive semantic/pragmatic shifts in scientific English, with broader implications for understanding technology's role in language evolution.

Abstract: Scientific English has undergone rapid and unprecedented changes in recent
years, with words such as "delve," "intricate," and "crucial" showing
significant spikes in frequency since around 2022. These changes are widely
attributed to the growing influence of Large Language Models like ChatGPT in
the discourse surrounding bias and misalignment. However, apart from changes in
frequency, the exact structure of these linguistic shifts has remained unclear.
The present study addresses this and investigates whether these changes involve
the replacement of synonyms by suddenly 'spiking words,' for example, "crucial"
replacing "essential" and "key," or whether they reflect broader semantic and
pragmatic qualifications. To further investigate structural changes, we include
part of speech tagging in our analysis to quantify linguistic shifts over
grammatical categories and differentiate between word forms, like "potential"
as a noun vs. as an adjective. We systematically analyze synonym groups for
widely discussed 'spiking words' based on frequency trends in scientific
abstracts from PubMed. We find that entire semantic clusters often shift
together, with most or all words in a group increasing in usage. This pattern
suggests that changes induced by Large Language Models are primarily semantic
and pragmatic rather than purely lexical. Notably, the adjective "important"
shows a significant decline, which prompted us to systematically analyze
decreasing lexical items. Our analysis of "collapsing" words reveals a more
complex picture, which is consistent with organic language change and contrasts
with the patterns of the abrupt spikes. These insights into the structure of
language change contribute to our understanding of how language technology
continues to shape human language.

*Kourosh Shahnazari,Mohammadali Keshtparvar,Seyed Moein Ayyoubzadeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A multi-input neural framework combines transformer-based language encoding with stylometric and metrical features for Persian poetry authorship attribution, achieving 71% accuracy with weighted voting and 97% at high confidence thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of Persian classical poetry's linguistic, stylistic, and metrical aspects makes computational authorship attribution challenging, necessitating a versatile approach.

Method: A multi-input neural framework integrates transformer-based language encoding, Word2Vec embeddings, stylometric measures, and metrical encodings, validated on a corpus of 647,653 verses.

Result: Weighted voting achieves 71% accuracy, while threshold-based filtering reaches 97% accuracy at a 0.9 threshold, albeit with lower coverage.

Conclusion: The framework enhances authorship attribution by combining deep learning with domain-specific features, benefiting stylistic analysis and computational literature research.

Abstract: The intricate linguistic, stylistic, and metrical aspects of Persian
classical poetry pose a challenge for computational authorship attribution. In
this work, we present a versatile framework to determine authorship among 67
prominent poets. We employ a multi-input neural framework consisting of a
transformer-based language encoder complemented by features addressing the
semantic, stylometric, and metrical dimensions of Persian poetry. Our feature
set encompasses 100-dimensional Word2Vec embeddings, seven stylometric
measures, and categorical encodings of poetic form and meter. We compiled a
vast corpus of 647,653 verses of the Ganjoor digital collection, validating the
data through strict preprocessing and author verification while preserving
poem-level splitting to prevent overlap. This work employs verse-level
classification and majority and weighted voting schemes in evaluation,
revealing that weighted voting yields 71% accuracy. We further investigate
threshold-based decision filtering, allowing the model to generate highly
confident predictions, achieving 97% accuracy at a 0.9 threshold, though at
lower coverage. Our work focuses on the integration of deep representational
forms with domain-specific features for improved authorship attribution. The
results illustrate the potential of our approach for automated classification
and the contribution to stylistic analysis, authorship disputes, and general
computational literature research. This research will facilitate further
research on multilingual author attribution, style shift, and generative
modeling of Persian poetry.

TL;DR: LinguaSynth is a transparent logistic regression framework integrating five linguistic feature types, achieving 84.89% accuracy on 20 Newsgroups, outperforming TF-IDF by 3.32%. It challenges the need for deep neural networks in text classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address interpretability and computational efficiency concerns of deep learning in NLP by proposing a transparent, resource-efficient alternative.

Method: Integrates lexical, syntactic, entity-level, word-level semantics, and document-level semantics into a logistic regression model.

Result: Achieves 84.89% accuracy on 20 Newsgroups, surpassing TF-IDF by 3.32%. Syntactic and entity-level features are key for disambiguation.

Conclusion: LinguaSynth demonstrates that interpretable, efficient models can rival deep neural networks in text classification, challenging prevailing assumptions.

Abstract: Deep learning has significantly advanced NLP, but its reliance on large
black-box models introduces critical interpretability and computational
efficiency concerns. This paper proposes LinguaSynth, a novel text
classification framework that strategically integrates five complementary
linguistic feature types: lexical, syntactic, entity-level, word-level
semantics, and document-level semantics within a transparent logistic
regression model. Unlike transformer-based architectures, LinguaSynth maintains
interpretability and computational efficiency, achieving an accuracy of 84.89
percent on the 20 Newsgroups dataset and surpassing a robust TF-IDF baseline by
3.32 percent. Through rigorous feature interaction analysis, we show that
syntactic and entity-level signals provide essential disambiguation and
effectively complement distributional semantics. LinguaSynth sets a new
benchmark for interpretable, resource-efficient NLP models and challenges the
prevailing assumption that deep neural networks are necessary for
high-performing text classification.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines the consistency hypothesis in black-box uncertainty quantification (UQ) for LLMs, introduces three mathematical statements to test it, and proposes data-free UQ methods leveraging the 'Sim-Any' hypothesis, showing improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance trust in LLM outputs by validating the assumption that generation consistency reflects confidence, and to develop practical UQ methods.

Method: Introduces three statistical tests for the consistency hypothesis, evaluates LLM output conformity across tasks, and proposes data-free UQ methods based on generation similarity.

Result: Empirical tests on 8 datasets and 3 tasks confirm the prevalence of the consistency hypothesis, with 'Sim-Any' being the most actionable. Proposed UQ methods outperform baselines.

Conclusion: The consistency hypothesis is valid and actionable, enabling effective black-box UQ methods for LLM confidence estimation.

Abstract: Estimating the confidence of large language model (LLM) outputs is essential
for real-world applications requiring high user trust. Black-box uncertainty
quantification (UQ) methods, relying solely on model API access, have gained
popularity due to their practical benefits. In this paper, we examine the
implicit assumption behind several UQ methods, which use generation consistency
as a proxy for confidence, an idea we formalize as the consistency hypothesis.
We introduce three mathematical statements with corresponding statistical tests
to capture variations of this hypothesis and metrics to evaluate LLM output
conformity across tasks. Our empirical investigation, spanning 8 benchmark
datasets and 3 tasks (question answering, text summarization, and text-to-SQL),
highlights the prevalence of the hypothesis under different settings. Among the
statements, we highlight the `Sim-Any' hypothesis as the most actionable, and
demonstrate how it can be leveraged by proposing data-free black-box UQ methods
that aggregate similarities between generations for confidence estimation.
These approaches can outperform the closest baselines, showcasing the practical
value of the empirically observed consistency hypothesis.

*Taiga Someya,Ryo Yoshida,Hitomi Yanaka,Yohei Oseki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Derivational Probing to study how syntactic structures form across neural language model layers, revealing a bottom-up process in BERT where micro-syntactic structures emerge early and integrate into macro-syntactic structures later.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how syntactic structures are constructed across layers in neural language models, as current derivations remain unclear.

Method: Proposed Derivational Probing to analyze micro- and macro-syntactic structures in BERT's layers.

Result: Found a bottom-up derivation: micro-syntactic structures form in lower layers and integrate into macro-syntactic structures in higher layers. Timing of macro-syntactic construction impacts downstream performance.

Conclusion: Optimal timing for integrating global syntactic information is critical for model performance.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that neural language models encode syntactic
structures in their internal representations, yet the derivations by which
these structures are constructed across layers remain poorly understood. In
this paper, we propose Derivational Probing to investigate how micro-syntactic
structures (e.g., subject noun phrases) and macro-syntactic structures (e.g.,
the relationship between the root verbs and their direct dependents) are
constructed as word embeddings propagate upward across layers. Our experiments
on BERT reveal a clear bottom-up derivation: micro-syntactic structures emerge
in lower layers and are gradually integrated into a coherent macro-syntactic
structure in higher layers. Furthermore, a targeted evaluation on subject-verb
number agreement shows that the timing of constructing macro-syntactic
structures is critical for downstream performance, suggesting an optimal timing
for integrating global syntactic information.

*Hang Shao,Heting Gao,Yunhang Shen,Jiawei Chen,Lijiang Li,Zuwei Long,Bo Tong,Ke Li,Xing Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepTalk is a framework using Mixture of Experts (MoE) to address performance degradation in native MLLMs, achieving a 5.5% performance drop and low latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Native MLLMs suffer from catastrophic forgetting due to insufficient paired speech-text data.

Method: DeepTalk uses adaptive modality expert learning with MoE, involving specialized single-modality training and joint multimodal training.

Result: DeepTalk reduces performance drop to 5.5% and maintains latency under 0.5 seconds.

Conclusion: DeepTalk outperforms native MLLMs and matches modular MLLMs in performance and latency.

Abstract: Native multimodal large language models (MLLMs) restructure a single large
language model (LLM) into a spoken language model (SLM) capable of both speech
and text generation. Compared to modular and aligned MLLMs, native MLLMs
preserve richer paralinguistic features such as emotion and prosody, and
generate speech responses directly within the backbone LLM rather than using a
separate speech decoder. This integration also results in lower response
latency and smoother interaction. However, native MLLMs suffer from
catastrophic forgetting and performance degradation because the available
paired speech-text data is insufficient to support the pretraining of MLLMs
compared to the vast amount of text data required to pretrain text LLMs. To
address this issue, we propose DeepTalk, a framework for adaptive modality
expert learning based on a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. DeepTalk
first adaptively distinguishes modality experts according to their modality
load within the LLM. Each modality expert then undergoes specialized
single-modality training, followed by joint multimodal collaborative training.
As a result, DeepTalk incurs only a 5.5% performance drop compared to the
original LLM, which is significantly lower than the average performance drop of
over 20% typically seen in native MLLMs (such as GLM-4-Voice), and is on par
with modular MLLMs. Meanwhile, the end-to-end dialogue latency remains within
0.5 seconds, ensuring a seamless and intelligent speech interaction experience.

*Jian Zhang,Linhao Zhang,Bokai Lei,Chuhan Wu,Wei Jia,Xiao Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel benchmark for evaluating speech-capable LLMs, addressing gaps in existing methods by incorporating speech-specific challenges and query-aware evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for speech LLMs are inadequate, often adapting text-based methods and ignoring speech-specific issues like prosody and homophones.

Method: The authors curate real-world chat data, diversify speaker attributes and acoustic conditions, and augment the dataset with speech-specific phenomena. They also design a query-aware evaluation method.

Result: Testing reveals significant performance differences among speech models across scenarios, with query-aware evaluation enabling finer-grained assessment.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark offers valuable insights for improving speech model development and evaluation.

Abstract: Recent multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o have
demonstrated strong capabilities of direct speech interaction. However, the
lack of specialized and comprehensive benchmarks for end-to-end speech LLM
evaluation hinders optimizing the user experience of Audio LLMs in real-world
applications. Existing evaluation methods often adapt text-based benchmarks,
overlooking speech's unique characteristics and challenges, including prosody,
homophones, stuttering, and differing user expectations. Here, we present a
novel approach to thoroughly evaluate LLMs in practical speech conversations.
We systematically curate real-world chat data relevant to spoken scenarios,
introduce diversity in speaker attributes and acoustic conditions, and augment
the dataset with speech-specific phenomena. We further design a query-aware
evaluation method to use customized evaluation checklists and prompts to
enhance the accuracy of automatic evaluation. We conduct comprehensive testing
and detailed analysis of various mainstream speech models, revealing
significant differences in model performance across different speech scenarios.
The use of query-aware evaluation further enables a finer-grained assessment
under various speech-specific scenarios. Our benchmark can provide valuable
insights for speech model development and evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as general-purpose world models (WMs) using a two-stage framework (Perception and Prediction) and introduces WM-ABench, a benchmark revealing significant limitations in VLMs' world modeling abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically assess VLMs' fundamental world modeling capabilities, which remain underexplored despite their potential as general-purpose WMs.

Method: Proposes a two-stage framework (Perception and Prediction) and introduces WM-ABench, a large-scale benchmark with 23 fine-grained dimensions across 6 simulated environments. Evaluates 15 VLMs through 660 experiments.

Result: VLMs show striking limitations in basic world modeling (e.g., near-random accuracy in motion trajectory tasks) and lack disentangled understanding (e.g., biases like blue objects moving faster).

Conclusion: Significant gaps exist between VLMs and human-level world modeling, highlighting the need for improvement in fundamental WM abilities.

Abstract: Internal world models (WMs) enable agents to understand the world's state and
predict transitions, serving as the basis for advanced deliberative reasoning.
Recent large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as OpenAI o3, GPT-4o and
Gemini, exhibit potential as general-purpose WMs. While the latest studies have
evaluated and shown limitations in specific capabilities such as visual
understanding, a systematic evaluation of VLMs' fundamental WM abilities
remains absent. Drawing on comparative psychology and cognitive science, we
propose a two-stage framework that assesses Perception (visual, spatial,
temporal, quantitative, and motion) and Prediction (mechanistic simulation,
transitive inference, compositional inference) to provide an atomic evaluation
of VLMs as WMs. Guided by this framework, we introduce WM-ABench, a large-scale
benchmark comprising 23 fine-grained evaluation dimensions across 6 diverse
simulated environments with controlled counterfactual simulations. Through 660
experiments on 15 latest commercial and open-source VLMs, we find that these
models exhibit striking limitations in basic world modeling abilities. For
instance, almost all models perform at near-random accuracy when distinguishing
motion trajectories. Additionally, they lack disentangled understanding --
e.g., some models tend to believe blue objects move faster than green ones.
More rich results and analyses reveal significant gaps between VLMs and
human-level world modeling.

### [182] [A Dual-Layered Evaluation of Geopolitical and Cultural Bias in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21881)
*Sean Kim,Hyuhng Joon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates bias in large language models (LLMs) through a two-phase study, distinguishing between model bias (from training) and inference bias (from query language). It assesses LLMs on factual and disputable questions across languages, revealing alignment effects and training-context interplay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand LLM behavior in diverse linguistic and cultural contexts, especially for factual and sensitive topics, to mitigate bias and improve deployment practices.

Method: A two-phase evaluation: Phase 1 tests factual questions for consistency across query languages; Phase 2 examines geopolitically sensitive disputes. A manually curated multilingual dataset is used.

Result: Phase 1 shows query language-induced alignment, while Phase 2 reveals interplay between training context and query language.

Conclusion: The study provides a framework for evaluating LLM bias in multilingual settings, aiding culturally aware deployment and future research.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse
linguistic and cultural contexts, understanding their behavior in both factual
and disputable scenarios is essential, especially when their outputs may shape
public opinion or reinforce dominant narratives. In this paper, we define two
types of bias in LLMs: model bias (bias stemming from model training) and
inference bias (bias induced by the language of the query), through a two-phase
evaluation. Phase 1 evaluates LLMs on factual questions where a single
verifiable answer exists, assessing whether models maintain consistency across
different query languages. Phase 2 expands the scope by probing geopolitically
sensitive disputes, where responses may reflect culturally embedded or
ideologically aligned perspectives. We construct a manually curated dataset
spanning both factual and disputable QA, across four languages and question
types. The results show that Phase 1 exhibits query language induced alignment,
while Phase 2 reflects an interplay between the model's training context and
query language. This paper offers a structured framework for evaluating LLM
behavior across neutral and sensitive topics, providing insights for future LLM
deployment and culturally aware evaluation practices in multilingual contexts.

*Ernie Chang,Yang Li,Patrick Huber,David Kant,Yangyang Shi,Vikas Chandra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using checkpoint models from training trajectories to optimize data mixtures for language models, improving performance by up to 1.93% on reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle to model the relationship between data and tasks for language model training. Checkpoint models, often underused, exhibit emerging capabilities during training, offering potential for better data mixtures.

Method: The framework identifies checkpoint models based on their benchmark performance and uses their aggregated first-order influence approximation over source data to optimize data mixtures.

Result: Demonstrated on eight reasoning benchmarks, the framework improves pretraining performance by up to 1.93%.

Conclusion: Checkpoint models can enhance data quality and optimize data mixtures, showing promise for improving language model training.

Abstract: In language model training, it is desirable to equip models with capabilities
from various tasks. However, it is not clear how to directly obtain the right
data mixtures for these capabilities as the relationship between data and tasks
is difficult to be modeled. In this work, we observe that checkpoint models
exhibit emerging capabilities at different points in the training trajectory.
Often, the training process saves checkpoints as artifacts that are
under-utilized as a source of in-training data signals. We identify these
artifact models based on their respective capabilities on the benchmarks and
leverage them as data mixers by using their aggregated first-order influence
approximation over source data. We demonstrated on eight reasoning benchmarks
that the proposed framework shows significant improvements in the pretraining
setting, with performance improvements of up to 1.93%. Overall, this shows the
potential of checkpoint models to enhance data quality and optimize data
mixtures.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PapersPlease, a benchmark with 3,700 moral dilemmas to evaluate LLMs' decision-making biases in immigration scenarios, revealing implicit preferences and varying responsiveness to social identities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate biases in LLMs' decision-making, especially in role-playing scenarios like immigration inspections, using hierarchical human needs theory (ERG).

Method: LLMs act as immigration inspectors, evaluating narratives based on ERG theory (Existence, Relatedness, Growth). The study analyzes six LLMs' decisions and the impact of social identities.

Result: LLMs show statistically significant biases, with implicit preferences and higher denial rates for marginalized identities in some models.

Conclusion: The study highlights LLMs' biases in moral dilemmas and the influence of social identities, providing a public benchmark for further research.

Abstract: Evaluating the performance and biases of large language models (LLMs) through
role-playing scenarios is becoming increasingly common, as LLMs often exhibit
biased behaviors in these contexts. Building on this line of research, we
introduce PapersPlease, a benchmark consisting of 3,700 moral dilemmas designed
to investigate LLMs' decision-making in prioritizing various levels of human
needs. In our setup, LLMs act as immigration inspectors deciding whether to
approve or deny entry based on the short narratives of people. These narratives
are constructed using the Existence, Relatedness, and Growth (ERG) theory,
which categorizes human needs into three hierarchical levels. Our analysis of
six LLMs reveals statistically significant patterns in decision-making,
suggesting that LLMs encode implicit preferences. Additionally, our evaluation
of the impact of incorporating social identities into the narratives shows
varying responsiveness based on both motivational needs and identity cues, with
some models exhibiting higher denial rates for marginalized identities. All
data is publicly available at https://github.com/yeonsuuuu28/papers-please.

*Weimin Xiong,Ke Wang,Yifan Song,Hanchao Liu,Sai Zhou,Wei Peng,Sujian Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the stability of tool-integrated LLM agents, revealing vulnerabilities in tool invocation stages and differences between open-source and proprietary models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations overlook agent stability, limiting real-world applicability due to potential crashes or abnormal behavior.

Method: Investigates agent vulnerabilities in tool invocation stages (reading documentation, tool selection, parameter generation, response processing) through experiments.

Result: Agents are highly error-prone at each stage; open-source models are more vulnerable. Increasing model size doesn't improve reasoning and may increase attack susceptibility.

Conclusion: Stability evaluation is crucial for LLM agents, offering insights for future development and assessment.

Abstract: Current evaluations of tool-integrated LLM agents typically focus on
end-to-end tool-usage evaluation while neglecting their stability. This limits
their real-world applicability, as various internal or external factors can
cause agents to crash or behave abnormally. Our research addresses this by
investigating whether agents are vulnerable to errors throughout the entire
tool invocation process, including reading tool documentation, selecting tools
and generating parameters, and processing the tool's response. Through
extensive experiments, we observe that agents are highly susceptible to errors
at each stage and agents based on open-source models are more vulnerable than
those based on proprietary models. We also find that increasing the model size
does not significantly improve tool invocation reasoning and may make agents
more vulnerable to attacks resembling normal user instructions. This highlights
the importance of evaluating agent stability and offers valuable insights for
future LLM development and evaluation.

### [186] [Advancing Jailbreak Strategies: A Hybrid Approach to Exploiting LLM Vulnerabilities and Bypassing Modern Defenses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21972)
*Mohamed Ahmed,Mohamed Abdelmouty,Mingyu Kim,Gunvanth Kandula,Alex Park,James C. Davis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Hybrid jailbreak attacks combining token- and prompt-level techniques outperform single-mode attacks, exposing vulnerabilities in current safety measures for large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the success of PTLMs and LLMs, they are vulnerable to attacks that bypass safety measures. Existing token-level and prompt-level jailbreaks have complementary limitations.

Method: Proposed two hybrid approaches (GCG + PAIR and GCG + WordGame) integrating token- and prompt-level techniques, evaluated across Vicuna and Llama models.

Result: GCG + PAIR achieved 91.6% ASR on Llama-3, surpassing PAIR's 58.4%. GCG + WordGame maintained over 80% ASR under strict evaluators. Both hybrids bypassed advanced defenses.

Conclusion: Hybrid attacks reveal unreported vulnerabilities, emphasizing the need for holistic safeguards against adaptive adversaries.

Abstract: The advancement of Pre-Trained Language Models (PTLMs) and Large Language
Models (LLMs) has led to their widespread adoption across diverse applications.
Despite their success, these models remain vulnerable to attacks that exploit
their inherent weaknesses to bypass safety measures. Two primary
inference-phase threats are token-level and prompt-level jailbreaks.
Token-level attacks embed adversarial sequences that transfer well to black-box
models like GPT but leave detectable patterns and rely on gradient-based token
optimization, whereas prompt-level attacks use semantically structured inputs
to elicit harmful responses yet depend on iterative feedback that can be
unreliable. To address the complementary limitations of these methods, we
propose two hybrid approaches that integrate token- and prompt-level techniques
to enhance jailbreak effectiveness across diverse PTLMs. GCG + PAIR and the
newly explored GCG + WordGame hybrids were evaluated across multiple Vicuna and
Llama models. GCG + PAIR consistently raised attack-success rates over its
constituent techniques on undefended models; for instance, on Llama-3, its
Attack Success Rate (ASR) reached 91.6%, a substantial increase from PAIR's
58.4% baseline. Meanwhile, GCG + WordGame matched the raw performance of
WordGame maintaining a high ASR of over 80% even under stricter evaluators like
Mistral-Sorry-Bench. Crucially, both hybrids retained transferability and
reliably pierced advanced defenses such as Gradient Cuff and JBShield, which
fully blocked single-mode attacks. These findings expose previously unreported
vulnerabilities in current safety stacks, highlight trade-offs between raw
success and defensive robustness, and underscore the need for holistic
safeguards against adaptive adversaries.

*Simon Münker,Nils Schwager,Achim Rettinger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines using LLMs to simulate social network user behavior, emphasizing the need for rigorous validation of empirical realism in social simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conflicting findings on whether LLMs can replace humans in social science research necessitate a deeper understanding of experimental designs and validation methods.

Method: The study provides a formal framework for social network simulation, tests LLM-based approaches to imitate user communication on X in English and German, and evaluates empirical realism.

Result: Findings highlight the importance of validating social simulations by their empirical realism in the fitted setting.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for more rigor in generative-agent-based modeling for social simulation.

Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to mimic human behavior triggered
a plethora of computational social science research, assuming that empirical
studies of humans can be conducted with AI agents instead. Since there have
been conflicting research findings on whether and when this hypothesis holds,
there is a need to better understand the differences in their experimental
designs. We focus on replicating the behavior of social network users with the
use of LLMs for the analysis of communication on social networks. First, we
provide a formal framework for the simulation of social networks, before
focusing on the sub-task of imitating user communication. We empirically test
different approaches to imitate user behavior on X in English and German. Our
findings suggest that social simulations should be validated by their empirical
realism measured in the setting in which the simulation components were fitted.
With this paper, we argue for more rigor when applying generative-agent-based
modeling for social simulation.

*Kartheek Kumar Reddy Nareddy,Sarah Ternus,Julia Niebling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper improves transcription accuracy for cockpit conversations using Whisper models, reducing WER from 68.49% to 26.26% through normalization and fine-tuning with LoRA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models struggle with niche domains like cockpit speech due to specialized vocabulary and multilingual content.

Method: Collected and labeled cockpit recordings, proposed normalization schemes, and fine-tuned Whisper models using LoRA.

Result: WER decreased significantly from 68.49% to 26.26%.

Conclusion: Normalization and fine-tuning with LoRA effectively enhance ASR performance for niche domains.

Abstract: The developments in transformer encoder-decoder architectures have led to
significant breakthroughs in machine translation, Automatic Speech Recognition
(ASR), and instruction-based chat machines, among other applications. The
pre-trained models were trained on vast amounts of generic data over a few
epochs (fewer than five in most cases), resulting in their strong
generalization capabilities. Nevertheless, the performance of these models does
suffer when applied to niche domains like transcribing pilot speech in the
cockpit, which involves a lot of specific vocabulary and multilingual
conversations. This paper investigates and improves the transcription accuracy
of cockpit conversations with Whisper models. We have collected around 85
minutes of cockpit simulator recordings and 130 minutes of interview recordings
with pilots and manually labeled them. The speakers are middle aged men
speaking both German and English. To improve the accuracy of transcriptions, we
propose multiple normalization schemes to refine the transcripts and improve
Word Error Rate (WER). We then employ fine-tuning to enhance ASR performance,
utilizing performance-efficient fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).
Hereby, WER decreased from 68.49 \% (pretrained whisper Large model without
normalization baseline) to 26.26\% (finetuned whisper Large model with the
proposed normalization scheme).

*Delu Kong,Lieve Macken*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates machine translations (MTs) vs. human translations (HTs) in English-to-Chinese children's literature using stylometric analysis. Results show differences in generic and creative text features, with LLMs aligning closer to HTs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the performance of MTs (NMTs and LLMs) against HTs in children's literature translation, focusing on stylistic differences.

Method: Constructed a Peter Pan corpus with 21 translations (7 HTs, 7 LLMs, 7 NMTs). Analyzed 447 linguistic features (generic and CTT-specific) using classification and clustering techniques.

Result: HTs and MTs differ in conjunction word distributions and 1-word-gram-YiYang. LLMs outperform NMTs in CTT-specific features, aligning more with HTs stylistically.

Conclusion: LLMs show potential in children's literature translation, closely mimicking human stylistic characteristics.

Abstract: This study focuses on evaluating the performance of machine translations
(MTs) compared to human translations (HTs) in English-to-Chinese children's
literature translation (CLT) from a stylometric perspective. The research
constructs a Peter Pan corpus, comprising 21 translations: 7 human translations
(HTs), 7 large language model translations (LLMs), and 7 neural machine
translation outputs (NMTs). The analysis employs a generic feature set
(including lexical, syntactic, readability, and n-gram features) and a creative
text translation (CTT-specific) feature set, which captures repetition, rhythm,
translatability, and miscellaneous levels, yielding 447 linguistic features in
total.
  Using classification and clustering techniques in machine learning, we
conduct a stylometric analysis of these translations. Results reveal that in
generic features, HTs and MTs exhibit significant differences in conjunction
word distributions and the ratio of 1-word-gram-YiYang, while NMTs and LLMs
show significant variation in descriptive words usage and adverb ratios.
Regarding CTT-specific features, LLMs outperform NMTs in distribution, aligning
more closely with HTs in stylistic characteristics, demonstrating the potential
of LLMs in CLT.

*Delu Kong,Lieve Macken*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study identifies Machine Translationese (MTese) in English-to-Chinese translations, using a large dataset and a five-layer feature set. Findings show distinct linguistic patterns in NMTs and LLMs, with original Chinese texts easily distinguishable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the under-researched linguistic peculiarities (MTese) in English-to-Chinese machine translations, particularly in news texts.

Method: Constructed a large dataset with 4 sub-corpora, applied a five-layer feature set, and used a chi-square ranking algorithm for feature selection in classification and clustering tasks.

Result: Confirmed MTese presence in NMTs and LLMs; original Chinese texts are distinguishable. Notable patterns include shorter sentences and more adversative conjunctions in MT outputs. LLMs show greater lexical diversity, while NMTs use more brackets.

Conclusion: MTese is evident in both NMTs and LLMs, with distinct linguistic patterns. No significant differences were found between Chinese and foreign LLMs.

Abstract: This study explores Machine Translationese (MTese) -- the linguistic
peculiarities of machine translation outputs -- focusing on the
under-researched English-to-Chinese language pair in news texts. We construct a
large dataset consisting of 4 sub-corpora and employ a comprehensive five-layer
feature set. Then, a chi-square ranking algorithm is applied for feature
selection in both classification and clustering tasks. Our findings confirm the
presence of MTese in both Neural Machine Translation systems (NMTs) and Large
Language Models (LLMs). Original Chinese texts are nearly perfectly
distinguishable from both LLM and NMT outputs. Notable linguistic patterns in
MT outputs are shorter sentence lengths and increased use of adversative
conjunctions. Comparing LLMs and NMTs, we achieve approximately 70%
classification accuracy, with LLMs exhibiting greater lexical diversity and
NMTs using more brackets. Additionally, translation-specific LLMs show lower
lexical diversity but higher usage of causal conjunctions compared to generic
LLMs. Lastly, we find no significant differences between LLMs developed by
Chinese firms and their foreign counterparts.

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of the first reasoning step in LLMs' chain-of-thought reasoning, proposes a cost-efficient sampling strategy to improve it, and introduces a benchmark for evaluating self-correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite progress in LLMs' reasoning, self-correction during long chain-of-thought reasoning is underexplored, and models often overthink. The first reasoning step's disproportionate influence on final predictions is a key issue.

Method: An efficient sampling strategy using a reward model to filter high-quality first reasoning steps, reducing inference cost by 70% without accuracy loss. A new benchmark with flawed first steps is introduced.

Result: The first reasoning step significantly affects final predictions. The proposed method reduces costs while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: The work highlights the importance of the first reasoning step, offers a practical solution, and provides a benchmark for future research on robust reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
advanced complex reasoning capabilities, particularly through extended
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning that incorporates mechanisms such as
backtracking, self-reflection and self-correction. Despite these developments,
the self-correction abilities of LLMs during long CoT reasoning remain
underexplored. And recent findings on overthinking suggest that such models
often engage in unnecessarily redundant reasoning. In this work, we empirically
show that the first reasoning step exerts a disproportionately large influence
on the final prediction - errors introduced at this stage can substantially
degrade subsequent reasoning quality. This phenomenon is consistently observed
across two state-of-the-art open-source reasoning model families: DeepSeek-R1
and Qwen3. To address this, we propose an efficient sampling strategy that
leverages a reward model to identify and retain high-quality first reasoning
steps while discarding suboptimal ones, achieving up to a 70% reduction in
inference cost without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we introduce a new
benchmark specifically constructed with deliberately flawed first reasoning
steps to systematically evaluate model self-correction capabilities, offering a
foundation for future research on robust reasoning in LLMs.

Motivation: The dynamic, task-oriented dialogues in MDC exhibit rich linguistic phenomena, making it a valuable resource for studying reference.

Method: Expert annotations of anaphoric and deictic reference were added to MDC, followed by quantitative and qualitative analyses. A short experiment tested the corpus's usefulness for referring expression comprehension.

Result: MDC-R was successfully annotated and analyzed, proving useful for understanding referring expressions.

Conclusion: MDC-R enhances the original corpus with reference annotations, serving as a valuable resource for linguistic and computational research.

Abstract: We introduce the Minecraft Dialogue Corpus with Reference (MDC-R). MDC-R is a
new language resource that supplements the original Minecraft Dialogue Corpus
(MDC) with expert annotations of anaphoric and deictic reference. MDC's
task-orientated, multi-turn, situated dialogue in a dynamic environment has
motivated multiple annotation efforts, owing to the interesting linguistic
phenomena that this setting gives rise to. We believe it can serve as a
valuable resource when annotated with reference, too. Here, we discuss our
method of annotation and the resulting corpus, and provide both a quantitative
and a qualitative analysis of the data. Furthermore, we carry out a short
experiment demonstrating the usefulness of our corpus for referring expression
comprehension.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes linguistic complexity in Twitter content across COVID-19, COP26, and the Russia-Ukraine war, revealing variations by account type, political leaning, reliability, and sentiment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how language on social media reflects societal and ideological structures, especially in contested topics.

Method: Combined multiple textual complexity measures to analyze Twitter content, focusing on account type, political leaning, reliability, and sentiment.

Result: Found significant linguistic differences across all dimensions, with complex language linked to negative/offensive content and ideological convergence.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into sociolinguistic dynamics online, showing how language mirrors ideological and social structures.

Abstract: Language is a fundamental aspect of human societies, continuously evolving in
response to various stimuli, including societal changes and intercultural
interactions. Technological advancements have profoundly transformed
communication, with social media emerging as a pivotal force that merges
entertainment-driven content with complex social dynamics. As these platforms
reshape public discourse, analyzing the linguistic features of user-generated
content is essential to understanding their broader societal impact. In this
paper, we examine the linguistic complexity of content produced by influential
users on Twitter across three globally significant and contested topics:
COVID-19, COP26, and the Russia-Ukraine war. By combining multiple measures of
textual complexity, we assess how language use varies along four key
dimensions: account type, political leaning, content reliability, and
sentiment. Our analysis reveals significant differences across all four axes,
including variations in language complexity between individuals and
organizations, between profiles with sided versus moderate political views, and
between those associated with higher versus lower reliability scores.
Additionally, profiles producing more negative and offensive content tend to
use more complex language, with users sharing similar political stances and
reliability levels converging toward a common jargon. Our findings offer new
insights into the sociolinguistic dynamics of digital platforms and contribute
to a deeper understanding of how language reflects ideological and social
structures in online spaces.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study isolates and interprets a sub-network in GPT-2 Small responsible for subject-verb agreement, identifying a small but effective circuit for verb conjugation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how GPT-2 Small processes subject-verb agreement by isolating the specific sub-network involved.

Method: Uses prompts with singular/plural subjects, performance verification, automatic circuit discovery, direct path patching, and direct logit attribution.

Result: A small fraction of the network's component-token pairs suffices for basic verb conjugation, but more is needed for complex cases.

Conclusion: The identified circuit is crucial for subject-verb agreement, with simpler tasks requiring fewer components than complex ones.

Abstract: I implement a procedure to isolate and interpret the sub-network (or
"circuit") responsible for subject-verb agreement in GPT-2 Small. In this
study, the model is given prompts where the subject is either singular (e.g.
"Alice") or plural (e.g. "Alice and Bob"), and the task is to correctly predict
the appropriate verb form ("walks" for singular subjects, "walk" for plural
subjects). Using a series of techniques-including performance verification
automatic circuit discovery via direct path patching, and direct logit
attribution- I isolate a candidate circuit that contributes significantly to
the model's correct verb conjugation. The results suggest that only a small
fraction of the network's component-token pairs is needed to achieve near-model
performance on the base task but substantially more for more complex settings.

TL;DR: DAPFAM is a new domain-aware patent retrieval dataset addressing gaps in existing datasets by offering balanced query domains, multi-jurisdiction coverage, and manageable size for sub-document experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing patent retrieval datasets lack explicit in-domain/out-of-domain labeling, balanced query domains, and manageable sizes for moderate computational resources.

Method: Constructed at the simple-family level, DAPFAM includes 1,247 domain-balanced query families and 45,336 target families, enriched with relevance judgments and IPC-based labeling.

Result: The dataset contains 49,869 evaluation pairs, supports sub-document retrieval, and baseline experiments reveal challenges in cross-domain patent retrieval.

Conclusion: DAPFAM fills critical gaps in patent retrieval datasets and is publicly available for research.

Abstract: In the landscape of publicly available patent retrieval datasets, the need
for explicit indomain and out-of-domain labeling, multi-jurisdiction coverage,
balanced query domain representation and manageable sizes that support sub
document level experiments on moderate computational resources is often
overlooked. To address these gaps, we propose DAPFAM, a new open access
domain-aware patent retrieval dataset constructed at the simple-family level.
The dataset contains 1,247 domain balanced full text query families and 45,336
full text target families. The dataset is enriched by clear relevance judgments
(forward/backward citations as positive links, random negatives), as well as
explicit in-domain or out-of-domain relationships via a novel proposed
labelling scheme based on via International Patent Classification (IPC) codes,
resulting in 49,869 evaluation pairs. The dataset is multi jurisdictional,
requires little to no preprocessing for retrieval evaluation, and remains of a
size manageable for entities with limited ressources allowing for sub document
level retrieval experiments without excessive computational costs. We describe
our three-step data-curation pipeline, present comprehensive dataset
statistics, and provide baseline experiments using lexical and neural retrieval
methods. Our baseline experiments highlight significant challenges in
crossdomain patent retrieval. The dataset will be publicly available (for now
the access link is this repository:

### [196] [SAGE: Spliced-Audio Generated Data for Enhancing Foundational Models in Low-Resource Arabic-English Code-Switched Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22143)
*Muhammad Umar Farooq,Oscar Saz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates speech SSL models on dialectal Arabic and Arabic-English code-switched speech, introducing a splicing method for data generation and achieving significant WER improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing data scarcity and improving performance on dialectal Arabic and code-switched speech tasks.

Method: Proposes a modified audio-splicing approach (SAGE) for artificial CS data and an Experience Replay method for generalization.

Result: Achieves absolute WER improvements (7.8% on CS benchmarks) and outperforms larger models by 5.5-8.4%.

Conclusion: The methods effectively enhance performance on dialectal and code-switched speech, surpassing larger multilingual models.

Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of various speech SSL models on
dialectal Arabic (DA) and Arabic-English code-switched (CS) speech. To address
data scarcity, a modified audio-splicing approach is introduced to generate
artificial CS speech data. Fine-tuning an already fine-tuned SSL model with the
proposed Spliced-Audio Generated (SAGE) data results in an absolute improvement
on Word Error Rate (WER) of 7.8% on Arabic and English CS benchmarks.
Additionally, an Experience Replay (ER) inspired approach is proposed to
enhance generalisation across DA and CS speech while mitigating catastrophic
forgetting. Integrating an out-of-domain 3-gram language model reduces the
overall mean WER from 31.7% to 26.6%. Few-shot fine-tuning for code-switching
benchmarks further improves WER by 4.9%. A WER of 31.1% on Arabic-English CS
benchmarks surpasses large-scale multilingual models, including USM and
Whisper-large-v2 (both over ten times larger) by an absolute margin of 5.5% and
8.4%, respectively.

*Tianshu Yu,Chao Xiang,Mingchuan Yang,Pei Ke,Bosi Wen,Cunxiang Wang,Jiale Cheng,Li Zhang,Xinyu Mu,Chuxiong Sun,Minlie Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RCO is a framework to train critic models using refinement signals, improving LLM critiques and responses without direct preference assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited research exists on effective critiques for improving LLM responses or generating such critiques.

Method: RCO uses a feedback loop where critiques guide actor models, with critique utility (CU) as a reward signal.

Result: RCO outperforms traditional methods in critique quality and refinement across five tasks.

Conclusion: RCO enhances LLM critique-refinement loops through a novel supervision scheme and effective critiques.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable evaluation and
critique capabilities, providing insightful feedback and identifying flaws in
various tasks. However, limited research has explored which types of critiques
are most effective for improving model responses or how to generate such
critiques. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{R}efinement-oriented
\textbf{C}ritique \textbf{O}ptimization (RCO), a novel framework designed to
train critic models using refinement signals. RCO uses a feedback loop where
critiques, generated by the critic model, guide the actor model in refining its
responses. The critique utility (CU) quantifies the effectiveness of these
refinements, serving as the reward signal for training the critic model. By
focusing on critiques that lead to better refinements, RCO eliminates the need
for direct critique preference assessment, ensuring that critiques driving
meaningful improvements are rewarded. We evaluate RCO across five tasks, i.e.,
dialog generation, summarization, question answering, mathematical reasoning,
and code generation, and show that it significantly outperforms traditional
methods and open-source models in terms of critique quality and refinement
outcomes. Our contributions include the introduction of RCO, a novel
supervision scheme based on refined response preferences, and comprehensive
experimental results that highlight the method's effectiveness in enhancing LLM
critique-refinement loops.

### [198] [Leveraging In-Context Learning for Political Bias Testing of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22232)
*Patrick Haller,Jannis Vamvas,Rico Sennrich,Lena A. Jäger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Questionnaire Modeling (QM) to improve bias evaluation in LLMs by using human survey data as context, showing better stability and enabling comparisons between instruction-tuned and base models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for probing LLMs for political biases lack stability and reliability, necessitating a more contextual approach.

Method: Proposes Questionnaire Modeling (QM), which uses human survey data as in-context examples to evaluate bias in LLMs.

Result: QM improves evaluation stability, reveals bias changes due to instruction tuning, and shows larger models leverage context better with smaller bias scores.

Conclusion: QM offers a more reliable method for bias evaluation in LLMs, highlighting the impact of instruction tuning and model size on bias.

Abstract: A growing body of work has been querying LLMs with political questions to
evaluate their potential biases. However, this probing method has limited
stability, making comparisons between models unreliable. In this paper, we
argue that LLMs need more context. We propose a new probing task, Questionnaire
Modeling (QM), that uses human survey data as in-context examples. We show that
QM improves the stability of question-based bias evaluation, and demonstrate
that it may be used to compare instruction-tuned models to their base versions.
Experiments with LLMs of various sizes indicate that instruction tuning can
indeed change the direction of bias. Furthermore, we observe a trend that
larger models are able to leverage in-context examples more effectively, and
generally exhibit smaller bias scores in QM. Data and code are publicly
available.

### [199] [Detection of Personal Data in Structured Datasets Using a Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22305)
*Albert Agisha Ntwali,Luca Rück,Martin Heckmann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel GPT-4o-based method for detecting personal data in structured datasets outperforms alternatives like CASSED and Microsoft Presidio, especially when leveraging contextual information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving personal data detection in structured datasets by incorporating contextual details beyond feature names and values.

Method: Uses GPT-4o to analyze contextual information from feature names and dataset descriptions, comparing it to CASSED and Microsoft Presidio on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Result: GPT-4o excels in datasets where context matters (Kaggle, OpenML) and performs comparably on medical data (MIMIC-Demo-Ext), while CASSED and Presidio lag without context.

Conclusion: More real-world datasets with personal data are needed to advance the field.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for detecting personal data in structured
datasets, leveraging GPT-4o, a state-of-the-art Large Language Model. A key
innovation of our method is the incorporation of contextual information: in
addition to a feature's name and values, we utilize information from other
feature names within the dataset as well as the dataset description. We compare
our approach to alternative methods, including Microsoft Presidio and CASSED,
evaluating them on multiple datasets: DeSSI, a large synthetic dataset,
datasets we collected from Kaggle and OpenML as well as MIMIC-Demo-Ext, a
real-world dataset containing patient information from critical care units.
  Our findings reveal that detection performance varies significantly depending
on the dataset used for evaluation. CASSED excels on DeSSI, the dataset on
which it was trained. Performance on the medical dataset MIMIC-Demo-Ext is
comparable across all models, with our GPT-4o-based approach clearly
outperforming the others. Notably, personal data detection in the Kaggle and
OpenML datasets appears to benefit from contextual information. This is
evidenced by the poor performance of CASSED and Presidio (both of which do not
utilize the context of the dataset) compared to the strong results of our
GPT-4o-based approach.
  We conclude that further progress in this field would greatly benefit from
the availability of more real-world datasets containing personal information.

### [200] [Evaluating Scoring Bias in LLM-as-a-Judge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22316)
*Qingquan Li,Shaoyu Dou,Kailai Shao,Chao Chen,Haixiang Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates scoring bias in LLM-as-a-Judge systems, proposing a framework to evaluate and mitigate such biases, which disrupt fairness and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are widely used as evaluators (LLM-as-a-Judge), but biases in scoring-based evaluations remain understudied, affecting fairness.

Method: The study defines scoring bias, constructs an evaluation dataset via data synthesis, and designs multi-faceted metrics to assess bias.

Result: Experiments show scoring biases disrupt judge models' stability, with insights on prompt design and bias mitigation strategies.

Conclusion: The work highlights the need for addressing scoring biases in LLM-as-a-Judge systems and offers practical mitigation insights.

Abstract: The remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) gives rise
to``LLM-as-a-Judge'', where LLMs are employed as evaluators for complex tasks.
Moreover, it has been widely adopted across fields such as Natural Language
Processing (NLP), preference learning, and various specific domains. However,
there are various biases within LLM-as-a-Judge, which adversely affect the
fairness and reliability of judgments. Current research on evaluating or
mitigating bias in LLM-as-a-Judge predominantly focuses on comparison-based
evaluations, while systematic investigations into bias in scoring-based
evaluations remain limited. Therefore, we define scoring bias in LLM-as-a-Judge
as the scores differ when scoring judge models are bias-related perturbed, and
provide a well-designed framework to comprehensively evaluate scoring bias. We
augment existing LLM-as-a-Judge benchmarks through data synthesis to construct
our evaluation dataset and design multi-faceted evaluation metrics. Our
experimental results demonstrate that the scoring stability of existing judge
models is disrupted by scoring biases. Further exploratory experiments and
discussions provide valuable insights into the design of scoring prompt
templates and the mitigation of scoring biases on aspects such as score
rubrics, score IDs, and reference answer selection.

### [201] [Why Are Parsing Actions for Understanding Message Hierarchies Not Random?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22366)
*Daichi Kato,Ryo Ueda,Yusuke Miyao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates why random parsing strategies, unlike human language comprehension, can achieve high communication accuracy in models with hierarchical biases. It modifies the experimental setup to test this under more complex inputs and a surprisal-related objective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why random parsing strategies deviate from human-like language comprehension yet succeed in models, and to test their robustness under more challenging conditions.

Method: Modifies the experimental setup by (I) using complex hierarchical inputs and (II) adding a surprisal-related term to the objective function.

Result: Evaluates whether random parsing strategies retain high communication accuracy under these modified conditions.

Conclusion: The study aims to clarify the conditions under which random parsing strategies succeed or fail, shedding light on human language comprehension.

Abstract: If humans understood language by randomly selecting parsing actions, it might
have been necessary to construct a robust symbolic system capable of being
interpreted under any hierarchical structure. However, human parsing strategies
do not seem to follow such a random pattern. Why is that the case? In fact, a
previous study on emergent communication using models with hierarchical biases
have reported that agents adopting random parsing
strategies$\unicode{x2013}$ones that deviate significantly from human language
comprehension$\unicode{x2013}$can achieve high communication accuracy. In this
study, we investigate this issue by making two simple and natural modifications
to the experimental setup: (I) we use more complex inputs that have
hierarchical structures, such that random parsing makes semantic interpretation
more difficult, and (II) we incorporate a surprisal-related term, which is
known to influence the order of words and characters in natural language, into
the objective function. With these changes, we evaluate whether agents
employing random parsing strategies still maintain high communication accuracy.

*Danush Khanna,Aditya Kumar Guru,Srivarshinee Sridhar,Zidan Ahmed,Rubhav Bahirwani,Meetu Malhotra,Vinija Jain,Aman Chadha,Amitava Das,Kripabandhu Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QuickSilver is a token-level framework for runtime optimization of LLMs, reducing FLOPs by up to 39.6% without altering model weights or structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inference latency and energy costs dominate LLM deployments, but existing optimization methods require retraining or architectural changes.

Method: QuickSilver uses Dynamic Token Halting, KV Cache Skipping, and Contextual Token Fusion to adaptively optimize inference.

Result: Achieves up to 39.6% FLOP reduction with minimal perplexity increase (<=0.2) on GPT-2 and Llama-2.

Conclusion: QuickSilver offers a modular, efficient solution for runtime optimization without disrupting model compatibility.

Abstract: Inference accounts for the majority of latency and energy consumption in
large language model (LLM) deployments, often exceeding 90% of total cost.
While training-time efficiency has seen extensive progress, runtime
optimization remains a key bottleneck, particularly under autoregressive
decoding. Existing approaches -- such as pruning, quantization, early exits,
and speculative decoding -- often require retraining, architectural changes, or
disrupt decoding compatibility. We introduce QuickSilver, a modular,
token-level framework that enables semantic adaptivity at inference time
without altering model weights or structure. QuickSilver integrates four
synergistic mechanisms:
  (i) Dynamic Token Halting, which halts computation for tokens with converged
representations; (ii) KV Cache Skipping, which selectively suppresses memory
writes to reduce attention overhead; and (iii) Contextual Token Fusion, which
collapses redundant tokens into shared paths to shrink sequence length.
  Unlike speculative decoding or MoE routing, QuickSilver operates entirely on
frozen, dense models and requires no auxiliary networks. Applied to GPT-2 and
Llama-2 across WikiText-103 and C4, QuickSilver achieves up to 39.6% FLOP
reduction with negligible perplexity degradation (<=0.2).

Motivation: To advance Czech GEC by leveraging synthetic error generation and exploring model configurations and LLMs.

Method: Transformer-based neural network with dynamic synthetic error generation, tested on Czech corpora with varied strategies, domain balancing, and model sizes.

Result: Best model excels in performance and efficiency; LLMs evaluated for Czech GEC in user and expert scenarios.

Conclusion: The system sets a new benchmark for Czech GEC, with open-source availability for further research.

Abstract: We present a grammar error correction (GEC) system that achieves state of the
art for the Czech language. Our system is based on a neural network translation
approach with the Transformer architecture, and its key feature is its
real-time synthetic generation pipeline, which dynamically augments sentences
with artificial errors by introducing both language-agnostic and Czech-specific
errors. We conduct a comprehensive series of experiments, investigating the
Czech GEC corpora as bases for synthetic error introduction, several error
generation strategies, domain balancing, tokenization granularity, model size,
and data scaling during fine-tuning. Additionally, we evaluate the performance
of large language models (LLMs) on Czech GEC in both end-user and expert
fine-tuning scenarios. Our best-performing model is superior both in
performance and computational efficiency. The source code and the trained model

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust bilingual (Korean-English) reasoning-focused model with competitive performance on Korean benchmarks and lower training compute.

Method: Pre-trained on 6 trillion tokens, uses a Peri-LN Transformer scaled with μP, three-stage curriculum, and post-trained via supervised fine-tuning with Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards.

Result: Competitive performance on Korean benchmarks (KMMLU, CSAT, etc.), robust bilingual consistency, and vision-augmented variant matching GPT-4.1 on KCSAT STEM.

Conclusion: HyperCLOVA X THINK is a strong foundation for Korean AI innovation and a valuable resource globally, with plans for open-source and business-friendly applications.

Abstract: We introduce HyperCLOVA X THINK, the first reasoning-focused large language
model in the HyperCLOVA X family, pre-trained on roughly $6$ trillion
high-quality Korean, and English tokens, augmented with targeted synthetic
Korean data. It was implemented as a compute-memory-balanced Peri-LN
Transformer scaled with $\mu$P, pre-trained through a three-stage curriculum
that expands the context window to $128$K tokens, and post-trained via
supervised fine-tuning with Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards
supports both detailed rationale and concise-answer modes. It delivers
competitive performance against similarly sized models on Korea-focused
benchmarks such as KMMLU, CSAT, KoBALT-700, HAERAE-1.0, and KoBigBench, while
preserving robust bilingual consistency and translation quality. In addition, a
vision-augmented variant matches or exceeds GPT-4.1 on the KCSAT STEM
benchmark, all of which are achieved with substantially lower training compute
than existing models of similar sizes. We also present a pruning and
distillation technique that will soon be applied to HyperCLOVA X THINK for an
open-source and business-friendly foundation model. Altogether, these
capabilities position HyperCLOVA X THINK as a robust foundation for Korean AI
innovation and a valuable resource for the global research community.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Sequential Diagnosis Benchmark and MAI-DxO, an AI orchestrator, to improve diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness in medicine, achieving 80-85.5% accuracy and reducing costs by 20-70%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of AI in medicine lack real-world complexity. The paper aims to emulate the iterative diagnostic process of physicians to enhance AI's clinical utility.

Method: The Sequential Diagnosis Benchmark transforms 304 NEJM-CPC cases into stepwise encounters. MAI-DxO orchestrates AI models to simulate physician panels, propose diagnoses, and select cost-effective tests.

Result: MAI-DxO achieves 80-85.5% diagnostic accuracy (4x higher than physicians) and reduces costs by 20-70%. Performance generalizes across multiple AI models.

Conclusion: AI systems like MAI-DxO, designed for iterative reasoning and judicious action, can significantly improve diagnostic precision and cost-effectiveness in clinical care.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence holds great promise for expanding access to expert
medical knowledge and reasoning. However, most evaluations of language models
rely on static vignettes and multiple-choice questions that fail to reflect the
complexity and nuance of evidence-based medicine in real-world settings. In
clinical practice, physicians iteratively formulate and revise diagnostic
hypotheses, adapting each subsequent question and test to what they've just
learned, and weigh the evolving evidence before committing to a final
diagnosis. To emulate this iterative process, we introduce the Sequential
Diagnosis Benchmark, which transforms 304 diagnostically challenging New
England Journal of Medicine clinicopathological conference (NEJM-CPC) cases
into stepwise diagnostic encounters. A physician or AI begins with a short case
abstract and must iteratively request additional details from a gatekeeper
model that reveals findings only when explicitly queried. Performance is
assessed not just by diagnostic accuracy but also by the cost of physician
visits and tests performed. We also present the MAI Diagnostic Orchestrator
(MAI-DxO), a model-agnostic orchestrator that simulates a panel of physicians,
proposes likely differential diagnoses and strategically selects high-value,
cost-effective tests. When paired with OpenAI's o3 model, MAI-DxO achieves 80%
diagnostic accuracy--four times higher than the 20% average of generalist
physicians. MAI-DxO also reduces diagnostic costs by 20% compared to
physicians, and 70% compared to off-the-shelf o3. When configured for maximum
accuracy, MAI-DxO achieves 85.5% accuracy. These performance gains with MAI-DxO
generalize across models from the OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, Grok, DeepSeek, and
Llama families. We highlight how AI systems, when guided to think iteratively
and act judiciously, can advance diagnostic precision and cost-effectiveness in
clinical care.

*Minjie Hong,Zirun Guo,Yan Xia,Zehan Wang,Ziang Zhang,Tao Jin,Zhou Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Asymmetric Policy Optimization (APO) with DADS and STCR to enhance reasoning in MLLMs, avoiding performance drops and overthinking, achieving a 7% gain over the base model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with complex reasoning, and RL application often causes performance drops or overthinking.

Method: APO divides responses into positive/negative groups, using DADS for adaptive KL divergence and STCR to penalize lengthy reasoning.

Result: View-R1-3B shows a 7% reasoning improvement, outperforms larger models, and maintains general task performance.

Conclusion: DADS and STCR effectively advance multimodal reasoning without degrading general capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are powerful at integrating diverse
data, but they often struggle with complex reasoning. While Reinforcement
learning (RL) can boost reasoning in LLMs, applying it to MLLMs is tricky.
Common issues include a drop in performance on general tasks and the generation
of overly detailed or "overthinking" reasoning. Our work investigates how the
KL penalty and overthinking affect RL training in MLLMs. We propose Asymmetric
Policy Optimization (APO) to address these issues, which divides the sampled
responses into positive and negative groups. For positive samples,
Difficulty-Adaptive Divergence Shaping (DADS) is introduced to dynamically
adjust the KL divergence weight based on their difficulty. This method prevents
policy entropy from dropping sharply, improves training stability, utilizes
samples better, and preserves the model's existing knowledge. For negative
samples, Suboptimal Trajectory Complexity Regularization (STCR) is proposed to
penalize overly long responses. This helps mitigate overthinking and encourages
more concise reasoning while preserving the model's explorative capacity. We
apply our method to Qwen2.5-VL-3B, creating View-R1-3B. View-R1-3B
significantly enhances reasoning capabilities, showing an average 7\% gain over
the base model and outperforming larger MLLMs (7-11B) on various reasoning
benchmarks. Importantly, unlike other reasoning-tuned MLLMs that often degrade
on general tasks, View-R1-3B maintains consistent improvement, demonstrating
superior generalization. These results highlight the effectiveness and broad
applicability of our DADS and STCR techniques for advancing complex multimodal
reasoning in MLLMs. The code will be made available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model-based algorithms for risk measures like ERM and EVaR are limited to small problems and require full transition probabilities.

Method: A Q-learning algorithm is introduced to compute optimal stationary policies for total-reward ERM and EVaR objectives, leveraging ERM's dynamic consistency and elicitability.

Result: Numerical results show quick and reliable convergence of the Q-learning algorithm to the optimal risk-averse value function in tabular domains.

Conclusion: The proposed Q-learning algorithm effectively addresses the limitations of model-based methods, offering a scalable solution for risk-averse MDPs.

Abstract: Risk-averse total-reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) offer a promising
framework for modeling and solving undiscounted infinite-horizon objectives.
Existing model-based algorithms for risk measures like the entropic risk
measure (ERM) and entropic value-at-risk (EVaR) are effective in small
problems, but require full access to transition probabilities. We propose a
Q-learning algorithm to compute the optimal stationary policy for total-reward
ERM and EVaR objectives with strong convergence and performance guarantees. The
algorithm and its optimality are made possible by ERM's dynamic consistency and
elicitability. Our numerical results on tabular domains demonstrate quick and
reliable convergence of the proposed Q-learning algorithm to the optimal
risk-averse value function.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reveals a unimodal relationship between cluster count and neighborhood radius in density-based clustering, proposes efficient parameter tuning via Ternary Search, and validates it on large-scale, high-dimensional tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Density-based clustering excels with noisy or complex data, but parameter tuning (e.g., radius) is computationally intensive, especially for large-scale, high-dimensional datasets.

Method: Leverages the unimodal relationship between cluster count and radius to devise efficient parameter tuning strategies using Ternary Search.

Result: Validated on NLP, Audio, and Computer Vision tasks, showing practical effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: Advances parameter control for density-based clustering and deepens understanding of parameter relationships.

Abstract: Density-based clustering methods often surpass centroid-based counterparts,
when addressing data with noise or arbitrary data distributions common in
real-world problems. In this study, we reveal a key property intrinsic to
density-based clustering methods regarding the relation between the number of
clusters and the neighborhood radius of core points - we empirically show that
it is nearly unimodal, and support this claim theoretically in a specific
setting. We leverage this property to devise new strategies for finding
appropriate values for the radius more efficiently based on the Ternary Search
algorithm. This is especially important for large scale data that is
high-dimensional, where parameter tuning is computationally intensive. We
validate our methodology through extensive applications across a range of
high-dimensional, large-scale NLP, Audio, and Computer Vision tasks,
demonstrating its practical effectiveness and robustness. This work not only
offers a significant advancement in parameter control for density-based
clustering but also broadens the understanding regarding the relations between
their guiding parameters. Our code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dynamic control method for quality-complexity tradeoffs in CNFs and DMs by rewiring transformer blocks and using consistency terms, reducing latency and improving FID scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational complexity of sampling in CNFs and DMs, the work explores dynamic control over time steps and neural network length.

Method: Rewires transformer blocks to solve an inner ODE and employs time- and length-wise consistency terms during training, enabling flexible sampling.

Result: Achieves up to 3× latency reduction and 3.5 FID score improvement on CelebA-HQ and ImageNet.

Conclusion: The proposed ODE_t (ODE_l) approach is solver-agnostic, efficient, and improves both latency and generation quality.

Abstract: Recently, continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) and diffusion models (DMs) have
been studied using the unified theoretical framework. Although such models can
generate high-quality data points from a noise distribution, the sampling
demands multiple iterations to solve an ordinary differential equation (ODE)
with high computational complexity. Most existing methods focus on reducing the
number of time steps during the sampling process to improve efficiency. In this
work, we explore a complementary direction in which the quality-complexity
tradeoff can be dynamically controlled in terms of time steps and in the length
of the neural network. We achieve this by rewiring the blocks in the
transformer-based architecture to solve an inner discretized ODE w.r.t. its
length. Then, we employ time- and length-wise consistency terms during flow
matching training, and as a result, the sampling can be performed with an
arbitrary number of time steps and transformer blocks. Unlike others, our
$\textrm{ODE}_t \left(\textrm{ODE}_l \right)$ approach is solver-agnostic in
time dimension and decreases both latency and memory usage. Compared to the
previous state of the art, image generation experiments on CelebA-HQ and
ImageNet show a latency reduction of up to $3\times$ in the most efficient
sampling mode, and a FID score improvement of up to $3.5$ points for
high-quality sampling. We release our code and model weights with fully
reproducible experiments.

TL;DR: Text-to-text regression outperforms traditional tabular methods in predicting metric outcomes for complex systems, achieving near-perfect rank correlation and lower MSE, while adapting easily to new tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional tabular regression struggles with complex systems data like configuration files or logs, where feature engineering is impractical.

Method: Proposes text-to-text regression using a 60M parameter encoder-decoder model trained from scratch, tested on Google's Borg system.

Result: Achieves 0.99 rank correlation (0.9 average), 100x lower MSE than tabular methods, and adapts to new tasks with 500 examples.

Conclusion: Text-to-text regression is a scalable, effective alternative for complex systems, enabling universal simulators of real-world outcomes.

Abstract: In many industries, predicting metric outcomes of large systems is a
fundamental problem, driven largely by traditional tabular regression. However,
such methods struggle on complex systems data in the wild such as configuration
files or system logs, where feature engineering is often infeasible. We propose
text-to-text regression as a general, scalable alternative. For predicting
resource efficiency on Borg, Google's massive compute cluster scheduling
system, a 60M parameter encoder-decoder, trained from random initialization,
achieves up to a near perfect 0.99 (0.9 average) rank correlation across the

adapts to new tasks in only 500 few-shot examples and captures the densities of
complex outcome distributions. Ablation studies highlight the importance of
using encoders, increasing sequence length, and the model's inherent
uncertainty quantification. These findings pave the way for universal
simulators of real-world outcomes.

*Biying Zhou,Nanyu Luo,Feng Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedIRT integrates federated learning with IRT to enable privacy-preserving, distributed estimation of latent abilities and item difficulty without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional IRT requires centralized data, raising privacy concerns. Federated learning offers privacy protection and distributed computing, motivating its integration with IRT.

Method: Proposes Federated Item Response Theory (FedIRT), a framework for estimating IRT models in a distributed manner while preserving privacy. Validated using numerical experiments and a real-world exam dataset.

Result: FedIRT matches standard IRT accuracy, ensures privacy, and reduces communication costs. Demonstrated effectiveness in educational settings.

Conclusion: FedIRT extends IRT to distributed contexts like multi-school assessments, maintaining accuracy and security. An open-source R package is provided for practical use.

Abstract: Item Response Theory (IRT) models have been widely used to estimate
respondents' latent abilities and calibrate items' difficulty. Traditional IRT
estimation requires all individual raw response data to be centralized in one
place, thus potentially causing privacy issues. Federated learning is an
emerging field in computer science and machine learning with added features of
privacy protection and distributed computing. To integrate the advances from
federated learning with modern psychometrics, we propose a novel framework,
Federated Item Response Theory (IRT), to enable estimating traditional IRT
models with additional privacy, allowing estimation in a distributed manner
without losing estimation accuracy.
  Our numerical experiments confirm that FedIRT achieves statistical accuracy
similar to standard IRT estimation using popular R packages, while offering
critical advantages: privacy protection and reduced communication costs. We
also validate FedIRT's utility through a real-world exam dataset, demonstrating
its effectiveness in realistic educational contexts. This new framework extends
IRT's applicability to distributed settings, such as multi-school assessments,
without sacrificing accuracy or security. To support practical adoption, we
provide an open-ource R package, FedIRT, implementing the framework for the
two-parameter logistic (2PL) and partial credit models (PCM).

### [212] [Gradient-Based Neuroplastic Adaptation for Concurrent Optimization of Neuro-Fuzzy Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21771)
*John Wesley Hostetter,Min Chi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel gradient-based neuroplastic adaptation method is proposed for concurrent optimization of neuro-fuzzy networks (NFNs) parameters and structure, enabling applications like online reinforcement learning for vision-based tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NFN design processes inefficiently isolate parametric and structural identification, leading to suboptimal architectures. The paper aims to address this by optimizing both aspects simultaneously.

Method: The proposed approach uses gradient-based neuroplastic adaptation to concurrently optimize NFNs' parameters and structure, recognizing their deep interconnection.

Result: The method is empirically validated by training NFNs via online reinforcement learning to perform well in challenging scenarios of the vision-based game DOOM.

Conclusion: Simultaneous optimization of NFNs' parameters and structure unlocks new applications, such as online reinforcement learning, demonstrating the method's effectiveness.

Abstract: Neuro-fuzzy networks (NFNs) are transparent, symbolic, and universal function
approximations that perform as well as conventional neural architectures, but
their knowledge is expressed as linguistic IF-THEN rules. Despite these
advantages, their systematic design process remains a challenge. Existing work
will often sequentially build NFNs by inefficiently isolating parametric and
structural identification, leading to a premature commitment to brittle and
subpar architecture. We propose a novel application-independent approach called
gradient-based neuroplastic adaptation for the concurrent optimization of NFNs'
parameters and structure. By recognizing that NFNs' parameters and structure
should be optimized simultaneously as they are deeply conjoined, settings
previously unapproachable for NFNs are now accessible, such as the online
reinforcement learning of NFNs for vision-based tasks. The effectiveness of
concurrently optimizing NFNs is empirically shown as it is trained by online
reinforcement learning to proficiently play challenging scenarios from a
vision-based video game called DOOM.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: M3PO is a scalable model-based RL framework improving sample efficiency and generalization by integrating an implicit world model and hybrid exploration strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses sample inefficiency in single-task settings and poor generalization in multi-task domains, overcoming limitations of existing model-based and model-free methods.

Method: Combines an implicit world model (predicting task outcomes without reconstruction) with a hybrid exploration strategy (model-based planning + model-free uncertainty bonuses). Uses discrepancies between model-based and model-free value estimates for exploration and a trust-region optimizer for stable policy updates.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, providing an efficient and robust alternative to existing approaches.

Conclusion: M3PO effectively addresses key challenges in RL, offering improved sample efficiency, generalization, and performance.

Abstract: We introduce Massively Multi-Task Model-Based Policy Optimization (M3PO), a
scalable model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) framework designed to
address sample inefficiency in single-task settings and poor generalization in
multi-task domains. Existing model-based approaches like DreamerV3 rely on
pixel-level generative models that neglect control-centric representations,
while model-free methods such as PPO suffer from high sample complexity and
weak exploration. M3PO integrates an implicit world model, trained to predict
task outcomes without observation reconstruction, with a hybrid exploration
strategy that combines model-based planning and model-free uncertainty-driven
bonuses. This eliminates the bias-variance trade-off in prior methods by using
discrepancies between model-based and model-free value estimates to guide
exploration, while maintaining stable policy updates through a trust-region
optimizer. M3PO provides an efficient and robust alternative to existing
model-based policy optimization approaches and achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in processing multi-source, multi-fidelity data and enhance model transferability in atomistic modeling.

Method: Multi-task learning with shared message passing layers and data-specific decoding heads, implemented in HydraGNN with GPU acceleration.

Result: Efficient scaling on Perlmutter, Aurora, and Frontier supercomputers, trained on 24 million structures.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances scalability and generalizability for large, diverse datasets in atomistic modeling.

Abstract: Graph foundation models using graph neural networks promise sustainable,
efficient atomistic modeling. To tackle challenges of processing multi-source,
multi-fidelity data during pre-training, recent studies employ multi-task
learning, in which shared message passing layers initially process input
atomistic structures regardless of source, then route them to multiple decoding
heads that predict data-specific outputs. This approach stabilizes pre-training
and enhances a model's transferability to unexplored chemical regions.
Preliminary results on approximately four million structures are encouraging,
yet questions remain about generalizability to larger, more diverse datasets
and scalability on supercomputers. We propose a multi-task parallelism method
that distributes each head across computing resources with GPU acceleration.
Implemented in the open-source HydraGNN architecture, our method was trained on
over 24 million structures from five datasets and tested on the Perlmutter,
Aurora, and Frontier supercomputers, demonstrating efficient scaling on all
three highly heterogeneous super-computing architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explains how discrete symbolic structures emerge from continuous neural network training dynamics using Wasserstein gradient flow and geometric constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between continuous neural learning and discrete symbolic reasoning by understanding the emergence of symbolic structures from neural dynamics.

Method: Lifts neural parameters to a measure space, models training as Wasserstein gradient flow, and analyzes decoupling and contraction under geometric constraints like group invariance.

Result: Shows that training transitions to compositional representations with lower degrees of freedom, complying with algebraic operations, and establishes data scaling laws for symbolic tasks.

Conclusion: Provides a foundation for designing neurosymbolic systems that integrate continuous learning with discrete algebraic reasoning.

Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework that explains how discrete symbolic
structures can emerge naturally from continuous neural network training
dynamics. By lifting neural parameters to a measure space and modeling training
as Wasserstein gradient flow, we show that under geometric constraints, such as
group invariance, the parameter measure $\mu_t$ undergoes two concurrent
phenomena: (1) a decoupling of the gradient flow into independent optimization
trajectories over some potential functions, and (2) a progressive contraction
on the degree of freedom. These potentials encode algebraic constraints
relevant to the task and act as ring homomorphisms under a commutative
semi-ring structure on the measure space. As training progresses, the network
transitions from a high-dimensional exploration to compositional
representations that comply with algebraic operations and exhibit a lower
degree of freedom. We further establish data scaling laws for realizing
symbolic tasks, linking representational capacity to the group invariance that
facilitates symbolic solutions. This framework charts a principled foundation
for understanding and designing neurosymbolic systems that integrate continuous
learning with discrete algebraic reasoning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares forward-mode automatic differentiation (FmAD) and zero-order (ZO) optimization with backpropagation (BP) and checkpointing, showing BP's superiority in accuracy, speed, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the practical benefits of FmAD and ZO compared to memory-efficient BP variants like checkpointing, addressing gaps in prior comparisons and theoretical analysis.

Method: Theoretical and empirical comparison of BP, FmAD, and ZO methods, including experiments on large language and vision-language models.

Result: BP with checkpointing outperforms FmAD and ZO, achieving higher accuracy (31.1%), faster convergence (34.8%), and fewer computations (3.8x) at similar memory usage.

Conclusion: BP with checkpointing remains the most effective for memory-constrained training, highlighting limitations of FmAD and ZO.

Abstract: Forward-mode automatic differentiation (FmAD) and zero-order (ZO)
optimization have been proposed as memory-efficient alternatives to
backpropagation (BP) for gradient computation, especially in low-resource
settings. However, their practical benefits remain unclear due to two key gaps:
a lack of comparison against memory-efficient BP variants, such as activation
checkpointing, and a lack of a unified theoretical analysis. This work presents
a comprehensive theoretical and empirical comparison of BP, FmAD, and ZO
methods. Our theoretical analysis shows that while FmAD, and ZO can reduce
memory usage, they incur significant costs in accuracy, convergence speed, and
computation compared to BP with checkpointing. These drawbacks worsen with
larger models or constrained perturbation budgets. Empirical experiments on
large language and vision-language models show that BP with checkpointing
outperforms FmAD and ZO variants, including those enhanced with variance
reduction, achieving up to 31.1% higher accuracy, 34.8% faster convergence, and
3.8x fewer computations at comparable memory usage. Our results highlight
fundamental limitations of FmAD and ZO, and reaffirm BP with checkpointing as
the most effective strategy for model training under memory-constrained
settings. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Partial observations are common but challenging, especially in stochastic systems. The study aims to bridge the Mori-Zwanzig formalism and Koopman operator theory to address this.

Method: Uses Koopman operator theory to analyze partial observations in stochastic systems, incorporating delay embedding and numerical experiments.

Result: Delay embedding is effective in stochastic systems, with numerical experiments showing power-law behavior in accuracy relative to additive noise amplitude.

Conclusion: The study underscores the importance of distinguishing state and function spaces in stochastic systems and demonstrates the utility of delay embedding for partial observations.

Abstract: It is sometimes difficult to achieve a complete observation for a full set of
observables, and partial observations are necessary. For deterministic systems,
the Mori-Zwanzig formalism provides a theoretical framework for handling
partial observations. Recently, data-driven algorithms based on the Koopman
operator theory have made significant progress, and there is a discussion to
connect the Mori-Zwanzig formalism with the Koopman operator theory. In this
work, we discuss the effects of partial observation in stochastic systems using
the Koopman operator theory. The discussion clarifies the importance of
distinguishing the state space and the function space in stochastic systems.
Even in stochastic systems, the delay embedding technique is beneficial for
partial observation, and several numerical experiments showed a power-law
behavior of the accuracy for the amplitude of the additive noise. We also
discuss the relation between the exponent of the power-law behavior and the
effects of partial observation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift to 6G requires semantic-aware communication, focusing on task-relevant information over bit-centric transmission.

Method: TOAST uses deep reinforcement learning for task balancing, LoRA for efficient fine-tuning, and a diffusion model for noise restoration.

Result: TOAST outperforms baselines in classification accuracy and reconstruction quality, especially at low SNR.

Conclusion: TOAST provides robust, efficient, and high-performance semantic communication for 6G networks.

Abstract: The evolution toward 6G networks demands a fundamental shift from bit-centric
transmission to semantic-aware communication that emphasizes task-relevant
information. This work introduces TOAST (Task-Oriented Adaptive Semantic
Transmission), a unified framework designed to address the core challenge of
multi-task optimization in dynamic wireless environments through three
complementary components. First, we formulate adaptive task balancing as a
Markov decision process, employing deep reinforcement learning to dynamically
adjust the trade-off between image reconstruction fidelity and semantic
classification accuracy based on real-time channel conditions. Second, we
integrate module-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) mechanisms throughout our
Swin Transformer-based joint source-channel coding architecture, enabling
parameter-efficient fine-tuning that dramatically reduces adaptation overhead
while maintaining full performance across diverse channel impairments including
Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN), fading, phase noise, and impulse
interference. Third, we incorporate an Elucidating diffusion model that
operates in the latent space to restore features corrupted by channel noises,
providing substantial quality improvements compared to baseline approaches.
Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that TOAST achieves
superior performance compared to baseline approaches, with significant
improvements in both classification accuracy and reconstruction quality at low
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) conditions while maintaining robust performance

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) offer potential for near-term quantum

poorly conditioned optimization landscapes. We introduce GuiderNet, a
meta-learning framework that conditions Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQCs)
using data-dependent parameter shifts aimed at minimizing the log condition
number of the Fubini-Study metric tensor. Implemented as a classical neural
network, GuiderNet is meta-trained to guide PQC parameters into geometrically
favorable regions and is embedded within hybrid quantum-classical pipelines to
steer both initialization and adaptive modulation during training.
  Applied to the Kaggle Diabetes classification task, GuiderNet reduces
cumulative training loss by over 5x, improves test accuracy from 75.3% to

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A physics-informed DAS neural network paradigm is proposed, eliminating the need for real-world event data by using physical modeling for training. It achieves high accuracy in event identification and noise removal, demonstrating strong generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming the limitation of scarce real-world event data in DAS applications by leveraging physics-informed AI models.

Method: Uses physical modeling to generate synthetic DAS event data for training a generative network and a debackground net for noise removal.

Result: Achieves 91.8% fault diagnosis accuracy and comparable/better performance than data-driven models trained with real-world data.

Conclusion: The paradigm addresses data acquisition and noise challenges in DAS, offering a scalable solution for diverse applications.

Abstract: Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) has attracted considerable attention
across various fields and artificial intelligence (AI) technology plays an
important role in DAS applications to realize event recognition and denoising.
Existing AI models require real-world data (RWD), whether labeled or not, for
training, which is contradictory to the fact of limited available event data in
real-world scenarios. Here, a physics-informed DAS neural network paradigm is
proposed, which does not need real-world events data for training. By
physically modeling target events and the constraints of real world and DAS
system, physical functions are derived to train a generative network for
generation of DAS events data. DAS debackground net is trained by using the
generated DAS events data to eliminate background noise in DAS data. The
effectiveness of the proposed paradigm is verified in event identification
application based on a public dataset of DAS spatiotemporal data and in belt
conveyor fault monitoring application based on DAS time-frequency data, and
achieved comparable or better performance than data-driven networks trained
with RWD. Owing to the introduction of physical information and capability of
background noise removal, the paradigm demonstrates generalization in same
application on different sites. A fault diagnosis accuracy of 91.8% is achieved
in belt conveyor field with networks which transferred from simulation test
site without any fault events data of test site and field for training. The
proposed paradigm is a prospective solution to address significant obstacles of
data acquisition and intense noise in practical DAS applications and explore
more potential fields for DAS.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces R* Decision Transformer (R* DT) to improve auto-bidding in online advertising by addressing limitations of traditional Decision Transformer (DT), such as preset RTG values and mixed-quality training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Auto-bidding systems in online advertising face challenges like short-sightedness and reliance on mixed-quality data. The goal is to enhance automation and performance.

Method: The R* DT is developed in three steps: R DT (stores actions and RTG), R^ DT (forecasts optimal RTG), and R* DT (enhances training data with high-reward trajectories).

Result: Tests on a bidding dataset show R* DT outperforms traditional DT, especially with mixed-quality trajectories.

Conclusion: R* DT effectively improves auto-bidding by optimizing RTG and refining policies through data augmentation.

Abstract: In the realm of online advertising, advertisers partake in ad auctions to
obtain advertising slots, frequently taking advantage of auto-bidding tools
provided by demand-side platforms. To improve the automation of these bidding
systems, we adopt generative models, namely the Decision Transformer (DT), to
tackle the difficulties inherent in automated bidding. Applying the Decision
Transformer to the auto-bidding task enables a unified approach to sequential
modeling, which efficiently overcomes short-sightedness by capturing long-term
dependencies between past bidding actions and user behavior. Nevertheless,
conventional DT has certain drawbacks: (1) DT necessitates a preset
return-to-go (RTG) value before generating actions, which is not inherently
produced; (2) The policy learned by DT is restricted by its training data,
which is consists of mixed-quality trajectories. To address these challenges,
we introduce the R* Decision Transformer (R* DT), developed in a three-step
process: (1) R DT: Similar to traditional DT, R DT stores actions based on
state and RTG value, as well as memorizing the RTG for a given state using the
training set; (2) R^ DT: We forecast the highest value (within the training
set) of RTG for a given state, deriving a suboptimal policy based on the
current state and the forecasted supreme RTG value; (3) R* DT: Based on R^ DT,
we generate trajectories and select those with high rewards (using a simulator)
to augment our training dataset. This data enhancement has been shown to
improve the RTG of trajectories in the training data and gradually leads the
suboptimal policy towards optimality. Comprehensive tests on a publicly
available bidding dataset validate the R* DT's efficacy and highlight its
superiority when dealing with mixed-quality trajectories.

Motivation: To address the limitations of manually-driven miles for AV testing by creating a scalable, realistic traffic simulation system.

Method: Proposes SceneDiffuser++, an end-to-end generative world model trained on a single loss function, integrating scene generation, agent behavior, occlusion reasoning, and dynamic scene generation.

Result: Demonstrates city-scale traffic simulation with superior realism, evaluated on an augmented WOMD dataset.

Conclusion: SceneDiffuser++ successfully integrates multiple simulation technologies, offering a scalable and realistic solution for AV testing.

Abstract: The goal of traffic simulation is to augment a potentially limited amount of
manually-driven miles that is available for testing and validation, with a much
larger amount of simulated synthetic miles. The culmination of this vision
would be a generative simulated city, where given a map of the city and an
autonomous vehicle (AV) software stack, the simulator can seamlessly simulate
the trip from point A to point B by populating the city around the AV and
controlling all aspects of the scene, from animating the dynamic agents (e.g.,
vehicles, pedestrians) to controlling the traffic light states. We refer to
this vision as CitySim, which requires an agglomeration of simulation
technologies: scene generation to populate the initial scene, agent behavior
modeling to animate the scene, occlusion reasoning, dynamic scene generation to
seamlessly spawn and remove agents, and environment simulation for factors such
as traffic lights. While some key technologies have been separately studied in
various works, others such as dynamic scene generation and environment
simulation have received less attention in the research community. We propose
SceneDiffuser++, the first end-to-end generative world model trained on a
single loss function capable of point A-to-B simulation on a city scale
integrating all the requirements above. We demonstrate the city-scale traffic
simulation capability of SceneDiffuser++ and study its superior realism under
long simulation conditions. We evaluate the simulation quality on an augmented
version of the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) with larger map regions to
support trip-level simulation.

Conclusion: The binned semiparametric Bayesian networks are a reliable and more efficient alternative to non-binned models.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new type of probabilistic semiparametric model that
takes advantage of data binning to reduce the computational cost of kernel
density estimation in nonparametric distributions. Two new conditional
probability distributions are developed for the new binned semiparametric
Bayesian networks, the sparse binned kernel density estimation and the Fourier
kernel density estimation. These two probability distributions address the
curse of dimensionality, which typically impacts binned models, by using sparse
tensors and restricting the number of parent nodes in conditional probability
calculations. To evaluate the proposal, we perform a complexity analysis and
conduct several comparative experiments using synthetic data and datasets from
the UCI Machine Learning repository. The experiments include different binning
rules, parent restrictions, grid sizes, and number of instances to get a
holistic view of the model's behavior. As a result, our binned semiparametric
Bayesian networks achieve structural learning and log-likelihood estimations
with no statistically significant differences compared to the semiparametric
Bayesian networks, but at a much higher speed. Thus, the new binned
semiparametric Bayesian networks prove to be a reliable and more efficient
alternative to their non-binned counterparts.

*Mohammad Sabbaqi,Riccardo Taormina,Elvin Isufi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A graph-aware state space model for graph time series is proposed, combining parametric graph-induced models for latent state and observation equations, with applications in prediction and imputation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing inference tasks with time series over graphs in fields like urban water networks, economics, and neuroscience requires computationally affordable models capturing graph-temporal patterns.

Method: The model uses a stochastic partial differential equation for the state equation and a sampled, graph-filtered observation model. Parameters are learned via maximum likelihood and a deep learning architecture inspired by Kalman neural networks.

Result: The model jointly learns parameters and tracks the state, improving expressivity and scalability for downstream tasks like prediction and imputation.

Conclusion: The proposed graph-aware state space model offers a tractable and scalable solution for graph time series inference, leveraging both theoretical and deep learning approaches.

Abstract: Inference tasks with time series over graphs are of importance in
applications such as urban water networks, economics, and networked
neuroscience. Addressing these tasks typically relies on identifying a
computationally affordable model that jointly captures the graph-temporal
patterns of the data. In this work, we propose a graph-aware state space model
for graph time series, where both the latent state and the observation equation
are parametric graph-induced models with a limited number of parameters that
need to be learned. More specifically, we consider the state equation to follow
a stochastic partial differential equation driven by noise over the graphs
edges accounting not only for potential edge uncertainties but also for
increasing the degrees of freedom in the latter in a tractable manner. The
graph structure conditioning of the noise dispersion allows the state variable
to deviate from the stochastic process in certain neighborhoods. The
observation model is a sampled and graph-filtered version of the state
capturing multi-hop neighboring influence. The goal is to learn the parameters
in both state and observation models from the partially observed data for
downstream tasks such as prediction and imputation. The model is inferred first
through a maximum likelihood approach that provides theoretical tractability
but is limited in expressivity and scalability. To improve on the latter, we
use the state-space formulation to build a principled deep learning
architecture that jointly learns the parameters and tracks the state in an
end-to-end manner in the spirit of Kalman neural networks.

*Yian Wang,Ali Ebrahimpour-Boroojeny,Hari Sundaram*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RWFT is a lightweight unlearning method that erases a class from a classifier without retraining, outperforming existing methods in metrics and robustness to attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enforce user deletion rights and mitigate biased predictions without costly retraining.

Method: Output-reweighting technique redistributing probability mass for the forgotten class, robust to MIA-NN attacks.

Result: Matches retraining results, gains 2.79% in prior metrics and 111.45% in new TV-based metric.

Conclusion: RWFT is effective, efficient, and robust, setting a new standard for machine unlearning.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce an output-reweighting unlearning method, RWFT, a
lightweight technique that erases an entire class from a trained classifier
without full retraining. Forgetting specific classes from trained models is
essential for enforcing user deletion rights and mitigating harmful or biased
predictions. The full retraining is costly and existing unlearning methods fail
to replicate the behavior of the retrained models when predicting samples from
the unlearned class. We prove this failure by designing a variant of membership
inference attacks, MIA-NN that successfully reveals the unlearned class for any
of these methods. We propose a simple redistribution of the probability mass
for the prediction on the samples in the forgotten class which is robust to
MIA-NN. We also introduce a new metric based on the total variation (TV)
distance of the prediction probabilities to quantify residual leakage to
prevent future methods from susceptibility to the new attack. Through extensive
experiments with state of the art baselines in machine unlearning, we show that
our approach matches the results of full retraining in both metrics used for
evaluation by prior work and the new metric we propose in this work. Compare to
state-of-the-art methods, we gain 2.79% in previously used metrics and 111.45%
in our new TV-based metric over the best existing method.

### [229] [TROFI: Trajectory-Ranked Offline Inverse Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22008)
*Alessandro Sestini,Joakim Bergdahl,Konrad Tollmar,Andrew D. Bagdanov,Linus Gisslén*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TROFI is a new offline RL method that learns policies without predefined rewards by inferring rewards from human preferences, outperforming baselines and matching ground truth rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL often lacks predefined rewards, especially in applied settings like gaming, making it hard to train agents.

Method: TROFI learns a reward function from human preferences, labels the dataset, and trains the policy without needing optimal trajectories.

Result: TROFI outperforms baselines on D4RL and performs comparably to ground truth rewards, validated in a 3D game.

Conclusion: A well-engineered reward function is crucial for aligning value functions with actual rewards in offline RL.

Abstract: In offline reinforcement learning, agents are trained using only a fixed set
of stored transitions derived from a source policy. However, this requires that
the dataset be labeled by a reward function. In applied settings such as video
game development, the availability of the reward function is not always
guaranteed. This paper proposes Trajectory-Ranked OFfline Inverse reinforcement
learning (TROFI), a novel approach to effectively learn a policy offline
without a pre-defined reward function. TROFI first learns a reward function
from human preferences, which it then uses to label the original dataset making
it usable for training the policy. In contrast to other approaches, our method
does not require optimal trajectories. Through experiments on the D4RL
benchmark we demonstrate that TROFI consistently outperforms baselines and
performs comparably to using the ground truth reward to learn policies.
Additionally, we validate the efficacy of our method in a 3D game environment.
Our studies of the reward model highlight the importance of the reward function
in this setting: we show that to ensure the alignment of a value function to
the actual future discounted reward, it is fundamental to have a
well-engineered and easy-to-learn reward function.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedMKGC, a federated learning task for multimodal knowledge graph completion, addressing privacy and collaboration challenges with the MMFeD3-HidE framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable effective collaboration among decentralized multimodal knowledge graphs while ensuring privacy and reasoning ability.

Method: Proposes HidE for recovering complete multimodal distributions and MMFeD3 for mutual knowledge transfer via logit and feature distillation.

Result: MMFeD3-HidE shows effectiveness, semantic consistency, and convergence robustness in experiments.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses multimodal challenges in federated learning for knowledge graph completion.

Abstract: With the increasing multimodal knowledge privatization requirements,
multimodal knowledge graphs in different institutes are usually decentralized,
lacking of effective collaboration system with both stronger reasoning ability
and transmission safety guarantees. In this paper, we propose the Federated
Multimodal Knowledge Graph Completion (FedMKGC) task, aiming at training over
federated MKGs for better predicting the missing links in clients without
sharing sensitive knowledge. We propose a framework named MMFeD3-HidE for
addressing multimodal uncertain unavailability and multimodal client
heterogeneity challenges of FedMKGC. (1) Inside the clients, our proposed
Hyper-modal Imputation Diffusion Embedding model (HidE) recovers the complete
multimodal distributions from incomplete entity embeddings constrained by
available modalities. (2) Among clients, our proposed Multimodal FeDerated Dual
Distillation (MMFeD3) transfers knowledge mutually between clients and the
server with logit and feature distillation to improve both global convergence
and semantic consistency. We propose a FedMKGC benchmark for a comprehensive
evaluation, consisting of a general FedMKGC backbone named MMFedE, datasets
with heterogeneous multimodal information, and three groups of constructed
baselines. Experiments conducted on our benchmark validate the effectiveness,
semantic consistency, and convergence robustness of MMFeD3-HidE.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UniCA bridges Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) with covariate-aware forecasting by homogenizing and fusing diverse covariates, enhancing their adaptability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TSFMs are limited to real-valued series, struggling with heterogeneous covariates like categorical variables or multimodal data. UniCA aims to address this gap.

Method: UniCA homogenizes diverse covariates into series representations and fuses them using an attention-based mechanism, ensuring compatibility with both homogeneous and heterogeneous data.

Result: Experiments show UniCA's superiority in handling unimodal and multimodal covariate-aware forecasting tasks, preserving TSFMs' generalization.

Conclusion: UniCA successfully extends TSFMs to covariate-aware forecasting, demonstrating practical promise for real-world applications.

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have achieved remarkable success
through large-scale pretraining. However, their design primarily targets
real-valued series, limiting their ability to handle general forecasting tasks
involving diverse and often heterogeneous covariates--such as categorical
variables and multimodal data (e.g., images, text)--which are typically
task-specific and difficult to leverage during pretraining. To address this
gap, we propose Unified Covariate Adaptation (UniCA), a framework to bridge
TSFMs with general covariate-aware forecasting. UniCA first performs covariate
homogenization to transform heterogeneous covariates into high-level
homogeneous series representations and then fuses them via a unified
attention-based fusion mechanism. UniCA is compatible and universal for
adaptation with both homogeneous and heterogeneous covariates, incorporating
extra covariate information while preserving the generalization ability of
TSFMs.Extensive experiments on multiple unimodal and multimodal covariate-aware
forecasting benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of UniCA, highlighting the
promise of covariate-aware TSFM adaptation in real-world forecasting scenarios.

*Tianhao Chen,Xin Xu,Zijing Liu,Pengxiang Li,Xinyuan Song,Ajay Kumar Jaiswal,Fan Zhang,Jishan Hu,Yang Wang,Hao Chen,Shizhe Diao,Shiwei Liu,Yu Li,Yin Lu,Can Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GPAS is a technique to address activation variance growth in Pre-LN Transformers by scaling activations while preserving gradients, improving performance across model sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-LN Transformers suffer from exponential activation variance growth, limiting deeper layers' learning capacity.

Method: Proposes Gradient-Preserving Activation Scaling (GPAS), scaling activations without altering gradients to maintain information and avoid vanishing gradients.

Result: GPAS consistently improves performance in models from 71M to 1B parameters and works with other architectures like Sandwich-LN and DeepNorm.

Conclusion: GPAS is a versatile solution for improving training dynamics in various Transformer architectures.

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models, such as the LLaMA, Qwen and DeepSeek series,
predominantly adopt the Pre-LayerNorm (Pre-LN) Transformer architecture. While
being stable during pretraining and scalable to large model sizes, Pre-LN
suffers from an exponential growth in activation variance across layers,
causing the residual path to dominate over sub-layer outputs and limiting the
learning capacity of deeper layers. To mitigate this issue, we propose
Gradient-Preserving Activation Scaling (GPAS), a simple technique that can be
used in combination with existing approaches. GPAS works by scaling down the
intermediate activations while keeping their gradients unchanged. This leaves
information in the activations intact, and avoids the gradient vanishing
problem associated with gradient downscaling. Extensive experiments across
various model sizes from 71M to 1B show that GPAS achieves consistent
performance gains. Beyond enhancing Pre-LN Transformers, GPAS also shows
promise in improving alternative architectures such as Sandwich-LN and
DeepNorm, demonstrating its versatility and potential for improving training
dynamics in a wide range of settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cryptocurrency markets are volatile and complex, requiring advanced forecasting methods.

Method: Combines LSTM for temporal dependencies and XGBoost for nonlinear relationships, using sentiment scores and macroeconomic indicators.

Result: Outperforms standalone models and traditional methods in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Litecoin predictions.

Conclusion: Hybrid architectures like LSTM+XGBoost show promise for financial forecasting across diverse cryptocurrencies.

Abstract: The volatility and complex dynamics of cryptocurrency markets present unique
challenges for accurate price forecasting. This research proposes a hybrid deep
learning and machine learning model that integrates Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for cryptocurrency
price prediction. The LSTM component captures temporal dependencies in
historical price data, while XGBoost enhances prediction by modeling nonlinear
relationships with auxiliary features such as sentiment scores and
macroeconomic indicators. The model is evaluated on historical datasets of
Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Litecoin, incorporating both global and
localized exchange data. Comparative analysis using Mean Absolute Percentage
Error (MAPE) and Min-Max Normalized Root Mean Square Error (MinMax RMSE)
demonstrates that the LSTM+XGBoost hybrid consistently outperforms standalone
models and traditional forecasting methods. This study underscores the

TL;DR: Transformers are linked to GNNs as message-passing networks on fully connected graphs, leveraging self-attention and positional encodings for efficient set processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between Transformers and GNNs, highlighting their shared principles and hardware efficiency.

Method: Analyze Transformers as GNNs with self-attention and positional encodings, comparing their operations on fully connected graphs.

Result: Transformers are expressive set processors, more efficient on hardware than sparse GNNs due to dense matrix operations.

Conclusion: Transformers can be seen as GNNs optimized for modern hardware, offering a new perspective on their success.

Abstract: We establish connections between the Transformer architecture, originally
introduced for natural language processing, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
for representation learning on graphs. We show how Transformers can be viewed
as message passing GNNs operating on fully connected graphs of tokens, where
the self-attention mechanism capture the relative importance of all tokens
w.r.t. each-other, and positional encodings provide hints about sequential
ordering or structure. Thus, Transformers are expressive set processing
networks that learn relationships among input elements without being
constrained by apriori graphs. Despite this mathematical connection to GNNs,
Transformers are implemented via dense matrix operations that are significantly
more efficient on modern hardware than sparse message passing. This leads to
the perspective that Transformers are GNNs currently winning the hardware
lottery.

*Filip Rydin,Attila Lischka,Jiaming Wu,Morteza Haghir Chehreghani,Balázs Kulcsár*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces two neural approaches for multi-objective routing on multigraphs, addressing a gap in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based routing methods overlook multigraphs, despite their practical relevance.

Method: Two neural approaches: one works directly on multigraphs by autoregressively selecting edges, while the other first prunes the multigraph into a simple graph.

Result: Both models show strong performance on problems like TSP and CVRP.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively address multi-objective routing on multigraphs, demonstrating practical utility.

Abstract: Learning-based methods for routing have gained significant attention in
recent years, both in single-objective and multi-objective contexts. However,
the multigraph setting, where multiple paths with distinct attributes can exist
between destinations, has largely been overlooked, despite its high practical
relevancy. In this paper, we introduce two neural approaches to address
multi-objective routing on multigraphs. Our first approach works directly on
the multigraph, by autoregressively selecting edges until a tour is completed.
On the other hand, our second model first prunes the multigraph into a simple
graph and then builds routes. We validate both models experimentally and find
that they demonstrate strong performance across a variety of problems,
including the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing
Problem (CVRP).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep-learning model simplifies heavy metal pollution assessment in soils and seaports, outperforming traditional methods with lower errors and higher efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PLI assessment is laborious and data-scarce; the paper aims to streamline this using deep learning.

Method: Uses transfer learning to develop a quantitative PLI prediction model, tested on data from six Australian ports.

Result: Achieves significantly lower MAE (0.5) and MAPE (0.03), outperforming baselines by up to 2 orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: The model provides an innovative, cost-effective solution for water quality prediction, aiding environmental and industrial monitoring.

Abstract: Detecting heavy metal pollution in soils and seaports is vital for regional
environmental monitoring. The Pollution Load Index (PLI), an international
standard, is commonly used to assess heavy metal containment. However, the
conventional PLI assessment involves laborious procedures and data analysis of
sediment samples. To address this challenge, we propose a deep-learning-based
model that simplifies the heavy metal assessment process. Our model tackles the
issue of data scarcity in the water-sediment domain, which is traditionally
plagued by challenges in data collection and varying standards across nations.
By leveraging transfer learning, we develop an accurate quantitative assessment
method for predicting PLI. Our approach allows the transfer of learned features
across domains with different sets of features. We evaluate our model using
data from six major ports in New South Wales, Australia: Port Yamba, Port
Newcastle, Port Jackson, Port Botany, Port Kembla, and Port Eden. The results
demonstrate significantly lower Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute
Percentage Error (MAPE) of approximately 0.5 and 0.03, respectively, compared
to other models. Our model performance is up to 2 orders of magnitude than
other baseline models. Our proposed model offers an innovative, accessible, and
cost-effective approach to predicting water quality, benefiting marine life
conservation, aquaculture, and industrial pollution monitoring.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving post-earthquake damage assessment using machine learning, addressing class imbalance with SMOTE, and evaluating models for accurate damage grade prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate damage assessment is crucial for effective disaster response and resource allocation, especially given the impact on lives and properties.

Method: Uses multi-class classification (XGBoost, other ML/DL models, ensembling) with SMOTE to handle class imbalance, and conducts feature manipulation experiments.

Result: Identifies key seismic vulnerability factors and evaluates model performance using techniques like confusion matrices.

Conclusion: The study enhances earthquake damage prediction by addressing class imbalance and optimizing model performance.

Abstract: In the aftermath of major earthquakes, evaluating structural and
infrastructural damage is vital for coordinating post-disaster response
efforts. This includes assessing damage's extent and spatial distribution to
prioritize rescue operations and resource allocation. Accurately estimating
damage grades to buildings post-earthquake is paramount for effective response
and recovery, given the significant impact on lives and properties,
underscoring the urgency of streamlining relief fund allocation processes.
Previous studies have shown the effectiveness of multi-class classification,
especially XGBoost, along with other machine learning models and ensembling
methods, incorporating regularization to address class imbalance. One
consequence of class imbalance is that it may give rise to skewed models that
undervalue minority classes and give preference to the majority class. This
research deals with the problem of class imbalance with the help of the
synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). We delve into multiple
multi-class classification machine learning, deep learning models, and
ensembling methods to forecast structural damage grades. The study elucidates
performance determinants through comprehensive feature manipulation experiments
and diverse training approaches. It identifies key factors contributing to
seismic vulnerability while evaluating model performance using techniques like
the confusion matrix further to enhance understanding of the effectiveness of
earthquake damage prediction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a parameterization method for control law learning using reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, extending Thompson sampling (TS) to general function spaces for active learning-based controller design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thompson sampling (TS) is limited to finite parametric representations, restricting its use in control system design where general spaces are common. This work aims to overcome this limitation.

Method: The proposed method treats control laws as elements in a function space, leveraging reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. A TS framework is designed to explore optimal control laws, with convergence guarantees.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows exponential learning rates for control laws and closed-loop performance metrics, with derived upper bounds for control regret. Numerical experiments confirm effectiveness.

Conclusion: The method successfully generalizes TS to function spaces, enabling flexible control law design without structural restrictions, validated by theoretical and experimental results.

Abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) is an effective method to explore parametric
uncertainties and can therefore be used for active learning-based controller
design. However, TS relies on finite parametric representations, which limits
its applicability to more general spaces, which are more commonly encountered
in control system design. To address this issue, this work pro poses a
parameterization method for control law learning using reproducing kernel
Hilbert spaces and designs a data-driven active learning control approach.
Specifically, the proposed method treats the control law as an element in a
function space, allowing the design of control laws without imposing
restrictions on the system structure or the form of the controller. A TS
framework is proposed in this work to explore potential optimal control laws,
and the convergence guarantees are further provided for the learning process.
Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed method learns the relationship
between control laws and closed-loop performance metrics at an exponential
rate, and the upper bound of control regret is also derived. Numerical
experiments on controlling unknown nonlinear systems validate the effectiveness
of the proposed method.

TL;DR: The study evaluates the modularity of LLM-based agentic systems in drug discovery, comparing performance of various LLMs and agent types, emphasizing the need for prompt re-engineering and further research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the interchangeability of components in LLM-based agentic systems for drug discovery, a topic with limited prior attention.

Method: Comparison of different LLMs (e.g., Claude-3.5-Sonnet, GPT-4o) and agent types (tool-calling vs. code-generating) using an LLM-as-a-judge score in chemistry and drug discovery tasks.

Result: Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and GPT-4o outperformed other models. Code-generating agents generally performed better, but results varied by question and model. Prompt re-engineering was crucial for model replacement.

Conclusion: Modularity in agentic systems requires careful consideration of prompts and models, highlighting the need for further research to develop stable, scalable solutions.

Abstract: Large-language models (LLMs) and agentic systems present exciting
opportunities to accelerate drug discovery and design. In this study, we
critically examine the modularity of LLM-based agentic systems for drug
discovery, i.e., whether parts of the agentic system such as the LLM are
interchangeable, a topic that has received limited attention in drug discovery
applications. We compare the performance of different large language models
(LLMs) and the effectiveness of tool-calling agents versus code-generating
agents in this domain. Our case study, comparing performance in orchestrating
tools for chemistry and drug discovery using an LLM-as-a-judge score, shows
that Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Claude-3.7-Sonnet and GPT-4o outperform alternative
language models such as Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3.1-70B, GPT-3.5-Turbo, and
Nova-Micro. Although we confirm that code-generating agents outperform the
tool-calling ones on average, we show that this is highly question and model
dependent. Furthermore, the impact of replacing system prompts is dependent on
the specific question asked and the model used, underscoring that -- even in
this particular domain -- one cannot just replace language models without
considering prompt re-engineering. Our study highlights the necessity of
further research into the modularity of agentic systems to enable the
development of stable and scalable solutions for real-world problems.

representative samples. DreaMLearning accommodates a wide range of data types,
tasks, and model architectures. Extensive experiments on regression and
classification tasks with tabular and image data demonstrate that dreaMLearning
accelerates training by up to 8.8x, reduces memory usage by 10x, and cuts

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO, an efficient RL variant, suffers from limited exploration, low sample efficiency, and instability, hindering its performance on complex reasoning tasks.

address these limitations, we introduce EFRame, an Exploration-Filtering-Replay
framework that systematically augments GRPO along three critical dimensions.
EFRame performs additional rollouts to explore high-quality trajectories,
applies online filtering to eliminate low-quality samples that introduce noise
and variance, and leverages experience replay to repeatedly exploit rare but
informative samples. EFRame establishes a complete and stable learning cycle,
guiding the model through a structured transition from exploration to
convergence. Our experiments across a variety of reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that EFRame not only improves the robustness and efficiency of
training, but also enables access to deeper reasoning capabilities that remain
unattainable under vanilla GRPO. Furthermore, EFRame enables a more
fine-grained categorization of training samples, allowing for a deeper analysis
of how different types of samples contribute to the learning process in RL. Our
code is available at https://github.com/597358816/EFRame.

*Shunta Nonaga,Koji Tabata,Yuta Mizuno,Tamiki Komatsuzaki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel stochastic bandit optimization method is introduced, focusing on balancing expected reward and risk via the mean-variance criterion. It outperforms existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in traditional bandit problems by jointly optimizing expected reward and risk, crucial for risk-aware decision-making in uncertain environments.

Method: A unified meta-algorithmic framework for fixed-confidence and fixed-budget regimes, using adaptive confidence intervals and sample exploration.

Result: Theoretical guarantees on solution correctness and empirical validation showing superior accuracy and sample efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed method is broadly applicable and effective for risk-aware decision-making, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Decision making under uncertain environments in the maximization of expected
reward while minimizing its risk is one of the ubiquitous problems in many
subjects. Here, we introduce a novel problem setting in stochastic bandit
optimization that jointly addresses two critical aspects of decision-making:
maximizing expected reward and minimizing associated uncertainty, quantified
via the mean-variance(MV) criterion. Unlike traditional bandit formulations
that focus solely on expected returns, our objective is to efficiently and
accurately identify the Pareto-optimal set of arms that strikes the best
trade-off between expected performance and risk. We propose a unified
meta-algorithmic framework capable of operating under both fixed-confidence and
fixed-budget regimes, achieved through adaptive design of confidence intervals
tailored to each scenario using the same sample exploration strategy. We
provide theoretical guarantees on the correctness of the returned solutions in
both settings. To complement this theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive
empirical evaluations across synthetic benchmarks, demonstrating that our
approach outperforms existing methods in terms of both accuracy and sample
efficiency, highlighting its broad applicability to risk-aware decision-making
tasks in uncertain environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Projected Compression reduces large language model size using projection modules, maintaining performance while lowering computational demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growth of large language models increases inference time and computational costs, prompting the need for efficient size reduction methods.

Method: Train additional projection weights, merge them into a lower-dimensional matrix, and reduce model size without extra FLOPs.

Result: Outperforms hard pruning and retraining, with performance scaling well with token count.

Conclusion: Projected Compression is an effective method for reducing model size while preserving performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Large language models have steadily increased in size to achieve improved
performance; however, this growth has also led to greater inference time and
computational demands. Consequently, there is rising interest in model size
reduction methods. To address this issue, we propose Projected Compression, a
novel model compression technique, that reduces model weights by utilizing
projection modules. Specifically, we first train additional trainable
projections weights and preserve access to all the original model parameters.
Subsequently, these projections are merged into a lower-dimensional product
matrix, resulting in a reduced-size standard Transformer-based model. Unlike
alternative approaches that require additional computational overhead, our
method matches the base model's per-token computation step in FLOPs.
Experimental results show that Projected Compression outperforms the comparable
hard pruning and retraining approach on higher quality models. Moreover, the
performance margin scales well with the number of tokens.

### [245] [Score-Based Model for Low-Rank Tensor Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22295)
*Zhengyun Cheng,Changhao Wang,Guanwen Zhang,Yi Xu,Wei Zhou,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A score-based model is proposed for low-rank tensor decompositions, eliminating predefined structural assumptions and improving performance in tensor completion and denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional tensor decomposition methods rely on fixed structural assumptions, which are often impractical and lead to accuracy loss.

Method: A neural network learns an energy function optimized via score matching, capturing the gradient of the joint log-probability of tensor entries and shared factors. Block coordinate descent (BCD) with smooth regularization is integrated.

Result: The method outperforms traditional approaches, showing improvements in handling sparse, continuous-time tensors, and visual data.

Conclusion: The proposed model offers flexibility in learning tensor structures without rigid assumptions, enhancing accuracy and applicability.

Abstract: Low-rank tensor decompositions (TDs) provide an effective framework for
multiway data analysis. Traditional TD methods rely on predefined structural
assumptions, such as CP or Tucker decompositions. From a probabilistic
perspective, these can be viewed as using Dirac delta distributions to model
the relationships between shared factors and the low-rank tensor. However, such
prior knowledge is rarely available in practical scenarios, particularly
regarding the optimal rank structure and contraction rules. The optimization
procedures based on fixed contraction rules are complex, and approximations
made during these processes often lead to accuracy loss. To address this issue,
we propose a score-based model that eliminates the need for predefined
structural or distributional assumptions, enabling the learning of
compatibility between tensors and shared factors. Specifically, a neural
network is designed to learn the energy function, which is optimized via score
matching to capture the gradient of the joint log-probability of tensor entries
and shared factors. Our method allows for modeling structures and distributions
beyond the Dirac delta assumption. Moreover, integrating the block coordinate
descent (BCD) algorithm with the proposed smooth regularization enables the
model to perform both tensor completion and denoising. Experimental results
demonstrate significant performance improvements across various tensor types,
including sparse and continuous-time tensors, as well as visual data.

*Tao Liu,Longlong Lin,Yunfeng Yu,Xi Ou,Youan Zhang,Zhiqiu Ye,Tao Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoATA is a dual-channel GNN framework for co-augmenting topology and attributes, outperforming existing methods by leveraging contrastive learning and mutual corrections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world graphs often have noise and incompleteness, degrading GNN performance. Existing methods focus on single-dimensional augmentation, ignoring deeper interplays between topology and attributes.

Method: CoATA propagates structural signals to enrich node attributes, projects enhanced attributes into a bipartite graph, and uses contrastive learning with prototype alignment for mutual corrections.

Result: CoATA outperforms eleven state-of-the-art baselines on seven benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: CoATA effectively captures the synergistic relationship between topology and attributes, demonstrating superior performance in noisy and incomplete graphs.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered substantial attention due to their
remarkable capability in learning graph representations. However, real-world
graphs often exhibit substantial noise and incompleteness, which severely
degrades the performance of GNNs. Existing methods typically address this issue
through single-dimensional augmentation, focusing either on refining topology
structures or perturbing node attributes, thereby overlooking the deeper
interplays between the two. To bridge this gap, this paper presents CoATA, a
dual-channel GNN framework specifically designed for the Co-Augmentation of
Topology and Attribute. Specifically, CoATA first propagates structural signals
to enrich and denoise node attributes. Then, it projects the enhanced attribute
space into a node-attribute bipartite graph for further refinement or
reconstruction of the underlying structure. Subsequently, CoATA introduces
contrastive learning, leveraging prototype alignment and consistency
constraints, to facilitate mutual corrections between the augmented and
original graphs. Finally, extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the proposed CoATA outperforms eleven state-of-the-art
baseline methods, showcasing its effectiveness in capturing the synergistic
relationship between topology and attributes.

*Takumi Okuo,Shinnosuke Matsuo,Shota Harada,Kiyohito Tanaka,Ryoma Bise*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A weakly-supervised domain adaptation method is proposed to address domain shift in medical datasets by leveraging target domain class proportions, improving performance without extra annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shift in medical applications degrades model performance due to differing data distributions. Existing methods struggle with varying class proportions.

Method: Proportion-constrained pseudo-labeling uses target domain class proportions to assign pseudo-labels to unlabeled data.

Result: Outperforms semi-supervised methods on endoscopic datasets, even with only 5% labeled target data, and shows robustness to noisy proportion labels.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses domain shift in medical applications by utilizing class proportion information, demonstrating practical utility.

Abstract: Domain shift is a significant challenge in machine learning, particularly in
medical applications where data distributions differ across institutions due to
variations in data collection practices, equipment, and procedures. This can
degrade performance when models trained on source domain data are applied to
the target domain. Domain adaptation methods have been widely studied to
address this issue, but most struggle when class proportions between the source
and target domains differ. In this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised domain
adaptation method that leverages class proportion information from the target
domain, which is often accessible in medical datasets through prior knowledge
or statistical reports. Our method assigns pseudo-labels to the unlabeled
target data based on class proportion (called proportion-constrained
pseudo-labeling), improving performance without the need for additional
annotations. Experiments on two endoscopic datasets demonstrate that our method
outperforms semi-supervised domain adaptation techniques, even when 5% of the
target domain is labeled. Additionally, the experimental results with noisy
proportion labels highlight the robustness of our method, further demonstrating
its effectiveness in real-world application scenarios.

*Erkan Turan,Aristotelis Siozopoulos,Maks Ovsjanikov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Koopman-CFM integrates Koopman operator theory to linearize generative dynamics, enabling faster, interpretable sampling via matrix exponentiation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CFM relies on computationally expensive ODE solving and lacks interpretability. Koopman theory offers a structured, linear alternative.

Method: Proposes a decoder-free Koopman-CFM architecture that learns a linear embedding for generative dynamics, allowing one-step sampling.

Result: Achieves significant speedups on 2D datasets, MNIST, F-MNIST, and TFD, with structured spectral analysis of the generative process.

Conclusion: Koopman-CFM combines efficiency and interpretability, advancing fast and structured generative modeling.

Abstract: Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) offers a simulation-free framework for
training continuous-time generative models, bridging diffusion and flow-based
approaches. However, sampling from CFM still relies on numerically solving
non-linear ODEs which can be computationally expensive and difficult to
interpret. Recent alternatives address sampling speed via trajectory
straightening, mini-batch coupling or distillation. However, these methods
typically do not shed light on the underlying \textit{structure} of the
generative process. In this work, we propose to accelerate CFM and introduce an
interpretable representation of its dynamics by integrating Koopman operator
theory, which models non-linear flows as linear evolution in a learned space of
observables. We introduce a decoder-free Koopman-CFM architecture that learns
an embedding where the generative dynamics become linear, enabling closed-form,
one-step sampling via matrix exponentiation. This results in significant
speedups over traditional CFM as demonstrated on controlled 2D datasets and
real-world benchmarks, MNIST, Fashion-MNIST (F-MNIST), and the Toronto Face
Dataset (TFD). Unlike previous methods, our approach leads to a well-structured
Koopman generator, whose spectral properties, eigenvalues, and eigenfunctions
offer principled tools for analyzing generative behavior such as temporal
scaling, mode stability, and decomposition in Koopman latent space. By
combining sampling efficiency with analytical structure, Koopman-enhanced flow
matching offers a potential step toward fast and interpretable generative
modeling.

### [249] [Less Greedy Equivalence Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22331)
*Adiba Ejaz,Elias Bareinboim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LGES improves GES by reducing computational cost and improving accuracy, achieving faster speed and lower error while retaining theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational cost and finite-sample accuracy challenges of GES in causal discovery.

Method: Modifies GES's greedy step by avoiding edge insertions where conditional independence is implied, and incorporates prior assumptions and interventional data.

Result: Achieves up to 10-fold speed-up, reduces structural error, and outperforms GES and other baselines in accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: LGES is a more efficient and accurate variant of GES, with theoretical guarantees and practical benefits for causal discovery.

Abstract: Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) is a classic score-based algorithm for causal
discovery from observational data. In the sample limit, it recovers the Markov
equivalence class of graphs that describe the data. Still, it faces two
challenges in practice: computational cost and finite-sample accuracy. In this
paper, we develop Less Greedy Equivalence Search (LGES), a variant of GES that
retains its theoretical guarantees while partially addressing these
limitations. LGES modifies the greedy step: rather than always applying the
highest-scoring insertion, it avoids edge insertions between variables for
which the score implies some conditional independence. This more targeted
search yields up to a \(10\)-fold speed-up and a substantial reduction in
structural error relative to GES. Moreover, LGES can guide the search using
prior assumptions, while correcting these assumptions when contradicted by the
data. Finally, LGES can exploit interventional data to refine the learned
observational equivalence class. We prove that LGES recovers the true
equivalence class in the sample limit from observational and interventional
data, even with misspecified prior assumptions. Experiments demonstrate that
LGES outperforms GES and other baselines in speed, accuracy, and robustness to
misspecified assumptions. Our code is available at

*Zihan Guan,Zhiyuan Zhao,Fengwei Tian,Dung Nguyen,Payel Bhattacharjee,Ravi Tandon,B. Aditya Prakash,Anil Vullikanti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework combining deep learning and epidemic models for forecasting and mechanistic modeling, using diverse datasets with Differential Privacy (DP) guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diverse datasets enhance epidemiology analyses, but sensitive data requires privacy protections like DP.

Method: Developed a framework integrating deep learning and epidemic models, incorporating DP-protected datasets.

Result: Demonstrated the framework's effectiveness with a synthetic financial dataset, showing value even under DP.

Conclusion: The framework successfully leverages DP-protected datasets for improved epidemic forecasting and modeling.

Abstract: It is now well understood that diverse datasets provide a lot of value in key
epidemiology and public health analyses, such as forecasting and nowcasting,
development of epidemic models, evaluation and design of interventions and
resource allocation. Some of these datasets are often sensitive, and need
adequate privacy protections. There are many models of privacy, but
Differential Privacy (DP) has become a de facto standard because of its strong
guarantees, without making models about adversaries. In this paper, we develop
a framework the integrates deep learning and epidemic models to simultaneously
perform epidemic forecasting and learning a mechanistic model of epidemic
spread, while incorporating multiple datasets for these analyses, including
some with DP guarantees. We demonstrate our framework using a realistic but
synthetic financial dataset with DP; such a dataset has not been used in such
epidemic analyses. We show that this dataset provides significant value in
forecasting and learning an epidemic model, even when used with DP guarantees.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PiPRL framework integrates symbolic physics priors into RL for indoor navigation, improving efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current physics-informed inductive biases in RL require manual effort and expertise, limiting accessibility.

Method: Uses a domain-specific language (DSL) for human-readable physics priors, combined with hierarchical neuro-symbolic integration (PiPRL).

Result: PiPRL outperforms purely symbolic or neural policies and reduces training time by over 26%.

Conclusion: Symbolic approaches like PiPRL effectively distill physics priors into RL, enhancing efficiency and generalization.

Abstract: When using reinforcement learning (RL) to tackle physical control tasks,
inductive biases that encode physics priors can help improve sample efficiency
during training and enhance generalization in testing. However, the current
practice of incorporating these helpful physics-informed inductive biases
inevitably runs into significant manual labor and domain expertise, making them
prohibitive for general users. This work explores a symbolic approach to
distill physics-informed inductive biases into RL agents, where the physics
priors are expressed in a domain-specific language (DSL) that is human-readable
and naturally explainable. Yet, the DSL priors do not translate directly into
an implementable policy due to partial and noisy observations and additional
physical constraints in navigation tasks. To address this gap, we develop a
physics-informed program-guided RL (PiPRL) framework with applications to
indoor navigation. PiPRL adopts a hierarchical and modularized neuro-symbolic
integration, where a meta symbolic program receives semantically meaningful
features from a neural perception module, which form the bases for symbolic
programming that encodes physics priors and guides the RL process of a
low-level neural controller. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PiPRL
consistently outperforms purely symbolic or neural policies and reduces
training time by over 26% with the help of the program-based inductive biases.

TL;DR: Proposes Sheaf-DMFL, a decentralized multimodal learning framework using sheaf theory to improve collaboration in heterogeneous systems, with an enhanced version (Sheaf-DMFL-Att) incorporating attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of conventional FL in handling multimodal data and diverse client capabilities in real-world scenarios.

Method: Leverages sheaf theory for client collaboration, with local feature encoders for modalities and a task-specific layer. Introduces attention in Sheaf-DMFL-Att.

Result: Demonstrates superiority in link blockage prediction and mmWave beamforming through simulations.

Conclusion: Sheaf-DMFL and Sheaf-DMFL-Att effectively enhance multimodal learning in heterogeneous systems with theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: In large-scale communication systems, increasingly complex scenarios require
more intelligent collaboration among edge devices collecting various multimodal
sensory data to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the environment
and improve decision-making accuracy. However, conventional federated learning
(FL) algorithms typically consider unimodal datasets, require identical model
architectures, and fail to leverage the rich information embedded in multimodal
data, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios with diverse
modalities and varying client capabilities. To address this issue, we propose
Sheaf-DMFL, a novel decentralized multimodal learning framework leveraging
sheaf theory to enhance collaboration among devices with diverse modalities.
Specifically, each client has a set of local feature encoders for its different
modalities, whose outputs are concatenated before passing through a
task-specific layer. While encoders for the same modality are trained
collaboratively across clients, we capture the intrinsic correlations among
clients' task-specific layers using a sheaf-based structure. To further enhance
learning capability, we propose an enhanced algorithm named Sheaf-DMFL-Att,
which tailors the attention mechanism within each client to capture
correlations among different modalities. A rigorous convergence analysis of
Sheaf-DMFL-Att is provided, establishing its theoretical guarantees. Extensive
simulations are conducted on real-world link blockage prediction and mmWave
beamforming scenarios, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms
in such heterogeneous wireless communication systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a probabilistic framework for inference-time scaling in LLMs, proposing the \textsc{OptScale} algorithm to dynamically optimize sample numbers for performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing heuristic approaches for parallel sampling in LLMs lack a principled foundation, prompting the need for a formalized method.

Method: A probabilistic framework is developed, assuming i.i.d. parallel samples, with a derived theoretical lower bound for sample numbers. \textsc{OptScale} dynamically determines optimal samples using a language model-based predictor.

Result: Experiments on math benchmarks show \textsc{OptScale} reduces sampling overhead while matching or outperforming state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The work provides a theoretical and practical solution for efficient LLM deployment in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Inference-time scaling has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing the
reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing
approaches often rely on heuristic strategies for parallel sampling, lacking a
principled foundation. To address this gap, we propose a probabilistic
framework that formalizes the optimality of inference-time scaling under the
assumption that parallel samples are independently and identically distributed
(i.i.d.), and where the Best-of-N selection strategy follows a probability
distribution that can be estimated. Within this framework, we derive a
theoretical lower bound on the required number of samples to achieve a target
performance level, providing the first principled guidance for
compute-efficient scaling. Leveraging this insight, we develop
\textsc{OptScale}, a practical algorithm that dynamically determines the
optimal number of sampled responses. \textsc{OptScale} employs a language
model-based predictor to estimate probabilistic prior parameters, enabling the
decision of the minimal number of samples needed that satisfy predefined
performance thresholds and confidence levels. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks (including MATH-500, GSM8K, AIME, and AMC)
demonstrate that \textsc{OptScale} significantly reduces sampling overhead
while remaining better or on par with state-of-the-art reasoning performance.
Our work offers both a theoretical foundation and a practical solution for
principled inference-time scaling, addressing a critical gap in the efficient
deployment of LLMs for complex reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore flexible, content-dependent neural architectures that generalize sparse methods and optimize for efficiency.

Method: DNAs use proto-architectures with modules (e.g., transformers, MLPs) and routers, allowing tokens to traverse modules dynamically. Training optimizes for efficiency and specialization.

Result: DNAs match dense baselines, learn efficient compute/parameter sharing, and exhibit power-law distributed paths with emergent specialization.

Conclusion: DNAs offer a scalable, interpretable approach to dynamic neural architectures, with potential for efficiency and specialization.

Abstract: We introduce and train distributed neural architectures (DNA) in vision and
language domains. DNAs are initialized with a proto-architecture that consists
of (transformer, MLP, attention, etc.) modules and routers. Any token (or
patch) can traverse any series of modules in any order. DNAs are a natural
generalization of the sparse methods such as Mixture-of-Experts,
Mixture-of-Depths, parameter sharing, etc. Computation and communication
patterns of DNA modules are learnt end-to-end during training and depend on the
content and context of each token (or patch). These patterns can be shaped by
further requirements added to the optimization objective such as compute/memory
efficiency or load balancing. We empirically show that (i) trained DNAs are
competitive with the dense baselines in both domains and (ii) compute
efficiency/parameter sharing can be learnt from data. Next, we analyze the
emergent connectivity and computation patterns in the trained DNAs. We find
that the paths that tokens take through the models are themselves distributed
according to a power-law. We show that some paths (or, equivalently, groups of
modules) show emergent specialization. Finally, we demonstrate that models
learn to allocate compute and active parameters in an interpretable way.

Motivation: Addressing challenges in adapting ML models to medical time series due to complex temporal dependencies and dynamic distribution shifts.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in transfer learning tasks on EEG, ECG, and EMG datasets.

Conclusion: The framework enhances robustness and generalizability, enabling reliable AI deployment in diverse healthcare settings.

Abstract: Adapting machine learning models to medical time series across different

Our method employs independent encoders and a hierarchical fusion mechanism to
learn feature-invariant representations that are transferable across domains
while preserving temporal coherence. Extensive experiments on diverse medical

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new value-incentivized actor-critic (VAC) method for online RL, balancing exploration and exploitation with theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of balancing exploration and exploitation in online RL with complex function approximations, leveraging optimistic regularization.

Method: Proposes VAC, a primal-dual optimization-based method integrating exploration and exploitation into a single objective.

Result: VAC achieves near-optimal regret guarantees under linear MDPs and extends to general function approximations.

Conclusion: VAC offers a practical and theoretically sound solution for exploration-exploitation trade-offs in RL.

Abstract: Online reinforcement learning (RL) with complex function approximations such
as transformers and deep neural networks plays a significant role in the modern
practice of artificial intelligence. Despite its popularity and importance,
balancing the fundamental trade-off between exploration and exploitation
remains a long-standing challenge; in particular, we are still in lack of
efficient and practical schemes that are backed by theoretical performance
guarantees. Motivated by recent developments in exploration via optimistic
regularization, this paper provides an interpretation of the principle of
optimism through the lens of primal-dual optimization. From this fresh
perspective, we set forth a new value-incentivized actor-critic (VAC) method,
which optimizes a single easy-to-optimize objective integrating exploration and
exploitation -- it promotes state-action and policy estimates that are both
consistent with collected data transitions and result in higher value
functions. Theoretically, the proposed VAC method has near-optimal regret
guarantees under linear Markov decision processes (MDPs) in both finite-horizon
and infinite-horizon settings, which can be extended to the general function
approximation setting under appropriate assumptions.

*Pritam Dash,Ethan Chan,Nathan P. Lawrence,Karthik Pattabiraman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ARMOR is a model-free RL controller for UAVs that learns robust latent state representations to resist adversarial sensor attacks, outperforming conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAVs are vulnerable to sensor attacks like GPS spoofing, which can corrupt state estimates and cause unsafe behavior. Existing safe RL methods fail against such attacks.

Method: ARMOR uses a two-stage training framework: a teacher encoder with attack info trains an RL policy, and a student encoder approximates the teacher's latent states using only historical sensor data.

Result: ARMOR ensures UAV safety, generalizes to unseen attacks, and reduces training costs by avoiding iterative adversarial training.

Conclusion: ARMOR provides an effective, attack-resilient solution for UAV control under adversarial sensor manipulation.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) depend on onboard sensors for perception,
navigation, and control. However, these sensors are susceptible to physical
attacks, such as GPS spoofing, that can corrupt state estimates and lead to
unsafe behavior. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers adaptive control
capabilities, existing safe RL methods are ineffective against such attacks. We
present ARMOR (Adaptive Robust Manipulation-Optimized State Representations),
an attack-resilient, model-free RL controller that enables robust UAV operation
under adversarial sensor manipulation. Instead of relying on raw sensor
observations, ARMOR learns a robust latent representation of the UAV's physical
state via a two-stage training framework. In the first stage, a teacher
encoder, trained with privileged attack information, generates attack-aware
latent states for RL policy training. In the second stage, a student encoder is
trained via supervised learning to approximate the teacher's latent states
using only historical sensor data, enabling real-world deployment without
privileged information. Our experiments show that ARMOR outperforms
conventional methods, ensuring UAV safety. Additionally, ARMOR improves
generalization to unseen attacks and reduces training cost by eliminating the
need for iterative adversarial training.

TL;DR: CLoVE is a novel algorithm for Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) that identifies client clusters using loss vector embeddings, offering simplicity, broad applicability, and robustness without needing optimal initialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifying client clusters in CFL is challenging due to unknown client assignments. CLoVE addresses this by leveraging loss value similarities within clusters.

Method: CLoVE uses client embeddings from model losses, iteratively separates clients into clusters, and optimizes cluster-specific models via federated aggregation.

Result: Theoretical bounds show accurate cluster recovery in one round and exponential convergence. Experiments confirm high accuracy in cluster recovery and model performance.

Conclusion: CLoVE outperforms existing CFL and PFL algorithms in accuracy and efficiency, making it suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: We propose CLoVE (Clustering of Loss Vector Embeddings), a novel algorithm
for Clustered Federated Learning (CFL). In CFL, clients are naturally grouped
into clusters based on their data distribution. However, identifying these
clusters is challenging, as client assignments are unknown. CLoVE utilizes
client embeddings derived from model losses on client data, and leverages the
insight that clients in the same cluster share similar loss values, while those
in different clusters exhibit distinct loss patterns. Based on these
embeddings, CLoVE is able to iteratively identify and separate clients from
different clusters and optimize cluster-specific models through federated
aggregation. Key advantages of CLoVE over existing CFL algorithms are (1) its
simplicity, (2) its applicability to both supervised and unsupervised settings,
and (3) the fact that it eliminates the need for near-optimal model
initialization, which makes it more robust and better suited for real-world
applications. We establish theoretical convergence bounds, showing that CLoVE
can recover clusters accurately with high probability in a single round and
converges exponentially fast to optimal models in a linear setting. Our
comprehensive experiments comparing with a variety of both CFL and generic
Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) algorithms on different types of datasets
and an extensive array of non-IID settings demonstrate that CLoVE achieves
highly accurate cluster recovery in just a few rounds of training, along with
state-of-the-art model accuracy, across a variety of both supervised and
unsupervised PFL tasks.

*Weitao Tang,Johann Vargas-Calixto,Nasim Katebi,Robert Galinsky,Gari D. Clifford,Faezeh Marzbanrad*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This review synthesizes research on fetal sleep, comparing human and animal models, reviewing invasive and non-invasive techniques, and exploring computational methods for sleep-state classification. It highlights disruptions from intrauterine conditions and aims to advance non-invasive fetal sleep monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding fetal sleep patterns can provide insights into early brain maturation and help detect neurological issues like hypoxia or growth restriction.

Method: The review compares sleep-state patterns in humans and animal models, examines invasive and non-invasive techniques, and evaluates computational methods for sleep-state classification.

Result: The study highlights species-specific differences, the impact of intrauterine conditions on fetal sleep, and the potential of computational methods for monitoring.

Conclusion: The review lays the groundwork for developing objective, non-invasive fetal sleep monitoring technologies to improve prenatal diagnosis and intervention.

Abstract: Fetal sleep is a relatively underexplored yet vital aspect of prenatal
neurodevelopment. Understanding fetal sleep patterns could provide insights
into early brain maturation and help clinicians detect signs of neurological
compromise that arise due to fetal hypoxia or fetal growth restriction. This
review synthesizes over eight decades of research on the physiological
characteristics, ontogeny, and regulation of fetal sleep. We compare
sleep-state patterns in humans and large animal models, highlighting
species-specific differences and the presence of sleep-state analogs. We review
both invasive techniques in animals and non-invasive modalities in humans.
Computational methods for sleep-state classification are also examined,
including rule-based approaches (with and without clustering-based
preprocessing) and state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Finally, we
discuss how intrauterine conditions such as hypoxia and fetal growth
restriction can disrupt fetal sleep. This review provides a comprehensive
foundation for the development of objective, multimodal, and non-invasive fetal
sleep monitoring technologies to support early diagnosis and intervention in
prenatal care.

### [260] [Joint Task Offloading and Resource Allocation in Low-Altitude MEC via Graph Attention Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21933)
*Yifan Xue,Ruihuai Liang,Bo Yang,Xuelin Cao,Zhiwen Yu,Mérouane Debbah,Chau Yuen*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a graph attention diffusion-based solution generator (GADSG) for task scheduling in low-altitude MEC systems, addressing challenges like node heterogeneity and dynamic tasks. It outperforms baselines in performance and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The low-altitude economy's growth demands real-time, intelligent task scheduling in MEC systems, but challenges like unstable links and dynamic tasks persist.

Method: A three-layer MEC system is modeled, and the problem is abstracted into graph-structured tasks. GADSG combines graph attention networks and diffusion models for joint optimization.

Result: GADSG outperforms baselines in optimization, robustness, and generalization across diverse task structures.

Conclusion: GADSG shows strong potential for efficient task scheduling in dynamic low-altitude networks.

Abstract: With the rapid development of the low-altitude economy, air-ground integrated
multi-access edge computing (MEC) systems are facing increasing demands for
real-time and intelligent task scheduling. In such systems, task offloading and
resource allocation encounter multiple challenges, including node
heterogeneity, unstable communication links, and dynamic task variations. To
address these issues, this paper constructs a three-layer heterogeneous MEC
system architecture for low-altitude economic networks, encompassing aerial and
ground users as well as edge servers. The system is systematically modeled from
the perspectives of communication channels, computational costs, and constraint
conditions, and the joint optimization problem of offloading decisions and
resource allocation is uniformly abstracted into a graph-structured modeling
task. On this basis, we propose a graph attention diffusion-based solution
generator (GADSG). This method integrates the contextual awareness of graph
attention networks with the solution distribution learning capability of
diffusion models, enabling joint modeling and optimization of discrete
offloading variables and continuous resource allocation variables within a
high-dimensional latent space. We construct multiple simulation datasets with
varying scales and topologies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed GADSG model significantly outperforms existing baseline methods in
terms of optimization performance, robustness, and generalization across task
structures, showing strong potential for efficient task scheduling in dynamic
and complex low-altitude economic network environments.

### [261] [Concept-Level AI for Telecom: Moving Beyond Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22359)
*Viswanath Kumarskandpriya,Abdulhalim Dandoush,Abbas Bradai,Ali Belgacem*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper advocates for Large Concept Models (LCMs) over Large Language Models (LLMs) in telecom due to their superior handling of hierarchical, cross-layer, and real-time challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Telecom systems face complexity from multi-domain, multilingual, and hierarchical structures, requiring AI solutions beyond token-based LLMs.

Method: LCMs use semantic concept reasoning, hyperbolic latent spaces, and concise embeddings to address telecom-specific needs like cross-layer dependencies and real-time coordination.

Result: LCMs outperform LLMs in memory efficiency, cross-layer correlation, and multimodal integration for telecom management.

Conclusion: LCMs represent a necessary evolutionary leap for robust AI-driven telecom solutions, surpassing LLMs in critical aspects.

Abstract: The telecommunications and networking domain stands at the precipice of a
transformative era, driven by the necessity to manage increasingly complex,
hierarchical, multi administrative domains (i.e., several operators on the same
path) and multilingual systems. Recent research has demonstrated that Large
Language Models (LLMs), with their exceptional general-purpose text analysis
and code generation capabilities, can be effectively applied to certain telecom
problems (e.g., auto-configuration of data plan to meet certain application
requirements). However, due to their inherent token-by-token processing and
limited capacity for maintaining extended context, LLMs struggle to fulfill
telecom-specific requirements such as cross-layer dependency cascades (i.e.,
over OSI), temporal-spatial fault correlation, and real-time distributed
coordination. In contrast, Large Concept Models (LCMs), which reason at the
abstraction level of semantic concepts rather than individual lexical tokens,
offer a fundamentally superior approach for addressing these telecom
challenges. By employing hyperbolic latent spaces for hierarchical
representation and encapsulating complex multi-layered network interactions
within concise concept embeddings, LCMs overcome critical shortcomings of LLMs
in terms of memory efficiency, cross-layer correlation, and native multimodal
integration. This paper argues that adopting LCMs is not simply an incremental
step, but a necessary evolutionary leap toward achieving robust and effective
AI-driven telecom management.

### [262] [PhotonSplat: 3D Scene Reconstruction and Colorization from SPAD Sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21680)
*Sai Sri Teja,Sreevidya Chintalapati,Vinayak Gupta,Mukund Varma T,Haejoon Lee,Aswin Sankaranarayanan,Kaushik Mitra*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: PhotonSplat is a framework for 3D scene reconstruction from SPAD binary images, addressing noise and blur trade-offs with novel filtering and dynamic scene support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural rendering fails with motion-blurred imagery. SPAD arrays offer high-speed sensing but introduce binary image challenges.

Method: Uses PhotonSplat for 3D reconstruction from SPAD binary images, incorporating spatial filtering and dynamic scene representations.

Result: Enables high-quality 3D reconstruction from noisy SPAD data, supporting applications like segmentation and appearance editing.

Conclusion: PhotonSplat effectively handles SPAD challenges, advancing neural rendering for motion-blurred scenes.

Abstract: Advances in 3D reconstruction using neural rendering have enabled
high-quality 3D capture. However, they often fail when the input imagery is
corrupted by motion blur, due to fast motion of the camera or the objects in
the scene. This work advances neural rendering techniques in such scenarios by
using single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) arrays, an emerging sensing
technology capable of sensing images at extremely high speeds. However, the use
of SPADs presents its own set of unique challenges in the form of binary
images, that are driven by stochastic photon arrivals. To address this, we
introduce PhotonSplat, a framework designed to reconstruct 3D scenes directly
from SPAD binary images, effectively navigating the noise vs. blur trade-off.
Our approach incorporates a novel 3D spatial filtering technique to reduce
noise in the renderings. The framework also supports both no-reference using
generative priors and reference-based colorization from a single blurry image,
enabling downstream applications such as segmentation, object detection and
appearance editing tasks. Additionally, we extend our method to incorporate
dynamic scene representations, making it suitable for scenes with moving
objects. We further contribute PhotonScenes, a real-world multi-view dataset
captured with the SPAD sensors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance trackerless freehand ultrasound reconstruction by addressing challenges like motion estimation and drift, and to foster innovation through a public benchmark.

Method: The Challenge provided a dataset and framework for evaluating diverse algorithmic approaches, including recurrent models, registration-driven refinement, attention, and physics-informed models.

Result: Six teams submitted 21 solutions, showcasing progress but also revealing limitations in state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The Challenge serves as a live benchmark for ongoing development, with plans for future iterations to further advance the field.

Abstract: Trackerless freehand ultrasound reconstruction aims to reconstruct 3D volumes
from sequences of 2D ultrasound images without relying on external tracking
systems, offering a low-cost, portable, and widely deployable alternative for
volumetric imaging. However, it presents significant challenges, including
accurate inter-frame motion estimation, minimisation of drift accumulation over

attracted over 43 registered teams, of which 6 teams submitted 21 valid
dockerized solutions. Submitted methods spanned a wide range of algorithmic
approaches, including recurrent models, registration-driven volume refinement,
attention, and physics-informed models. This paper presents an overview of the
Challenge design, summarises the key characteristics of the dataset, provides a
concise literature review, introduces the technical details of the underlying
methodology working with tracked freehand ultrasound data, and offers a
comparative analysis of submitted methods across multiple evaluation metrics.
The results highlight both the progress and current limitations of
state-of-the-art approaches in this domain, and inform directions for future
research. The data, evaluation code, and baseline are publicly available to
facilitate ongoing development and reproducibility. As a live and evolving
benchmark, this Challenge is designed to be continuously developed and
improved. The Challenge was held at MICCAI 2024 and will be organised again at

### [264] [Physical Degradation Model-Guided Interferometric Hyperspectral Reconstruction with Unfolding Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21880)
*Yuansheng Li,Yunhao Zou,Linwei Chen,Ying Fu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel pipeline for Interferometric Hyperspectral Imaging (IHI) reconstruction addresses data scarcity and degradation challenges using a physics-based degradation model and a transformer-based method (IHRUT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IHI's potential is limited by lack of training data and difficulty in removing degradation components. The paper aims to bridge the gap between IHI reconstruction and deep learning.

Method: 1) Develops a simplified IHI degradation model for synthetic training data. 2) Introduces IHRUT, a transformer-based method for spectral correction and detail restoration.

Result: The proposed method shows superior performance and generalization in experiments.

Conclusion: The pipeline effectively enhances IHI reconstruction by combining physics-based modeling and deep learning, overcoming key challenges.

Abstract: Interferometric Hyperspectral Imaging (IHI) is a critical technique for
large-scale remote sensing tasks due to its advantages in flux and spectral
resolution. However, IHI is susceptible to complex errors arising from imaging
steps, and its quality is limited by existing signal processing-based
reconstruction algorithms. Two key challenges hinder performance enhancement:
1) the lack of training datasets. 2) the difficulty in eliminating IHI-specific
degradation components through learning-based methods. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel IHI reconstruction pipeline. First, based on
imaging physics and radiometric calibration data, we establish a simplified yet
accurate IHI degradation model and a parameter estimation method. This model
enables the synthesis of realistic IHI training datasets from hyperspectral
images (HSIs), bridging the gap between IHI reconstruction and deep learning.
Second, we design the Interferometric Hyperspectral Reconstruction Unfolding
Transformer (IHRUT), which achieves effective spectral correction and detail
restoration through a stripe-pattern enhancement mechanism and a
spatial-spectral transformer architecture. Experimental results demonstrate the
superior performance and generalization capability of our method.

*Fabian Perez,Sara Rojas,Carlos Hinojosa,Hoover Rueda-Chacón,Bernard Ghanem*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: UnMix-NeRF integrates spectral unmixing into NeRF for hyperspectral view synthesis and unsupervised material segmentation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current NeRF-based segmentation lacks material properties, limiting applications like robotics and AR. UnMix-NeRF addresses this by incorporating spectral reflectance.

Method: The framework models spectral reflectance via diffuse and specular components, using a learned dictionary of global endmembers and per-point abundances for material segmentation.

Result: UnMix-NeRF achieves superior spectral reconstruction and material segmentation compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: UnMix-NeRF successfully bridges the gap in material perception for NeRF, enabling scene editing and flexible material-based manipulation.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)-based segmentation methods focus on object
semantics and rely solely on RGB data, lacking intrinsic material properties.
This limitation restricts accurate material perception, which is crucial for
robotics, augmented reality, simulation, and other applications. We introduce
UnMix-NeRF, a framework that integrates spectral unmixing into NeRF, enabling
joint hyperspectral novel view synthesis and unsupervised material
segmentation. Our method models spectral reflectance via diffuse and specular
components, where a learned dictionary of global endmembers represents pure
material signatures, and per-point abundances capture their distribution. For
material segmentation, we use spectral signature predictions along learned
endmembers, allowing unsupervised material clustering. Additionally, UnMix-NeRF
enables scene editing by modifying learned endmember dictionaries for flexible
material-based appearance manipulation. Extensive experiments validate our
approach, demonstrating superior spectral reconstruction and material
segmentation to existing methods. Project page:

### [266] [StableCodec: Taming One-Step Diffusion for Extreme Image Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21977)
*Tianyu Zhang,Xin Luo,Li Li,Dong Liu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: StableCodec introduces one-step diffusion for ultra-low bitrate image compression, improving efficiency and fidelity with a dual-branch coding structure and end-to-end optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based compression methods require many denoising steps and sacrifice fidelity, limiting real-time use.

Method: Uses a Deep Compression Latent Codec for noisy latent transmission and a Dual-Branch Coding Structure for fidelity. Optimizes end-to-end with bitrate and pixel constraints.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on FID, KID, and DISTS metrics at ultra-low bitrates (0.005 bpp) with fast inference.

Conclusion: StableCodec enables efficient, high-fidelity, and high-realism extreme image compression with practical speed.

Abstract: Diffusion-based image compression has shown remarkable potential for
achieving ultra-low bitrate coding (less than 0.05 bits per pixel) with high
realism, by leveraging the generative priors of large pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models. However, current approaches require a large number of
denoising steps at the decoder to generate realistic results under extreme
bitrate constraints, limiting their application in real-time compression
scenarios. Additionally, these methods often sacrifice reconstruction fidelity,
as diffusion models typically fail to guarantee pixel-level consistency. To
address these challenges, we introduce StableCodec, which enables one-step
diffusion for high-fidelity and high-realism extreme image compression with
improved coding efficiency. To achieve ultra-low bitrates, we first develop an
efficient Deep Compression Latent Codec to transmit a noisy latent
representation for a single-step denoising process. We then propose a
Dual-Branch Coding Structure, consisting of a pair of auxiliary encoder and
decoder, to enhance reconstruction fidelity. Furthermore, we adopt end-to-end
optimization with joint bitrate and pixel-level constraints. Extensive
experiments on the CLIC 2020, DIV2K, and Kodak dataset demonstrate that
StableCodec outperforms existing methods in terms of FID, KID and DISTS by a
significant margin, even at bitrates as low as 0.005 bits per pixel, while
maintaining strong fidelity. Additionally, StableCodec achieves inference
speeds comparable to mainstream transform coding schemes. All source code are

*Qi Gao,Zhihao Chen,Dong Zeng,Junping Zhang,Jianhua Ma,Hongming Shan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposes NEED, a noise-inspired diffusion model for generalizable low-dose CT reconstruction, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of generalizing deep learning-based CT reconstruction to unseen doses, avoiding unrealistic structures from traditional diffusion models.

Method: Introduces a shifted Poisson diffusion model for projection data and a doubly guided diffusion model for image refinement, cascading them for dual-domain reconstruction.

Result: NEED excels in reconstruction and generalization across unseen doses, validated by extensive evaluations.

Conclusion: NEED offers a robust, generalizable solution for LDCT reconstruction, requiring only normal-dose training data.

Abstract: The generalization of deep learning-based low-dose computed tomography (CT)
reconstruction models to doses unseen in the training data is important and
remains challenging. Previous efforts heavily rely on paired data to improve
the generalization performance and robustness through collecting either diverse
CT data for re-training or a few test data for fine-tuning. Recently, diffusion
models have shown promising and generalizable performance in low-dose CT (LDCT)
reconstruction, however, they may produce unrealistic structures due to the CT
image noise deviating from Gaussian distribution and imprecise prior
information from the guidance of noisy LDCT images. In this paper, we propose a
noise-inspired diffusion model for generalizable LDCT reconstruction, termed
NEED, which tailors diffusion models for noise characteristics of each domain.
First, we propose a novel shifted Poisson diffusion model to denoise projection
data, which aligns the diffusion process with the noise model in pre-log LDCT
projections. Second, we devise a doubly guided diffusion model to refine
reconstructed images, which leverages LDCT images and initial reconstructions
to more accurately locate prior information and enhance reconstruction
fidelity. By cascading these two diffusion models for dual-domain
reconstruction, our NEED requires only normal-dose data for training and can be
effectively extended to various unseen dose levels during testing via a time
step matching strategy. Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and
segmentation-based evaluations on two datasets demonstrate that our NEED
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction and
generalization performance. Source code is made available at

*Julia Machnio,Sebastian Nørgaard Llambias,Mads Nielsen,Mostafa Mehdipour Ghazi*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework for white matter hyperintensities (WMH) segmentation and localization using single- and multi-modal MRI inputs, showing improved performance with multimodal data but trade-offs in robustness and joint task modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation and spatial localization of WMH are crucial for diagnosing small vessel disease and neurodegeneration, but existing methods lack flexibility in handling missing modalities and integrating anatomical localization.

Method: Proposes a deep learning framework evaluating four input configurations (FLAIR-only, T1-only, concatenated FLAIR and T1, modality-interchangeable) and a multi-task model for joint lesion and anatomical region prediction.

Result: Multimodal input significantly improves segmentation performance, though the modality-interchangeable setup trades accuracy for robustness. Joint lesion-region segmentation was less effective than separate models.

Conclusion: Multimodal fusion enhances WMH analysis accuracy and robustness, while joint modeling shows potential but requires further optimization.

Abstract: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are radiological markers of small vessel
disease and neurodegeneration, whose accurate segmentation and spatial
localization are crucial for diagnosis and monitoring. While multimodal MRI
offers complementary contrasts for detecting and contextualizing WM lesions,
existing approaches often lack flexibility in handling missing modalities and
fail to integrate anatomical localization efficiently. We propose a deep
learning framework for WM lesion segmentation and localization that operates
directly in native space using single- and multi-modal MRI inputs. Our study
evaluates four input configurations: FLAIR-only, T1-only, concatenated FLAIR
and T1, and a modality-interchangeable setup. It further introduces a
multi-task model for jointly predicting lesion and anatomical region masks to
estimate region-wise lesion burden. Experiments conducted on the MICCAI WMH
Segmentation Challenge dataset demonstrate that multimodal input significantly
improves the segmentation performance, outperforming unimodal models. While the
modality-interchangeable setting trades accuracy for robustness, it enables
inference in cases with missing modalities. Joint lesion-region segmentation
using multi-task learning was less effective than separate models, suggesting
representational conflict between tasks. Our findings highlight the utility of
multimodal fusion for accurate and robust WMH analysis, and the potential of
joint modeling for integrated predictions.

Motivation: Manual segmentation of aortic dissections is time-consuming and inconsistent, necessitating automated solutions for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning.

Method: Four deep learning pipelines (single-step, sequential, sequential multi-task, ensemble) using 3D U-Net and Swin-UnetR architectures were tested on 100 CTA images. Performance was measured with Dice Coefficient and Hausdorff Distance.

Result: High segmentation accuracy: Dice Coefficients of 0.91 (TL), 0.88 (FL), and 0.47 (FLT), outperforming previous methods.

Conclusion: The pipelines offer precise segmentation of aortic dissection features, aiding in morphological analysis for surveillance and treatment.

Abstract: Purpose: Aortic dissections are life-threatening cardiovascular conditions
requiring accurate segmentation of true lumen (TL), false lumen (FL), and false
lumen thrombosis (FLT) from CTA images for effective management. Manual
segmentation is time-consuming and variable, necessitating automated solutions.
Materials and Methods: We developed four deep learning-based pipelines for Type
B aortic dissection segmentation: a single-step model, a sequential model, a
sequential multi-task model, and an ensemble model, utilizing 3D U-Net and
Swin-UnetR architectures. A dataset of 100 retrospective CTA images was split
into training (n=80), validation (n=10), and testing (n=10). Performance was
assessed using the Dice Coefficient and Hausdorff Distance. Results: Our
approach achieved superior segmentation accuracy, with Dice Coefficients of
0.91 $\pm$ 0.07 for TL, 0.88 $\pm$ 0.18 for FL, and 0.47 $\pm$ 0.25 for FLT,
outperforming Yao et al. (1), who reported 0.78 $\pm$ 0.20, 0.68 $\pm$ 0.18,

*Ajay Mittal,Raghav Mehta,Omar Todd,Philipp Seeböck,Georg Langs,Ben Glocker*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a three-step pipeline for CVD classification from CT images, emphasizing interpretability and achieving higher accuracy than raw CT-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve clinical interpretability and accuracy in CVD classification from CT images, addressing limitations of end-to-end deep learning methods.

Method: Breaks the pipeline into segmentation, registration, and classification, using Atlas-ISTN and foundational models for interpretable feature extraction.

Result: Achieves 87.50% classification accuracy on the ASOCA dataset, outperforming raw CT-based methods (67.50%).

Conclusion: The proposed interpretable pipeline enhances CVD classification accuracy and clinical relevance.

Abstract: Automatic detection and classification of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) from
Computed Tomography (CT) images play an important part in facilitating
better-informed clinical decisions. However, most of the recent deep learning
based methods either directly work on raw CT data or utilize it in pair with
anatomical cardiac structure segmentation by training an end-to-end classifier.
As such, these approaches become much more difficult to interpret from a
clinical perspective. To address this challenge, in this work, we break down
the CVD classification pipeline into three components: (i) image segmentation,
(ii) image registration, and (iii) downstream CVD classification. Specifically,
we utilize the Atlas-ISTN framework and recent segmentation foundational models
to generate anatomical structure segmentation and a normative healthy atlas.
These are further utilized to extract clinically interpretable radiomic
features as well as deformation field based geometric features (through atlas
registration) for CVD classification. Our experiments on the publicly available
ASOCA dataset show that utilizing these features leads to better CVD
classification accuracy (87.50\%) when compared against classification model
trained directly on raw CT images (67.50\%). Our code is publicly available:

*Yuliang Huang,Imraj Singh,Thomas Joyce,Kris Thielemans,Jamie R. McClelland*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deformation-informed 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) method for dynamic CBCT reconstruction, addressing motion artifacts and computational inefficiencies in existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion artifacts in 3D CBCT due to breathing variability and the computational expense of implicit motion representations in current 4DGS methods.

Method: Proposes a free-form deformation (FFD)-based spatial basis function and a deformation-informed framework to ensure consistency in Gaussian motion.

Result: Superior image quality with a 6x speedup over HexPlane, demonstrated on six CBCT datasets.

Conclusion: The deformation-informed 4DGS method offers efficient, motion-compensated CBCT reconstruction, with code publicly available.

Abstract: 3D Cone-Beam CT (CBCT) is widely used in radiotherapy but suffers from motion
artifacts due to breathing. A common clinical approach mitigates this by
sorting projections into respiratory phases and reconstructing images per
phase, but this does not account for breathing variability. Dynamic CBCT
instead reconstructs images at each projection, capturing continuous motion
without phase sorting. Recent advancements in 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS)
offer powerful tools for modeling dynamic scenes, yet their application to
dynamic CBCT remains underexplored. Existing 4DGS methods, such as HexPlane,
use implicit motion representations, which are computationally expensive. While
explicit low-rank motion models have been proposed, they lack spatial
regularization, leading to inconsistencies in Gaussian motion. To address these
limitations, we introduce a free-form deformation (FFD)-based spatial basis
function and a deformation-informed framework that enforces consistency by
coupling the temporal evolution of Gaussian's mean position, scale, and
rotation under a unified deformation field. We evaluate our approach on six
CBCT datasets, demonstrating superior image quality with a 6x speedup over
HexPlane. These results highlight the potential of deformation-informed 4DGS
for efficient, motion-compensated CBCT reconstruction. The code is available at

### [272] [Dehazing Light Microscopy Images with Guided Conditional Flow Matching: finding a sweet spot between fidelity and realism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22397)
*Anirban Ray,Ashesh,Florian Jug*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: HazeMatching is a novel iterative method for dehazing microscopy images, balancing fidelity and realism by adapting conditional flow matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cheaper microscopy modalities like widefield produce hazy images; existing dehazing methods prioritize either fidelity or realism, not both.

Method: HazeMatching uses conditional flow matching, guiding the generative process with hazy observations in the conditional velocity field.

Result: Evaluated on 5 datasets, HazeMatching outperforms 7 baselines, balancing fidelity and realism, and produces well-calibrated predictions.

Conclusion: HazeMatching effectively balances fidelity and realism without needing an explicit degradation operator, making it practical for real microscopy data.

Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy is a major driver of scientific progress in the life
sciences. Although high-end confocal microscopes are capable of filtering
out-of-focus light, cheaper and more accessible microscopy modalities, such as
widefield microscopy, can not, which consequently leads to hazy image data.
Computational dehazing is trying to combine the best of both worlds, leading to
cheap microscopy but crisp-looking images. The perception-distortion trade-off
tells us that we can optimize either for data fidelity, e.g. low MSE or high
PSNR, or for data realism, measured by perceptual metrics such as LPIPS or FID.
Existing methods either prioritize fidelity at the expense of realism, or
produce perceptually convincing results that lack quantitative accuracy. In
this work, we propose HazeMatching, a novel iterative method for dehazing light
microscopy images, which effectively balances these objectives. Our goal was to
find a balanced trade-off between the fidelity of the dehazing results and the
realism of individual predictions (samples). We achieve this by adapting the
conditional flow matching framework by guiding the generative process with a
hazy observation in the conditional velocity field. We evaluate HazeMatching on
5 datasets, covering both synthetic and real data, assessing both distortion
and perceptual quality. Our method is compared against 7 baselines, achieving a
consistent balance between fidelity and realism on average. Additionally, with
calibration analysis, we show that HazeMatching produces well-calibrated
predictions. Note that our method does not need an explicit degradation
operator to exist, making it easily applicable on real microscopy data. All
data used for training and evaluation and our code will be publicly available
under a permissive license.

### [273] [Single-shot HDR using conventional image sensor shutter functions and optical randomization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22426)
*Xiang Dai,Kyrollos Yanny,Kristina Monakhova,Nicholas Antipa*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A single-shot HDR imaging method using GRR shutter mode and optical shuffling to recover HDR data, outperforming others in high saturation scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome motion artifacts in classic multi-exposure HDR imaging and address limitations of single-shot methods with highlight regions.

Method: Utilizes GRR shutter mode and optical shuffling for spatially randomized exposures, solving an optimization problem with a total variation prior.

Result: Outperforms other single-shot methods in high saturation (10%+) and achieves 73dB dynamic range with an 8-bit sensor.

Conclusion: The method effectively recovers HDR data in challenging scenarios and demonstrates practical feasibility with a lab prototype.

Abstract: High-dynamic-range (HDR) imaging is an essential technique for overcoming the
dynamic range limits of image sensors. The classic method relies on multiple
exposures, which slows capture time, resulting in motion artifacts when imaging
dynamic scenes. Single-shot HDR imaging alleviates this issue by encoding HDR
data into a single exposure, then computationally recovering it. Many
established methods use strong image priors to recover improperly exposed image
detail. These approaches struggle with extended highlight regions. We utilize
the global reset release (GRR) shutter mode of an off-the-shelf sensor. GRR
shutter mode applies a longer exposure time to rows closer to the bottom of the
sensor. We use optics that relay a randomly permuted (shuffled) image onto the
sensor, effectively creating spatially randomized exposures across the scene.
The exposure diversity allows us to recover HDR data by solving an optimization
problem with a simple total variation image prior. In simulation, we
demonstrate that our method outperforms other single-shot methods when many
sensor pixels are saturated (10% or more), and is competitive at a modest
saturation (1%). Finally, we demonstrate a physical lab prototype that uses an
off-the-shelf random fiber bundle for the optical shuffling. The fiber bundle
is coupled to a low-cost commercial sensor operating in GRR shutter mode. Our
prototype achieves a dynamic range of up to 73dB using an 8-bit sensor with
48dB dynamic range.

### [274] [A Plea for History and Philosophy of Statistics and Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22236)
*Hanti Lin*

Main category: stat.OT

TL;DR: The paper advocates for integrating the history and philosophy of statistics with machine learning, highlighting the blurred boundaries between the fields. It introduces 'achievabilism,' a foundational assumption in frequentist statistics and machine learning, and proposes methodological integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The urgency to integrate history and philosophy of statistics with machine learning due to their intertwined development and blurred boundaries, aiming to uncover foundational insights.

Method: A case study tracing a philosophical idea in machine learning back to Neyman and Pearson's 1936 work, leading to the articulation of 'achievabilism.'

Result: The identification of 'achievabilism' as a shared foundational assumption in frequentist statistics and machine learning, and a methodological integration proposal.

Conclusion: The paper calls for deeper integration of history, philosophy, and methodology across statistics and machine learning to advance foundational understanding.

Abstract: The integration of the history and philosophy of statistics was initiated at
least by Hacking (1965) and advanced by Mayo (1996), but it has not received
sustained follow-up. Yet such integration is more urgent than ever, as the
recent success of artificial intelligence has been driven largely by machine
learning -- a field historically developed alongside statistics. Today, the
boundary between statistics and machine learning is increasingly blurred. What
we now need is integration, twice over: of history and philosophy, and of the
field they engage -- statistics and machine learning. I present a case study of
a philosophical idea in machine learning (and in formal epistemology) whose
root can be traced back to an often under-appreciated insight in Neyman and
Pearson's 1936 work (a follow-up to their 1933 classic). This leads to the
articulation of a foundational assumption -- largely implicit in, but shared
by, the practices of frequentist statistics and machine learning -- which I
call achievabilism. Another integration also emerges at the level of
methodology, combining two ends of the philosophy of science spectrum: history
and philosophy of science on the one hand, and formal epistemology on the other
hand.

### [275] [Inverse Design of Diffractive Metasurfaces Using Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21748)
*Liav Hen,Erez Yosef,Dan Raviv,Raja Giryes,Jacob Scheuer*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method using diffusion models for inverse design of metasurfaces, achieving low-error designs quickly and releasing code/datasets for further research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complex, nonlinear relationship between metasurface structure and optical properties makes inverse design challenging, requiring expert tuning and facing computational inefficiencies.

Method: The authors integrate diffusion models into computational workflows, training on RCWA-simulated data to predict metasurface geometry from target optical responses.

Result: The model generates low-error metasurface designs (e.g., intensity and polarization splitters) in under 30 minutes, either directly or as an initializer for optimization.

Conclusion: The approach efficiently addresses metasurface design challenges, with publicly released resources to advance data-driven research.

Abstract: Metasurfaces are ultra-thin optical elements composed of engineered
sub-wavelength structures that enable precise control of light. Their inverse
design - determining a geometry that yields a desired optical response - is
challenging due to the complex, nonlinear relationship between structure and
optical properties. This often requires expert tuning, is prone to local
minima, and involves significant computational overhead. In this work, we
address these challenges by integrating the generative capabilities of
diffusion models into computational design workflows. Using an RCWA simulator,
we generate training data consisting of metasurface geometries and their
corresponding far-field scattering patterns. We then train a conditional
diffusion model to predict meta-atom geometry and height from a target spatial
power distribution at a specified wavelength, sampled from a continuous
supported band. Once trained, the model can generate metasurfaces with low
error, either directly using RCWA-guided posterior sampling or by serving as an
initializer for traditional optimization methods. We demonstrate our approach
on the design of a spatially uniform intensity splitter and a polarization beam
splitter, both produced with low error in under 30 minutes. To support further
research in data-driven metasurface design, we publicly release our code and
datasets.

*Felipe Rogério Pimentel,Rafael Gustavo Alves*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper modifies Chen et al.'s FIR filter algorithm for tracking COVID-19 infections and recoveries, achieving better approximation errors in simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy of tracking and predicting COVID-19 cases using FIR filters and ridge regression, especially in the absence of vaccines.

Method: Modified Chen et al.'s algorithm by adjusting FIR filter orders and regularization parameters, applied to the SIR model for Minas Gerais/Brazil.

Result: The modified algorithm showed better approximation errors compared to the original in simulations.

Conclusion: The proposed modification enhances prediction accuracy for COVID-19 cases, demonstrating practical utility in pandemic tracking.

Abstract: Authors Yi-Cheng Chen, Ping-En Lu, Cheng-Shang Chang, and Tzu-Hsuan Liu use
the Finite Impulse Response (FIR) linear system filtering method to track and
predict the number of people infected and recovered from COVID-19, in a
pandemic context in which there was still no vaccine and the only way to avoid
contagion was isolation. To estimate the coefficients of these FIR filters,
Chen et al. used machine learning methods through a classical optimization
problem with regularization (ridge regression). These estimated coefficients
are called ridge coefficients. The epidemic mathematical model adopted by these
researchers to formulate the FIR filters is the time-dependent discrete SIR. In
this paper, we propose a small modification to the algorithm of Chen et al. to
obtain the ridge coefficients. We then used this modified algorithm to track
and predict the number of people infected and recovered from COVID-19 in the
state of Minas Gerais/Brazil, within a prediction window, during the initial
period of the pandemic. We also compare the predicted data with the respective
real data to check how good the approximation is. In the modified algorithm, we
set values for the FIR filter orders and for the regularization parameters,
both different from the respective values defined by Chen et al. in their
algorithm. In this context, the numerical results obtained by the modified
algorithm in some simulations present better approximation errors compared to
the respective approximation errors presented by the algorithm of Chen et al.

Motivation: To explore and enhance generative AI methods by integrating critical damping into higher-order dynamics, building on existing successes in lower-order systems.

Method: Extends HOLD by introducing critical damping, a concept from systems analysis, to dynamics of arbitrary order.

Result: A novel approach to diffusion methods, potentially improving stability and performance in generative AI.

Conclusion: The work advances diffusion-based generative models by generalizing critical damping to higher-order dynamics, opening new research directions.

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models represent an entirely new class of
generative AI methods that have yet to be fully explored. Critical damping has
been successfully introduced in Critically-Damped Langevin Dynamics (CLD) and
Critically-Damped Third-Order Langevin Dynamics (TOLD++), but has not yet been

method, by introducing the concept of critical damping from systems analysis.

*Tianrong Chen,Huangjie Zheng,David Berthelot,Jiatao Gu,Josh Susskind,Shuangfei Zhai*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A new training-free sampling method for diffusion models is introduced, achieving up to 186% faster sampling than state-of-the-art solvers while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models excel in generating high-fidelity images but suffer from slow sampling. This work aims to improve sampling efficiency without compromising quality.

Method: The method uses an ODE solver with higher-dimensional initial noise, reducing function evaluations and allowing detail control via a hyperparameter. It leverages momentum dynamics and shows equivalence to conventional diffusion models.

Result: The approach outperforms current solvers in speed (186% faster) and works across various pretrained models (EDM, EDM2, Stable-Diffusion 3) in pixel/latent spaces and conditional settings.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly accelerates sampling in diffusion models while maintaining quality, offering a practical solution for efficient high-fidelity image generation.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in generating
high-fidelity images but typically suffer from inefficient sampling. Many
solver designs and noise scheduling strategies have been proposed to
dramatically improve sampling speeds. In this paper, we introduce a new
sampling method that is up to $186\%$ faster than the current state of the art
solver for comparative FID on ImageNet512. This new sampling method is
training-free and uses an ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver. The key
to our method resides in using higher-dimensional initial noise, allowing to
produce more detailed samples with less function evaluations from existing
pretrained diffusion models. In addition, by design our solver allows to
control the level of detail through a simple hyper-parameter at no extra
computational cost. We present how our approach leverages momentum dynamics by
establishing a fundamental equivalence between momentum diffusion models and
conventional diffusion models with respect to their training paradigms.
Moreover, we observe the use of higher-dimensional noise naturally exhibits
characteristics similar to stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Finally,
we demonstrate strong performances on a set of representative pretrained
diffusion models, including EDM, EDM2, and Stable-Diffusion 3, which cover
models in both pixel and latent spaces, as well as class and text conditional
settings. The code is available at https://github.com/apple/ml-tada.

### [279] [Classification with Reject Option: Distribution-free Error Guarantees via Conformal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21802)
*Johan Hallberg Szabadváry,Tuwe Löfström,Ulf Johansson,Cecilia Sönströd,Ernst Ahlberg,Lars Carlsson*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper formalizes ML with a reject option in binary classification using conformal prediction, providing theoretical guarantees on error rates and practical trade-offs between error and reject rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of ML models making unreliable predictions by introducing a reject option, ensuring predictions are only made when likely correct.

Method: Uses conformal prediction to create prediction sets (singleton, two labels, or none) and derives theoretical guarantees on error rates for binary classification with reject option.

Result: Theoretical error rates are proven, and numerical examples illustrate trade-offs between error and reject rates using error-reject curves.

Conclusion: The framework provides a practical way to implement ML with reject option, balancing error and reject rates for reliable predictions.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models always make a prediction, even when they are
likely to be wrong. This causes problems in practical applications, as we do
not know if we should trust a prediction. ML with reject option addresses this
issue by abstaining from making a prediction if it is likely to be incorrect.
In this work, we formalise the approach to ML with reject option in binary
classification, deriving theoretical guarantees on the resulting error rate.
This is achieved through conformal prediction (CP), which produce prediction
sets with distribution-free validity guarantees. In binary classification, CP
can output prediction sets containing exactly one, two or no labels. By
accepting only the singleton predictions, we turn CP into a binary classifier
with reject option.
  Here, CP is formally put in the framework of predicting with reject option.
We state and prove the resulting error rate, and give finite sample estimates.
Numerical examples provide illustrations of derived error rate through several
different conformal prediction settings, ranging from full conformal prediction
to offline batch inductive conformal prediction. The former has a direct link
to sharp validity guarantees, whereas the latter is more fuzzy in terms of
validity guarantees but can be used in practice. Error-reject curves illustrate
the trade-off between error rate and reject rate, and can serve to aid a user
to set an acceptable error rate or reject rate in practice.

*Rafael Oliveira,Xuesong Wang,Kian Ming A. Chai,Edwin V. Bonilla*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Extension of Thompson sampling for functional optimization using neural operator surrogates, avoiding costly operator queries and improving sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimize over function spaces with expensive operator queries (e.g., high-fidelity simulators) and inexpensive functional evaluations.

Method: Sample-then-optimize with neural operator surrogates, treating them as approximate Gaussian process samples without explicit uncertainty quantification.

Result: Theoretical convergence guarantees under minimal assumptions; outperforms baselines in functional optimization tasks like PDEs.

Conclusion: Proposed method enhances sample efficiency and performance in operator-driven functional optimization.

Abstract: We propose an extension of Thompson sampling to optimization problems over
function spaces where the objective is a known functional of an unknown
operator's output. We assume that functional evaluations are inexpensive, while
queries to the operator (such as running a high-fidelity simulator) are costly.
Our algorithm employs a sample-then-optimize approach using neural operator
surrogates. This strategy avoids explicit uncertainty quantification by
treating trained neural operators as approximate samples from a Gaussian
process. We provide novel theoretical convergence guarantees, based on Gaussian
processes in the infinite-dimensional setting, under minimal assumptions. We
benchmark our method against existing baselines on functional optimization
tasks involving partial differential equations and other nonlinear
operator-driven phenomena, demonstrating improved sample efficiency and
competitive performance.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A hybrid generative model combines deep grey-box modeling with Optimal Transport to enhance incomplete physics models, leveraging limited unpaired data to align model distributions with true data-generating processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many real-world systems are described by approximate physics models with missing terms, leading to discrepancies between model predictions and true data distributions.

Method: The approach integrates deep grey-box modeling with Optimal Transport to map data distributions while minimizing distortion, preserving physics-based inductive biases and interpretability.

Result: The method outperforms black-box alternatives in resolving unpaired data problems and accurately learning system dynamics, validated by experimental results.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach effectively combines theory-driven and data-driven methods, offering improved model transparency and insights into learned physics dynamics.

Abstract: Physics phenomena are often described by ordinary and/or partial differential
equations (ODEs/PDEs), and solved analytically or numerically. Unfortunately,
many real-world systems are described only approximately with missing or
unknown terms in the equations. This makes the distribution of the physics
model differ from the true data-generating process (DGP). Using limited and
unpaired data between DGP observations and the imperfect model simulations, we
investigate this particular setting by completing the known-physics model,
combining theory-driven models and data-driven to describe the shifted
distribution involved in the DGP. We present a novel hybrid generative model
approach combining deep grey-box modelling with Optimal Transport (OT) methods
to enhance incomplete physics models. Our method implements OT maps in data
space while maintaining minimal source distribution distortion, demonstrating
superior performance in resolving the unpaired problem and ensuring correct
usage of physics parameters. Unlike black-box alternatives, our approach
leverages physics-based inductive biases to accurately learn system dynamics
while preserving interpretability through its domain knowledge foundation.
Experimental results validate our method's effectiveness in both generation
tasks and model transparency, offering detailed insights into learned physics
dynamics.

TL;DR: The paper introduces NESS, a machine learning approach to improve neighbor embedding (NE) algorithms for single-cell data, addressing distortions and instability issues while capturing continuous cell-state transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NE algorithms like t-SNE and UMAP introduce distortions and fail to capture continuous cell-state transitions, while current evaluation methods focus on discrete cell types. The PCS framework is used to address these challenges.

Method: The authors evaluate popular NE algorithms, identify their shortcomings, and introduce NESS, a method leveraging algorithmic stability to improve NE representations and infer smooth biological structures.

Result: NESS is applied to six single-cell datasets, successfully identifying transitional and stable cell states and quantifying transcriptional dynamics, providing robust biological insights.

Conclusion: NESS offers a principled, interpretable, and stable approach for analyzing single-cell data, enhancing the understanding of continuous biological processes.

Abstract: Single-cell sequencing is revolutionizing biology by enabling detailed
investigations of cell-state transitions. Many biological processes unfold
along continuous trajectories, yet it remains challenging to extract smooth,
low-dimensional representations from inherently noisy, high-dimensional
single-cell data. Neighbor embedding (NE) algorithms, such as t-SNE and UMAP,
are widely used to embed high-dimensional single-cell data into low dimensions.
But they often introduce undesirable distortions, resulting in misleading
interpretations. Existing evaluation methods for NE algorithms primarily focus
on separating discrete cell types rather than capturing continuous cell-state
transitions, while dynamic modeling approaches rely on strong assumptions about
cellular processes and specialized data. To address these challenges, we build
on the Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) framework for reliable and
reproducible data-driven discoveries. First, we systematically evaluate popular
NE algorithms through empirical analysis, simulation, and theory, and reveal
their key shortcomings, such as artifacts and instability. We then introduce
NESS, a principled and interpretable machine learning approach to improve NE
representations by leveraging algorithmic stability and to enable robust
inference of smooth biological structures. NESS offers useful concepts,
quantitative stability metrics, and efficient computational workflows to
uncover developmental trajectories and cell-state transitions in single-cell
data. Finally, we apply NESS to six single-cell datasets, spanning pluripotent
stem cell differentiation, organoid development, and multiple tissue-specific
lineage trajectories. Across these diverse contexts, NESS consistently yields
useful biological insights, such as identification of transitional and stable
cell states and quantification of transcriptional dynamics during development.

*Xiang Li,Garrett Wen,Weiqing He,Jiayuan Wu,Qi Long,Weijie J. Su*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper addresses estimating the proportion of watermarked text in mixed-source content, proposing efficient estimators for continuous pivotal statistic-based watermarking methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world texts often mix human-written and LLM-generated content, but existing methods focus on detecting fully watermarked texts, leaving mixed-source scenarios unexplored.

Method: The problem is framed as estimating a proportion parameter in a mixture model using pivotal statistics. Identifiability and efficient estimators are derived for continuous pivotal statistic-based watermarking.

Result: Proposed estimators achieve high accuracy in synthetic and real-world mixed-source text evaluations, matching minimax lower bounds.

Conclusion: The study provides practical solutions for estimating watermark proportions in mixed-source texts, particularly for continuous pivotal statistic-based methods.

Abstract: Text watermarks in large language models (LLMs) are an increasingly important
tool for detecting synthetic text and distinguishing human-written content from
LLM-generated text. While most existing studies focus on determining whether
entire texts are watermarked, many real-world scenarios involve mixed-source
texts, which blend human-written and watermarked content. In this paper, we
address the problem of optimally estimating the watermark proportion in
mixed-source texts. We cast this problem as estimating the proportion parameter
in a mixture model based on \emph{pivotal statistics}. First, we show that this
parameter is not even identifiable in certain watermarking schemes, let alone
consistently estimable. In stark contrast, for watermarking methods that employ
continuous pivotal statistics for detection, we demonstrate that the proportion
parameter is identifiable under mild conditions. We propose efficient
estimators for this class of methods, which include several popular unbiased
watermarks as examples, and derive minimax lower bounds for any measurable
estimator based on pivotal statistics, showing that our estimators achieve
these lower bounds. Through evaluations on both synthetic data and mixed-source
text generated by open-source models, we demonstrate that our proposed
estimators consistently achieve high estimation accuracy.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper generalizes the understanding of RKHS for NTK and NNGP kernels beyond ReLU, covering activations like SELU, ELU, and LeakyReLU, and explores their properties across network depths and smoothness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing theory for deep learning kernels (NTK, NNGP) is limited to ReLU and its powers, leaving other common activation functions poorly understood.

Method: The authors analyze the RKHS of NTK and NNGP kernels for non-smooth activations (e.g., SELU, ELU, LeakyReLU) and special cases like missing biases or polynomial activations.

Result: Non-infinitely smooth activations produce equivalent RKHSs across depths, while polynomial activations yield non-equivalent ones. Smoothness of NNGP sample paths is also characterized.

Conclusion: The study broadens the theoretical framework for deep learning kernels, providing insights into the behavior of various activation functions and their impact on RKHS and network smoothness.

Abstract: While the theory of deep learning has made some progress in recent years,
much of it is limited to the ReLU activation function. In particular, while the
neural tangent kernel (NTK) and neural network Gaussian process kernel (NNGP)
have given theoreticians tractable limiting cases of fully connected neural
networks, their properties for most activation functions except for powers of
the ReLU function are poorly understood. Our main contribution is to provide a
more general characterization of the RKHS of these kernels for typical
activation functions whose only non-smoothness is at zero, such as SELU, ELU,
or LeakyReLU. Our analysis also covers a broad set of special cases such as
missing biases, two-layer networks, or polynomial activations. Our results show
that a broad class of not infinitely smooth activations generate equivalent
RKHSs at different network depths, while polynomial activations generate
non-equivalent RKHSs. Finally, we derive results for the smoothness of NNGP
sample paths, characterizing the smoothness of infinitely wide neural networks
at initialization.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a 5-stage model for evolving scientific knowledge from static PDFs to structured semantic representations in knowledge graphs, introducing SciMantify, a hybrid approach for collaborative semantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scientific PDFs are static and lack semantic structure, hindering accessibility and reusability. A flexible, semantic representation is needed for humans and machines.

Method: A 5-star LOD-inspired model guides the transition from PDFs to semantic KGs. SciMantify, a hybrid approach, leverages tabular data and human-machine collaboration for semantification.

Result: Implemented in ORKG, the approach simplifies preprocessing, reduces semantification effort, and improves KG alignment, as shown in a preliminary user experiment.

Conclusion: The proposed model and SciMantify enhance the semantic representation of scientific knowledge, making it more accessible and reusable.

Abstract: Scientific publications, primarily digitized as PDFs, remain static and
unstructured, limiting the accessibility and reusability of the contained
knowledge. At best, scientific knowledge from publications is provided in
tabular formats, which lack semantic context. A more flexible, structured, and
semantic representation is needed to make scientific knowledge understandable
and processable by both humans and machines. We propose an evolution model of
knowledge representation, inspired by the 5-star Linked Open Data (LOD) model,
with five stages and defined criteria to guide the stepwise transition from a
digital artifact, such as a PDF, to a semantic representation integrated in a
knowledge graph (KG). Based on an exemplary workflow implementing the entire
model, we developed a hybrid approach, called SciMantify, leveraging tabular
formats of scientific knowledge, e.g., results from secondary studies, to
support its evolving semantification. In the approach, humans and machines
collaborate closely by performing semantic annotation tasks (SATs) and refining
the results to progressively improve the semantic representation of scientific
knowledge. We implemented the approach in the Open Research Knowledge Graph
(ORKG), an established platform for improving the findability, accessibility,
interoperability, and reusability of scientific knowledge. A preliminary user
experiment showed that the approach simplifies the preprocessing of scientific
knowledge, reduces the effort for the evolving semantification, and enhances
the knowledge representation through better alignment with the KG structures.

### [288] [Adapting University Policies for Generative AI: Opportunities, Challenges, and Policy Solutions in Higher Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22231)
*Russell Beale*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of generative AI, like ChatGPT, on higher education, balancing its benefits (productivity, research support) with challenges (academic integrity, equity) and proposing policy solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the dual-edged impact of generative AI in academia, ensuring its benefits are maximized while mitigating risks like cheating and inequity.

Method: Critically examines opportunities and challenges of AI, synthesizing empirical data and case studies to propose policy solutions.

Result: Finds widespread student use of AI (47%), with detection tools at 88% accuracy, highlighting the need for resilient assessments and training.

Conclusion: Proactive policy adaptation is essential to leverage AI's potential while upholding academic integrity and equity.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools -
especially large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT - has ushered in a
transformative era in higher education. Universities in developed regions are
increasingly integrating these technologies into research, teaching, and
assessment. On one hand, LLMs can enhance productivity by streamlining
literature reviews, facilitating idea generation, assisting with coding and
data analysis, and even supporting grant proposal drafting. On the other hand,
their use raises significant concerns regarding academic integrity, ethical
boundaries, and equitable access. Recent empirical studies indicate that nearly
47% of students use LLMs in their coursework - with 39% using them for exam
questions and 7% for entire assignments - while detection tools currently
achieve around 88% accuracy, leaving a 12% error margin. This article
critically examines the opportunities offered by generative AI, explores the
multifaceted challenges it poses, and outlines robust policy solutions.
Emphasis is placed on redesigning assessments to be AI-resilient, enhancing
staff and student training, implementing multi-layered enforcement mechanisms,
and defining acceptable use. By synthesizing data from recent research and case
studies, the article argues that proactive policy adaptation is imperative to
harness AI's potential while safeguarding the core values of academic integrity
and equity.

*Shiyi Wang,Wenbo Li,Yiteng Chen,Qingyao Wu,Huiping Zhuang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FrankenBot is a VLM-driven robotic framework inspired by the human brain, integrating multiple functions for efficient and robust manipulation without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving human-like efficiency in robotic manipulation requires integrating diverse functions like task planning and memory, which existing methods lack.

Method: Proposes FrankenBot, a brain-morphic framework with components mapped to human brain regions (e.g., cortex for task planning) for efficient coordination.

Result: Demonstrates superior anomaly handling, memory, efficiency, and stability in simulations and real-world tests without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: FrankenBot successfully integrates multiple robotic functions into a unified system, balancing functionality and efficiency.

Abstract: Developing a general robot manipulation system capable of performing a wide
range of tasks in complex, dynamic, and unstructured real-world environments
has long been a challenging task. It is widely recognized that achieving
human-like efficiency and robustness manipulation requires the robotic brain to
integrate a comprehensive set of functions, such as task planning, policy
generation, anomaly monitoring and handling, and long-term memory, achieving
high-efficiency operation across all functions. Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
pretrained on massive multimodal data, have acquired rich world knowledge,
exhibiting exceptional scene understanding and multimodal reasoning
capabilities. However, existing methods typically focus on realizing only a
single function or a subset of functions within the robotic brain, without
integrating them into a unified cognitive architecture. Inspired by a
divide-and-conquer strategy and the architecture of the human brain, we propose
FrankenBot, a VLM-driven, brain-morphic robotic manipulation framework that
achieves both comprehensive functionality and high operational efficiency. Our
framework includes a suite of components, decoupling a part of key functions
from frequent VLM calls, striking an optimal balance between functional
completeness and system efficiency. Specifically, we map task planning, policy
generation, memory management, and low-level interfacing to the cortex,
cerebellum, temporal lobe-hippocampus complex, and brainstem, respectively, and
design efficient coordination mechanisms for the modules. We conducted
comprehensive experiments in both simulation and real-world robotic
environments, demonstrating that our method offers significant advantages in
anomaly detection and handling, long-term memory, operational efficiency, and
stability -- all without requiring any fine-tuning or retraining.

TL;DR: ARK is a Python-first robotics framework designed to simplify robotics software development, bridging the gap between robotics and AI by offering a user-friendly, well-documented ecosystem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotics software stacks are complex, requiring low-level expertise and fragmented tools, unlike the streamlined Python ecosystems in AI. ARK aims to make robotics more accessible.

Method: ARK provides a Gym-style interface for data collection, preprocessing, and training policies using imitation-learning algorithms. It supports simulation and physical robots, with a client-server architecture and optional C/C++ bindings.

Result: ARK enables rapid prototyping, hardware swapping, and end-to-end pipelines, rivaling AI workflows. It includes reusable modules and ROS interoperability.

Conclusion: ARK lowers entry barriers and accelerates autonomous robot deployment by unifying robotics and AI practices under a Python-centric framework.

Abstract: Robotics has made remarkable hardware strides-from DARPA's Urban and Robotics
Challenges to the first humanoid-robot kickboxing tournament-yet commercial
autonomy still lags behind progress in machine learning. A major bottleneck is
software: current robot stacks demand steep learning curves, low-level C/C++
expertise, fragmented tooling, and intricate hardware integration, in stark
contrast to the Python-centric, well-documented ecosystems that propelled
modern AI. We introduce ARK, an open-source, Python-first robotics framework
designed to close that gap. ARK presents a Gym-style environment interface that
allows users to collect data, preprocess it, and train policies using
state-of-the-art imitation-learning algorithms (e.g., ACT, Diffusion Policy)
while seamlessly toggling between high-fidelity simulation and physical robots.
A lightweight client-server architecture provides networked
publisher-subscriber communication, and optional C/C++ bindings ensure
real-time performance when needed. ARK ships with reusable modules for control,
SLAM, motion planning, system identification, and visualization, along with
native ROS interoperability. Comprehensive documentation and case studies-from
manipulation to mobile navigation-demonstrate rapid prototyping, effortless
hardware swapping, and end-to-end pipelines that rival the convenience of
mainstream machine-learning workflows. By unifying robotics and AI practices
under a common Python umbrella, ARK lowers entry barriers and accelerates
research and commercial deployment of autonomous robots.

*Haiping Yang,Huaxing Liu,Wei Wu,Zuohui Chen,Ning Wu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A vision-based system, AeroLite-MDNet, is proposed for UAV landing deviation warnings, achieving high accuracy and low delay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate UAV landing is challenging due to GPS interference, necessitating a reliable deviation warning system.

Method: The system uses a multiscale fusion module for object detection and a segmentation branch for orientation estimation, evaluated with a new metric (AWD) and dataset (UAVLandData).

Result: Achieves 98.6% deviation detection accuracy and 0.7s AWD.

Conclusion: The system significantly improves UAV landing reliability, with code and dataset made available for further research.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly employed in diverse
applications such as land surveying, material transport, and environmental
monitoring. Following missions like data collection or inspection, UAVs must
land safely at docking stations for storage or recharging, which is an
essential requirement for ensuring operational continuity. However, accurate
landing remains challenging due to factors like GPS signal interference. To
address this issue, we propose a deviation warning system for UAV landings,
powered by a novel vision-based model called AeroLite-MDNet. This model
integrates a multiscale fusion module for robust cross-scale object detection
and incorporates a segmentation branch for efficient orientation estimation. We
introduce a new evaluation metric, Average Warning Delay (AWD), to quantify the
system's sensitivity to landing deviations. Furthermore, we contribute a new
dataset, UAVLandData, which captures real-world landing deviation scenarios to
support training and evaluation. Experimental results show that our system
achieves an AWD of 0.7 seconds with a deviation detection accuracy of 98.6\%,
demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing UAV landing reliability. Code will

Motivation: Existing datasets and models focus on urban or wide off-road settings, leaving a gap for narrow trail-like scenarios, critical for search/rescue and incident management.

Method: TOMD includes 128-channel LiDAR, stereo imagery, GNSS, IMU, and illumination data. A dynamic multiscale fusion model is proposed, testing early, cross, and mixed fusion strategies.

Result: The approach proves effective, with illumination significantly impacting segmentation performance.

Conclusion: TOMD and the proposed model address the gap in trail-based off-road navigation, with the dataset publicly released for further research.

Abstract: Detecting traversable pathways in unstructured outdoor environments remains a
significant challenge for autonomous robots, especially in critical
applications such as wide-area search and rescue, as well as incident
management scenarios like forest fires. Existing datasets and models primarily
target urban settings or wide, vehicle-traversable off-road tracks, leaving a
substantial gap in addressing the complexity of narrow, trail-like off-road
scenarios. To address this, we introduce the Trail-based Off-road Multimodal
Dataset (TOMD), a comprehensive dataset specifically designed for such
environments. TOMD features high-fidelity multimodal sensor data -- including
128-channel LiDAR, stereo imagery, GNSS, IMU, and illumination measurements --
collected through repeated traversals under diverse conditions. We also propose
a dynamic multiscale data fusion model for accurate traversable pathway
prediction. The study analyzes the performance of early, cross, and mixed
fusion strategies under varying illumination levels. Results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach and the relevance of illumination in segmentation
performance. We publicly release TOMD at https://github.com/yyyxs1125/TMOD to
support future research in trail-based off-road navigation.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a structured learning approach for vision-based lane keeping in skid-steered vehicles, addressing challenges in modeling and automation deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of accurate analytical models for skid-slip wheel-terrain interactions, especially in off-road settings, hinders automation in skid-steered vehicles.

Method: A novel structured formulation for learning visual navigation is introduced, leveraging end-to-end learning methods like imitation and deep reinforcement learning.

Result: Extensive simulations, hardware tests, and ablation studies show the approach outperforms current methods.

Conclusion: The proposed structured learning method significantly improves performance in vision-based lane keeping for skid-steered vehicles.

Abstract: Vision-based lane keeping is a topic of significant interest in the robotics
and autonomous ground vehicles communities in various on-road and off-road
applications. The skid-steered vehicle architecture has served as a useful
vehicle platform for human controlled operations. However, systematic modeling,
especially of the skid-slip wheel terrain interactions (primarily in off-road
settings) has created bottlenecks for automation deployment. End-to-end
learning based methods such as imitation learning and deep reinforcement
learning, have gained prominence as a viable deployment option to counter the
lack of accurate analytical models. However, the systematic formulation and
subsequent verification/validation in dynamic operation regimes (particularly
for skid-steered vehicles) remains a work in progress. To this end, a novel
approach for structured formulation for learning visual navigation is proposed
and investigated in this work. Extensive software simulations, hardware
evaluations and ablation studies now highlight the significantly improved
performance of the proposed approach against contemporary literature.

Motivation: Standard closed-set methods and existing open-vocabulary detection struggle with diverse objects and dynamic conditions in indoor settings.

Method: The approach refines pseudo labels via temporal clustering, uses multi-scale threshold fusion, and applies a Mean Teacher framework with contrastive learning.

Result: Experiments show significant gains in zero-shot detection performance and adaptability to dynamic indoor conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed SFDA method effectively adapts pre-trained models to real-world indoor environments without source data.

Abstract: Mobile robots rely on object detectors for perception and object localization
in indoor environments. However, standard closed-set methods struggle to handle
the diverse objects and dynamic conditions encountered in real homes and labs.
Open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD), driven by Vision Language Models
(VLMs), extends beyond fixed labels but still struggles with domain shifts in
indoor environments. We introduce a Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA)
approach that adapts a pre-trained model without accessing source data. We
refine pseudo labels via temporal clustering, employ multi-scale threshold
fusion, and apply a Mean Teacher framework with contrastive learning. Our
Embodied Domain Adaptation for Object Detection (EDAOD) benchmark evaluates
adaptation under sequential changes in lighting, layout, and object diversity.

Conclusion: ASVSim, released under the MIT license, aims to democratize autonomous navigation research for the ocean engineering community.

Abstract: The transport industry has recently shown significant interest in unmanned
surface vehicles (USVs), specifically for port and inland waterway transport.
These systems can improve operational efficiency and safety, which is
especially relevant in the European Union, where initiatives such as the Green
Deal are driving a shift towards increased use of inland waterways. At the same
time, a shortage of qualified personnel is accelerating the adoption of
autonomous solutions. However, there is a notable lack of open-source,

Built upon Cosys-AirSim, ASVSim provides a comprehensive platform for
developing autonomous navigation algorithms and generating synthetic datasets.
The simulator supports research of both traditional control methods and deep

Motivation: To systematically study hitchhiking, an informal and decentralized travel mode, using a large, crowd-sourced dataset.

Method: Leveraged data from hitchwiki.org and hitchmap.com (63,000+ entries) to analyze spatiotemporal patterns, waiting times, user behavior, and metadata.

Result: Identified Europe-centric distribution, seasonal trends, reliance on active contributors, and inherent dataset biases (demographic skew, unverifiable entries).

Conclusion: The dataset provides valuable insights into hitchhiking, despite limitations. Future work should enrich data and explore hitchhiking as a cultural phenomenon.

Abstract: Hitchhiking, a spontaneous and decentralized mode of travel, has long eluded
systematic study due to its informal nature. This paper presents and analyzes
the largest known structured dataset of hitchhiking rides, comprising over
63,000 entries collected over nearly two decades through platforms associated
with hitchwiki.org and lately on hitchmap.com. By leveraging crowd-sourced
contributions, the dataset captures key spatiotemporal and strategic aspects of
hitchhiking. This work documents the dataset's origins, evolution, and
community-driven maintenance, highlighting its Europe-centric distribution,
seasonal patterns, and reliance on a small number of highly active
contributors. Through exploratory analyses, I examine waiting times, user
behavior, and comment metadata, shedding light on the lived realities of
hitchhikers. While the dataset has inherent biases and limitations - such as
demographic skew and unverifiable entries it offers a rare and valuable window
into an alternative form of mobility. I conclude by outlining future directions
for enriching the dataset and advancing research on hitchhiking as both a
transportation practice and cultural phenomenon.

Motivation: To assess the impact of large language models like ChatGPT on the readability of scientific abstracts.

Method: Analyzed arXiv.org abstracts using four readability formulas, aggregating scores by year and category.

Result: Readability decreased annually, with a notable change post-ChatGPT release in 2023-2024 across most categories.

Conclusion: AI likely influences scientific writing, making abstracts more complex post-ChatGPT.

Abstract: The rise and growing popularity of accessible large language models have
raised questions about their impact on various aspects of life, including how
scientists write and publish their research. The primary objective of this
paper is to analyze a dataset consisting of all abstracts posted on arXiv.org
between 2010 and June 7th, 2024, to assess the evolution of their readability
and determine whether significant shifts occurred following the release of
ChatGPT in November 2022. Four standard readability formulas are used to
calculate individual readability scores for each paper, classifying their level
of readability. These scores are then aggregated by year and across the eight
primary categories covered by the platform. The results show a steady annual
decrease in readability, suggesting that abstracts are likely becoming
increasingly complex. Additionally, following the release of ChatGPT, a
significant change in readability is observed for 2023 and the analyzed months
of 2024. Similar trends are found across categories, with most experiencing a
notable change in readability during 2023 and 2024. These findings offer
insights into the broader changes in readability and point to the likely
influence of AI on scientific writing.

TL;DR: A transformer-based model extends previous architectures to simulate complex hadronic showers in highly-granular calorimeters, achieving holistic generation across electromagnetic and hadronic systems for the first time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance accuracy and speed in particle shower simulations, addressing computing constraints by leveraging generative machine learning models.

Method: Uses a transformer-based extension of diffusion models to generate geometry-independent point clouds, focusing on electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters.

Result: Efficient simulation of complex hadronic showers with pronounced substructure across both calorimeter types.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the first successful holistic machine learning approach for shower generation in highly-granular imaging calorimeter systems.

Abstract: Simulating showers of particles in highly-granular calorimeters is a key
frontier in the application of machine learning to particle physics. Achieving
high accuracy and speed with generative machine learning models can enable them
to augment traditional simulations and alleviate a major computing constraint.
Recent developments have shown how diffusion based generative shower simulation
approaches that do not rely on a fixed structure, but instead generate
geometry-independent point clouds, are very efficient. We present a
transformer-based extension to previous architectures which were developed for
simulating electromagnetic showers in the highly granular electromagnetic
calorimeter of the International Large Detector, ILD. The attention mechanism
now allows us to generate complex hadronic showers with more pronounced
substructure across both the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters. This is
the first time that machine learning methods are used to holistically generate
showers across the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeter in highly granular
imaging calorimeter systems.

*Michael A. Riegler,Kristoffer Herland Hellton,Vajira Thambawita,Hugo L. Hammer*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: LLMs like Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT were tested for suggesting Bayesian priors. They correctly identified associations but varied in prior quality, with Claude outperforming others. Calibration of prior width remains a challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Selecting Bayesian priors is difficult and subjective. The study explores using LLMs to automate and improve this process.

Method: LLMs were prompted to suggest and verify priors for heart disease risk and concrete strength datasets. Priors were evaluated using Kullback-Leibler divergence.

Result: LLMs correctly identified associations but varied in prior quality. Claude provided better priors, especially avoiding unnecessary vagueness.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for automating prior selection, but calibration of prior width needs refinement.

Abstract: Selecting prior distributions in Bayesian statistics is challenging,
resource-intensive, and subjective. We analyze using large-language models
(LLMs) to suggest suitable, knowledge-based informative priors. We developed an
extensive prompt asking LLMs not only to suggest priors but also to verify and
reflect on their choices.
  We evaluated Claude Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and ChatGPT-4o-mini on two real
datasets: heart disease risk and concrete strength. All LLMs correctly
identified the direction for all associations (e.g., that heart disease risk is
higher for males). The quality of suggested priors was measured by their
Kullback-Leibler divergence from the maximum likelihood estimator's
distribution.
  The LLMs suggested both moderately and weakly informative priors. The
moderate priors were often overconfident, resulting in distributions misaligned
with the data. In our experiments, Claude and Gemini provided better priors
than ChatGPT. For weakly informative priors, a key performance difference
emerged: ChatGPT and Gemini defaulted to an "unnecessarily vague" mean of 0,
while Claude did not, demonstrating a significant advantage.
  The ability of LLMs to identify correct associations shows their great
potential as an efficient, objective method for developing informative priors.
However, the primary challenge remains in calibrating the width of these priors
to avoid over- and under-confidence.

Conclusion: The study advances fairness in multidimensional allocation, offering practical tools and theoretical insights, though computational challenges remain for certain cases.

Abstract: This paper explores the fair allocation of indivisible items in a
multidimensional setting, motivated by the need to address fairness in complex
environments where agents assess bundles according to multiple criteria. Such
multidimensional settings are not merely of theoretical interest but are
central to many real-world applications. For example, cloud computing resources
are evaluated based on multiple criteria such as CPU cores, memory, and network
bandwidth. In such cases, traditional one dimensional fairness notions fail to
capture fairness across multiple attributes. To address these challenges, we
study two relaxed variants of envy-freeness: weak simultaneously envy-free up
to c goods (weak sEFc) and strong simultaneously envy-free up to c goods
(strong sEFc), which accommodate the multidimensionality of agents'
preferences. Under the weak notion, for every pair of agents and for each
dimension, any perceived envy can be eliminated by removing, if necessary, a
different set of goods from the envied agent's allocation. In contrast, the
strong version requires selecting a single set of goods whose removal from the
envied bundle simultaneously eliminates envy in every dimension. We provide
upper and lower bounds on the relaxation parameter c that guarantee the
existence of weak or strong sEFc allocations, where these bounds are
independent of the total number of items. In addition, we present algorithms
for checking whether a weak or strong sEFc allocation exists. Moreover, we
establish NP-hardness results for checking the existence of weak sEF1 and
strong sEF1 allocations.

TL;DR: RiverEcho is an interactive system using a large language model and cultural knowledge dataset to promote Yellow River culture through voice queries and digital human responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To conserve and inherit the ancient Yellow River culture by leveraging technology.

Method: Built a knowledge database of Yellow River culture, used Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance LLM response quality.

Result: Improved response quality, providing professional and informative cultural insights.

Conclusion: RiverEcho diversifies cultural promotion methods and deepens user engagement with Yellow River culture.

Abstract: The Yellow River is China's mother river and a cradle of human civilization.
The ancient Yellow River culture is, moreover, an indispensable part of human
art history. To conserve and inherit the ancient Yellow River culture, we
designed RiverEcho, a real-time interactive system that responds to voice
queries using a large language model and a cultural knowledge dataset,
delivering explanations through a talking-head digital human. Specifically, we
built a knowledge database focused on the ancient Yellow River culture,
including the collection of historical texts and the processing pipeline.
Experimental results demonstrate that leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) on the proposed dataset enhances the response quality of the Large
Language Model(LLM), enabling the system to generate more professional and
informative responses. Our work not only diversifies the means of promoting
Yellow River culture but also provides users with deeper cultural insights.

### [305] [DiffSoundStream: Efficient Speech Tokenization via Diffusion Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22362)
*Yang Yang,Yunpeng Li,George Sung,Shao-Fu Shih,Craig Dooley,Alessio Centazzo,Ramanan Rajeswaran*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: DiffSoundStream improves speech tokenization efficiency by reducing redundancy between semantic and acoustic tokens and using latent diffusion models for high-quality waveform synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Token-based speech generation is constrained by token rate, limiting inference speed. The goal is to enhance efficiency without compromising quality.

Method: Two techniques: (1) conditioning neural codec on semantic tokens to reduce redundancy, and (2) using latent diffusion models for waveform synthesis.

Result: At 50 tokens per second, DiffSoundStream matches the quality of a standard model at twice the token rate. Step-size distillation achieves near-quality with just four diffusion steps.

Conclusion: DiffSoundStream offers a more efficient alternative for speech tokenization, maintaining quality while reducing computational demands.

Abstract: Token-based language modeling is a prominent approach for speech generation,
where tokens are obtained by quantizing features from self-supervised learning
(SSL) models and extracting codes from neural speech codecs, generally referred
to as semantic tokens and acoustic tokens. These tokens are often modeled
autoregressively, with the inference speed being constrained by the token rate.
In this work, we propose DiffSoundStream, a solution that improves the
efficiency of speech tokenization in non-streaming scenarios through two
techniques: (1) conditioning the neural codec on semantic tokens to minimize
redundancy between semantic and acoustic tokens, and (2) leveraging latent
diffusion models to synthesize high-quality waveforms from semantic and
coarse-level acoustic tokens. Experiments show that at 50 tokens per second,
DiffSoundStream achieves speech quality on par with a standard SoundStream
model operating at twice the token rate. Additionally, we achieve step-size
distillation using just four diffusion sampling steps with only a minor quality
loss.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel ML-based method for interoperable channel feedback compression without sharing models between UE and base stations, demonstrating practical benefits in 6G networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of real-life proof for ML-based channel feedback compression benefits in practical settings where UE and base stations don't share ML models.

Method: Training interoperable compression and decompression ML models confidentially and testing them with prototype UEs and base stations.

Result: Accurate ML-based channel feedback without model sharing, improving downlink throughput and channel reconstruction accuracy.

Conclusion: The approach enables practical ML-based channel feedback in 6G networks without vendor model sharing.

Abstract: Neural network-based compression and decompression of channel state feedback
has been one of the most widely studied applications of machine learning (ML)
in wireless networks. Various simulation-based studies have shown that ML-based
feedback compression can result in reduced overhead and more accurate channel
information. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no real-life
proofs of concepts demonstrating the benefits of ML-based channel feedback
compression in a practical setting, where the user equipment (UE) and base
station have no access to each others' ML models. In this paper, we present a
novel approach for training interoperable compression and decompression ML
models in a confidential manner, and demonstrate the accuracy of the ensuing
models using prototype UEs and base stations. The performance of the ML-based
channel feedback is measured both in terms of the accuracy of the reconstructed
channel information and achieved downlink throughput gains when using the
channel information for beamforming. The reported measurement results
demonstrate that it is possible to develop an accurate ML-based channel
feedback link without having to share ML models between device and network
vendors. These results pave the way for a practical implementation of ML-based
channel feedback in commercial 6G networks.

*Fuying Wang,Jiacheng Xu,Lequan Yu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: MELP is a novel multi-scale ECG-language pretraining model that improves ECG analysis by aligning ECG signals with clinical text at token, beat, and rhythm levels, outperforming existing SSL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deep learning for ECG analysis requires large-scale manual annotations, which are resource-intensive. Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a solution but struggles with the multi-scale nature of ECG signals.

Method: MELP pretrains a cardiology-specific language model and applies three levels of cross-modal supervision (token, beat, rhythm) to align ECG signals with textual reports.

Result: MELP outperforms existing SSL methods in tasks like zero-shot ECG classification, linear probing, and transfer learning across three public ECG datasets.

Conclusion: MELP effectively captures hierarchical ECG structures and enhances adaptability for diverse clinical applications, offering a robust alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) play a vital role in monitoring cardiac health and
diagnosing heart diseases. However, traditional deep learning approaches for
ECG analysis rely heavily on large-scale manual annotations, which are both
time-consuming and resource-intensive to obtain. To overcome this limitation,
self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising alternative, enabling
the extraction of robust ECG representations that can be efficiently
transferred to various downstream tasks. While previous studies have explored
SSL for ECG pretraining and multi-modal ECG-language alignment, they often fail
to capture the multi-scale nature of ECG signals. As a result, these methods
struggle to learn generalized representations due to their inability to model
the hierarchical structure of ECG data. To address this gap, we introduce MELP,
a novel Multi-scale ECG-Language Pretraining (MELP) model that fully leverages
hierarchical supervision from ECG-text pairs. MELP first pretrains a
cardiology-specific language model to enhance its understanding of clinical
text. It then applies three levels of cross-modal supervision-at the token,
beat, and rhythm levels-to align ECG signals with textual reports, capturing
structured information across different time scales. We evaluate MELP on three
public ECG datasets across multiple tasks, including zero-shot ECG
classification, linear probing, and transfer learning. Experimental results
demonstrate that MELP outperforms existing SSL methods, underscoring its
effectiveness and adaptability across diverse clinical applications. Our code

TL;DR: The paper explores using Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to design efficient deep neural networks for radar target detection, reducing computational complexity while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks excel in radar target detection but face challenges in embedded systems due to high computational complexity.

Method: Proposes MCTS-based NAS to find efficient neural architectures, evaluated on endoclutter radar signals.

Result: A novel, lighter network achieves required detection performance, outperforming expert-designed baselines.

Conclusion: MCTS-based NAS is effective for designing computationally efficient neural networks for radar applications.

Abstract: Recent research works establish deep neural networks as high performing tools
for radar target detection, especially on challenging environments (presence of
clutter or interferences, multi-target scenarii...). However, the usually large
computational complexity of these networks is one of the factors preventing
them from being widely implemented in embedded radar systems. We propose to
investigate novel neural architecture search (NAS) methods, based on
Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), for finding neural networks achieving the
required detection performance and striving towards a lower computational
complexity. We evaluate the searched architectures on endoclutter radar
signals, in order to compare their respective performance metrics and
generalization properties. A novel network satisfying the required detection
probability while being significantly lighter than the expert-designed baseline
is proposed.

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: A novel method for storm surge forecasting uses RGB-encoded images and ConvLSTM networks, integrating wind fields and topo-bathymetry for accurate, scalable predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine learning approaches for storm surge forecasting lack spatial resolution, generalization, and compatibility with modern deep learning architectures.

Method: Projects unstructured water elevation fields onto RGB-encoded images, applies ConvLSTM networks, and integrates wind fields and topo-bathymetry as inputs.

Result: Demonstrates robust 48-hour forecasting performance in the Gulf of Mexico and strong spatial extensibility.

Conclusion: The study improves storm surge forecasting in usability, adaptability, and interpretability by combining structured representation and scalable deep learning.

Abstract: Storm surge forecasting plays a crucial role in coastal disaster
preparedness, yet existing machine learning approaches often suffer from
limited spatial resolution, reliance on coastal station data, and poor
generalization. Moreover, many prior models operate directly on unstructured
spatial data, making them incompatible with modern deep learning architectures.
In this work, we introduce a novel approach that projects unstructured water
elevation fields onto structured Red Green Blue (RGB)-encoded image
representations, enabling the application of Convolutional Long Short Term
Memory (ConvLSTM) networks for end-to-end spatiotemporal surge forecasting. Our
model further integrates ground-truth wind fields as dynamic conditioning
signals and topo-bathymetry as a static input, capturing physically meaningful
drivers of surge evolution. Evaluated on a large-scale dataset of synthetic
storms in the Gulf of Mexico, our method demonstrates robust 48-hour
forecasting performance across multiple regions along the Texas coast and
exhibits strong spatial extensibility to other coastal areas. By combining
structured representation, physically grounded forcings, and scalable deep
learning, this study advances the frontier of storm surge forecasting in
usability, adaptability, and interpretability.

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: A physics-guided machine-learning approach optimizes L-PBF scan paths for desired microstructures, using a surrogate 3D U-Net model and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to achieve computational efficiency and improved microstructure control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The formation of complex microstructures in L-PBF affects product quality, necessitating optimized scan paths for desired outcomes like equiaxed grains.

Method: Combined phase-field method (PFM) for grain structure modeling with a surrogate 3D U-Net model for prediction, and DRL for scan path optimization.

Result: Achieved a two-orders-of-magnitude speedup and demonstrated DRL's effectiveness in generating optimized scan paths for target microstructures.

Conclusion: Machine learning methods enhance microstructure control and computational efficiency in L-PBF, outperforming conventional approaches.

Abstract: Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) is a widely recognized additive manufacturing
technology for producing intricate metal components with exceptional accuracy.
A key challenge in L-PBF is the formation of complex microstructures affecting
product quality. We propose a physics-guided, machine-learning approach to
optimize scan paths for desired microstructure outcomes, such as equiaxed
grains. We utilized a phase-field method (PFM) to model crystalline grain
structure evolution. To reduce computational costs, we trained a surrogate
machine learning model, a 3D U-Net convolutional neural network, using
single-track phase-field simulations with various laser powers to predict
crystalline grain orientations based on initial microstructure and thermal
history. We investigated three scanning strategies across various hatch
spacings within a square domain, achieving a two-orders-of-magnitude speedup
using the surrogate model. To reduce trial and error in designing laser scan
toolpaths, we used deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to generate optimized scan
paths for target microstructure. Results from three cases demonstrate the DRL
approach's effectiveness. We integrated the surrogate 3D U-Net model into our
DRL environment to accelerate the reinforcement learning training process. The
reward function minimizes both aspect ratio and grain volume of the predicted
microstructure from the agent's scan path. The reinforcement learning algorithm
was benchmarked against conventional zigzag approach for smaller and larger
domains, showing machine learning methods' potential to enhance microstructure
control and computational efficiency in L-PBF optimization.

*Bohan Li,Zhihan Li,Haoran Wang,Hanglei Zhang,Yiwei Guo,Hankun Wang,Xie Chen,Kai Yu*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces DCAR, a dynamic chunk-wise autoregressive framework for speech synthesis, improving efficiency and intelligibility over traditional AR models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional AR speech synthesis models struggle with long sequences, leading to latency and quality issues, limiting real-time applications.

Method: DCAR uses a chunk-to-frame attention mechanism with multi-token prediction, dynamically adjusting token spans to reduce sequence dependency.

Result: DCAR achieves 72.27% intelligibility improvement and 2.61x speedup over traditional models.

Conclusion: DCAR is a versatile foundation for next-gen speech synthesis, addressing key limitations of AR models.

Abstract: Recently, autoregressive (AR) language models have emerged as a dominant
approach in speech synthesis, offering expressive generation and scalable
training. However, conventional AR speech synthesis models relying on the
next-token prediction paradigm often encounter significant challenges when
handling long speech sequences. These models often struggle to construct stable
frame-to-frame attention, leading to increased latency and degraded synthesis
quality, thereby limiting their feasibility for real-time applications. To
address these limitations, we introduce a novel dynamic chunk-wise
autoregressive synthesis framework, termed DCAR, designed to enhance both
efficiency and intelligibility robustness in AR speech generation. DCAR
introduces a chunk-to-frame attention mechanism through training with
multi-token prediction, enabling dynamic chunk prediction in variable speech
contexts using a lightweight module trained on-policy. DCAR dynamically adjusts
the token prediction span, significantly reducing the sequence length
dependency while obtaining high synthesis quality. Comprehensive empirical
evaluations demonstrate that DCAR substantially outperforms traditional
next-token prediction models, achieving up to 72.27% intelligibility
improvement and 2.61x inference speedup simultaneously on the test set.
Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive analysis to support it as a versatile
foundation for next-generation speech synthesis systems.

Motivation: To improve the accuracy of aligning human piano performances (audio) with loosely aligned MIDI files, addressing timing errors.

Method: A Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) processes unaligned piano rolls and spectrograms to estimate aligned piano rolls, trained on augmented MIDI data simulating human timing errors.

Result: The CRNN achieves 20% higher alignment accuracy than DTW, with further improvements when combined with DTW.

Conclusion: Neural networks, particularly CRNN, show promise in advancing MIDI-to-audio alignment, offering better accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a neural network approach for synchronizing audio
recordings of human piano performances with their corresponding loosely aligned
MIDI files. The task is addressed using a Convolutional Recurrent Neural
Network (CRNN) architecture, which effectively captures spectral and temporal
features by processing an unaligned piano roll and a spectrogram as inputs to
estimate the aligned piano roll. To train the network, we create a dataset of
piano pieces with augmented MIDI files that simulate common human timing
errors. The proposed model achieves up to 20% higher alignment accuracy than
the industry-standard Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method across various
tolerance windows. Furthermore, integrating DTW with the CRNN yields additional
improvements, offering enhanced robustness and consistency. These findings
demonstrate the potential of neural networks in advancing state-of-the-art
MIDI-to-audio alignment.

TL;DR: SUBARU introduces a low-power, sub-Nyquist sampling method for hearables, achieving GAN-like audio quality without GANs and enabling efficient SE in noisy conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address practical gaps in low-power hearable implementations, including ADC sampling/bit resolution impact, GAN-like quality without GANs, and sub-Nyquist signal processing.

Method: Proposes SUBARU: uses sub-Nyquist sampling/low bit resolution, virtual discriminators for audio quality, and wideband reconstruction for streaming SE.

Result: 3.31x power reduction, 1.74ms inference time, <13.77MB memory, and effective SE in noisy environments.

Conclusion: SUBARU offers a practical, efficient solution for hearable SE with low power and high-quality audio.

Abstract: Hearables are wearable computers that are worn on the ear. Bone conduction
microphones (BCMs) are used with air conduction microphones (ACMs) in hearables
as a supporting modality for multimodal speech enhancement (SE) in noisy
conditions. However, existing works don't consider the following practical
aspects for low-power implementations on hearables: (i) They do not explore how
lowering the sampling frequencies and bit resolutions in analog-to-digital
converters (ADCs) of hearables jointly impact low-power processing and
multimodal SE in terms of speech quality and intelligibility. (ii) They don't
discuss how GAN-like audio quality can be achieved without using actual GAN
discriminators. And (iii) They don't process signals from ACMs/BCMs at
sub-Nyquist sampling rate because, in their frameworks, they lack a wideband
reconstruction methodology from their narrowband parts. We propose SUBARU
(\textbf{Sub}-Nyquist \textbf{A}udio \textbf{R}esolution \textbf{U}psampling),
which achieves the following: SUBARU (i) intentionally uses sub-Nyquist
sampling and low bit resolution in ADCs, achieving a 3.31x reduction in power
consumption; (ii) introduces novel multi-scale and multi-period virtual
discriminators, which achieve GAN-like audio quality without using GANs'
adversarial training; and (iii) achieves streaming operations on mobile
platforms and SE in in-the-wild noisy conditions with an inference time of
1.74ms and a memory footprint of less than 13.77MB.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid development of QML raises security challenges, particularly in cloud-based and hybrid deployments, necessitating a study of unique adversarial threats.

Method: The chapter examines attack vectors like model stealing, data poisoning, and backdoor attacks, and proposes defenses such as noise-based watermarks, hardware-aware obfuscation, and adapted classical adversarial training.

Result: Key findings include vulnerabilities in QML systems and emerging defense strategies, though challenges like balancing noise and cross-platform attacks remain.

Conclusion: The paper provides a roadmap for building robust QML systems resilient to adversarial threats, highlighting open challenges for future research.

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) integrates quantum computing with classical
machine learning, primarily to solve classification, regression and generative
tasks. However, its rapid development raises critical security challenges in
the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. This chapter examines
adversarial threats unique to QML systems, focusing on vulnerabilities in
cloud-based deployments, hybrid architectures, and quantum generative models.
Key attack vectors include model stealing via transpilation or output
extraction, data poisoning through quantum-specific perturbations, reverse
engineering of proprietary variational quantum circuits, and backdoor attacks.
Adversaries exploit noise-prone quantum hardware and insufficiently secured
QML-as-a-Service (QMLaaS) workflows to compromise model integrity, ownership,
and functionality. Defense mechanisms leverage quantum properties to counter
these threats. Noise signatures from training hardware act as non-invasive
watermarks, while hardware-aware obfuscation techniques and ensemble strategies
disrupt cloning attempts. Emerging solutions also adapt classical adversarial
training and differential privacy to quantum settings, addressing
vulnerabilities in quantum neural networks and generative architectures.
However, securing QML requires addressing open challenges such as balancing
noise levels for reliability and security, mitigating cross-platform attacks,
and developing quantum-classical trust frameworks. This chapter summarizes
recent advances in attacks and defenses, offering a roadmap for researchers and
practitioners to build robust, trustworthy QML systems resilient to evolving
adversarial landscapes.

Motivation: To explore the untapped potential of Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) in quantum machine learning by integrating them with quantum circuits.

Method: Implemented KANs in hybrid (classical-quantum) and fully quantum forms using Quantum Circuit Born Machine (QCBM), adapting KAN transfer with pre-trained residual functions.

Result: Demonstrated feasibility, interpretability, and performance of QuKAN architectures.

Conclusion: QuKANs show promise in quantum machine learning by combining KANs' efficiency with quantum representational power.

Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs), built upon the Kolmogorov Arnold
representation theorem (KAR), have demonstrated promising capabilities in
expressing complex functions with fewer neurons. This is achieved by
implementing learnable parameters on the edges instead of on the nodes, unlike
traditional networks such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). However, KANs
potential in quantum machine learning has not yet been well explored. In this
work, we present an implementation of these KAN architectures in both hybrid
and fully quantum forms using a Quantum Circuit Born Machine (QCBM). We adapt
the KAN transfer using pre-trained residual functions, thereby exploiting the
representational power of parametrized quantum circuits. In the hybrid model we
combine classical KAN components with quantum subroutines, while the fully
quantum version the entire architecture of the residual function is translated
to a quantum model. We demonstrate the feasibility, interpretability and
performance of the proposed Quantum KAN (QuKAN) architecture.

TL;DR: Recurrent and recurrence-free quantum reservoir computers (QRCs) are robust for learning chaotic dynamics from time-series data, leveraging generalized synchronization and noise resilience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate the effectiveness of QRCs in learning and forecasting chaotic dynamics, including invariant properties, and to design robust quantum machines for near-term hardware.

Method: Formulate QRCs as coupled dynamical systems, derive the Jacobian for analysis, and use generalized synchronization to design robust architectures. Propose the GS=ESP criterion for recurrence-free QRCs.

Result: QRCs successfully learn chaotic dynamics and invariant properties. Noise dissipation enhances robustness, and RF-QRCs fulfill GS=ESP by design.

Conclusion: QRCs are promising for chaotic time-series forecasting on near-term quantum hardware, with noise resilience and robust design principles.

Abstract: We show that recurrent quantum reservoir computers (QRCs) and their
recurrence-free architectures (RF-QRCs) are robust tools for learning and
forecasting chaotic dynamics from time-series data. First, we formulate and
interpret quantum reservoir computers as coupled dynamical systems, where the
reservoir acts as a response system driven by training data; in other words,
quantum reservoir computers are generalized-synchronization (GS) systems.
Second, we show that quantum reservoir computers can learn chaotic dynamics and
their invariant properties, such as Lyapunov spectra, attractor dimensions, and
geometric properties such as the covariant Lyapunov vectors. This analysis is
enabled by deriving the Jacobian of the quantum reservoir update. Third, by
leveraging tools from generalized synchronization, we provide a method for
designing robust quantum reservoir computers. We propose the criterion
$GS=ESP$: GS implies the echo state property (ESP), and vice versa. We
analytically show that RF-QRCs, by design, fulfill $GS=ESP$. Finally, we
analyze the effect of simulated noise. We find that dissipation from noise
enhances the robustness of quantum reservoir computers. Numerical verifications
on systems of different dimensions support our conclusions. This work opens
opportunities for designing robust quantum machines for chaotic time series
forecasting on near-term quantum hardware.

*Yingzhi He,Xiaohao Liu,An Zhang,Yunshan Ma,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: LLM2Rec integrates large language models (LLMs) with collaborative filtering (CF) signals for sequential recommendation, improving both in-domain and out-of-domain performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ID-based embeddings lack transferable knowledge, while text-based methods miss CF signals. An ideal model should combine both.

Method: LLM2Rec uses a two-stage training framework: (1) Collaborative Supervised Fine-tuning to adapt LLMs for item relationships, and (2) Item-level Embedding Modeling to encode semantic and collaborative information.

Result: Experiments show LLM2Rec improves recommendation quality in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings.

Conclusion: LLM2Rec demonstrates the potential of LLMs for robust, generalizable sequential recommendation.

Abstract: Sequential recommendation aims to predict users' future interactions by
modeling collaborative filtering (CF) signals from historical behaviors of
similar users or items. Traditional sequential recommenders predominantly rely
on ID-based embeddings, which capture CF signals through high-order
co-occurrence patterns. However, these embeddings depend solely on past
interactions, lacking transferable knowledge to generalize to unseen domains.
Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have motivated text-based
recommendation approaches that derive item representations from textual
descriptions. While these methods enhance generalization, they fail to encode
CF signals-i.e., latent item correlations and preference patterns-crucial for
effective recommendation. We argue that an ideal embedding model should
seamlessly integrate CF signals with rich semantic representations to improve
both in-domain and out-of-domain recommendation performance.
  To this end, we propose LLM2Rec, a novel embedding model tailored for
sequential recommendation, integrating the rich semantic understanding of LLMs
with CF awareness. Our approach follows a two-stage training framework: (1)
Collaborative Supervised Fine-tuning, which adapts LLMs to infer item
relationships based on historical interactions, and (2) Item-level Embedding
Modeling, which refines these specialized LLMs into structured item embedding
models that encode both semantic and collaborative information. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that LLM2Rec effectively
improves recommendation quality across both in-domain and out-of-domain
settings. Our findings highlight the potential of leveraging LLMs to build more
robust, generalizable embedding models for sequential recommendation. Our codes

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight how benchmark features like topic diversity and semantic complexity can mislead assessments of domain adaptation in retrieval models.

Method: Fine-tuned ColBERTv2 on Environmental Impact Statements (EIS) and evaluated across two benchmarks with differing semantic structures.

Result: Identical domain adaptation showed small improvements (0.61% NDCG) on one benchmark but large gains (2.22% NDCG) on another, a 3.6-fold difference.

Conclusion: Benchmark selection critically impacts retrieval system assessments, with overlapping semantic boundaries better reflecting real-world complexity.

Abstract: Evaluation benchmark characteristics may distort the true benefits of domain
adaptation in retrieval models. This creates misleading assessments that
influence deployment decisions in specialized domains. We show that two
benchmarks with drastically different features such as topic diversity,
boundary overlap, and semantic complexity can influence the perceived benefits
of fine-tuning. Using environmental regulatory document retrieval as a case
study, we fine-tune ColBERTv2 model on Environmental Impact Statements (EIS)
from federal agencies. We evaluate these models across two benchmarks with
different semantic structures. Our findings reveal that identical domain
adaptation approaches show very different perceived benefits depending on
evaluation methodology. On one benchmark, with clearly separated topic
boundaries, domain adaptation shows small improvements (maximum 0.61% NDCG
gain). However, on the other benchmark with overlapping semantic structures,
the same models demonstrate large improvements (up to 2.22% NDCG gain), a
3.6-fold difference in the performance benefit. We compare these benchmarks
through topic diversity metrics, finding that the higher-performing benchmark
shows 11% higher average cosine distances between contexts and 23% lower
silhouette scores, directly contributing to the observed performance
difference. These results demonstrate that benchmark selection strongly
determines assessments of retrieval system effectiveness in specialized
domains. Evaluation frameworks with well-separated topics regularly
underestimate domain adaptation benefits, while those with overlapping semantic
boundaries reveal improvements that better reflect real-world regulatory
document complexity. Our findings have important implications for developing
and deploying AI systems for interdisciplinary domains that integrate multiple
topics.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Refine-POI is a reinforcement fine-tuning framework for next POI recommendation, addressing the mismatch in SFT-based models by using recommendation-driven rewards to generate top-k lists with single ground-truth POIs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The mismatch between next POI recommendation data and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) methods, where SFT models struggle to produce top-k lists due to single ground-truth POIs per example.

Method: Proposes Refine-POI, a reinforcement fine-tuning framework with recommendation-driven rewards to train LLMs for top-k recommendations using single ground-truth POIs.

Result: Refine-POI achieves state-of-the-art top-k recommendation performance on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Refine-POI effectively bridges the gap in SFT-based models for next POI recommendation, enabling accurate top-k list generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been adopted for next point-of-interest
(POI) recommendation tasks. Typical LLM-based recommenders fall into two
categories: prompt-based and supervised fine-tuning (SFT)-based models.
Prompt-based models generally offer greater output flexibility but deliver
lower accuracy, whereas SFT-based models achieve higher performance yet face a
fundamental mismatch: next POI recommendation data does not naturally suit
supervised fine-tuning. In SFT, the model is trained to reproduce the exact
ground truth, but each training example provides only a single target POI, so
there is no ground truth for producing a top-k list.
  To address this, we propose Refine-POI, a reinforcement fine-tuning framework
for next POI recommendation. We introduce recommendation-driven rewards that
enable LLMs to learn to generate top-k recommendation lists using only one
ground-truth POI per example. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate
that Refine-POI achieves state-of-the-art top-k recommendation performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation frameworks lack trustworthiness, limiting enterprise adoption of multimodal AI.

Method: Introduces a systematic benchmarking framework to measure trustworthiness by integrating text, images, captions, and OCR in VisualRAG systems.

Result: Optimal modality weighting (30% text, 15% image, 25% caption, 30% OCR) boosts performance by 57.3% over text-only baselines.

Conclusion: The framework enhances trustworthiness in multimodal RAG, supporting responsible AI deployment for enterprise applications.

Abstract: Current evaluation frameworks for multimodal generative AI struggle to
establish trustworthiness, hindering enterprise adoption where reliability is
paramount. We introduce a systematic, quantitative benchmarking framework to
measure the trustworthiness of progressively integrating cross-modal inputs
such as text, images, captions, and OCR within VisualRAG systems for enterprise
document intelligence. Our approach establishes quantitative relationships

that optimal modality weighting with weights of 30% text, 15% image, 25%
caption, and 30% OCR improves performance by 57.3% over text-only baselines
while maintaining computational efficiency. We provide comparative assessments
of foundation models, demonstrating their differential impact on
trustworthiness in caption generation and OCR extraction-a vital consideration
for reliable enterprise AI. This work advances responsible AI deployment by
providing a rigorous framework for quantifying and enhancing trustworthiness in
multimodal RAG for critical enterprise applications.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: A novel framework for recommender systems balances relevance and diversity using Bayesian updates and multi-objective optimization, improving user experience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing content homogeneity and reduced user engagement in recommender systems by balancing relevance and diversity.

Method: Multi-objective, contextual sequential sampling with Bayesian updates, diversity metrics, and dominance-based ranking for Pareto-optimal item sets.

Result: Significant improvement in diversity without sacrificing relevance, validated on real-world data.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances user experience in large-scale recommendations by optimizing diversity and relevance.

Abstract: The challenge of balancing user relevance and content diversity in
recommender systems is increasingly critical amid growing concerns about
content homogeneity and reduced user engagement. In this work, we propose a
novel framework that leverages a multi-objective, contextual sequential
sampling strategy. Item selection is guided by Bayesian updates that
dynamically adjust scores to optimize diversity. The reward formulation
integrates multiple diversity metrics-including the log-determinant volume of a
tuned similarity submatrix and ridge leverage scores-along with a diversity
gain uncertainty term to address the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Both
intra- and inter-batch diversity are modeled to promote serendipity and
minimize redundancy. A dominance-based ranking procedure identifies
Pareto-optimal item sets, enabling adaptive and balanced selections at each
iteration. Experiments on a real-world dataset show that our approach
significantly improves diversity without sacrificing relevance, demonstrating
its potential to enhance user experience in large-scale recommendation
settings.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: DCN^2 improves DCNv2 with three algorithmic enhancements, outperforming it in live recommender systems and benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of DCNv2, such as information loss and collision management, to enhance recommender system performance.

Method: Introduces three improvements: mitigating Cross layer information loss, learnable lookup-level weights, and explicit pairwise similarity modeling.

Result: DCN^2 outperforms DCNv2 in live systems (0.5B predictions/sec) and public benchmarks.

Conclusion: DCN^2 is a superior, scalable alternative to DCNv2, addressing its key limitations effectively.

Abstract: The Deep and Cross architecture (DCNv2) is a robust production baseline and
is integral to numerous real-life recommender systems. Its inherent efficiency
and ability to model interactions often result in models that are both simpler
and highly competitive compared to more computationally demanding alternatives,
such as Deep FFMs. In this work, we introduce three significant algorithmic
improvements to the DCNv2 architecture, detailing their formulation and
behavior at scale. The enhanced architecture we refer to as DCN^2 is actively
used in a live recommender system, processing over 0.5 billion predictions per
second across diverse use cases where it out-performed DCNv2, both offline and
online (ab tests). These improvements effectively address key limitations
observed in the DCNv2, including information loss in Cross layers, implicit
management of collisions through learnable lookup-level weights, and explicit
modeling of pairwise similarities with a custom layer that emulates FFMs'
behavior. The superior performance of DCN^2 is also demonstrated on four
publicly available benchmark data sets.

*Tao Feng,Zhigang Hua,Zijie Lei,Yan Xie,Shuang Yang,Bo Long,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: IRanker is a ranking foundation model using RL and iterative decoding to unify ranking tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results and strong generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify diverse ranking tasks (e.g., recommendation, routing) with a single model, despite the lack of clear supervision labels.

Method: Proposes IRanker, a framework combining reinforcement learning (RL) and iterative decoding to decompose ranking into stepwise elimination of the worst candidate.

Result: IRanker-3B outperforms similar-sized models, surpasses larger models in some cases, and shows strong in-domain and out-of-domain generalization.

Conclusion: IRanker effectively unifies ranking tasks, demonstrates robust performance, and enhances LLM capabilities through its iterative mechanism.

Abstract: Ranking tasks are ubiquitous, encompassing applications such as
recommendation systems, LLM routing, and item re-ranking. We propose to unify
these tasks using a single ranking foundation model (FM), as it eliminates the
need for designing different models for each specific ranking task. However,
unlike general supervision tasks in LLMs, ranking tasks do not have clear
labels for supervision, posing great challenges to developing a ranking FM. To
overcome these challenges, we propose IRanker, a ranking FM framework with
reinforcement learning (RL) and iterative decoding. Our insight is to decompose
the complex ranking task into an iterative decoding process that eliminates the
worst candidate from the candidate pool step by step, which significantly
reduces the output combinatorial space and better utilizes the limited context
length during RL training. We meticulously train and comprehensively evaluate
an IRanker-3B model on nine datasets across three scenarios: recommendation,
routing, and passage ranking. The results show that a single IRanker-3B
achieves state-of-the-art results on several datasets compared to models of
similar size, and even surpasses the performance of larger models on certain
datasets. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our RL design and the
robustness of the iterative mechanism across different LLM sizes. Moreover, we
conducted both in-domain and out-of-domain zero-shot generalization
experiments, which showed that IRanker-3B achieved good generalization on
in-domain ranking tasks compared to the base LLM by at least 5% improvement.
Surprisingly, on out-of-domain generic LLM tasks, IRanker-3B outperformed the
base model by at least 9% on GSM8K, IFEval, and MathQA. In addition, the
thoughts generated by IRanker-3B during training could further enhance
zero-shot LLM performance.

*Duong Bach*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: HPC-ColPali improves ColPali's efficiency with hierarchical patch compression, reducing storage and computational costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high storage and computational costs of multi-vector retrieval systems like ColPali without sacrificing retrieval accuracy.

Method: Integrates K-Means quantization, attention-guided dynamic pruning, and optional binary encoding to compress and optimize patch embeddings.

Result: Achieves 30-50% lower query latency, reduces hallucination rates by 30%, and halves end-to-end latency in legal summarization.

Conclusion: HPC-ColPali is a scalable, efficient solution for multi-vector document retrieval, balancing performance and resource constraints.

Abstract: Multi-vector document retrieval systems, such as ColPali, excel in
fine-grained matching for complex queries but incur significant storage and
computational costs due to their reliance on high-dimensional patch embeddings
and late-interaction scoring. To address these challenges, we propose
HPC-ColPali, a Hierarchical Patch Compression framework that enhances the
efficiency of ColPali while preserving its retrieval accuracy. Our approach
integrates three innovative techniques: (1) K-Means quantization, which
compresses patch embeddings into 1-byte centroid indices, achieving up to
32$\times$ storage reduction; (2) attention-guided dynamic pruning, utilizing
Vision-Language Model attention weights to retain only the top-$p\%$ most
salient patches, reducing late-interaction computation by up to 60\% with less
than 2\% nDCG@10 loss; and (3) optional binary encoding of centroid indices
into $b$-bit strings ($b=\lceil\log_2 K\rceil$), enabling rapid Hamming
distance-based similarity search for resource-constrained environments.
Evaluated on the ViDoRe and SEC-Filings datasets, HPC-ColPali achieves 30--50\%
lower query latency under HNSW indexing while maintaining high retrieval
precision. When integrated into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline for
legal summarization, it reduces hallucination rates by 30\% and halves
end-to-end latency. These advancements establish HPC-ColPali as a scalable and
efficient solution for multi-vector document retrieval across diverse
applications. Code is available at https://github.com/DngBack/HPC-ColPali.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: CAL-RAG is a retrieval-augmented, agentic framework for automated layout generation, combining multimodal retrieval, LLMs, and collaborative agents to improve semantic alignment and visual coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches lack grounding in contextual design exemplars and struggle with semantic alignment and visual coherence in layout generation.

Method: CAL-RAG integrates multimodal retrieval, LLM-based layout recommendations, vision-language grading, and feedback-driven refinements for iterative improvement.

Result: CAL-RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PKU PosterLayout dataset, outperforming baselines like LayoutPrompter in metrics like underlay effectiveness and element alignment.

Conclusion: Combining retrieval augmentation with agentic reasoning provides a scalable, interpretable, and high-fidelity solution for automated layout generation.

Abstract: Automated content-aware layout generation -- the task of arranging visual
elements such as text, logos, and underlays on a background canvas -- remains a
fundamental yet under-explored problem in intelligent design systems. While
recent advances in deep generative models and large language models (LLMs) have
shown promise in structured content generation, most existing approaches lack
grounding in contextual design exemplars and fall short in handling semantic
alignment and visual coherence. In this work we introduce CAL-RAG, a
retrieval-augmented, agentic framework for content-aware layout generation that
integrates multimodal retrieval, large language models, and collaborative
agentic reasoning. Our system retrieves relevant layout examples from a
structured knowledge base and invokes an LLM-based layout recommender to
propose structured element placements. A vision-language grader agent evaluates
the layout with visual metrics, and a feedback agent provides targeted
refinements, enabling iterative improvement. We implement our framework using
LangGraph and evaluate it on the PKU PosterLayout dataset, a benchmark rich in
semantic and structural variability. CAL-RAG achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple layout metrics -- including underlay effectiveness,
element alignment, and overlap -- substantially outperforming strong baselines
such as LayoutPrompter. These results demonstrate that combining retrieval
augmentation with agentic multi-step reasoning yields a scalable,
interpretable, and high-fidelity solution for automated layout generation.

TL;DR: ARAG enhances recommendation systems by integrating multi-agent collaboration into RAG, outperforming standard methods with significant improvements in metrics like NDCG@5 and Hit@5.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG-based approaches lack dynamic user preference capture in recommendations, prompting the need for a more nuanced framework like ARAG.

Method: ARAG employs four specialized LLM-based agents to analyze user behavior, evaluate semantic alignment, summarize findings, and rank recommendations.

Result: ARAG achieves up to 42.1% improvement in NDCG@5 and 35.5% in Hit@5 compared to standard RAG and recency-based baselines.

Conclusion: ARAG demonstrates the effectiveness of agentic reasoning in retrieval-augmented recommendation, offering new directions for LLM-based personalization.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown promise in enhancing
recommendation systems by incorporating external context into large language
model prompts. However, existing RAG-based approaches often rely on static
retrieval heuristics and fail to capture nuanced user preferences in dynamic
recommendation scenarios. In this work, we introduce ARAG, an Agentic
Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework for Personalized Recommendation, which
integrates a multi-agent collaboration mechanism into the RAG pipeline. To
better understand the long-term and session behavior of the user, ARAG
leverages four specialized LLM-based agents: a User Understanding Agent that
summarizes user preferences from long-term and session contexts, a Natural
Language Inference (NLI) Agent that evaluates semantic alignment between
candidate items retrieved by RAG and inferred intent, a context summary agent
that summarizes the findings of NLI agent, and an Item Ranker Agent that
generates a ranked list of recommendations based on contextual fit. We evaluate
ARAG accross three datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that ARAG
significantly outperforms standard RAG and recency-based baselines, achieving
up to 42.1% improvement in NDCG@5 and 35.5% in Hit@5. We also, conduct an
ablation study to analyse the effect by different components of ARAG. Our
findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating agentic reasoning into
retrieval-augmented recommendation and provide new directions for LLM-based
personalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hybrid retrieval methods are understudied in Chinese contexts despite their potential for performance enhancement.

Method: HyReC integrates semantic term union, uses GLAE for consistent semantic sharing, and includes a Normalization Module (NM) for alignment.

Result: Evaluated on the C-MTEB benchmark, HyReC demonstrates effectiveness.

Conclusion: HyReC offers a tailored solution for hybrid retrieval in Chinese, improving performance through innovative integration and alignment techniques.

Abstract: Hybrid-based retrieval methods, which unify dense-vector and lexicon-based
retrieval, have garnered considerable attention in the industry due to
performance enhancement. However, despite their promising results, the
application of these hybrid paradigms in Chinese retrieval contexts has
remained largely underexplored. In this paper, we introduce HyReC, an
innovative end-to-end optimization method tailored specifically for
hybrid-based retrieval in Chinese. HyReC enhances performance by integrating
the semantic union of terms into the representation model. Additionally, it
features the Global-Local-Aware Encoder (GLAE) to promote consistent semantic
sharing between lexicon-based and dense retrieval while minimizing the
interference between them. To further refine alignment, we incorporate a
Normalization Module (NM) that fosters mutual benefits between the retrieval
approaches. Finally, we evaluate HyReC on the C-MTEB retrieval benchmark to
demonstrate its effectiveness.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Idea Novelty Checker, an LLM-based RAG framework for automated evaluation of idea novelty, outperforming existing methods by 13% in agreement with expert evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual novelty evaluation is labor-intensive and subjective, necessitating an automated solution.

Method: A two-stage retrieve-then-rerank approach: broad retrieval followed by embedding-based filtering and facet-based LLM re-ranking, guided by expert-labeled examples.

Result: Achieves ~13% higher agreement with expert evaluations than existing methods, with facet-based re-ranking proving crucial.

Conclusion: The Idea Novelty Checker effectively automates novelty evaluation, improving accuracy and scalability.

Abstract: Automated scientific idea generation systems have made remarkable progress,
yet the automatic evaluation of idea novelty remains a critical and
underexplored challenge. Manual evaluation of novelty through literature review
is labor-intensive, prone to error due to subjectivity, and impractical at
scale. To address these issues, we propose the Idea Novelty Checker, an
LLM-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that leverages a
two-stage retrieve-then-rerank approach. The Idea Novelty Checker first
collects a broad set of relevant papers using keyword and snippet-based
retrieval, then refines this collection through embedding-based filtering
followed by facet-based LLM re-ranking. It incorporates expert-labeled examples
to guide the system in comparing papers for novelty evaluation and in
generating literature-grounded reasoning. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that our novelty checker achieves approximately 13% higher agreement than
existing approaches. Ablation studies further showcases the importance of the
facet-based re-ranker in identifying the most relevant literature for novelty
evaluation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel gender fairness metric, CWEx, using LLMs to detect and measure gender bias in passage ranking, outperforming existing metrics and aligning better with human labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing social biases in NLP and IR systems by improving the detection and evaluation of gender bias in passage ranking.

Method: Leverages LLMs for bias detection, introduces CWEx metric, and annotates the MS MARCO dataset to create MSMGenderBias for evaluation.

Result: CWEx provides a more detailed fairness evaluation, with improved alignment to human labels (58.77% for Grep-BiasIR, 18.51% for MSMGenderBias).

Conclusion: The work offers a robust framework for analyzing and mitigating bias in IR systems through LLM-driven detection, improved metrics, and annotated datasets.

Abstract: The presence of social biases in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and
Information Retrieval (IR) systems is an ongoing challenge, which underlines
the importance of developing robust approaches to identifying and evaluating
such biases. In this paper, we aim to address this issue by leveraging Large
Language Models (LLMs) to detect and measure gender bias in passage ranking.
Existing gender fairness metrics rely on lexical- and frequency-based measures,
leading to various limitations, e.g., missing subtle gender disparities.
Building on our LLM-based gender bias detection method, we introduce a novel
gender fairness metric, named Class-wise Weighted Exposure (CWEx), aiming to
address existing limitations. To measure the effectiveness of our proposed
metric and study LLMs' effectiveness in detecting gender bias, we annotate a
subset of the MS MARCO Passage Ranking collection and release our new gender
bias collection, called MSMGenderBias, to foster future research in this area.
Our extensive experimental results on various ranking models show that our
proposed metric offers a more detailed evaluation of fairness compared to
previous metrics, with improved alignment to human labels (58.77% for
Grep-BiasIR, and 18.51% for MSMGenderBias, measured using Cohen's Kappa
agreement), effectively distinguishing gender bias in ranking. By integrating
LLM-driven bias detection, an improved fairness metric, and gender bias
annotations for an established dataset, this work provides a more robust
framework for analyzing and mitigating bias in IR systems.

*Stanley Wu,Ronik Bhaskar,Anna Yoo Jeong Ha,Shawn Shan,Haitao Zheng,Ben Y. Zhao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores adversarial mislabeling attacks on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to poison text-to-image model training pipelines, showing high vulnerability and real-world effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the feasibility of using adversarial attacks on VLMs to inject incorrect captions into training data, thereby altering text-to-image model behavior.

Method: Experiments demonstrating VLMs' vulnerability to adversarial perturbations, producing miscaptioned images that poison training pipelines.

Result: Attackers can inject 'dirty-label' poison samples, altering model behavior with few poisoned samples, achieving over 73% success in black-box scenarios.

Conclusion: Adversarial attacks on VLMs pose a significant threat to text-to-image model training, likely increasing costs and reducing data quality, with defenses being circumventable.

Abstract: Today's text-to-image generative models are trained on millions of images
sourced from the Internet, each paired with a detailed caption produced by
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). This part of the training pipeline is critical
for supplying the models with large volumes of high-quality image-caption pairs
during training. However, recent work suggests that VLMs are vulnerable to
stealthy adversarial attacks, where adversarial perturbations are added to
images to mislead the VLMs into producing incorrect captions.
  In this paper, we explore the feasibility of adversarial mislabeling attacks
on VLMs as a mechanism to poisoning training pipelines for text-to-image
models. Our experiments demonstrate that VLMs are highly vulnerable to
adversarial perturbations, allowing attackers to produce benign-looking images
that are consistently miscaptioned by the VLM models. This has the effect of
injecting strong "dirty-label" poison samples into the training pipeline for
text-to-image models, successfully altering their behavior with a small number
of poisoned samples. We find that while potential defenses can be effective,
they can be targeted and circumvented by adaptive attackers. This suggests a
cat-and-mouse game that is likely to reduce the quality of training data and
increase the cost of text-to-image model development. Finally, we demonstrate
the real-world effectiveness of these attacks, achieving high attack success
(over 73%) even in black-box scenarios against commercial VLMs (Google Vertex
AI and Microsoft Azure).

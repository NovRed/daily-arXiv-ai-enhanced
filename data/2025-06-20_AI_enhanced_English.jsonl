They also require human grounding in multi-modal environments, which can be ad-hoc, rigid, and brittle. Neural networks are good at extracting rich contextual information from multi-modal data, but lack interpretable structures for reasoning.\n  Objectives: CALM aims to bridge the gap between logic and neural perception, creating an analog logic that can reason over multi-modal inputs. Without this integration, AI systems remain either brittle or unstructured, unable to generalize robustly to real-world tasks. In CALM, symbolic predicates evaluate to analog truth values computed by neural networks and constrained search.\n  Methods: CALM represents each predicate using a domain tree, which iteratively refines its analog truth value when the contextual groundings of its entities are determined. The iterative refinement is predicted by neural networks capable of capturing multi-modal information and is filtered through a symbolic reasoning module to ensure constraint satisfaction.\n  Results: In fill-in-the-blank object placement tasks, CALM achieved 92.2% accuracy, outperforming classical logic (86.3%) and LLM (59.4%) baselines.

Our approach is grounded in the insight that credible documents tend to exhibit higher semantic coherence with other credible documents, enabling automated credibility estimation through inter-document agreement. To incorporate credibility into LLM inference, we propose two integration strategies: a black-box approach for models without access to internal weights or activations, and a white-box method that directly modifies attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments across three model architectures and five datasets demonstrate that CrEst consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to a 26.86% improvement in accuracy and a 3.49% increase in F1 score.

First, we propose the Mask Separated Self-Attention mechanism that enables the integration of the denoising process into a DETR architecture. This improves the stability of Hungarian matching to achieve a consistent optimization objective. Second, we present the Variational Query Denoising technique to address the gradient vanishing problem of conventional denoising methods, which severely restricts the efficiency of the denoising process.

A conventional approach to mitigate this issue involves storing items with homogeneous characteristics in a single lane, but this strategy restricts the flexibility and adaptability of multi-deep storage systems.\n  In this study, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based framework to address the retrieval problem in multi-deep storage systems with heterogeneous item configurations.

The GNN encodes topological and item-specific information into embeddings for all directly accessible items, while the Transformer maps these embeddings into global priority assignments.

Directly prompting MLLMs to perform this complex task often yields unsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, we propose {ChartIR}, an iterative refinement method based on structured instruction. First, we distinguish two tasks: visual understanding and code translation.

The description instruction captures the visual elements of the reference chart, while the difference instruction characterizes the discrepancies between the reference chart and the generated chart. These instructions effectively transform visual features into language representations, thereby facilitating the subsequent code translation process. Second, we decompose the overall chart generation pipeline into two stages: initial code generation and iterative refinement, enabling progressive enhancement of the final output.

Previous work on games with LLM agents has taken an ad hoc approach to encoding game history, which not only obscures the impact of state representation on agents' behavior, but also limits comparability between studies. Our framework addresses these gaps by characterizing methods of state representation along three axes: action informativeness (i.e., the extent to which the state representation captures actions played); reward informativeness (i.e., the extent to which the state representation describes rewards obtained); and prompting style (or natural language compression, i.e., the extent to which the full text history is summarized).\n  We apply this framework to a dynamic selfish routing game, chosen because it admits a simple equilibrium both in theory and in human subject experiments \\cite{rapoport_choice_2009}. Despite the game's relative simplicity, we find that there are key dependencies of LLM agent behavior on the natural language state representation. In particular, we observe that representations which provide agents with (1) summarized, rather than complete, natural language representations of past history; (2) information about regrets, rather than raw payoffs; and (3) limited information about others' actions lead to behavior that more closely matches game theoretic equilibrium predictions, and with more stable game play by the agents.

How can an AI system determine which viewpoint offers the most valuable insight for accurate and efficient 3D object reconstruction? Active view selection (AVS) for 3D reconstruction remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. The aim is to identify the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D reconstruction. Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian Splatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each candidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural uncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network, named UPNet. UPNet takes a single input image of a 3D object and outputs a predicted uncertainty map, representing uncertainty values across all possible candidate viewpoints. By leveraging heuristics derived from observing many natural objects and their associated uncertainty patterns, we train UPNet to learn a direct mapping from viewpoint appearance to uncertainty in the underlying volumetric representations.

First, long-term memory is supported by a sparse subset of channels within the model's selective state space block, which persistently encode early input tokens and are causally linked to primacy effects.

To address this limitation, we can use a wider range of satellite data to make more full use of its inversion effects on various meteorological variables, thus producing more realistic results across different meteorological variables. To further improve the accuracy of downscaling meteorological variables at any location, we propose the Multi-source Observation Down-Scaling Model (MODS). It is a conditional diffusion model that fuses data from multiple geostationary satellites GridSat, polar-orbiting satellites (AMSU-A, HIRS, and MHS), and topographic data (GEBCO), as conditions, and is pre-trained on the ERA5 reanalysis dataset. During training, latent features from diverse conditional inputs are extracted separately and fused into ERA5 maps via a multi-source cross-attention module. By exploiting the inversion relationships between reanalysis data and multi-source atmospheric variables, MODS generates atmospheric states that align more closely with real-world conditions. During sampling, MODS enhances downscaling consistency by incorporating low-resolution ERA5 maps and station-level meteorological data as guidance. Experimental results demonstrate that MODS achieves higher fidelity when downscaling ERA5 maps to a 6.25 km resolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes MODS, a multi-source data fusion model, to improve downscaling accuracy of meteorological variables by integrating diverse satellite and topographic data.", "motivation": "Existing downscaling methods relying solely on geostationary satellite data fail to capture all meteorological changes, limiting accuracy.", "method": "MODS is a conditional diffusion model that fuses data from multiple satellites and topography, pre-trained on ERA5, using multi-source cross-attention for feature fusion.", "result": "MODS achieves higher fidelity in downscaling ERA5 maps to 6.25 km resolution compared to existing methods.", "conclusion": "MODS enhances downscaling accuracy by leveraging multi-source data, producing more realistic meteorological conditions."}}

Three key fusion modules are also integrated to process medical images from different modalities adaptively. Ultimately, the robust network structure and a hybrid loss function are integrated to harmonize the fused image's brightness, color, contrast, and detail, enhancing its quality and information density.

This paper introduces Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach.

A key challenge lies in the lack of reliable, scalable RL reward signals across diverse reasoning domains. We introduce Guru, a curated RL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning domains--Math, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabular--each built through domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering to ensure reliability and effectiveness for RL training. Based on Guru, we systematically revisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant variation across domains. For example, while prior work suggests that RL primarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal a more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code, Science) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with limited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain training to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely to facilitate genuine skill acquisition.

While previous works have explored representation learning for this task, the critical challenge of training instability in sequential representations and its detrimental impact on policy performance has been overlooked. This work demonstrates that Controlled Differential Equations (CDE) state representation can achieve strong RL policies when two key factors are met: (1) ensuring training stability through early stopping or stabilization methods, and (2) enforcing acuity-aware representations by correlation regularization with clinical scores (SOFA, SAPS-II, OASIS). Experiments on the MIMIC-III sepsis cohort reveal that stable CDE autoencoder produces representations strongly correlated with acuity scores and enables RL policies with superior performance (WIS return $> 0.9$).

However, the crucial choice of window size presents a Pareto tradeoff: larger windows maintain performance akin to full attention but offer minimal efficiency gains in short-context scenarios, while smaller windows can lead to performance degradation. Current models, such as Gemma2 and Mistral, adopt conservative window sizes (e.g., 4096 out of an 8192 pretraining length) to preserve performance. This work investigates strategies to shift this Pareto frontier, enabling local-global models to achieve efficiency gains even in short-context regimes. Our core motivation is to address the intrinsic limitation of local attention -- its complete disregard for tokens outside the defined window. We explore RATTENTION, a variant of local attention integrated with a specialized linear attention mechanism designed to capture information from these out-of-window tokens. Pretraining experiments at the 3B and 12B scales demonstrate that RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between performance and efficiency. As a sweet spot, RATTENTION with a window size of just 512 consistently matches the performance of full-attention models across diverse settings. Furthermore, the recurrent nature inherent in the linear attention component of RATTENTION contributes to enhanced long-context performance, as validated on the RULER benchmark.

However, the diversity of model implementations and training strategies across recent TFMs, though promising, makes it challenging to isolate the contribution of individual design choices or evaluate their potential synergies. This hinders the field's ability to converge on best practices and limits the reproducibility of insights across studies. We present BMFM-RNA, an open-source, modular software package that unifies diverse TFM pretraining and fine-tuning objectives within a single framework. Leveraging this capability, we introduce a novel training objective, whole cell expression decoder (WCED), which captures global expression patterns using an autoencoder-like CLS bottleneck representation. In this paper, we describe the framework, supported input representations, and training objectives. We evaluated four model checkpoints pretrained on CELLxGENE using combinations of masked language modeling (MLM), WCED and multitask learning. Using the benchmarking capabilities of BMFM-RNA, we show that WCED-based models achieve performance that matches or exceeds state-of-the-art approaches like scGPT across more than a dozen datasets in both zero-shot and fine-tuning tasks.

While previous works showed that the problem of optimal vaccination is closely linked to the NP-hard Spectral Radius Minimization (SRM) problem, they assumed that the graph is known, which is often not the case in practice. In this work, we consider the problem of minimizing the extinction time of an outbreak modeled by an SIS model where the graph on which the disease spreads is unknown and only the infection states of the vertices are observed. To this end, we split the problem into two: learning the graph and determining effective vaccination strategies. We propose a novel inclusion-exclusion-based learning algorithm and, unlike previous approaches, establish its sample complexity for graph recovery. We then detail an optimal algorithm for the SRM problem and prove that its running time is polynomial in the number of vertices for graphs with bounded treewidth.

Despite substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning - even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning.

For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations.

While very small datasets can simply be searched manually, even modest projects can produce audio datasets on the order of 105 hours of recordings, making manual review impractical and necessitating some form of automated detection. pycnet-audio (Ruff 2024) is intended to provide a practical processing workflow for acoustic data, built around the PNW-Cnet model, which was initially developed by the U.S. Forest Service to support population monitoring of northern spotted owls (Strix occidentalis caurina) and other forest owls (Lesmeister and Jenkins 2022; Ruff et al. 2020). PNW-Cnet has been expanded to detect vocalizations of ca. 80 forest wildlife species and numerous forms of anthropogenic and environmental noise (Ruff et al. 2021, 2023).", "AI": {"tldr": "Passive acoustic monitoring uses ARUs to record wildlife sounds, requiring automated processing for large datasets. pycnet-audio, built around PNW-Cnet, automates detection of vocalizations and noise for ~80 species.", "motivation": "Manual review of large acoustic datasets is impractical, necessitating automated solutions for efficient wildlife monitoring.", "method": "Deploy ARUs to record audio, then use pycnet-audio and PNW-Cnet to automate detection of target signals (vocalizations, noise).", "result": "PNW-Cnet detects vocalizations of ~80 species and various noise types, enabling scalable wildlife monitoring.", "conclusion": "pycnet-audio provides a practical workflow for processing large acoustic datasets, enhancing efficiency in wildlife research."}}

(2020), Lan (2016), where different dual blocks are updated at potentially different rates.\n  To find an $\u03b5$-suboptimal solution, the complexities of our algorithms achieve optimal dependency on $\u03b5$: MT-GS needs $O(\\overline{r}A/\u03b5)$ communication rounds and $O(\\overline{r}/\u03b5^2)$ subgradient steps for Lipchitz objectives, and AMT-GS needs $O(\\overline{r}A/\\sqrt{\u03b5\u03bc})$ communication rounds and $O(\\overline{r}/(\u03b5\u03bc))$ subgradient steps if the objectives are also $\u03bc$-strongly convex. Here, $\\overline{r}$ measures the ``average rate of updates'' for dual blocks, and $A$ measures similarities between (subgradients of) local functions. In addition, the linear dependency of communication rounds on $A$ is optimal (Arjevani and Shamir 2015), thereby providing a positive answer to the open question whether such dependency is achievable for non-smooth objectives (Arjevani and Shamir 2015).", "AI": {"tldr": "Proposed two first-order methods (MT-GS and AMT-GS) for distributed optimization, reducing communication rounds and achieving optimal dependency on \u03b5.", "motivation": "Address non-smooth, distributed optimization by leveraging similarities between local objectives and enabling flexible communication rates.", "method": "Block-decomposable primal-dual formulation with multi-timescale sliding, updating dual blocks at varying rates.", "result": "MT-GS requires O(\u00afrA/\u03b5) rounds and O(\u00afr/\u03b5\u00b2) steps; AMT-GS needs O(\u00afrA/\u221a\u03b5\u03bc) rounds and O(\u00afr/(\u03b5\u03bc)) steps for strongly convex objectives.", "conclusion": "Achieves optimal communication round dependency on \u03b5 and answers an open question about non-smooth objectives."}}

The inevitable challenge here is the churn of nodes due to failures and the operator's scheduling policies, leading to losing a stage - a part of the model. The conventional approaches to recover from failures are to either use checkpointing, where periodically a copy of the entire model is sent to an additional storage, or redundant computation. These approaches yield significant communication and/or computation overhead even in non-failure cases and scale poorly in settings with large models. In this paper, we propose, CheckFree, an efficient recovery method where a failing stage is substituted by a weighted average of the closest neighboring stages. In contrast to the state of the art, CheckFree requires no additional computation or storage. However, because of the nature of averaging neighbouring stages, it can only recover failures of intermediate stages. We further extend our method to CheckFree+ with out-of-order pipeline execution to tolerate crashes of the first and last stages. Thanks to out-of-order pipelining, behaviour of those stages is mimicked by their neighboring ones, which allows CheckFree+ to recover them by simply copying the weights from the immediate neighbour. To be able to recover the (de)embedding layers, CheckFree+ copies those layers to the neighboring stages, which requires relatively small storage overhead. We extensively evaluate our method on LLaMa models of model sizes from 124M to 1.5B with varying failure frequencies. In the case of low and medium failure rates (5-10%), CheckFree and CheckFree+ outperform both checkpointing and redundant computation in terms of convergence in wall-clock time by over 12%.

Significantly, the proposed method explicitly models the time-dependent probability distribution, which means that it is possible to obtain the value of the probability density within the time horizon of interest. Additionally, the input before the final activation in the time-dependent classifier is a second-order approximation to the partial derivative, with respect to time, of the logarithm of the density. We apply the proposed approach to approximate the time-dependent probability density functions for systems driven by stochastic excitations. We also use the proposed approach to synthesize new samples of a random vector from a given set of its realizations. In such applications, we generate sample paths necessary for training using stochastic interpolants. Subsequently, new samples are generated using gradient-based Markov chain Monte Carlo methods because automatic differentiation can efficiently provide the necessary gradient. Further, we demonstrate the utility of an explicit approximation to the time-dependent probability density function through applications in unsupervised outlier detection.

We design a novel implementation based on dynamic programming that greatly improves its computational efficiency. Furthermore, we show via careful numerical experiments that our method can outperform popular methods such as lasso and elastic net across a wide range of settings.

### [1] [Text2VR: Automated instruction Generation in Virtual Reality using Large language Models for Assembly Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03699)
*Subin Raj Peter*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate VR training content generation, reducing development time and enhancing scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VR training is effective but resource-intensive to develop. Automating content creation can address this challenge.

Method: A system with an LLM module extracts task info from text, and an intelligent module converts it into VR demonstrations and visual cues.

Result: The approach reduces development overhead and improves training effectiveness in VR environments.

Conclusion: Automating VR training content with LLMs makes it more scalable and adaptable to industrial needs.

Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) has emerged as a powerful tool for workforce training,
offering immersive, interactive, and risk-free environments that enhance skill
acquisition, decision-making, and confidence. Despite its advantages,
developing VR applications for training remains a significant challenge due to
the time, expertise, and resources required to create accurate and engaging
instructional content. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a
novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the
generation of virtual instructions from textual input. The system comprises two
core components: an LLM module that extracts task-relevant information from the
text, and an intelligent module that transforms this information into animated
demonstrations and visual cues within a VR environment. The intelligent module
receives input from the LLM module and interprets the extracted information.
Based on this, an instruction generator creates training content using relevant
data from a database. The instruction generator generates the instruction by
changing the color of virtual objects and creating animations to illustrate
tasks. This approach enhances training effectiveness and reduces development
overhead, making VR-based training more scalable and adaptable to evolving
industrial needs.

### [2] [Outlier Detection Algorithm for Circle Fitting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03720)
*Ahmet GÃ¶khan Poyraz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the PCOD algorithm for outlier detection in circle fitting, showing superior accuracy in industrial applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noisy point sets in circle fitting compromise accuracy, necessitating effective outlier detection methods.

Method: The PCOD algorithm transforms points to polar coordinates, calculates local/global deviations, and identifies outliers.

Result: PCOD outperforms other methods in accuracy for high-precision industrial measurements.

Conclusion: PCOD enhances circle fitting in industrial settings by improving outlier detection and accuracy.

Abstract: Circle fitting methods are extensively utilized in various industries,
particularly in quality control processes and design applications. The
effectiveness of these algorithms can be significantly compromised when the
point sets to be predicted are noisy. To mitigate this issue, outlier detection
and removal algorithms are often applied before the circle fitting procedure.
This study introduces the Polar Coordinate-Based Outlier Detection (PCOD)
algorithm, which can be effectively employed in circle fitting applications. In
the proposed approach, the point set is first transformed into polar
coordinates, followed by the calculation of both local and global standard
deviations. Outliers are then identified by comparing local mean values with
the global standard deviation. The practicality and efficiency of the proposed
method are demonstrated by focusing on the high-precision diameter measurement
of industrial washer parts. Images from a machine vision system are processed
through preprocessing steps, including sub-pixel edge detection. The resulting
sub-pixel edge points are then cleaned using the proposed outlier detection and
removal algorithm, after which circle fitting is performed. A comparison is
made using ten different circle fitting algorithms and five distinct outlier
detection methods. The results indicate that the proposed method outperforms
the other approaches, delivering the best performance in terms of accuracy
within the dataset, thereby demonstrating its potential for enhancing circle
fitting applications in industrial environments.

### [3] [Enhancing Diameter Measurement Accuracy in Machine Vision Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03721)
*Ahmet Gokhan Poyraz,Ahmet Emir Dirik,Hakan Gurkan,Mehmet Kacmaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes two methods to improve measurement accuracy in camera systems using known reference parts, reducing errors significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Measurement errors in camera systems persist despite specialized equipment, especially for parts of varying diameters.

Method: Two approaches: a conversion factor-based method and a pixel-based method, using known references to estimate unknown part diameters.

Result: Errors reduced from 13-114 micrometers to 1-2 micrometers in tests on glass and metal samples.

Conclusion: The methods enhance accuracy and reliability in diameter measurements, requiring minimal reference parts.

Abstract: In camera measurement systems, specialized equipment such as telecentric
lenses is often employed to measure parts with narrow tolerances. However,
despite the use of such equipment, measurement errors can occur due to
mechanical and software-related factors within the system. These errors are
particularly evident in applications where parts of different diameters are
measured using the same setup. This study proposes two innovative approaches to
enhance measurement accuracy using multiple known reference parts: a conversion
factor-based method and a pixel-based method. In the first approach, the
conversion factor is estimated from known references to calculate the diameter
(mm) of the unknown part. In the second approach, the diameter (mm) is directly
estimated using pixel-based diameter information from the references. The
experimental setup includes an industrial-grade camera and telecentric lenses.
Tests conducted on glass samples (1-12 mm) and metal workpieces (3-24 mm) show
that measurement errors, which originally ranged from 13-114 micrometers, were
reduced to 1-2 micrometers using the proposed methods. By utilizing only a few
known reference parts, the proposed approach enables high-accuracy measurement
of all parts within the camera's field of view. Additionally, this method
enhances the existing diameter measurement literature by significantly reducing
error rates and improving measurement reliability.

TL;DR: Integration of MLLM-derived reasoning into multimodal emotion recognition improves performance by enriching cross-modal interactions and addressing class imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance multimodal emotion recognition by leveraging trustworthy prior reasoning knowledge from MLLMs and mitigating class imbalance.

Method: Uses Gemini for fine-grained reasoning traces, injects priors during fusion, and introduces Balanced Dual-Contrastive Learning for class balance.

Result: Substantial performance gains on the MER2024 benchmark, showing synergy between MLLM reasoning and lightweight fusion networks.

Conclusion: MLLM-derived reasoning combined with domain adaptability of fusion networks enables robust, scalable emotion recognition.

Abstract: This study investigates the integration of trustworthy prior reasoning
knowledge from MLLMs into multimodal emotion recognition. We employ Gemini to
generate fine-grained, modality-separable reasoning traces, which are injected
as priors during the fusion stage to enrich cross-modal interactions. To
mitigate the pronounced class-imbalance in multimodal emotion recognition, we
introduce Balanced Dual-Contrastive Learning, a loss formulation that jointly
balances inter-class and intra-class distributions. Applied to the MER2024
benchmark, our prior-enhanced framework yields substantial performance gains,
demonstrating that the reliability of MLLM-derived reasoning can be
synergistically combined with the domain adaptability of lightweight fusion
networks for robust, scalable emotion recognition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A comprehensive survey on Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS), covering problem formulation, datasets, metrics, methodologies, and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance fine-grained object-level understanding in videos by integrating visual and audio modalities.

Method: Analyzes unimodal/multimodal encoding, fusion strategies, decoder designs, and training paradigms (supervised to training-free).

Result: Highlights performance impacts of architectural choices, fusion strategies, and training methods, identifying current challenges.

Conclusion: Proposes future directions like better temporal reasoning, multimodal fusion, leveraging foundation models, and reducing labeled data reliance.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to identify and segment sound-producing
objects in videos by leveraging both visual and audio modalities. It has
emerged as a significant research area in multimodal perception, enabling
fine-grained object-level understanding. In this survey, we present a
comprehensive overview of the AVS field, covering its problem formulation,
benchmark datasets, evaluation metrics, and the progression of methodologies.
We analyze a wide range of approaches, including architectures for unimodal and
multimodal encoding, key strategies for audio-visual fusion, and various
decoder designs. Furthermore, we examine major training paradigms, from fully
supervised learning to weakly supervised and training-free methods. Notably, we
provide an extensive comparison of AVS methods across standard benchmarks,
highlighting the impact of different architectural choices, fusion strategies,
and training paradigms on performance. Finally, we outline the current
challenges, such as limited temporal modeling, modality bias toward vision,
lack of robustness in complex environments, and high computational demands, and
propose promising future directions, including improving temporal reasoning and
multimodal fusion, leveraging foundation models for better generalization and
few-shot learning, reducing reliance on labeled data through selfand weakly
supervised learning, and incorporating higher-level reasoning for more
intelligent AVS systems.

### [6] [A Large Language Model Powered Integrated Circuit Footprint Geometry Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03725)
*Yida Wang,Taiting Lu,Runze Liu,Lanqing Yang,Yifan Yang,Zhe Chen,Yuehai Wang,Yixin Liu,Kaiyuan Lin,Xiaomeng Chen,Dian Ding,Yijie Li,Yi-Chao Chen,Yincheng Jin,Mahanth Gowda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes LLM4-IC8K, a framework using LLMs for automated IC footprint geometry labeling from mechanical drawings, addressing limitations of current LMMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated parsing of IC footprint geometry is challenging due to unstructured drawings and lack of existing methods.

Method: LLM4-IC8K treats drawings as images, using LLMs for structured interpretation via three sub-tasks: pin count, center coordinates, and pin dimensions. A two-stage training approach (synthetic then real-world data) is employed.

Result: The model outperforms state-of-the-art LMMs, validated on the ICGeo8K dataset (8,608 samples).

Conclusion: LLM4-IC8K effectively addresses IC footprint labeling challenges, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Printed-Circuit-board (PCB) footprint geometry labeling of integrated
circuits (IC) is essential in defining the physical interface between
components and the PCB layout, requiring exceptional visual perception
proficiency. However, due to the unstructured footprint drawing and abstract
diagram annotations, automated parsing and accurate footprint geometry modeling
remain highly challenging. Despite its importance, no methods currently exist
for automated package geometry labeling directly from IC mechanical drawings.
In this paper, we first investigate the visual perception performance of Large
Multimodal Models (LMMs) when solving IC footprint geometry understanding. Our
findings reveal that current LMMs severely suffer from inaccurate geometric
perception, which hinders their performance in solving the footprint geometry
labeling problem. To address these limitations, we propose LLM4-IC8K, a novel
framework that treats IC mechanical drawings as images and leverages LLMs for
structured geometric interpretation. To mimic the step-by-step reasoning
approach used by human engineers, LLM4-IC8K addresses three sub-tasks:
perceiving the number of pins, computing the center coordinates of each pin,
and estimating the dimensions of individual pins. We present a two-stage
framework that first trains LMMs on synthetically generated IC footprint
diagrams to learn fundamental geometric reasoning and then fine-tunes them on
real-world datasheet drawings to enhance robustness and accuracy in practical
scenarios. To support this, we introduce ICGeo8K, a multi-modal dataset with
8,608 labeled samples, including 4138 hand-crafted IC footprint samples and
4470 synthetically generated samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our model outperforms state-of-the-art LMMs on the proposed benchmark.

*Tai Hyoung Rhee,Dong-guw Lee,Ayoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based framework for denoising thermal infrared (TIR) images using latent-space and wavelet-domain optimization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and showing robust generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TIR images are useful for robotic perception in poor visibility but suffer from fixed-pattern noise, hindering tasks like object detection and mapping.

Method: Leverages a pretrained stable diffusion model, fine-tuned with a novel loss function combining latent-space and wavelet-domain losses, plus a cascaded refinement stage.

Result: Superior performance on benchmark datasets and robust zero-shot generalization to real-world TIR datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively denoises TIR images, making it practical for robotic applications.

Abstract: Thermal infrared imaging exhibits considerable potentials for robotic
perception tasks, especially in environments with poor visibility or
challenging lighting conditions. However, TIR images typically suffer from
heavy non-uniform fixed-pattern noise, complicating tasks such as object
detection, localization, and mapping. To address this, we propose a
diffusion-based TIR image denoising framework leveraging latent-space
representations and wavelet-domain optimization. Utilizing a pretrained stable
diffusion model, our method fine-tunes the model via a novel loss function
combining latent-space and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) / dual-tree complex
wavelet transform (DTCWT) losses. Additionally, we implement a cascaded
refinement stage to enhance fine details, ensuring high-fidelity denoising
results. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance of
our approach compared to state-of-the-art denoising methods. Furthermore, our
method exhibits robust zero-shot generalization to diverse and challenging
real-world TIR datasets, underscoring its effectiveness for practical robotic
deployment.

### [8] [What is Beneath Misogyny: Misogynous Memes Classification and Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03732)
*Kushal Kanwar,Dushyant Singh Chauhan,Gopendra Vikram Singh,Asif Ekbal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel multimodal approach, MM-Misogyny, detects, categorizes, and explains misogynistic content in memes using text and image analysis with cross-attention and LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting and understanding misogynistic content in memes due to their multimodal and nuanced nature.

Method: MM-Misogyny processes text and image separately, unifies them via cross-attention, and uses a classifier and LLM for labeling, categorization, and explanation.

Result: The model outperforms existing methods, detecting and classifying misogyny while providing granular insights into its manifestations.

Conclusion: MM-Misogyny offers an effective solution for identifying and analyzing misogynistic memes, with potential applications in combating harmful ideologies online.

Abstract: Memes are popular in the modern world and are distributed primarily for
entertainment. However, harmful ideologies such as misogyny can be propagated
through innocent-looking memes. The detection and understanding of why a meme
is misogynous is a research challenge due to its multimodal nature (image and
text) and its nuanced manifestations across different societal contexts. We
introduce a novel multimodal approach, \textit{namely},
\textit{\textbf{MM-Misogyny}} to detect, categorize, and explain misogynistic
content in memes. \textit{\textbf{MM-Misogyny}} processes text and image
modalities separately and unifies them into a multimodal context through a
cross-attention mechanism. The resulting multimodal context is then easily
processed for labeling, categorization, and explanation via a classifier and
Large Language Model (LLM). The evaluation of the proposed model is performed
on a newly curated dataset (\textit{\textbf{W}hat's \textbf{B}eneath
\textbf{M}isogynous \textbf{S}tereotyping (WBMS)}) created by collecting
misogynous memes from cyberspace and categorizing them into four categories,
\textit{namely}, Kitchen, Leadership, Working, and Shopping. The model not only
detects and classifies misogyny, but also provides a granular understanding of
how misogyny operates in domains of life. The results demonstrate the
superiority of our approach compared to existing methods. The code and dataset

### [9] [StorySync: Training-Free Subject Consistency in Text-to-Image Generation via Region Harmonization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03735)
*Gopalji Gaur,Mohammadreza Zolfaghari,Thomas Brox*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free method for generating visually consistent subjects in text-to-image diffusion models using masked cross-image attention and regional feature harmonization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for maintaining subject consistency in visual storytelling are computationally expensive and disrupt pre-trained model capabilities.

Method: Introduces masked cross-image attention sharing and regional feature harmonization to align and refine subject features dynamically.

Result: Successfully generates visually consistent subjects across scenarios without compromising the model's creative abilities.

Conclusion: The proposed approach efficiently maintains subject consistency in visual storytelling without retraining or fine-tuning.

Abstract: Generating a coherent sequence of images that tells a visual story, using
text-to-image diffusion models, often faces the critical challenge of
maintaining subject consistency across all story scenes. Existing approaches,
which typically rely on fine-tuning or retraining models, are computationally
expensive, time-consuming, and often interfere with the model's pre-existing
capabilities. In this paper, we follow a training-free approach and propose an
efficient consistent-subject-generation method. This approach works seamlessly
with pre-trained diffusion models by introducing masked cross-image attention
sharing to dynamically align subject features across a batch of images, and
Regional Feature Harmonization to refine visually similar details for improved
subject consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
successfully generates visually consistent subjects across a variety of
scenarios while maintaining the creative abilities of the diffusion model.

### [10] [Fusion of Pervasive RF Data with Spatial Images via Vision Transformers for Enhanced Mapping in Smart Cities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03736)
*Rafayel Mkrtchyan,Armen Manukyan,Hrant Khachatrian,Theofanis P. Raptis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning approach using DINOv2 and RF data improves building mapping accuracy, outperforming baselines with a 65.3% IoU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional mapping methods (satellite, LiDAR, manual) are costly, inaccessible, or inaccurate. Open-source maps introduce biases due to human errors and environmental changes.

Method: Integrates DINOv2 with RF data from wireless devices, using a vision transformer to process both modalities for better spatial and structural mapping.

Result: Achieves 65.3% IoU, surpassing erroneous maps (40.1%), RF-only (37.3%), and non-AI fusion (42.2%) baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively combines RF and map data, enhancing mapping accuracy for smart city applications.

Abstract: Environment mapping is an important computing task for a wide range of smart
city applications, including autonomous navigation, wireless network operations
and extended reality environments. Conventional smart city mapping techniques,
such as satellite imagery, LiDAR scans, and manual annotations, often suffer
from limitations related to cost, accessibility and accuracy. Open-source
mapping platforms have been widely utilized in artificial intelligence
applications for environment mapping, serving as a source of ground truth.
However, human errors and the evolving nature of real-world environments
introduce biases that can negatively impact the performance of neural networks
trained on such data. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based approach
that integrates the DINOv2 architecture to improve building mapping by
combining maps from open-source platforms with radio frequency (RF) data
collected from multiple wireless user equipments and base stations. Our
approach leverages a vision transformer-based architecture to jointly process
both RF and map modalities within a unified framework, effectively capturing
spatial dependencies and structural priors for enhanced mapping accuracy. For
the evaluation purposes, we employ a synthetic dataset co-produced by Huawei.
We develop and train a model that leverages only aggregated path loss
information to tackle the mapping problem. We measure the results according to
three performance metrics which capture different qualities: (i) The Jaccard
index, also known as intersection over union (IoU), (ii) the Hausdorff
distance, and (iii) the Chamfer distance. Our design achieves a macro IoU of
65.3%, significantly surpassing (i) the erroneous maps baseline, which yields
40.1%, (ii) an RF-only method from the literature, which yields 37.3%, and
(iii) a non-AI fusion baseline that we designed which yields 42.2%.

### [11] [VQ-DeepISC: Vector Quantized-Enabled Digital Semantic Communication with Channel Adaptive Image Transmission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03740)
*Jianqiao Chen,Tingting Zhu,Huishi Song,Nan Ma,Xiaodong Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A VQ-DeepISC system is proposed for digital semantic communication, using VQ modules and channel adaptation for efficient index-based transmission, outperforming benchmarks in reconstruction fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in digitizing semantic features while preserving continuity and context, requiring robust methods for practical interoperability between semantic and digital systems.

Method: The system employs a Swin Transformer for semantic feature extraction, VQ modules for discrete latent spaces, and an attention-driven channel adaptation module. Training includes KLD regularization and EMA for stability.

Result: Superior reconstruction fidelity is achieved compared to benchmark methods, validated through experiments.

Conclusion: VQ-DeepISC effectively bridges semantic and digital communication, offering a robust and efficient solution for practical applications.

Abstract: Discretization of semantic features enables interoperability between semantic
and digital communication systems, showing significant potential for practical
applications. The fundamental difficulty in digitizing semantic features stems
from the need to preserve continuity and context in inherently analog
representations during their compression into discrete symbols while ensuring
robustness to channel degradation. In this paper, we propose a vector quantized
(VQ)-enabled digital semantic communication system with channel adaptive image
transmission, named VQ-DeepISC. Guided by deep joint source-channel coding
(DJSCC), we first design a Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical semantic
feature extraction, followed by VQ modules projecting features into discrete
latent spaces. Consequently, it enables efficient index-based transmission
instead of raw feature transmission. To further optimize this process, we
develop an attention mechanism-driven channel adaptation module to dynamically
optimize index transmission. Secondly, to counteract codebook collapse during
training process, we impose a distributional regularization by minimizing the
Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between codeword usage frequencies and a
uniform prior. Meanwhile, exponential moving average (EMA) is employed to
stabilize training and ensure balanced feature coverage during codebook
updates. Finally, digital communication is implemented using quadrature phase
shift keying (QPSK) modulation alongside orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM), adhering to the IEEE 802.11a standard. Experimental
results demonstrate superior reconstruction fidelity of the proposed system
over benchmark methods.

*Wenwen Li,Chia-Yu Hsu,Maosheng Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning model for weakly supervised object detection of natural features, incorporating spatial principles and attention maps, is applied to detect impact craters on Mars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges like lack of training data and neglect of spatial effects hinder AI integration in geospatial research.

Method: Developed a spatially explicit model using weak labels, attention maps, and multistage training.

Result: Successfully detected impact craters on Mars and generalized to other features on Earth and planets.

Conclusion: Advances GeoAI by integrating spatial principles and improving weakly supervised object detection.

Abstract: Recent interest in geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) has fostered a
wide range of applications using artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep
learning, for geospatial problem solving. However, major challenges such as a
lack of training data and the neglect of spatial principles and spatial effects
in AI model design remain, significantly hindering the in-depth integration of
AI with geospatial research. This paper reports our work in developing a deep
learning model that enables object detection, particularly of natural features,
in a weakly supervised manner. Our work makes three contributions: First, we
present a method of object detection using only weak labels. This is achieved
by developing a spatially explicit model based on Tobler's first law of
geography. Second, we incorporate attention maps into the object detection
pipeline and develop a multistage training strategy to improve performance.
Third, we apply this model to detect impact craters on Mars, a task that
previously required extensive manual effort. The model generalizes to both
natural and human-made features on the surfaces of Earth and other planets.
This research advances the theoretical and methodological foundations of GeoAI.

### [13] [Closed-Circuit Television Data as an Emergent Data Source for Urban Rail Platform Crowding Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03749)
*Riccardo Fiorista,Awad Abdelhalim,Anson F. Stewart,Gabriel L. Pincus,Ian Thistle,Jinhua Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using CCTV footage and computer vision to estimate urban rail platform occupancy, comparing three methods and introducing a novel linear-optimization approach for accurate real-time crowd estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving safety, efficiency, and customer experience in transit by accurately estimating platform crowding in real-time, which is currently challenging with indirect proxies.

Method: Three computer vision approaches: object detection (YOLOv11, RT-DETRv2, APGCC), crowd-level classification (Crowd-ViT), and semantic segmentation (DeepLabV3), plus a novel linear-optimization method for count extraction.

Result: Computer vision methods, tested on a large WMATA dataset, prove effective for real-time crowd estimation, outperforming traditional proxies.

Conclusion: CCTV data alone can enable precise real-time crowding estimates, aiding timely operational responses for crowding mitigation.

Abstract: Accurately estimating urban rail platform occupancy can enhance transit
agencies' ability to make informed operational decisions, thereby improving
safety, operational efficiency, and customer experience, particularly in the
context of crowding. However, sensing real-time crowding remains challenging
and often depends on indirect proxies such as automatic fare collection data or
staff observations. Recently, Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) footage has
emerged as a promising data source with the potential to yield accurate,
real-time occupancy estimates. The presented study investigates this potential
by comparing three state-of-the-art computer vision approaches for extracting
crowd-related features from platform CCTV imagery: (a) object detection and
counting using YOLOv11, RT-DETRv2, and APGCC; (b) crowd-level classification
via a custom-trained Vision Transformer, Crowd-ViT; and (c) semantic
segmentation using DeepLabV3. Additionally, we present a novel, highly
efficient linear-optimization-based approach to extract counts from the
generated segmentation maps while accounting for image object depth and, thus,
for passenger dispersion along a platform. Tested on a privacy-preserving
dataset created in collaboration with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit
Authority (WMATA) that encompasses more than 600 hours of video material, our
results demonstrate that computer vision approaches can provide substantive
value for crowd estimation. This work demonstrates that CCTV image data,
independent of other data sources available to a transit agency, can enable
more precise real-time crowding estimation and, eventually, timely operational
responses for platform crowding mitigation.

*Brian Gopalan,Nathalia Nascimento,Vishal Monga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A modular deep-learning framework for weed segmentation in precision agriculture dynamically routes drone images through specialized models based on quality conditions (noise/blur), outperforming CNN-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the need for efficient and accurate weed segmentation from drone video in precision agriculture, especially under common image degradation conditions like blur and noise.

Method: Proposes a quality-aware framework that analyzes image quality (blur/noise) using Mean Absolute Deviation and Laplacian, then routes data to one of three vision transformer models optimized for clean images, noise reduction, or blur correction.

Result: Outperforms existing CNN-based methods in segmentation quality and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework represents a significant advancement in deep-learning applications for agriculture by dynamically adapting to image degradation.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical need for efficient and accurate weed
segmentation from drone video in precision agriculture. A quality-aware modular
deep-learning framework is proposed that addresses common image degradation by
analyzing quality conditions-such as blur and noise-and routing inputs through
specialized pre-processing and transformer models optimized for each
degradation type. The system first analyzes drone images for noise and blur
using Mean Absolute Deviation and the Laplacian. Data is then dynamically
routed to one of three vision transformer models: a baseline for clean images,
a modified transformer with Fisher Vector encoding for noise reduction, or
another with an unrolled Lucy-Robinson decoder to correct blur. This novel
routing strategy allows the system to outperform existing CNN-based methods in
both segmentation quality and computational efficiency, demonstrating a

*Bevin V,Ananthakrishnan P V,Ragesh KR,Sanjay M,Vineeth S,Bibin Wilson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel pipeline generates synthetic invoice documents to overcome dataset limitations for training machine learning models in automated invoice processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of acquiring large-scale, diverse datasets due to privacy regulations and high annotation costs.

Method: Uses OCR to extract text and layout, replaces data fields with LLM-generated synthetic content, and employs inpainting to render new text while preserving layout.

Result: Produces realistic synthetic invoice images and aligned structured data (JSON), enabling scalable dataset amplification.

Conclusion: The approach automates dataset creation, improving robustness and accuracy of document intelligence models.

Abstract: The performance of machine learning models for automated invoice processing
is critically dependent on large-scale, diverse datasets. However, the
acquisition of such datasets is often constrained by privacy regulations and
the high cost of manual annotation. To address this, we present a novel
pipeline for generating high-fidelity, synthetic invoice documents and their
corresponding structured data. Our method first utilizes Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) to extract the text content and precise spatial layout from a
source invoice. Select data fields are then replaced with contextually
realistic, synthetic content generated by a large language model (LLM).
Finally, we employ an inpainting technique to erase the original text from the
image and render the new, synthetic text in its place, preserving the exact
layout and font characteristics. This process yields a pair of outputs: a
visually realistic new invoice image and a perfectly aligned structured data
file (JSON) reflecting the synthetic content. Our approach provides a scalable
and automated solution to amplify small, private datasets, enabling the
creation of large, varied corpora for training more robust and accurate
document intelligence models.

*Ziheng Jia,Jiaying Qian,Zicheng Zhang,Zijian Chen,Xiongkuo Min*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Refine-IQA introduces a multi-stage RFT framework for image quality assessment, enhancing perception and scoring tasks with novel rewards and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RFT-based IQA methods lack supervision for the 'think' process and direct fine-tuning limits performance.

Method: Stage-1 uses the Refine-Perception-20K dataset and multi-task rewards for perception. Stage-2 employs probability difference rewards for 'think' process supervision.

Result: Refine-IQA achieves top performance in perception, scoring, and quality interpreting tasks.

Conclusion: The framework improves IQA by addressing gaps in supervision and perception, enabling robust quality interpretation.

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) is a proliferating paradigm for LMM training.
Analogous to high-level reasoning tasks, RFT is similarly applicable to
low-level vision domains, including image quality assessment (IQA). Existing
RFT-based IQA methods typically use rule-based output rewards to verify the
model's rollouts but provide no reward supervision for the "think" process,
leaving its correctness and efficacy uncontrolled. Furthermore, these methods
typically fine-tune directly on downstream IQA tasks without explicitly
enhancing the model's native low-level visual quality perception, which may
constrain its performance upper bound. In response to these gaps, we propose
the multi-stage RFT IQA framework (Refine-IQA). In Stage-1, we build the
Refine-Perception-20K dataset (with 12 main distortions, 20,907
locally-distorted images, and over 55K RFT samples) and design multi-task
reward functions to strengthen the model's visual quality perception. In
Stage-2, targeting the quality scoring task, we introduce a probability
difference reward involved strategy for "think" process supervision. The
resulting Refine-IQA Series Models achieve outstanding performance on both
perception and scoring tasks-and, notably, our paradigm activates a robust
"think" (quality interpreting) capability that also attains exceptional results
on the corresponding quality interpreting benchmark.

*Mingyu Liu,Zian Mao,Zhu Liu,Haoran Zhang,Jintao Guo,Xiaoya He,Xi Huang,Shufen Chu,Chun Cheng,Jun Ding,Yujun Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 4D-PreNet is a deep-learning pipeline for denoising, center correction, and distortion calibration in 4D-STEM, improving data preprocessing for real-time analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-throughput 4D-STEM faces data preprocessing bottlenecks due to noise, drift, and distortions, which conventional methods fail to address robustly.

Method: Uses attention-enhanced U-Net and ResNet architectures trained on simulated datasets to generalize to experimental data.

Result: Reduces mean squared error by 50% in denoising and achieves sub-pixel center localization (errors <0.04 pixels).

Conclusion: 4D-PreNet outperforms traditional methods, enabling reliable high-throughput 4D-STEM analysis.

Abstract: Automated experimentation with real time data analysis in scanning
transmission electron microscopy (STEM) often require end-to-end framework. The
four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) with
high-throughput data acquisition has been constrained by the critical
bottleneck results from data preprocessing. Pervasive noise, beam center drift,
and elliptical distortions during high-throughput acquisition inevitably
corrupt diffraction patterns, systematically biasing quantitative measurements.
Yet, conventional correction algorithms are often material-specific and fail to
provide a robust, generalizable solution. In this work, we present 4D-PreNet,
an end-to-end deep-learning pipeline that integrates attention-enhanced U-Net
and ResNet architectures to simultaneously perform denoising, center
correction, and elliptical distortion calibration. The network is trained on
large, simulated datasets encompassing a wide range of noise levels, drift
magnitudes, and distortion types, enabling it to generalize effectively to
experimental data acquired under varying conditions. Quantitative evaluations
demonstrate that our pipeline reduces mean squared error by up to 50% during
denoising and achieves sub-pixel center localization in the center detection
task, with average errors below 0.04 pixels. The outputs are bench-marked
against traditional algorithms, highlighting improvements in both noise
suppression and restoration of diffraction patterns, thereby facilitating
high-throughput, reliable 4D-STEM real-time analysis for automated
characterization.

TL;DR: HPSv3 is introduced as a human-centric metric for text-to-image generation, addressing limitations of existing metrics with a new dataset (HPDv3) and a VLM-based preference model. CoHP method improves image quality iteratively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing human-centric metrics for text-to-image generation are limited by data coverage, feature extraction, and loss functions.

Method: (1) Release HPDv3 dataset with 1.08M text-image pairs and 1.17M comparisons. (2) Train a VLM-based preference model with uncertainty-aware ranking loss. (3) Propose CoHP for iterative image refinement.

Result: HPSv3 proves robust for wide-spectrum image evaluation, and CoHP efficiently enhances image quality without extra data.

Conclusion: HPSv3 and CoHP provide effective, human-aligned solutions for evaluating and improving text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Evaluating text-to-image generation models requires alignment with human
perception, yet existing human-centric metrics are constrained by limited data
coverage, suboptimal feature extraction, and inefficient loss functions. To
address these challenges, we introduce Human Preference Score v3 (HPSv3). (1)
We release HPDv3, the first wide-spectrum human preference dataset integrating
1.08M text-image pairs and 1.17M annotated pairwise comparisons from
state-of-the-art generative models and low to high-quality real-world images.
(2) We introduce a VLM-based preference model trained using an
uncertainty-aware ranking loss for fine-grained ranking. Besides, we propose
Chain-of-Human-Preference (CoHP), an iterative image refinement method that
enhances quality without extra data, using HPSv3 to select the best image at
each step. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HPSv3 serves as a robust
metric for wide-spectrum image evaluation, and CoHP offers an efficient and
human-aligned approach to improve image generation quality. The code and
dataset are available at the HPSv3 Homepage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Impact craters are key for planetary science, and deep learning advancements enable automated detection to study surface composition and geological history.

Method: A two-stage framework: first, crater identification using CNNs, ResNet-50, and YOLO; second, YOLO-based localization. Tested on Mars and Moon remote sensing data.

Result: YOLO shows balanced detection performance, while ResNet-50 excels in identifying large craters with high precision.

Conclusion: Deep learning models, especially YOLO and ResNet-50, are effective for automated crater detection and identification, aiding planetary research.

Abstract: Impact craters are among the most prominent geomorphological features on
planetary surfaces and are of substantial significance in planetary science
research. Their spatial distribution and morphological characteristics provide
critical information on planetary surface composition, geological history, and
impact processes. In recent years, the rapid advancement of deep learning
models has fostered significant interest in automated crater detection. In this
paper, we apply advancements in deep learning models for impact crater
detection and identification. We use novel models, including Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) and variants such as YOLO and ResNet. We present a
framework that features a two-stage approach where the first stage features
crater identification using simple classic CNN, ResNet-50 and YOLO. In the
second stage, our framework employs YOLO-based detection for crater
localisation. Therefore, we detect and identify different types of craters and
present a summary report with remote sensing data for a selected region. We
consider selected regions for craters and identification from Mars and the Moon
based on remote sensing data. Our results indicate that YOLO demonstrates the
most balanced crater detection performance, while ResNet-50 excels in
identifying large craters with high precision.

*Shen Zhu,Yinzhu Jin,Ifrah Zawar,P. Thomas Fletcher*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion model for generating point-based shapes with correspondences, outperforming existing methods in realism and enabling downstream tasks like conditional and counterfactual generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods ignore point correspondences in shape generation, limiting their utility for tasks requiring structured outputs.

Method: A diffusion model is designed to generate point-based shapes while preserving correspondences, trained on OASIS-3 data.

Result: The model produces highly realistic hippocampal shapes with preserved correspondences, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The model successfully bridges the gap in generating structured shapes with correspondences, enabling applications like disease progression modeling.

Abstract: We propose a diffusion model designed to generate point-based shape
representations with correspondences. Traditional statistical shape models have
considered point correspondences extensively, but current deep learning methods
do not take them into account, focusing on unordered point clouds instead.
Current deep generative models for point clouds do not address generating
shapes with point correspondences between generated shapes. This work aims to
formulate a diffusion model that is capable of generating realistic point-based
shape representations, which preserve point correspondences that are present in
the training data. Using shape representation data with correspondences derived
from Open Access Series of Imaging Studies 3 (OASIS-3), we demonstrate that our
correspondence-preserving model effectively generates point-based hippocampal
shape representations that are highly realistic compared to existing methods.
We further demonstrate the applications of our generative model by downstream
tasks, such as conditional generation of healthy and AD subjects and predicting
morphological changes of disease progression by counterfactual generation.

*Xiangcen Wu,Shaheer U. Saeed,Yipei Wang,Ester Bonmati Coll,Yipeng Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A recommendation system is proposed to enhance prostate cancer segmentation by suggesting optimal image portions and modalities, improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiologists use varied strategies for medical image analysis, but current machine learning models lack dynamic decision-making for optimal modality and region selection.

Method: A policy network is trained to recommend modalities and regions, iteratively refining segmentation with a pre-trained model mimicking radiologist inspection.

Result: Validated on 1325 MRI images, the method improves segmentation accuracy and efficiency, outperforming standard networks and developing unique strategies.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for interactive applications, assisting radiologists and potentially refining current guidelines like PI-RADS.

Abstract: Radiologists often mix medical image reading strategies, including inspection
of individual modalities and local image regions, using information at
different locations from different images independently as well as
concurrently. In this paper, we propose a recommend system to assist machine
learning-based segmentation models, by suggesting appropriate image portions
along with the best modality, such that prostate cancer segmentation
performance can be maximised. Our approach trains a policy network that assists
tumor localisation, by recommending both the optimal imaging modality and the
specific sections of interest for review. During training, a pre-trained
segmentation network mimics radiologist inspection on individual or variable
combinations of these imaging modalities and their sections - selected by the
policy network. Taking the locally segmented regions as an input for the next
step, this dynamic decision making process iterates until all cancers are best
localised. We validate our method using a data set of 1325 labelled
multiparametric MRI images from prostate cancer patients, demonstrating its
potential to improve annotation efficiency and segmentation accuracy,
especially when challenging pathology is present. Experimental results show
that our approach can surpass standard segmentation networks. Perhaps more
interestingly, our trained agent independently developed its own optimal
strategy, which may or may not be consistent with current radiologist
guidelines such as PI-RADS. This observation also suggests a promising
interactive application, in which the proposed policy networks assist human
radiologists.

TL;DR: A two-stage training method reduces manual curation for audio-synchronized video animation, using noisy pretraining and small-scale fine-tuning, achieving scalability and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods require expensive manual curation of high-quality training videos, limiting scalability to diverse audio-video classes.

Method: A two-stage paradigm: pretraining on noisy, large-scale videos, then fine-tuning on small, high-quality curated examples. Multi-feature conditioning and window attention enhance synchronization.

Result: Reduces manual effort by 10x, generalizes to open classes, and introduces AVSync48, a 3x more diverse benchmark.

Conclusion: The method efficiently scales audio-synchronized animation with minimal human effort, leveraging noisy data and pretrained models.

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-synchronized visual animation enable control of
video content using audios from specific classes. However, existing methods
rely heavily on expensive manual curation of high-quality, class-specific
training videos, posing challenges to scaling up to diverse audio-video classes
in the open world. In this work, we propose an efficient two-stage training
paradigm to scale up audio-synchronized visual animation using abundant but
noisy videos. In stage one, we automatically curate large-scale videos for
pretraining, allowing the model to learn diverse but imperfect audio-video
alignments. In stage two, we finetune the model on manually curated
high-quality examples, but only at a small scale, significantly reducing the
required human effort. We further enhance synchronization by allowing each
frame to access rich audio context via multi-feature conditioning and window
attention. To efficiently train the model, we leverage pretrained text-to-video
generator and audio encoders, introducing only 1.9\% additional trainable
parameters to learn audio-conditioning capability without compromising the
generator's prior knowledge. For evaluation, we introduce AVSync48, a benchmark
with videos from 48 classes, which is 3$\times$ more diverse than previous
benchmarks. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly reduces
reliance on manual curation by over 10$\times$, while generalizing to many open
classes.

*Mamadou Keita,Wassim Hamidouche,Hessen Bougueffa Eutamene,Abdelmalik Taleb-Ahmed,Abdenour Hadid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAVID is a novel framework for detecting AI-generated images using visual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing detection methods lack generalization and robustness, relying on low-level artifacts. RAVID aims to improve adaptability by leveraging visual RAG.

Method: RAVID uses a fine-tuned CLIP encoder (RAVID CLIP) with category prompts, retrieves relevant images, and combines them with the query using a vision-language model (VLM).

Result: RAVID achieves 93.85% accuracy on the UniversalFakeDetect benchmark and outperforms traditional methods under image degradations (80.27% vs. 63.44%).

Conclusion: RAVID demonstrates superior performance and robustness, making it a promising solution for AI-generated image detection.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce RAVID, the first framework for AI-generated image
detection that leverages visual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). While RAG
methods have shown promise in mitigating factual inaccuracies in foundation
models, they have primarily focused on text, leaving visual knowledge
underexplored. Meanwhile, existing detection methods, which struggle with
generalization and robustness, often rely on low-level artifacts and
model-specific features, limiting their adaptability. To address this, RAVID
dynamically retrieves relevant images to enhance detection. Our approach
utilizes a fine-tuned CLIP image encoder, RAVID CLIP, enhanced with
category-related prompts to improve representation learning. We further
integrate a vision-language model (VLM) to fuse retrieved images with the
query, enriching the input and improving accuracy. Given a query image, RAVID
generates an embedding using RAVID CLIP, retrieves the most relevant images
from a database, and combines these with the query image to form an enriched
input for a VLM (e.g., Qwen-VL or Openflamingo). Experiments on the
UniversalFakeDetect benchmark, which covers 19 generative models, show that
RAVID achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average accuracy of 93.85%.
RAVID also outperforms traditional methods in terms of robustness, maintaining
high accuracy even under image degradations such as Gaussian blur and JPEG
compression. Specifically, RAVID achieves an average accuracy of 80.27% under
degradation conditions, compared to 63.44% for the state-of-the-art model
C2P-CLIP, demonstrating consistent improvements in both Gaussian blur and JPEG
compression scenarios. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

*Michele Andrade,Guilherme A. L. Silva,ValÃ©ria Santos,Gladston Moreira,Eduardo Luz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of large-scale pre-training datasets on deep learning models for estimating nutritional content from 2D food images, finding that proprietary datasets like JFT-300M outperform public ones like ImageNet and COYO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in nutritional estimation from images, such as variability in presentation and lack of depth information, and the reliance on proprietary datasets for pre-training.

Method: Vision Transformer (ViT) models pre-trained on ImageNet and COYO are fine-tuned and compared against CNN baselines (InceptionV2, ResNet-50) and a state-of-the-art method using JFT-300M. Experiments are conducted on the Nutrition5k dataset.

Result: Models pre-trained on JFT-300M perform best. COYO-trained models underperform compared to ImageNet, contrary to expectations.

Conclusion: Pre-training dataset characteristics (scale, domain relevance, curation) are crucial for effective transfer learning in nutritional estimation.

Abstract: Estimating the nutritional content of food from images is a critical task
with significant implications for health and dietary monitoring. This is
challenging, especially when relying solely on 2D images, due to the
variability in food presentation, lighting, and the inherent difficulty in
inferring volume and mass without depth information. Furthermore,
reproducibility in this domain is hampered by the reliance of state-of-the-art
methods on proprietary datasets for large-scale pre-training. In this paper, we
investigate the impact of large-scale pre-training datasets on the performance
of deep learning models for nutritional estimation using only 2D images. We
fine-tune and evaluate Vision Transformer (ViT) models pre-trained on two large
public datasets, ImageNet and COYO, comparing their performance against
baseline CNN models (InceptionV2 and ResNet-50) and a state-of-the-art method
pre-trained on the proprietary JFT-300M dataset. We conduct extensive
experiments on the Nutrition5k dataset, a large-scale collection of real-world
food plates with high-precision nutritional annotations. Our evaluation using
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAE%) reveals
that models pre-trained on JFT-300M significantly outperform those pre-trained
on public datasets. Unexpectedly, the model pre-trained on the massive COYO
dataset performs worse than the model pre-trained on ImageNet for this specific
regression task, refuting our initial hypothesis. Our analysis provides
quantitative evidence highlighting the critical role of pre-training dataset
characteristics, including scale, domain relevance, and curation quality, for
effective transfer learning in 2D nutritional estimation.

*Zheng Zhang,Tianzhuzi Tan,Guanchun Yin,Bo Zhang,Xiuzhuang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JanusNet is a data augmentation framework for 3D medical image segmentation that preserves anatomical continuity while focusing on hard-to-segment regions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data augmentation disrupts anatomical continuity in 3D medical images, causing structural inconsistencies and poor performance in challenging regions like small organs.

Method: JanusNet uses Slice-Block Shuffle to align shuffling of slice blocks while preserving anatomical context and Confidence-Guided Displacement to amplify signals from difficult areas.

Result: JanusNet achieves a 4% DSC gain on the Synapse dataset with only 20% labeled data, surpassing other methods.

Conclusion: JanusNet effectively leverages anatomical information and improves segmentation performance, especially in challenging regions.

Abstract: Limited by the scarcity of training samples and annotations, weakly
supervised medical image segmentation often employs data augmentation to
increase data diversity, while randomly mixing volumetric blocks has
demonstrated strong performance. However, this approach disrupts the inherent
anatomical continuity of 3D medical images along orthogonal axes, leading to
severe structural inconsistencies and insufficient training in challenging
regions, such as small-sized organs, etc. To better comply with and utilize
human anatomical information, we propose JanusNet}, a data augmentation
framework for 3D medical data that globally models anatomical continuity while
locally focusing on hard-to-segment regions. Specifically, our Slice-Block
Shuffle step performs aligned shuffling of same-index slice blocks across
volumes along a random axis, while preserving the anatomical context on planes
perpendicular to the perturbation axis. Concurrently, the Confidence-Guided
Displacement step uses prediction reliability to replace blocks within each
slice, amplifying signals from difficult areas. This dual-stage, axis-aligned
framework is plug-and-play, requiring minimal code changes for most
teacher-student schemes. Extensive experiments on the Synapse and AMOS datasets
demonstrate that JanusNet significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods,
achieving, for instance, a 4% DSC gain on the Synapse dataset with only 20%
labeled data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing slow CAD rendering and expensive VLM deployment in Text-to-CAD systems, which may degrade performance due to reward hacking.

Method: Uses Compiler-as-a-Judge Module (CJM) for fast reward signals and Compiler-as-a-Review Module (CRM) for CAD verification, alongside an agentic CAD generation approach.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CAD datasets with superior efficiency.

Conclusion: CAD-Judge effectively enhances Text-to-CAD systems by optimizing alignment and robustness.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models are widely used across industrial design,
simulation, and manufacturing processes. Text-to-CAD systems aim to generate
editable, general-purpose CAD models from textual descriptions, significantly
reducing the complexity and entry barrier associated with traditional CAD
workflows. However, rendering CAD models can be slow, and deploying VLMs to
review CAD models can be expensive and may introduce reward hacking that
degrades the systems. To address these challenges, we propose CAD-Judge, a
novel, verifiable reward system for efficient and effective CAD preference
grading and grammatical validation. We adopt the Compiler-as-a-Judge Module
(CJM) as a fast, direct reward signal, optimizing model alignment by maximizing
generative utility through prospect theory. To further improve the robustness
of Text-to-CAD in the testing phase, we introduce a simple yet effective
agentic CAD generation approach and adopt the Compiler-as-a-Review Module
(CRM), which efficiently verifies the generated CAD models, enabling the system
to refine them accordingly. Extensive experiments on challenging CAD datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while
maintaining superior efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SÂ²Q-VDiT, a post-training quantization framework for video diffusion models (V-DMs) to reduce computational costs by leveraging salient data and sparse token distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video diffusion models (V-DMs) face high computational costs due to large parameter sizes and long token sequences, leading to calibration variance and learning challenges.

Method: Proposes Hessian-aware Salient Data Selection for high-quality calibration datasets and Attention-guided Sparse Token Distillation to focus on influential tokens.

Result: Achieves lossless performance under W4A6 quantization, with 3.9Ã model compression and 1.3Ã inference acceleration.

Conclusion: SÂ²Q-VDiT effectively addresses computational inefficiencies in V-DMs while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have emerged as the mainstream paradigm for video
generation models. However, the use of up to billions of parameters incurs
significant computational costs. Quantization offers a promising solution by
reducing memory usage and accelerating inference. Nonetheless, we observe that
the joint modeling of spatial and temporal information in video diffusion
models (V-DMs) leads to extremely long token sequences, which introduces high
calibration variance and learning challenges. To address these issues, we
propose \textbf{$\text{S}^2$Q-VDiT}, a post-training quantization framework for
V-DMs that leverages \textbf{S}alient data and \textbf{S}parse token
distillation. During the calibration phase, we identify that quantization
performance is highly sensitive to the choice of calibration data. To mitigate
this, we introduce \textit{Hessian-aware Salient Data Selection}, which
constructs high-quality calibration datasets by considering both diffusion and
quantization characteristics unique to V-DMs. To tackle the learning
challenges, we further analyze the sparse attention patterns inherent in V-DMs.
Based on this observation, we propose \textit{Attention-guided Sparse Token
Distillation}, which exploits token-wise attention distributions to emphasize
tokens that are more influential to the model's output. Under W4A6
quantization, $\text{S}^2$Q-VDiT achieves lossless performance while delivering
$3.9\times$ model compression and $1.3\times$ inference acceleration. Code will

*Haiqi Yang,Jinzhe Li,Gengxu Li,Yi Chang,Yuan Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ISEval, a framework to evaluate Large Multimodal Models' (LMMs) ability to detect flawed inputs, revealing their struggles with proactive error identification and varying performance across error types and modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether LMMs can actively detect and scrutinize erroneous inputs, a capability not yet addressed despite their growth in handling multimodal tasks.

Method: The Input Scrutiny Ability Evaluation Framework (ISEval) is introduced, covering seven flawed premise categories and three evaluation metrics, applied to ten advanced LMMs.

Result: Most LMMs struggle to detect flawed inputs without guidance, with performance varying by error type and modality trust (e.g., logical fallacies vs. linguistic errors).

Conclusion: The findings highlight the need to improve LMMs' proactive input verification and offer insights for mitigating reliance on explicit prompts.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have witnessed remarkable growth, showcasing
formidable capabilities in handling intricate multimodal tasks with exceptional
performance. Recent research has underscored the inclination of large language
models to passively accept defective inputs, often resulting in futile
reasoning on invalid prompts. However, the same critical question of whether
LMMs can actively detect and scrutinize erroneous inputs still remains
unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the Input Scrutiny Ability
Evaluation Framework (ISEval), which encompasses seven categories of flawed
premises and three evaluation metrics. Our extensive evaluation of ten advanced
LMMs has identified key findings. Most models struggle to actively detect
flawed textual premises without guidance, which reflects a strong reliance on
explicit prompts for premise error identification. Error type affects
performance: models excel at identifying logical fallacies but struggle with
surface-level linguistic errors and certain conditional flaws. Modality trust
varies-Gemini 2.5 pro and Claude Sonnet 4 balance visual and textual info,
while aya-vision-8b over-rely on text in conflicts. These insights underscore
the urgent need to enhance LMMs' proactive verification of input validity and
shed novel insights into mitigating the problem. The code is available at

### [29] [Prototype-Driven Structure Synergy Network for Remote Sensing Images Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04022)
*Junyi Wang,Jinjiang Li,Guodong Fan,Yakun Ju,Xiang Fang,Alex C. Kot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PDSSNet improves semantic segmentation in remote sensing by addressing intra-class variance and inter-class similarity through adaptive prototypes and semantic-structure coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High intra-class variance and inter-class similarity in remote sensing images hinder precise segmentation, requiring better methods to unify class representations and distinguish features.

Method: PDSSNet uses three modules: APEM for unbiased class prototypes, SSCM for hierarchical semantic-structure coordination, and CSAM for dynamic feature adjustment.

Result: PDSSNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed network effectively integrates class semantics and spatial structure, improving segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: In the semantic segmentation of remote sensing images, acquiring complete
ground objects is critical for achieving precise analysis. However, this task
is severely hindered by two major challenges: high intra-class variance and
high inter-class similarity. Traditional methods often yield incomplete
segmentation results due to their inability to effectively unify class
representations and distinguish between similar features. Even emerging
class-guided approaches are limited by coarse class prototype representations
and a neglect of target structural information.
  Therefore, this paper proposes a Prototype-Driven Structure Synergy Network
(PDSSNet). The design of this network is based on a core concept, a complete
ground object is jointly defined by its invariant class semantics and its
variant spatial structure. To implement this, we have designed three key
modules. First, the Adaptive Prototype Extraction Module (APEM) ensures
semantic accuracy from the source by encoding the ground truth to extract
unbiased class prototypes. Subsequently, the designed Semantic-Structure
Coordination Module (SSCM) follows a hierarchical semantics-first,
structure-second principle. This involves first establishing a global semantic
cognition, then leveraging structural information to constrain and refine the
semantic representation, thereby ensuring the integrity of class information.
Finally, the Channel Similarity Adjustment Module (CSAM) employs a dynamic
step-size adjustment mechanism to focus on discriminative features between
classes.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that PDSSNet outperforms state-of-the-art
methods. The source code is available at

### [30] [Dual Prompt Learning for Adapting Vision-Language Models to Downstream Image-Text Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04028)
*Yifan Wang,Tao Wang,Chenwei Tang,Caiyang Yu,Zhengqing Zang,Mengmi Zhang,Shudong Huang,Jiancheng Lv*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCAR introduces a dual-prompt learning framework for Image-Text Retrieval, addressing fine-grained attribute and subcategory discrimination, and achieves state-of-the-art results on the FDRD dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt learning excels in tasks like image classification but struggles with Image-Text Retrieval due to fine-grained attribute and subcategory discrimination challenges.

Method: DCAR dynamically adjusts prompt vectors from semantic and visual dimensions, optimizing attribute and class features. It updates attribute weights via text-image correlation and uses negative samples for subcategory distinctions.

Result: DCAR outperforms baselines on the FDRD dataset, which includes 1,500 fine categories and 230,000 image-caption pairs.

Conclusion: DCAR effectively enhances fine-grained representation learning in ITR, demonstrating superior performance on challenging downstream data.

Abstract: Recently, prompt learning has demonstrated remarkable success in adapting
pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks such as
image classification. However, its application to the downstream Image-Text
Retrieval (ITR) task is more challenging. We find that the challenge lies in
discriminating both fine-grained attributes and similar subcategories of the
downstream data. To address this challenge, we propose Dual prompt Learning
with Joint Category-Attribute Reweighting (DCAR), a novel dual-prompt learning
framework to achieve precise image-text matching. The framework dynamically
adjusts prompt vectors from both semantic and visual dimensions to improve the
performance of CLIP on the downstream ITR task. Based on the prompt paradigm,
DCAR jointly optimizes attribute and class features to enhance fine-grained
representation learning. Specifically, (1) at the attribute level, it
dynamically updates the weights of attribute descriptions based on text-image
mutual information correlation; (2) at the category level, it introduces
negative samples from multiple perspectives with category-matching weighting to
learn subcategory distinctions. To validate our method, we construct the
Fine-class Described Retrieval Dataset (FDRD), which serves as a challenging
benchmark for ITR in downstream data domains. It covers over 1,500 downstream
fine categories and 230,000 image-caption pairs with detailed attribute
annotations. Extensive experiments on FDRD demonstrate that DCAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance over existing baselines.

### [31] [Radar-Based NLoS Pedestrian Localization for Darting-Out Scenarios Near Parked Vehicles with Camera-Assisted Point Cloud Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04033)
*Hee-Yeun Kim,Byeonggyu Park,Byonghyok Choi,Hansang Cho,Byungkwan Kim,Soomok Lee,Mingu Jeon,Seung-Woo Seo,Seong-Woo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework combining monocular camera and 2D radar to detect pedestrians in NLoS blind spots caused by parked vehicles, improving road safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of NLoS blind spots due to parked vehicles, which hinder pedestrian detection and road safety.

Method: Integrates monocular camera image segmentation and 2D radar PCD to detect parked vehicles and localize pedestrians in NLoS regions.

Result: Enhances early pedestrian detection in real-world urban environments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves NLoS pedestrian localization and road safety by leveraging combined sensor data.

Abstract: The presence of Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) blind spots resulting from roadside
parking in urban environments poses a significant challenge to road safety,
particularly due to the sudden emergence of pedestrians. mmWave technology
leverages diffraction and reflection to observe NLoS regions, and recent
studies have demonstrated its potential for detecting obscured objects.
However, existing approaches predominantly rely on predefined spatial
information or assume simple wall reflections, thereby limiting their
generalizability and practical applicability. A particular challenge arises in
scenarios where pedestrians suddenly appear from between parked vehicles, as
these parked vehicles act as temporary spatial obstructions. Furthermore, since
parked vehicles are dynamic and may relocate over time, spatial information
obtained from satellite maps or other predefined sources may not accurately
reflect real-time road conditions, leading to erroneous sensor interpretations.
To address this limitation, we propose an NLoS pedestrian localization
framework that integrates monocular camera image with 2D radar point cloud
(PCD) data. The proposed method initially detects parked vehicles through image
segmentation, estimates depth to infer approximate spatial characteristics, and
subsequently refines this information using 2D radar PCD to achieve precise
spatial inference. Experimental evaluations conducted in real-world urban road
environments demonstrate that the proposed approach enhances early pedestrian
detection and contributes to improved road safety. Supplementary materials are

Abstract: This study presents CORE-ReID V2, an enhanced framework building upon
CORE-ReID. The new framework extends its predecessor by addressing Unsupervised
Domain Adaptation (UDA) challenges in Person ReID and Vehicle ReID, with
further applicability to Object ReID. During pre-training, CycleGAN is employed
to synthesize diverse data, bridging image characteristic gaps across different
domains. In the fine-tuning, an advanced ensemble fusion mechanism, consisting
of the Efficient Channel Attention Block (ECAB) and the Simplified Efficient
Channel Attention Block (SECAB), enhances both local and global feature
representations while reducing ambiguity in pseudo-labels for target samples.
Experimental results on widely used UDA Person ReID and Vehicle ReID datasets
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving top performance in Mean Average Precision (mAP) and Rank-k Accuracy
(Top-1, Top-5, Top-10). Moreover, the framework supports lightweight backbones
such as ResNet18 and ResNet34, ensuring both scalability and efficiency. Our

*Tongshun Zhang,Pingling Liu,Zijian Zhang,Qiuzhan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPJFNet is a novel dark image restoration method that improves efficiency by eliminating external priors, optimizing frequency processing, and reducing computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods face efficiency bottlenecks due to reliance on external priors, redundant operations, and indiscriminate frequency processing.

Method: SPJFNet uses a Self-Mining Guidance Module (SMGM) for lightweight endogenous guidance, lossless wavelet decomposition, and joint Fourier-based enhancement. It also employs a Dual-Frequency Guidance Framework (DFGF) for specialized high/low frequency processing.

Result: SPJFNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing model complexity and computational demands.

Conclusion: The proposed SPJFNet offers an efficient and high-performance solution for dark image restoration, validated by benchmarks.

Abstract: Current dark image restoration methods suffer from severe efficiency
bottlenecks, primarily stemming from: (1) computational burden and error
correction costs associated with reliance on external priors (manual or
cross-modal); (2) redundant operations in complex multi-stage enhancement
pipelines; and (3) indiscriminate processing across frequency components in
frequency-domain methods, leading to excessive global computational demands. To
address these challenges, we propose an Efficient Self-Mining Prior-Guided
Joint Frequency Enhancement Network (SPJFNet). Specifically, we first introduce
a Self-Mining Guidance Module (SMGM) that generates lightweight endogenous
guidance directly from the network, eliminating dependence on external priors
and thereby bypassing error correction overhead while improving inference
speed. Second, through meticulous analysis of different frequency domain
characteristics, we reconstruct and compress multi-level operation chains into
a single efficient operation via lossless wavelet decomposition and joint
Fourier-based advantageous frequency enhancement, significantly reducing
parameters. Building upon this foundation, we propose a Dual-Frequency Guidance
Framework (DFGF) that strategically deploys specialized high/low frequency
branches (wavelet-domain high-frequency enhancement and Fourier-domain
low-frequency restoration), decoupling frequency processing to substantially
reduce computational complexity. Rigorous evaluation across multiple benchmarks
demonstrates that SPJFNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art performance but
also achieves significant efficiency improvements, substantially reducing model
complexity and computational overhead. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VisualTrans, a benchmark for Visual Transformation Reasoning (VTR) in real-world human-object interactions, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks. It evaluates spatial, procedural, and quantitative reasoning across 12 tasks and 472 QA pairs. State-of-the-art models perform well in static tasks but struggle with dynamic reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for VTR suffer from sim-to-real gaps, limited complexity, and incomplete reasoning coverage, hindering practical applications.

Method: VisualTrans is built using a scalable pipeline involving first-person videos, automated metadata annotation with multimodal models, and human verification. It includes 12 tasks and 6 subtask types.

Result: Models excel in static spatial tasks but show weaknesses in dynamic, multi-step reasoning, especially in intermediate state recognition and sequence planning.

Conclusion: VisualTrans highlights gaps in temporal modeling and causal reasoning, guiding future research for more capable VTR systems.

Abstract: Visual transformation reasoning (VTR) is a vital cognitive capability that
empowers intelligent agents to understand dynamic scenes, model causal
relationships, and predict future states, and thereby guiding actions and
laying the foundation for advanced intelligent systems. However, existing
benchmarks suffer from a sim-to-real gap, limited task complexity, and
incomplete reasoning coverage, limiting their practical use in real-world
scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce VisualTrans, the first
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for VTR in real-world
human-object interaction scenarios. VisualTrans encompasses 12 semantically
diverse manipulation tasks and systematically evaluates three essential
reasoning dimensions - spatial, procedural, and quantitative - through 6
well-defined subtask types. The benchmark features 472 high-quality
question-answer pairs in various formats, including multiple-choice, open-ended
counting, and target enumeration. We introduce a scalable data construction
pipeline built upon first-person manipulation videos, which integrates task
selection, image pair extraction, automated metadata annotation with large
multimodal models, and structured question generation. Human verification
ensures the final benchmark is both high-quality and interpretable. Evaluations
of various state-of-the-art vision-language models show strong performance in
static spatial tasks. However, they reveal notable shortcomings in dynamic,
multi-step reasoning scenarios, particularly in areas like intermediate state
recognition and transformation sequence planning. These findings highlight
fundamental weaknesses in temporal modeling and causal reasoning, providing
clear directions for future research aimed at developing more capable and
generalizable VTR systems. The dataset and code are available at

*Qiangguo Jin,Hui Cui,Junbo Wang,Changming Sun,Yimiao He,Ping Xuan,Linlin Wang,Cong Cong,Leyi Wei,Ran Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces IPA-CP, a semi-supervised learning method for tumor segmentation in CT scans, combining adaptive augmentation and iterative pseudo-labeling to outperform existing SSL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSL methods focus on large organs, neglecting small or numerous tumors, and lack thorough investigation of data augmentation for labeled and unlabeled data.

Method: IPA-CP uses a two-way uncertainty-based adaptive augmentation and iterative pseudo-labeling to enhance tumor segmentation.

Result: IPA-CP outperforms state-of-the-art SSL methods on in-house and public datasets, with ablation studies confirming its effectiveness.

Conclusion: IPA-CP is a robust and effective approach for tumor segmentation, addressing gaps in current SSL methods.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has attracted considerable attention in
medical image processing. The latest SSL methods use a combination of
consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling to achieve remarkable success.
However, most existing SSL studies focus on segmenting large organs, neglecting
the challenging scenarios where there are numerous tumors or tumors of small
volume. Furthermore, the extensive capabilities of data augmentation
strategies, particularly in the context of both labeled and unlabeled data,
have yet to be thoroughly investigated. To tackle these challenges, we
introduce a straightforward yet effective approach, termed iterative
pseudo-labeling based adaptive copy-paste supervision (IPA-CP), for tumor
segmentation in CT scans. IPA-CP incorporates a two-way uncertainty based
adaptive augmentation mechanism, aiming to inject tumor uncertainties present
in the mean teacher architecture into adaptive augmentation. Additionally,
IPA-CP employs an iterative pseudo-label transition strategy to generate more
robust and informative pseudo labels for the unlabeled samples. Extensive
experiments on both in-house and public datasets show that our framework
outperforms state-of-the-art SSL methods in medical image segmentation.
Ablation study results demonstrate the effectiveness of our technical
contributions.

*Jiayi He,Xu Wang,Shengeng Tang,Yaxiong Wang,Lechao Cheng,Dan Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel two-phase framework for sign language video generation decouples motion semantics from signer identity, enabling high-quality synthesis with minimal data and flexible signer personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of excessive signer-specific data requirements and poor generalization in sign language video generation.

Method: A two-phase synthesis framework: (1) building a signer-independent multimodal motion lexicon, and (2) discrete-to-continuous motion synthesis with identity-aware neural rendering.

Result: The method achieves high-quality synthesis and unprecedented flexibility in signer personalization.

Conclusion: Disentangling motion from identity is viable and advantageous for sign language video generation.

Abstract: Sign language video generation requires producing natural signing motions
with realistic appearances under precise semantic control, yet faces two
critical challenges: excessive signer-specific data requirements and poor
generalization. We propose a new paradigm for sign language video generation
that decouples motion semantics from signer identity through a two-phase
synthesis framework. First, we construct a signer-independent multimodal motion
lexicon, where each gloss is stored as identity-agnostic pose, gesture, and 3D
mesh sequences, requiring only one recording per sign. This compact
representation enables our second key innovation: a discrete-to-continuous
motion synthesis stage that transforms retrieved gloss sequences into
temporally coherent motion trajectories, followed by identity-aware neural
rendering to produce photorealistic videos of arbitrary signers. Unlike prior
work constrained by signer-specific datasets, our method treats motion as a
first-class citizen: the learned latent pose dynamics serve as a portable
"choreography layer" that can be visually realized through different human
appearances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that disentangling motion from
identity is not just viable but advantageous - enabling both high-quality
synthesis and unprecedented flexibility in signer personalization.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the DOMR framework for dense object matching between egocentric and exocentric views, achieving state-of-the-art results on the Ego-Exo4D benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-view object correspondence is crucial for visual understanding but challenging due to differences in perspectives.

Method: The DOMR framework includes a Dense Object Matcher (DOM) module that jointly models objects using positional and semantic relationships, and a mask refinement head to improve mask accuracy.

Result: DOMR achieves mean IoU scores of 49.7% (EgoâExo) and 55.2% (ExoâEgo), outperforming previous methods by 5.8% and 4.3%.

Conclusion: The integrated approach of DOMR effectively addresses cross-view object matching, validated by superior performance on the benchmark.

Abstract: Cross-view object correspondence involves matching objects between egocentric
(first-person) and exocentric (third-person) views. It is a critical yet
challenging task for visual understanding. In this work, we propose the Dense
Object Matching and Refinement (DOMR) framework to establish dense object
correspondences across views. The framework centers around the Dense Object
Matcher (DOM) module, which jointly models multiple objects. Unlike methods
that directly match individual object masks to image features, DOM leverages
both positional and semantic relationships among objects to find
correspondences. DOM integrates a proposal generation module with a dense
matching module that jointly encodes visual, spatial, and semantic cues,
explicitly constructing inter-object relationships to achieve dense matching
among objects. Furthermore, we combine DOM with a mask refinement head designed
to improve the completeness and accuracy of the predicted masks, forming the
complete DOMR framework. Extensive evaluations on the Ego-Exo4D benchmark
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean
IoU of 49.7% on Ego$\to$Exo and 55.2% on Exo$\to$Ego. These results outperform
those of previous methods by 5.8% and 4.3%, respectively, validating the
effectiveness of our integrated approach for cross-view understanding.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GPI-WT, a white-box Transformer framework for k-space interpolation in MRI, combining global predictability with interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for k-space interpolation focus on local predictability but miss global dependencies. Transformers, known for capturing long-range dependencies, lack interpretability, raising reliability concerns.

Method: Proposes GPI-WT, a white-box Transformer based on Globally Predictable Interpolation (GPI), formulated as a structured low-rank model. Uses learnable global annihilation filters and subgradient-based optimization to create an interpretable attention mechanism.

Result: GPI-WT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in k-space interpolation accuracy and provides superior interpretability.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods by combining global predictability with interpretability, making it reliable for accelerated MRI.

Abstract: Interpolating missing data in k-space is essential for accelerating imaging.
However, existing methods, including convolutional neural network-based deep
learning, primarily exploit local predictability while overlooking the inherent
global dependencies in k-space. Recently, Transformers have demonstrated
remarkable success in natural language processing and image analysis due to
their ability to capture long-range dependencies. This inspires the use of
Transformers for k-space interpolation to better exploit its global structure.
However, their lack of interpretability raises concerns regarding the
reliability of interpolated data. To address this limitation, we propose
GPI-WT, a white-box Transformer framework based on Globally Predictable
Interpolation (GPI) for k-space. Specifically, we formulate GPI from the
perspective of annihilation as a novel k-space structured low-rank (SLR) model.
The global annihilation filters in the SLR model are treated as learnable
parameters, and the subgradients of the SLR model naturally induce a learnable
attention mechanism. By unfolding the subgradient-based optimization algorithm
of SLR into a cascaded network, we construct the first white-box Transformer
specifically designed for accelerated MRI. Experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
in k-space interpolation accuracy while providing superior interpretability.

TL;DR: Uni-DocDiff is a unified, scalable document restoration model using diffusion, with learnable task prompts and a Prior Pool mechanism for multi-task synergy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inefficiency and limited scalability of existing document restoration methods that treat tasks independently or use handcrafted prompts.

Method: Proposes Uni-DocDiff, featuring learnable task prompts, a Prior Pool for combining local and global features, and a Prior Fusion Module for adaptive task-specific prior selection.

Result: Achieves performance comparable or superior to task-specific models while maintaining scalability for new tasks.

Conclusion: Uni-DocDiff offers a versatile and scalable solution for document restoration, leveraging diffusion and multi-task synergy.

Abstract: Removing various degradations from damaged documents greatly benefits
digitization, downstream document analysis, and readability. Previous methods
often treat each restoration task independently with dedicated models, leading
to a cumbersome and highly complex document processing system. Although recent
studies attempt to unify multiple tasks, they often suffer from limited
scalability due to handcrafted prompts and heavy preprocessing, and fail to
fully exploit inter-task synergy within a shared architecture. To address the
aforementioned challenges, we propose Uni-DocDiff, a Unified and highly
scalable Document restoration model based on Diffusion. Uni-DocDiff develops a
learnable task prompt design, ensuring exceptional scalability across diverse
tasks. To further enhance its multi-task capabilities and address potential
task interference, we devise a novel \textbf{Prior \textbf{P}ool}, a simple yet
comprehensive mechanism that combines both local high-frequency features and
global low-frequency features. Additionally, we design the \textbf{Prior
\textbf{F}usion \textbf{M}odule (PFM)}, which enables the model to adaptively
select the most relevant prior information for each specific task. Extensive
experiments show that the versatile Uni-DocDiff achieves performance comparable
or even superior performance compared with task-specific expert models, and
simultaneously holds the task scalability for seamless adaptation to new tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TCSAFormer is a transformer-based medical image segmentation network that reduces computational complexity and enhances feature capture using Compressed Attention and Dual-Branch Feed-Forward Network modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based methods for medical image segmentation face high computational costs and limited local feature capture. TCSAFormer aims to address these issues.

Method: TCSAFormer uses a Compressed Attention module to reduce computational overhead and a Dual-Branch Feed-Forward Network to capture local and multiscale features.

Result: TCSAFormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ISIC-2018, CVC-ClinicDB, and Synapse datasets while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: TCSAFormer achieves a balance between efficiency and accuracy, making it a promising solution for medical image segmentation.

Abstract: In recent years, transformer-based methods have achieved remarkable progress
in medical image segmentation due to their superior ability to capture
long-range dependencies. However, these methods typically suffer from two major
limitations. First, their computational complexity scales quadratically with
the input sequences. Second, the feed-forward network (FFN) modules in vanilla
Transformers typically rely on fully connected layers, which limits models'
ability to capture local contextual information and multiscale features
critical for precise semantic segmentation. To address these issues, we propose
an efficient medical image segmentation network, named TCSAFormer. The proposed
TCSAFormer adopts two key ideas. First, it incorporates a Compressed Attention
(CA) module, which combines token compression and pixel-level sparse attention
to dynamically focus on the most relevant key-value pairs for each query. This
is achieved by pruning globally irrelevant tokens and merging redundant ones,
significantly reducing computational complexity while enhancing the model's
ability to capture relationships between tokens. Second, it introduces a
Dual-Branch Feed-Forward Network (DBFFN) module as a replacement for the
standard FFN to capture local contextual features and multiscale information,
thereby strengthening the model's feature representation capability. We conduct
extensive experiments on three publicly available medical image segmentation
datasets: ISIC-2018, CVC-ClinicDB, and Synapse, to evaluate the segmentation
performance of TCSAFormer. Experimental results demonstrate that TCSAFormer
achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methods, while maintaining lower computational overhead, thus achieving an
optimal trade-off between efficiency and accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: O-Bench is a new VQA benchmark for occlusion perception, revealing a performance gap between MLLMs and humans, with identified failure patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and evaluate MLLMs' capabilities in occlusion perception, an under-explored area in visual intelligence.

Method: Constructed 1,365 images with layered synthesis, annotated 4,588 QA pairs, and evaluated 22 MLLMs against human baselines.

Result: Significant performance gap between MLLMs and humans, not bridged by scaling or reasoning. Identified three failure patterns.

Conclusion: O-Bench serves as a vital tool for evaluating occlusion perception and inspires future MLLM development.

Abstract: Occlusion perception, a critical foundation for human-level spatial
understanding, embodies the challenge of integrating visual recognition and
reasoning. Though multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities, their performance on occlusion perception remains
under-explored. To address this gap, we introduce O-Bench, the first visual
question answering (VQA) benchmark specifically designed for occlusion
perception. Based on SA-1B, we construct 1,365 images featuring semantically
coherent occlusion scenarios through a novel layered synthesis approach. Upon
this foundation, we annotate 4,588 question-answer pairs in total across five
tailored tasks, employing a reliable, semi-automatic workflow. Our extensive
evaluation of 22 representative MLLMs against the human baseline reveals a
significant performance gap between current MLLMs and humans, which, we find,
cannot be sufficiently bridged by model scaling or thinking process. We further
identify three typical failure patterns, including an overly conservative bias,
a fragile gestalt prediction, and a struggle with quantitative tasks. We
believe O-Bench can not only provide a vital evaluation tool for occlusion
perception, but also inspire the development of MLLMs for better visual
intelligence. Our benchmark will be made publicly available upon paper

### [43] [TNet: Terrace Convolutional Decoder Network for Remote Sensing Image Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04061)
*Chengqian Dai,Yonghong Guo,Hongzhao Xiang,Yigui Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TNet, a Terrace Convolutional Decoder Network, improves remote sensing segmentation by integrating global and local features across decoding stages using convolution and addition, achieving competitive results on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing segmentation networks focus on intra-scale relationships but neglect global contextual dependencies across resolutions. TNet addresses this by blending global and local information.

Method: TNet uses convolution and addition to progressively fuse low-resolution (global) and high-resolution (local) features across decoding stages, creating spatially-aware kernels.

Result: TNet-R (ResNet-18 encoder) achieves mIoU of 85.35% on ISPRS Vaihingen, 87.05% on ISPRS Potsdam, and 52.19% on LoveDA, with high efficiency.

Conclusion: TNet is a simple, effective architecture for remote sensing segmentation, balancing global and local features while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: In remote sensing, most segmentation networks adopt the UNet architecture,
often incorporating modules such as Transformers or Mamba to enhance
global-local feature interactions within decoder stages. However, these
enhancements typically focus on intra-scale relationships and neglect the
global contextual dependencies across multiple resolutions. To address this
limitation, we introduce the Terrace Convolutional Decoder Network (TNet), a
simple yet effective architecture that leverages only convolution and addition
operations to progressively integrate low-resolution features (rich in global
context) into higher-resolution features (rich in local details) across
decoding stages. This progressive fusion enables the model to learn
spatially-aware convolutional kernels that naturally blend global and local
information in a stage-wise manner. We implement TNet with a ResNet-18 encoder
(TNet-R) and evaluate it on three benchmark datasets. TNet-R achieves
competitive performance with a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 85.35\%
on ISPRS Vaihingen, 87.05\% on ISPRS Potsdam, and 52.19\% on LoveDA, while
maintaining high computational efficiency. Code is publicly available.

*Yi-Ting Chen,Ting-Hsuan Liao,Pengsheng Guo,Alexander Schwing,Jia-Bin Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DSR is a 3D Gaussian-splatting-based super-resolution framework using 2D diffusion models for high-resolution, 3D-consistent results without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods lack explicit 3D consistency or rely on implicit approaches, limiting visual quality and coherence.

Method: Leverages 2D diffusion models with 3D Gaussian-splatting for explicit 3D consistency across views.

Result: Produces high-resolution, visually compelling results on MipNeRF360 and LLFF datasets while maintaining 3D structural consistency.

Conclusion: 3DSR effectively enhances visual quality and 3D coherence without additional fine-tuning, outperforming prior work.

Abstract: We propose 3D Super Resolution (3DSR), a novel 3D Gaussian-splatting-based
super-resolution framework that leverages off-the-shelf diffusion-based 2D
super-resolution models. 3DSR encourages 3D consistency across views via the
use of an explicit 3D Gaussian-splatting-based scene representation. This makes
the proposed 3DSR different from prior work, such as image upsampling or the
use of video super-resolution, which either don't consider 3D consistency or
aim to incorporate 3D consistency implicitly. Notably, our method enhances
visual quality without additional fine-tuning, ensuring spatial coherence
within the reconstructed scene. We evaluate 3DSR on MipNeRF360 and LLFF data,
demonstrating that it produces high-resolution results that are visually
compelling, while maintaining structural consistency in 3D reconstructions.
Code will be released.

### [45] [DET-GS: Depth- and Edge-Aware Regularization for High-Fidelity 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04099)
*Zexu Huang,Min Xu,Stuart Perry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DET-GS enhances 3D Gaussian Splatting with depth and edge-aware regularization, improving geometric accuracy and visual fidelity under sparse-view conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in accurate geometric reconstruction under sparse-view conditions, where existing methods fail to capture fine structures and degrade essential details.

Method: Proposes DET-GS, a framework with hierarchical geometric depth supervision, edge-aware regularization, and RGB-guided edge-preserving Total Variation loss.

Result: Outperforms SOTA methods in geometric accuracy and visual fidelity on sparse-view benchmarks.

Conclusion: DET-GS significantly advances sparse-view novel view synthesis by combining depth and edge-aware techniques.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) represents a significant advancement in the
field of efficient and high-fidelity novel view synthesis. Despite recent
progress, achieving accurate geometric reconstruction under sparse-view
conditions remains a fundamental challenge. Existing methods often rely on
non-local depth regularization, which fails to capture fine-grained structures
and is highly sensitive to depth estimation noise. Furthermore, traditional
smoothing methods neglect semantic boundaries and indiscriminately degrade
essential edges and textures, consequently limiting the overall quality of
reconstruction. In this work, we propose DET-GS, a unified depth and edge-aware
regularization framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting. DET-GS introduces a
hierarchical geometric depth supervision framework that adaptively enforces
multi-level geometric consistency, significantly enhancing structural fidelity
and robustness against depth estimation noise. To preserve scene boundaries, we
design an edge-aware depth regularization guided by semantic masks derived from
Canny edge detection. Furthermore, we introduce an RGB-guided edge-preserving
Total Variation loss that selectively smooths homogeneous regions while
rigorously retaining high-frequency details and textures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DET-GS achieves substantial improvements in both geometric
accuracy and visual fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on
sparse-view novel view synthesis benchmarks.

### [46] [NEARL-CLIP: Interacted Query Adaptation with Orthogonal Regularization for Medical Vision-Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04101)
*Zelin Peng,Yichen Zhao,Yu Huang,Piao Yang,Feilong Tang,Zhengqin Xu,Xiaokang Yang,Wei Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NEARL-CLIP is a novel VLM-based framework for medical image analysis, enhancing cross-modality interaction and knowledge enrichment with minimal added parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the domain gap in applying VLMs to medical imaging and overcoming modality misalignment in existing methods.

Method: Introduces USEformer for dynamic cross-modality queries and OCA for orthogonality-based knowledge decoupling.

Result: Achieves improved modality interaction and knowledge enrichment with only 1.46M learnable parameters.

Conclusion: NEARL-CLIP effectively bridges the domain gap in medical imaging, unlocking VLM potential with efficiency.

Abstract: Computer-aided medical image analysis is crucial for disease diagnosis and
treatment planning, yet limited annotated datasets restrict medical-specific
model development. While vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP offer strong
generalization capabilities, their direct application to medical imaging
analysis is impeded by a significant domain gap. Existing approaches to bridge
this gap, including prompt learning and one-way modality interaction
techniques, typically focus on introducing domain knowledge to a single
modality. Although this may offer performance gains, it often causes modality
misalignment, thereby failing to unlock the full potential of VLMs. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{NEARL-CLIP} (i\underline{N}teracted qu\underline{E}ry
\underline{A}daptation with o\underline{R}thogona\underline{L} Regularization),
a novel cross-modality interaction VLM-based framework that contains two
contributions: (1) Unified Synergy Embedding Transformer (USEformer), which
dynamically generates cross-modality queries to promote interaction between
modalities, thus fostering the mutual enrichment and enhancement of multi-modal
medical domain knowledge; (2) Orthogonal Cross-Attention Adapter (OCA). OCA
introduces an orthogonality technique to decouple the new knowledge from
USEformer into two distinct components: the truly novel information and the
incremental knowledge. By isolating the learning process from the interference
of incremental knowledge, OCA enables a more focused acquisition of new
information, thereby further facilitating modality interaction and unleashing
the capability of VLMs. Notably, NEARL-CLIP achieves these two contributions in
a parameter-efficient style, which only introduces \textbf{1.46M} learnable
parameters.

*Ashkan Ganj,Yiqin Zhao,Tian Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARCADE is an AR-based platform designed to simplify human perception studies for CV model evaluation, offering cross-platform data collection, custom protocols, and AR streaming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human perception studies are valuable but complex and hard to scale; AR presents a unique opportunity to streamline this process.

Method: ARCADE leverages AR for CV evaluation, supporting cross-platform data collection, pluggable model inference, and AR streaming.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness with depth and lighting estimation models, showing AR tasks can elicit human perceptual judgments.

Conclusion: ARCADE is a flexible and effective human-centered evaluation platform for CV research.

Abstract: Human perception studies can provide complementary insights to qualitative
evaluation for understanding computer vision (CV) model performance. However,
conducting human perception studies remains a non-trivial task, it often
requires complex, end-to-end system setups that are time-consuming and
difficult to scale. In this paper, we explore the unique opportunity presented
by augmented reality (AR) for helping CV researchers to conduct perceptual
studies. We design ARCADE, an evaluation platform that allows researchers to
easily leverage AR's rich context and interactivity for human-centered CV
evaluation. Specifically, ARCADE supports cross-platform AR data collection,
custom experiment protocols via pluggable model inference, and AR streaming for
user studies. We demonstrate ARCADE using two types of CV models, depth and
lighting estimation and show that AR tasks can be effectively used to elicit
human perceptual judgments of model quality. We also evaluate the systems
usability and performance across different deployment and study settings,
highlighting its flexibility and effectiveness as a human-centered evaluation
platform.

### [48] [Unlocking the Potential of MLLMs in Referring Expression Segmentation via a Light-weight Mask Decode](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04107)
*Jingchao Wang,Zhijian Wu,Dingjiang Huang,Yefeng Zheng,Hong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMSeg is a lightweight RES framework that leverages MLLM's visual encoder for detail features and integrates them with LLM's semantic features, outperforming SAM-based and SAM-free methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between performance and cost in RES by avoiding heavy models like SAM while maintaining accuracy.

Method: Proposes MLLMSeg, using MLLM's visual encoder, a DSFF module for feature fusion, and a lightweight mask decoder (34M parameters).

Result: Surpasses SAM-based and SAM-free methods in performance and cost balance.

Conclusion: MLLMSeg effectively balances accuracy and efficiency in RES tasks.

Abstract: Reference Expression Segmentation (RES) aims to segment image regions
specified by referring expressions and has become popular with the rise of
multimodal large models (MLLMs). While MLLMs excel in semantic understanding,
their token-generation paradigm struggles with pixel-level dense prediction.
Existing RES methods either couple MLLMs with the parameter-heavy Segment
Anything Model (SAM) with 632M network parameters or adopt SAM-free lightweight
pipelines that sacrifice accuracy. To address the trade-off between performance
and cost, we specifically propose MLLMSeg, a novel framework that fully
exploits the inherent visual detail features encoded in the MLLM vision encoder
without introducing an extra visual encoder. Besides, we propose a
detail-enhanced and semantic-consistent feature fusion module (DSFF) that fully
integrates the detail-related visual feature with the semantic-related feature
output by the large language model (LLM) of MLLM. Finally, we establish a
light-weight mask decoder with only 34M network parameters that optimally
leverages detailed spatial features from the visual encoder and semantic
features from the LLM to achieve precise mask prediction. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method generally surpasses both SAM-based and SAM-free
competitors, striking a better balance between performance and cost. Code is

*Likai Wang,Ruize Han,Xiangqun Zhang,Wei Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLIPVehicle, a unified framework for joint vehicle detection and re-identification, addressing the conflict between detection and Re-ID objectives. It leverages VLMs and multi-level learning, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for vehicle search are resource-intensive and impractical, requiring separate detection and Re-ID steps. The paper aims to unify these tasks efficiently.

Method: Proposes CLIPVehicle with a dual-granularity semantic-region alignment module and multi-level learning strategy. Introduces a new benchmark with real-world and synthetic datasets.

Result: CLIPVehicle outperforms state-of-the-art methods in vehicle Re-ID and person search tasks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively unifies detection and Re-ID, demonstrating superior performance and practicality for vehicle search.

Abstract: Vehicles, as one of the most common and significant objects in the real
world, the researches on which using computer vision technologies have made
remarkable progress, such as vehicle detection, vehicle re-identification, etc.
To search an interested vehicle from the surveillance videos, existing methods
first pre-detect and store all vehicle patches, and then apply vehicle
re-identification models, which is resource-intensive and not very practical.
In this work, we aim to achieve the joint detection and re-identification for
vehicle search. However, the conflicting objectives between detection that
focuses on shared vehicle commonness and re-identification that focuses on
individual vehicle uniqueness make it challenging for a model to learn in an
end-to-end system. For this problem, we propose a new unified framework, namely
CLIPVehicle, which contains a dual-granularity semantic-region alignment module
to leverage the VLMs (Vision-Language Models) for vehicle discrimination
modeling, and a multi-level vehicle identification learning strategy to learn
the identity representation from global, instance and feature levels. We also
construct a new benchmark, including a real-world dataset CityFlowVS, and two
synthetic datasets SynVS-Day and SynVS-All, for vehicle search. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods of both vehicle Re-ID and person search tasks.

*Maximilian Ulmer,Wout Boerdijk,Rudolph Triebel,Maximilian Durner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OC-DiT is a diffusion model for object-centric prediction, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot instance segmentation by conditioning on object templates and image features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of disentangling object instances in zero-shot instance segmentation using diffusion models.

Method: A conditional latent diffusion framework with two variants: a coarse model for initial proposals and a refinement model for parallel refinement, trained on a synthetic dataset.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world benchmarks without retraining.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of diffusion models for instance segmentation tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents OC-DiT, a novel class of diffusion models designed for
object-centric prediction, and applies it to zero-shot instance segmentation.
We propose a conditional latent diffusion framework that generates instance
masks by conditioning the generative process on object templates and image
features within the diffusion model's latent space. This allows our model to
effectively disentangle object instances through the diffusion process, which
is guided by visual object descriptors and localized image cues. Specifically,
we introduce two model variants: a coarse model for generating initial object
instance proposals, and a refinement model that refines all proposals in
parallel. We train these models on a newly created, large-scale synthetic
dataset comprising thousands of high-quality object meshes. Remarkably, our
model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging real-world
benchmarks, without requiring any retraining on target data. Through
comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate the potential of diffusion
models for instance segmentation tasks.

### [51] [Excavate the potential of Single-Scale Features: A Decomposition Network for Water-Related Optical Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04123)
*Zheng Cheng,Wenri Wang,Guangyong Chen,Yakun Ju,Yihua Cheng,Zhisong Liu,Yanda Meng,Jintao Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Single-scale feature extraction can match or surpass multi-scale methods in underwater image enhancement, leading to the proposal of SSD-Net, which combines CNN and Transformer strengths for efficient degradation decoupling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-scale feature extraction methods are complex, and experiments show single-scale methods can achieve comparable or better results, prompting the need for a simpler yet effective solution.

Method: Proposes SSD-Net with asymmetrical decomposition (clean and degradation layers), using Parallel Feature Decomposition Block (PFDB) and Bidirectional Feature Communication Block (BFCB) to combine CNN and Transformer strengths.

Result: SSD-Net demonstrates that single-scale feature extraction can effectively enhance underwater images, reducing complexity while maintaining or improving performance.

Conclusion: Single-scale methods like SSD-Net offer a simpler, efficient alternative to multi-scale approaches for underwater image enhancement, with potential for broader applications.

Abstract: Underwater image enhancement (UIE) techniques aim to improve visual quality
of images captured in aquatic environments by addressing degradation issues
caused by light absorption and scattering effects, including color distortion,
blurring, and low contrast. Current mainstream solutions predominantly employ
multi-scale feature extraction (MSFE) mechanisms to enhance reconstruction
quality through multi-resolution feature fusion. However, our extensive
experiments demonstrate that high-quality image reconstruction does not
necessarily rely on multi-scale feature fusion. Contrary to popular belief, our
experiments show that single-scale feature extraction alone can match or
surpass the performance of multi-scale methods, significantly reducing
complexity. To comprehensively explore single-scale feature potential in
underwater enhancement, we propose an innovative Single-Scale Decomposition
Network (SSD-Net). This architecture introduces an asymmetrical decomposition
mechanism that disentangles input image into clean layer along with degradation
layer. The former contains scene-intrinsic information and the latter encodes
medium-induced interference. It uniquely combines CNN's local feature
extraction capabilities with Transformer's global modeling strengths through
two core modules: 1) Parallel Feature Decomposition Block (PFDB), implementing
dual-branch feature space decoupling via efficient attention operations and
adaptive sparse transformer; 2) Bidirectional Feature Communication Block
(BFCB), enabling cross-layer residual interactions for complementary feature
mining and fusion. This synergistic design preserves feature decomposition
independence while establishing dynamic cross-layer information pathways,
effectively enhancing degradation decoupling capacity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel deep learning approach combines privileged information with object detection to improve litter detection, maintaining efficiency and generalizing well across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the global challenge of rising litter pollution by enhancing automated detection tools.

Method: Combines privileged information with deep learning object detection, encodes bounding box info as binary masks, and evaluates across five models.

Result: Consistent performance improvements across models, better generalization, and maintained computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The method offers a practical, efficient solution for litter detection in real-world applications.

Abstract: As litter pollution continues to rise globally, developing automated tools
capable of detecting litter effectively remains a significant challenge. This
study presents a novel approach that combines, for the first time, privileged
information with deep learning object detection to improve litter detection
while maintaining model efficiency. We evaluate our method across five widely
used object detection models, addressing challenges such as detecting small
litter and objects partially obscured by grass or stones. In addition to this,
a key contribution of our work can also be attributed to formulating a means of
encoding bounding box information as a binary mask, which can be fed to the
detection model to refine detection guidance. Through experiments on both
within-dataset evaluation on the renowned SODA dataset and cross-dataset
evaluation on the BDW and UAVVaste litter detection datasets, we demonstrate
consistent performance improvements across all models. Our approach not only
bolsters detection accuracy within the training sets but also generalises well
to other litter detection contexts. Crucially, these improvements are achieved
without increasing model complexity or adding extra layers, ensuring
computational efficiency and scalability. Our results suggest that this
methodology offers a practical solution for litter detection, balancing
accuracy and efficiency in real-world applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the SVC 2025 Multimodal Deception Detection Challenge to address cross-domain generalization in deception detection, leveraging multimodal data to improve model adaptability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deception detection methods struggle with domain shifts, limiting their real-world applicability. The challenge aims to bridge this gap by promoting cross-domain generalization.

Method: The challenge involves developing models using multimodal data (audio, video, text) to detect deception across diverse datasets, emphasizing generalization and adaptability.

Result: 21 teams participated, submitting final results, indicating strong interest and engagement in the challenge.

Conclusion: The challenge advances deception detection by fostering adaptable, explainable models and contributes to multimodal learning research.

Abstract: Deception detection is a critical task in real-world applications such as
security screening, fraud prevention, and credibility assessment. While deep
learning methods have shown promise in surpassing human-level performance,
their effectiveness often depends on the availability of high-quality and
diverse deception samples. Existing research predominantly focuses on
single-domain scenarios, overlooking the significant performance degradation
caused by domain shifts. To address this gap, we present the SVC 2025
Multimodal Deception Detection Challenge, a new benchmark designed to evaluate
cross-domain generalization in audio-visual deception detection. Participants
are required to develop models that not only perform well within individual
domains but also generalize across multiple heterogeneous datasets. By
leveraging multimodal data, including audio, video, and text, this challenge
encourages the design of models capable of capturing subtle and implicit
deceptive cues. Through this benchmark, we aim to foster the development of
more adaptable, explainable, and practically deployable deception detection
systems, advancing the broader field of multimodal learning. By the conclusion
of the workshop competition, a total of 21 teams had submitted their final
results. https://sites.google.com/view/svc-mm25 for more information.

*Zhaohong Huang,Yuxin Zhang,Mingbao Lin,Taojian Zhou,Guorong Cai,Rongrong Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DS$^2$Net introduces multi-view deep supervision for medical image segmentation, combining detail and semantic feature supervision with adaptive uncertainty-based loss, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods supervise either coarse-grained or fine-grained features in isolation, ignoring their vital relationships in medical image analysis.

Method: Proposes DS$^2$Net with Detail Enhance Module (DEM) and Semantic Enhance Module (SEM) for multi-view supervision, and an uncertainty-based loss for adaptive feature supervision.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on six benchmarks across colonoscopy, ultrasound, and microscope datasets.

Conclusion: DS$^2$Net effectively combines detail and semantic supervision with adaptive loss, setting a new standard for medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Deep Supervision Networks exhibit significant efficacy for the medical
imaging community. Nevertheless, existing work merely supervises either the
coarse-grained semantic features or fine-grained detailed features in
isolation, which compromises the fact that these two types of features hold
vital relationships in medical image analysis. We advocate the powers of
complementary feature supervision for medical image segmentation, by proposing
a Detail-Semantic Deep Supervision Network (DS$^2$Net). DS$^2$Net navigates
both low-level detailed and high-level semantic feature supervision through
Detail Enhance Module (DEM) and Semantic Enhance Module (SEM). DEM and SEM
respectively harness low-level and high-level feature maps to create detail and
semantic masks for enhancing feature supervision. This is a novel shift from
single-view deep supervision to multi-view deep supervision. DS$^2$Net is also
equipped with a novel uncertainty-based supervision loss that adaptively
assigns the supervision strength of features within distinct scales based on
their uncertainty, thus circumventing the sub-optimal heuristic design that
typifies previous works. Through extensive experiments on six benchmarks
captured under either colonoscopy, ultrasound and microscope, we demonstrate
that DS$^2$Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods for medical
image analysis.

*Hongyu Guo,Kuan Zhu,Xiangzhao Hao,Haiyun Guo,Ming Tang,Jinqiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniFGVC is a training-free framework for few-shot fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) that reformulates the task as multimodal retrieval, leveraging structured text descriptions and multimodal templates to improve generalization and avoid overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods suffer from overfitting and weak generalization when fine-tuning pre-trained models for few-shot FGVC. UniFGVC addresses this by using multimodal retrieval instead of fine-tuning.

Method: UniFGVC employs a Category-Discriminative Visual Captioner (CDV-Captioner) to generate structured text descriptions from images, constructs multimodal templates, and uses off-the-shelf encoders for retrieval in a joint space.

Result: UniFGVC outperforms prior few-shot CLIP-based methods and some fully-supervised approaches on 12 FGVC benchmarks.

Conclusion: UniFGVC provides a robust, training-free solution for few-shot FGVC with strong generalization and adaptability across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Few-shot fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) aims to leverage limited
data to enable models to discriminate subtly distinct categories. Recent works
mostly finetuned the pre-trained visual language models to achieve performance
gain, yet suffering from overfitting and weak generalization. To deal with
this, we introduce UniFGVC, a universal training-free framework that
reformulates few-shot FGVC as multimodal retrieval. First, we propose the
Category-Discriminative Visual Captioner (CDV-Captioner) to exploit the
open-world knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate a
structured text description that captures the fine-grained attribute features
distinguishing closely related classes. CDV-Captioner uses chain-of-thought
prompting and visually similar reference images to reduce hallucination and
enhance discrimination of generated captions. Using it we can convert each
image into an image-description pair, enabling more comprehensive feature
representation, and construct the multimodal category templates using few-shot
samples for the subsequent retrieval pipeline. Then, off-the-shelf vision and
text encoders embed query and template pairs, and FGVC is accomplished by
retrieving the nearest template in the joint space. UniFGVC ensures broad
compatibility with diverse MLLMs and encoders, offering reliable generalization
and adaptability across few-shot FGVC scenarios. Extensive experiments on 12
FGVC benchmarks demonstrate its consistent superiority over prior few-shot
CLIP-based methods and even several fully-supervised MLLMs-based approaches.

*Lijuan Liu,Wenfa Li,Dongbo Zhang,Shuo Wang,Shaohui Jiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IDC-Net is a unified framework for generating RGB-D video sequences with precise camera control, combining RGB and depth synthesis in a geometry-aware diffusion model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat RGB and depth generation separately, lacking spatial and geometric alignment. IDC-Net aims to address this by jointly synthesizing both for better camera control and geometric consistency.

Method: IDC-Net uses a joint learning framework with a geometry-aware diffusion model, trained on a camera-image-depth consistent dataset. It includes a geometry-aware transformer block for fine-grained camera control.

Result: IDC-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and geometric consistency, enabling direct use in 3D scene reconstruction without post-processing.

Conclusion: The joint learning framework of IDC-Net enhances RGB-D sequence generation, offering practical benefits for downstream tasks like 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: We present IDC-Net (Image-Depth Consistency Network), a novel framework
designed to generate RGB-D video sequences under explicit camera trajectory
control. Unlike approaches that treat RGB and depth generation separately,
IDC-Net jointly synthesizes both RGB images and corresponding depth maps within
a unified geometry-aware diffusion model. The joint learning framework
strengthens spatial and geometric alignment across frames, enabling more
precise camera control in the generated sequences. To support the training of
this camera-conditioned model and ensure high geometric fidelity, we construct
a camera-image-depth consistent dataset with metric-aligned RGB videos, depth
maps, and accurate camera poses, which provides precise geometric supervision
with notably improved inter-frame geometric consistency. Moreover, we introduce
a geometry-aware transformer block that enables fine-grained camera control,
enhancing control over the generated sequences. Extensive experiments show that
IDC-Net achieves improvements over state-of-the-art approaches in both visual
quality and geometric consistency of generated scene sequences. Notably, the
generated RGB-D sequences can be directly feed for downstream 3D Scene
reconstruction tasks without extra post-processing steps, showcasing the
practical benefits of our joint learning framework. See more at

*Yihua Shao,Xiaofeng Lin,Xinwei Long,Siyu Chen,Minxi Yan,Yang Liu,Ziyang Yan,Ao Ma,Hao Tang,Jingcai Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ICM-Fusion combines meta-learning and in-context adaptation to enhance multi-task generalization in LoRA models, reducing conflicts and forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA fusion methods cause inter-weight conflicts and catastrophic domain forgetting, limiting generalization in few-shot scenarios.

Method: Proposes ICM-Fusion with task vector arithmetic and Fusion VAE to dynamically balance optimization and reconstruct fused LoRA.

Result: ICM-Fusion reduces multi-tasking loss and enhances tasks in few-shot scenarios across visual and linguistic tasks.

Conclusion: ICM-Fusion improves multi-task adaptation in LoRA models, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Enabling multi-task adaptation in pre-trained Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
models is crucial for enhancing their generalization capabilities. Most
existing pre-trained LoRA fusion methods decompose weight matrices, sharing
similar parameters while merging divergent ones. However, this paradigm
inevitably induces inter-weight conflicts and leads to catastrophic domain
forgetting. While incremental learning enables adaptation to multiple tasks, it
struggles to achieve generalization in few-shot scenarios. Consequently, when
the weight data follows a long-tailed distribution, it can lead to forgetting
in the fused weights. To address this issue, we propose In-Context Meta LoRA
Fusion (ICM-Fusion), a novel framework that synergizes meta-learning with
in-context adaptation. The key innovation lies in our task vector arithmetic,
which dynamically balances conflicting optimization directions across domains
through learned manifold projections. ICM-Fusion obtains the optimal task
vector orientation for the fused model in the latent space by adjusting the
orientation of the task vectors. Subsequently, the fused LoRA is reconstructed
by a self-designed Fusion VAE (F-VAE) to realize multi-task LoRA generation. We
have conducted extensive experiments on visual and linguistic tasks, and the
experimental results demonstrate that ICM-Fusion can be adapted to a wide range
of architectural models and applied to various tasks. Compared to the current
pre-trained LoRA fusion method, ICM-Fusion fused LoRA can significantly reduce
the multi-tasking loss and can even achieve task enhancement in few-shot
scenarios.

### [58] [Audio-Assisted Face Video Restoration with Temporal and Identity Complementary Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04161)
*Yuqin Cao,Yixuan Gao,Wei Sun,Xiaohong Liu,Yulun Zhang,Xiongkuo Min*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAVN is a network for restoring degraded face videos using audio and visual correlations, outperforming existing methods in compression artifact removal, deblurring, and super-resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current face video restoration methods ignore audio-visual correlations, especially in mouth regions, and existing audio-aided methods are limited to compression artifact removal.

Method: GAVN uses identity and temporal complementary learning, capturing inter-frame temporal features in low-resolution and intra-frame identity features in high-resolution with audio and face landmarks.

Result: GAVN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in compression artifact removal, deblurring, and super-resolution.

Conclusion: GAVN effectively restores face videos by leveraging audio-visual correlations and achieves superior performance across multiple degradation types.

Abstract: Face videos accompanied by audio have become integral to our daily lives,
while they often suffer from complex degradations. Most face video restoration
methods neglect the intrinsic correlations between the visual and audio
features, especially in mouth regions. A few audio-aided face video restoration
methods have been proposed, but they only focus on compression artifact
removal. In this paper, we propose a General Audio-assisted face Video
restoration Network (GAVN) to address various types of streaming video
distortions via identity and temporal complementary learning. Specifically,
GAVN first captures inter-frame temporal features in the low-resolution space
to restore frames coarsely and save computational cost. Then, GAVN extracts
intra-frame identity features in the high-resolution space with the assistance
of audio signals and face landmarks to restore more facial details. Finally,
the reconstruction module integrates temporal features and identity features to
generate high-quality face videos. Experimental results demonstrate that GAVN
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on face video compression
artifact removal, deblurring, and super-resolution. Codes will be released upon
publication.

*Subhankar Swain,Naquee Rizwan,Nayandeep Deb,Vishwajeet Singh Solanki,Vishwa Gangadhar S,Animesh Mukherjee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dataset of 6,300 annotated memes for toxicity detection, enriched with socially relevant tags, and a tag generation module to improve meme moderation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of accessible data for meme moderation, given memes' role in spreading harmful content online.

Method: Created a dataset with binary and fine-grained toxicity labels, added metadata tags, and developed a tag generation module.

Result: Incorporating tags improved performance of state-of-the-art VLMs in detecting toxic memes.

Conclusion: The dataset and tag module provide a scalable foundation for better multimodal content moderation.

Abstract: The 2025 Global Risks Report identifies state-based armed conflict and
societal polarisation among the most pressing global threats, with social media
playing a central role in amplifying toxic discourse. Memes, as a widely used
mode of online communication, often serve as vehicles for spreading harmful
content. However, limitations in data accessibility and the high cost of
dataset curation hinder the development of robust meme moderation systems. To
address this challenge, in this work, we introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset
of 6,300 real-world meme-based posts annotated in two stages: (i) binary
classification into toxic and normal, and (ii) fine-grained labelling of toxic
memes as hateful, dangerous, or offensive. A key feature of this dataset is
that it is enriched with auxiliary metadata of socially relevant tags,
enhancing the context of each meme. In addition, we propose a tag generation
module that produces socially grounded tags, because most in-the-wild memes
often do not come with tags. Experimental results show that incorporating these
tags substantially enhances the performance of state-of-the-art VLMs detection
tasks. Our contributions offer a novel and scalable foundation for improved
content moderation in multimodal online environments.

*Jingyi Liao,Yongyi Su,Rong-Cheng Tu,Zhao Jin,Wenhao Sun,Yiting Li,Dacheng Tao,Xun Xu,Xulei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to enhance Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for specialized anomaly detection by introducing a multi-stage deliberative reasoning process and a fine-grained reward mechanism, improving accuracy and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) methods for anomaly detection lack efficient training data utilization and structured supervision, limiting their effectiveness in specialized domains.

Method: The framework includes a multi-stage deliberative reasoning process for diverse response generation and a fine-grained reward mechanism combining classification accuracy and localization supervision.

Result: The method shows significant performance improvements in adapting general vision-language models to specialized anomaly detection tasks, achieving superior accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively bridges the gap between general-purpose MLLM capabilities and the fine-grained visual discrimination needed for detecting subtle anomalies in specialized domains.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities across diverse domains, their application to specialized anomaly
detection (AD) remains constrained by domain adaptation challenges. Existing
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based approaches suffer from two
critical limitations: inadequate training data utilization when models produce
uniform responses, and insufficient supervision over reasoning processes that
encourage immediate binary decisions without deliberative analysis. We propose
a comprehensive framework addressing these limitations through two synergistic
innovations. First, we introduce a multi-stage deliberative reasoning process
that guides models from region identification to focused examination,
generating diverse response patterns essential for GRPO optimization while
enabling structured supervision over analytical workflows. Second, we develop a
fine-grained reward mechanism incorporating classification accuracy and
localization supervision, transforming binary feedback into continuous signals
that distinguish genuine analytical insight from spurious correctness.
Comprehensive evaluation across multiple industrial datasets demonstrates
substantial performance improvements in adapting general vision-language models
to specialized anomaly detection. Our method achieves superior accuracy with
efficient adaptation of existing annotations, effectively bridging the gap
between general-purpose MLLM capabilities and the fine-grained visual
discrimination required for detecting subtle manufacturing defects and
structural irregularities.

*Jin Kuang,Dong Liu,Yukuang Zhang,Shengsheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: U2CLLIE is a novel framework for low-light image enhancement that integrates uncertainty-aware enhancement and spatial-color causal correlation modeling, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches overlook intrinsic uncertainty in feature representations under dark conditions, impairing reliability and causal reasoning.

Method: U2CLLIE includes an Uncertainty-Aware Dual-domain Denoise (UaD) Module and a hierarchical causality-aware framework with LEN, NeCo, and AsC modules.

Result: U2CLLIE achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, showing robust generalization.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses uncertainty and noise in low-light conditions, enhancing image quality and reliability.

Abstract: Most existing low-light image enhancement approaches primarily focus on
architectural innovations, while often overlooking the intrinsic uncertainty
within feature representations particularly under extremely dark conditions
where degraded gradient and noise dominance severely impair model reliability
and causal reasoning. To address these issues, we propose U2CLLIE, a novel
framework that integrates uncertainty-aware enhancement and spatial-color
causal correlation modeling. From the perspective of entropy-based uncertainty,
our framework introduces two key components: (1) An Uncertainty-Aware
Dual-domain Denoise (UaD) Module, which leverages Gaussian-Guided Adaptive
Frequency Domain Feature Enhancement (G2AF) to suppress frequency-domain noise
and optimize entropy-driven representations. This module enhances spatial
texture extraction and frequency-domain noise suppression/structure refinement,
effectively mitigating gradient vanishing and noise dominance. (2) A
hierarchical causality-aware framework, where a Luminance Enhancement Network
(LEN) first performs coarse brightness enhancement on dark regions. Then,
during the encoder-decoder phase, two asymmetric causal correlation modeling
modules Neighborhood Correlation State Space (NeCo) and Adaptive Spatial-Color
Calibration (AsC) collaboratively construct hierarchical causal constraints.
These modules reconstruct and reinforce neighborhood structure and color
consistency in the feature space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
U2CLLIE achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark
datasets, exhibiting robust performance and strong generalization across
various scenes.

TL;DR: The paper explores the practical utility of large-scale vision models like ViT-22B, focusing on training stability and performance. It also investigates image generation using ViT architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the practical utility and training behavior of large-scale vision models like ViT-22B, and to explore their potential in image generation tasks.

Method: Examines ViT-22B's training in a local environment, addresses instability issues, and modifies the model for stability. Also proposes an image generation architecture using ViT and compares ViT and ViT-22B for this task.

Result: ViT-22B outperforms ViT in performance under the same parameter size. The study also successfully explores image generation with ViT architectures.

Conclusion: ViT-22B shows promise in performance and stability, and both ViT and ViT-22B can be adapted for image generation, with ViT-22B potentially being more suitable.

Abstract: There have been attempts to create large-scale structures in vision models
similar to LLM, such as ViT-22B. While this research has provided numerous
analyses and insights, our understanding of its practical utility remains
incomplete. Therefore, we examine how this model structure reacts and train in
a local environment. We also highlight the instability in training and make
some model modifications to stabilize it. The ViT-22B model, trained from
scratch, overall outperformed ViT in terms of performance under the same
parameter size. Additionally, we venture into the task of image generation,
which has not been attempted in ViT-22B. We propose an image generation
architecture using ViT and investigate which between ViT and ViT-22B is a more
suitable structure for image generation.

*Fengyi Wu,Yimian Dai,Tianfang Zhang,Yixuan Ding,Jian Yang,Ming-Ming Cheng,Zhenming Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RPCANet++ integrates RPCA with deep learning for efficient and interpretable sparse object segmentation, outperforming traditional RPCA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RPCA models are computationally heavy, rely on hyperparameters, and lack adaptability in dynamic scenarios.

Method: RPCANet++ unfolds a relaxed RPCA model into a structured network with Background Approximation, Object Extraction, and Image Restoration Modules, enhanced by Memory-Augmented and Deep Contrast Prior Modules.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse datasets, with improved interpretability via low-rankness and sparsity measurements.

Conclusion: Combines RPCA's theoretical strengths with deep learning efficiency, setting a new benchmark for sparse object segmentation.

Abstract: Robust principal component analysis (RPCA) decomposes an observation matrix
into low-rank background and sparse object components. This capability has
enabled its application in tasks ranging from image restoration to
segmentation. However, traditional RPCA models suffer from computational
burdens caused by matrix operations, reliance on finely tuned hyperparameters,
and rigid priors that limit adaptability in dynamic scenarios. To solve these
limitations, we propose RPCANet++, a sparse object segmentation framework that
fuses the interpretability of RPCA with efficient deep architectures. Our
approach unfolds a relaxed RPCA model into a structured network comprising a
Background Approximation Module (BAM), an Object Extraction Module (OEM), and
an Image Restoration Module (IRM). To mitigate inter-stage transmission loss in
the BAM, we introduce a Memory-Augmented Module (MAM) to enhance background
feature preservation, while a Deep Contrast Prior Module (DCPM) leverages
saliency cues to expedite object extraction. Extensive experiments on diverse
datasets demonstrate that RPCANet++ achieves state-of-the-art performance under
various imaging scenarios. We further improve interpretability via visual and
numerical low-rankness and sparsity measurements. By combining the theoretical
strengths of RPCA with the efficiency of deep networks, our approach sets a new
baseline for reliable and interpretable sparse object segmentation. Codes are

*Dunyuan Xu,Xikai Yang,Yaoqian Li,Jinpeng Li,Pheng-Ann Heng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MLLMU-Med, a benchmark for evaluating machine unlearning in biomedical MLLMs, addressing privacy and incorrect knowledge issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biomedical MLLMs risk privacy leaks and errors due to undetected harmful data. Retraining is impractical, so machine unlearning is proposed as a solution.

Method: A novel data generation pipeline creates synthetic private data and factual errors for benchmarking. An Unlearning Efficiency Score evaluates performance.

Result: Five unlearning methods show limited effectiveness, highlighting room for improvement.

Conclusion: MLLMU-Med provides a foundation for advancing machine unlearning research in biomedical MLLMs.

Abstract: The security of biomedical Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has
attracted increasing attention. However, training samples easily contain
private information and incorrect knowledge that are difficult to detect,
potentially leading to privacy leakage or erroneous outputs after deployment.
An intuitive idea is to reprocess the training set to remove unwanted content
and retrain the model from scratch. Yet, this is impractical due to significant
computational costs, especially for large language models. Machine unlearning
has emerged as a solution to this problem, which avoids complete retraining by
selectively removing undesired knowledge derived from harmful samples while
preserving required capabilities on normal cases. However, there exist no
available datasets to evaluate the unlearning quality for security protection
in biomedical MLLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose the first benchmark
Multimodal Large Language Model Unlearning for BioMedicine (MLLMU-Med) built
upon our novel data generation pipeline that effectively integrates synthetic
private data and factual errors into the training set. Our benchmark targets
two key scenarios: 1) Privacy protection, where patient private information is
mistakenly included in the training set, causing models to unintentionally
respond with private data during inference; and 2) Incorrectness removal, where
wrong knowledge derived from unreliable sources is embedded into the dataset,
leading to unsafe model responses. Moreover, we propose a novel Unlearning
Efficiency Score that directly reflects the overall unlearning performance
across different subsets. We evaluate five unlearning approaches on MLLMU-Med
and find that these methods show limited effectiveness in removing harmful
knowledge from biomedical MLLMs, indicating significant room for improvement.
This work establishes a new pathway for further research in this promising
field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAT (Gather and Trace) is a novel model for Video TextVQA, improving accuracy and efficiency by focusing on text instances and their dynamic evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frame-level frameworks suffer from redundant text entities and implicit relation modeling, limiting accuracy and efficiency.

Method: GAT uses a context-aggregated instance gathering module for unified textual representation and an instance-focused trajectory tracing module for spatio-temporal relationships.

Result: GAT outperforms existing methods by 3.86% in accuracy and is ten times faster than video large language models.

Conclusion: GAT is effective and generalizable, setting a new state-of-the-art for Video TextVQA.

Abstract: Video text-based visual question answering (Video TextVQA) aims to answer
questions by explicitly reading and reasoning about the text involved in a
video. Most works in this field follow a frame-level framework which suffers
from redundant text entities and implicit relation modeling, resulting in
limitations in both accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we rethink the
Video TextVQA task from an instance-oriented perspective and propose a novel
model termed GAT (Gather and Trace). First, to obtain accurate reading result
for each video text instance, a context-aggregated instance gathering module is
designed to integrate the visual appearance, layout characteristics, and
textual contents of the related entities into a unified textual representation.
Then, to capture dynamic evolution of text in the video flow, an
instance-focused trajectory tracing module is utilized to establish
spatio-temporal relationships between instances and infer the final answer.
Extensive experiments on several public Video TextVQA datasets validate the
effectiveness and generalization of our framework. GAT outperforms existing
Video TextVQA methods, video-language pretraining methods, and video large
language models in both accuracy and inference speed. Notably, GAT surpasses
the previous state-of-the-art Video TextVQA methods by 3.86\% in accuracy and
achieves ten times of faster inference speed than video large language models.

TL;DR: BootSC is a deep spectral clustering model that integrates all stages of spectral clustering into a single end-to-end network, addressing disjoint optimization and limited representation capacity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the disjoint optimization process and limited representation capacity in traditional spectral clustering.

Method: Jointly learns affinity matrix construction, spectral embedding, and k-means clustering using a single network, with optimal-transport-derived supervision and orthogonal re-parameterization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, e.g., 16% NMI improvement on ImageNet-Dogs.

Conclusion: BootSC effectively enhances spectral clustering by unifying and optimizing all stages, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Spectral clustering is a leading clustering method. Two of its major
shortcomings are the disjoint optimization process and the limited
representation capacity. To address these issues, we propose a deep spectral
clustering model (named BootSC), which jointly learns all stages of spectral
clustering -- affinity matrix construction, spectral embedding, and $k$-means
clustering -- using a single network in an end-to-end manner. BootSC leverages
effective and efficient optimal-transport-derived supervision to bootstrap the
affinity matrix and the cluster assignment matrix. Moreover, a
semantically-consistent orthogonal re-parameterization technique is introduced
to orthogonalize spectral embeddings, significantly enhancing the
discrimination capability. Experimental results indicate that BootSC achieves
state-of-the-art clustering performance. For example, it accomplishes a notable
16\% NMI improvement over the runner-up method on the challenging ImageNet-Dogs
dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/spdj2271/BootSC.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViFP is a framework to enhance visual-language model reasoning by detecting false positives (FPs) and improving reasoning paths. It uses sub-question templates, multi-turn QA, and a dynamic CoT mechanism to reduce logical errors while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for VLM reasoning suffer from high training costs, poor generalization, and reliance on specific datasets. ViFP aims to address these by improving reasoning reliability and reducing FPs.

Method: ViFP constructs sub-question templates for core visual reasoning dimensions, builds reasoning paths via multi-turn QA, dynamically analyzes path consistency, and uses an adaptive CoT mechanism to guide reasoning.

Result: ViFP improves accuracy by up to 5.4% on A-OKVQA, surpassing prior methods, and significantly reduces FPs. It also introduces the VoC metric for reliability evaluation.

Conclusion: ViFP effectively enhances reasoning reliability in VLMs by addressing FP issues, improving accuracy, and providing a quantitative evaluation tool (VoC).

Abstract: In visual-language model (VLM) reasoning, false positive(FP) reasoning occurs
when a model generates a correct answer but follows an incorrect reasoning
path. Existing methods based on specific multi-step reasoning datasets and
reinforcement learning strategies, leading to high training costs and limited
generalization. In this work, we propose ViFP, a general framework for
enhancing visual reasoning reliability. It improves both answer accuracy and
reasoning soundness by detecting FPs. ViFP tackles the limitations of dataset
dependency and poor generalization by constructing sub-question templates
grounded in the core dimensions of visual reasoning, such as object
localization, characteristic description, and object discovery. ViFP then
builds effective reasoning paths via multi-turn QA to improve reasoning
accuracy. Meanwhile, ViFP dynamically analyzes the consistency of reasoning
path to identify potential FPs, and introduces a targeted chain-of-thought
(CoT) mechanism that adaptively guides both FP and non-FP samples. Thereby
reducing logical errors in the reasoning path while preserving accuracy.
Finally, we introduce a reliability evaluation metric-VoC, which integrates
answer accuracy and the FP rate, providing a quantitative tool to assess
whether a VLM not only answers correctly, but also reasons reliably. Our
experiments on closed-source VLMs show that ViFP consistently improves
performance across three datasets: A-OKVQA, OKVQA, and FVQA. On A-OKVQA, ViFP
improves accuracy by up to 5.4%, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by
4.3%, and significantly reduces the number of FPs, validating its benefits in
enhancing reasoning reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges like misdiagnosis of small lesions and dimensionality differences in multimodal medical data.

Method: MMCAF-Net uses a feature pyramid structure, 3D multi-scale convolutional attention, and a multi-scale cross-attention module for feature extraction and fusion.

Result: Tested on the Lung-PET-CT-Dx dataset, MMCAF-Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in diagnostic accuracy.

Conclusion: MMCAF-Net effectively enhances multimodal data integration and diagnostic performance, with code publicly available.

Abstract: The diagnosis of medical diseases faces challenges such as the misdiagnosis
of small lesions. Deep learning, particularly multimodal approaches, has shown
great potential in the field of medical disease diagnosis. However, the
differences in dimensionality between medical imaging and electronic health
record data present challenges for effective alignment and fusion. To address
these issues, we propose the Multimodal Multiscale Cross-Attention Fusion
Network (MMCAF-Net). This model employs a feature pyramid structure combined
with an efficient 3D multi-scale convolutional attention module to extract
lesion-specific features from 3D medical images. To further enhance multimodal
data integration, MMCAF-Net incorporates a multi-scale cross-attention module,
which resolves dimensional inconsistencies, enabling more effective feature
fusion. We evaluated MMCAF-Net on the Lung-PET-CT-Dx dataset, and the results
showed a significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing current
state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

TL;DR: The paper identifies bottlenecks in open-vocabulary segmentation models and proposes oracle components to address them, offering insights for future research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current open-vocabulary models fail to recognize concepts outside training taxonomies, and performance has plateaued for years.

Method: Introduces novel oracle components leveraging groundtruth information to identify and decouple bottlenecks.

Result: Validation experiments reveal key empirical findings about open-vocabulary model failures.

Conclusion: The study provides actionable insights to advance open-vocabulary segmentation research.

Abstract: Standard segmentation setups are unable to deliver models that can recognize
concepts outside the training taxonomy. Open-vocabulary approaches promise to
close this gap through language-image pretraining on billions of image-caption
pairs. Unfortunately, we observe that the promise is not delivered due to
several bottlenecks that have caused the performance to plateau for almost two
years. This paper proposes novel oracle components that identify and decouple
these bottlenecks by taking advantage of the groundtruth information. The
presented validation experiments deliver important empirical findings that
provide a deeper insight into the failures of open-vocabulary models and
suggest prominent approaches to unlock the future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SplitGaussian decouples static and dynamic scene components to improve 3D reconstruction from monocular video, addressing motion leakage and flickering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods entangle static and dynamic elements, causing motion artifacts and distortions.

Method: Proposes SplitGaussian, a framework that explicitly separates static and dynamic representations, allowing only dynamic components to deform over time.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art in rendering quality, geometric stability, and motion separation.

Conclusion: Disentangled modeling enhances temporal consistency, fidelity, and convergence speed.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular video remains fundamentally
challenging due to the need to jointly infer motion, structure, and appearance
from limited observations. Existing dynamic scene reconstruction methods based
on Gaussian Splatting often entangle static and dynamic elements in a shared
representation, leading to motion leakage, geometric distortions, and temporal
flickering. We identify that the root cause lies in the coupled modeling of
geometry and appearance across time, which hampers both stability and
interpretability. To address this, we propose \textbf{SplitGaussian}, a novel
framework that explicitly decomposes scene representations into static and
dynamic components. By decoupling motion modeling from background geometry and
allowing only the dynamic branch to deform over time, our method prevents
motion artifacts in static regions while supporting view- and time-dependent
appearance refinement. This disentangled design not only enhances temporal
consistency and reconstruction fidelity but also accelerates convergence.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SplitGaussian outperforms prior
state-of-the-art methods in rendering quality, geometric stability, and motion
separation.

TL;DR: This survey reviews continual learning challenges in vision-language models (VLM-CL), identifies core failure modes, proposes a taxonomy of solutions, and highlights future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of VLMs to catastrophic forgetting in continual learning settings, given their unique cross-modal challenges.

Method: Identifies three core failure modes and proposes a taxonomy of solutions: Multi-Modal Replay Strategies, Cross-Modal Regularization, and Parameter-Efficient Adaptation.

Result: Highlights the need for better benchmarks and outlines open problems like continual pre-training and compositional zero-shot learning.

Conclusion: The survey serves as a diagnostic reference for developing lifelong vision-language systems, with resources available on GitHub.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse multimodal tasks by leveraging large-scale pre-training. However,
enabling them to learn continually from non-stationary data remains a major
challenge, as their cross-modal alignment and generalization capabilities are
particularly vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting. Unlike traditional unimodal
continual learning (CL), VLMs face unique challenges such as cross-modal
feature drift, parameter interference due to shared architectures, and
zero-shot capability erosion. This survey offers the first focused and
systematic review of continual learning for VLMs (VLM-CL). We begin by
identifying the three core failure modes that degrade performance in VLM-CL.
Based on these, we propose a challenge-driven taxonomy that maps solutions to
their target problems: (1) \textit{Multi-Modal Replay Strategies} address
cross-modal drift through explicit or implicit memory mechanisms; (2)
\textit{Cross-Modal Regularization} preserves modality alignment during
updates; and (3) \textit{Parameter-Efficient Adaptation} mitigates parameter
interference with modular or low-rank updates. We further analyze current
evaluation protocols, datasets, and metrics, highlighting the need for better
benchmarks that capture VLM-specific forgetting and compositional
generalization. Finally, we outline open problems and future directions,
including continual pre-training and compositional zero-shot learning. This
survey aims to serve as a comprehensive and diagnostic reference for

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayerT2V introduces a layered approach for Text-to-Video generation to handle multi-object motion, improving performance over SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2V models struggle with multi-object motion and intersecting trajectories due to semantic conflicts.

Method: LayerT2V composites videos layer by layer, separating background and foreground objects for better control.

Result: Achieves 1.4x and 4.5x improvements in mIoU and AP50 metrics over SOTA methods.

Conclusion: LayerT2V effectively addresses multi-object motion challenges in T2V generation.

Abstract: Controlling object motion trajectories in Text-to-Video (T2V) generation is a
challenging and relatively under-explored area, particularly in scenarios
involving multiple moving objects. Most community models and datasets in the
T2V domain are designed for single-object motion, limiting the performance of
current generative models in multi-object tasks. Additionally, existing motion
control methods in T2V either lack support for multi-object motion scenes or
experience severe performance degradation when object trajectories intersect,
primarily due to the semantic conflicts in colliding regions. To address these
limitations, we introduce LayerT2V, the first approach for generating video by
compositing background and foreground objects layer by layer. This layered
generation enables flexible integration of multiple independent elements within
a video, positioning each element on a distinct "layer" and thus facilitating
coherent multi-object synthesis while enhancing control over the generation
process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of LayerT2V in
generating complex multi-object scenarios, showcasing 1.4x and 4.5x
improvements in mIoU and AP50 metrics over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

### [73] [Intention Enhanced Diffusion Model for Multimodal Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04229)
*Yu Liu,Zhijie Liu,Xiao Ren,You-Fu Li,He Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based model for pedestrian trajectory prediction incorporates motion intentions, improving interpretability and precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous vehicles, but existing models often overlook motion intentions, limiting performance.

Method: Proposes a diffusion-based model with a pedestrian intention recognition module, decomposing intentions into lateral and longitudinal components, and using an efficient guidance mechanism.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on ETH and UCY benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Incorporating motion intentions enhances the interpretability and precision of trajectory predictions.

Abstract: Predicting pedestrian motion trajectories is critical for path planning and
motion control of autonomous vehicles. However, accurately forecasting crowd
trajectories remains a challenging task due to the inherently multimodal and
uncertain nature of human motion. Recent diffusion-based models have shown
promising results in capturing the stochasticity of pedestrian behavior for
trajectory prediction. However, few diffusion-based approaches explicitly
incorporate the underlying motion intentions of pedestrians, which can limit
the interpretability and precision of prediction models. In this work, we
propose a diffusion-based multimodal trajectory prediction model that
incorporates pedestrians' motion intentions into the prediction framework. The
motion intentions are decomposed into lateral and longitudinal components, and
a pedestrian intention recognition module is introduced to enable the model to
effectively capture these intentions. Furthermore, we adopt an efficient
guidance mechanism that facilitates the generation of interpretable
trajectories. The proposed framework is evaluated on two widely used human
trajectory prediction benchmarks, ETH and UCY, on which it is compared against
state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate that our method
achieves competitive performance.

*Saifullah Saifullah,Stefan Agne,Andreas Dengel,Sheraz Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DocVCE, a novel method using generative counterfactuals to explain document image classification models, addressing interpretability gaps in existing feature-importance maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving transparency and reliability of AI-driven document processing systems, especially in high-stakes applications where biases or spurious correlations could have serious consequences.

Method: Proposes DocVCE, leveraging latent diffusion models and classifier guidance to generate visual counterfactual explanations, followed by hierarchical patch-wise refinement.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on 3 datasets (RVL-CDIP, Tobacco3482, DocLayNet) and 3 models (ResNet, ConvNeXt, DiT) using validity, closeness, and realism criteria.

Conclusion: First work to explore generative counterfactual explanations in document image analysis, providing actionable insights into model decision-making.

Abstract: As black-box AI-driven decision-making systems become increasingly widespread
in modern document processing workflows, improving their transparency and
reliability has become critical, especially in high-stakes applications where
biases or spurious correlations in decision-making could lead to serious
consequences. One vital component often found in such document processing
workflows is document image classification, which, despite its widespread use,
remains difficult to explain. While some recent works have attempted to explain
the decisions of document image classification models through
feature-importance maps, these maps are often difficult to interpret and fail
to provide insights into the global features learned by the model. In this
paper, we aim to bridge this research gap by introducing generative document
counterfactuals that provide meaningful insights into the model's
decision-making through actionable explanations. In particular, we propose
DocVCE, a novel approach that leverages latent diffusion models in combination
with classifier guidance to first generate plausible in-distribution visual
counterfactual explanations, and then performs hierarchical patch-wise
refinement to search for a refined counterfactual that is closest to the target
factual image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a
rigorous qualitative and quantitative assessment on 3 different document
classification datasets -- RVL-CDIP, Tobacco3482, and DocLayNet -- and 3
different models -- ResNet, ConvNeXt, and DiT -- using well-established
evaluation criteria such as validity, closeness, and realism. To the best of
the authors' knowledge, this is the first work to explore generative
counterfactual explanations in document image analysis.

TL;DR: The paper explores using CNNs for object classification in SAR data, comparing simulated and reconstructed images, and applies this to identify ice types in real SAR imagery, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage CNNs for classifying objects and ice types in SAR data, addressing challenges in geometric and environmental classification.

Method: Uses a single scattering approximation with CNNs on simulated and reconstructed SAR data, and applies it to real Sentinel-1 imagery.

Result: Achieves high classification accuracy (â¥75%) in both simulated and real SAR data experiments.

Conclusion: CNNs are effective for SAR-based classification tasks, and antenna height impacts classification success.

Abstract: We consider the problem in Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) of identifying and
classifying objects located on the ground by means of Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs). Specifically, we adopt a single scattering approximation to
classify the shape of the object using both simulated SAR data and
reconstructed images from this data, and we compare the success of these
approaches. We then identify ice types in real SAR imagery from the satellite
Sentinel-1. In both experiments we achieve a promising high classification
accuracy ($\geq$75\%). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of CNNs in
using SAR data for both geometric and environmental classification tasks. Our
investigation also explores the effect of SAR data acquisition at different
antenna heights on our ability to classify objects successfully.

*Muhua Zhu,Xinhao Jin,Chengbo Wang,Yongcong Zhang,Yifei Xue,Tie Ji,Yizhen Lao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PIS3R is a novel image stitching method using deep 3D reconstruction to handle large parallax, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing stitching methods struggle with large parallax due to depth variations in 3D scenes.

Method: Uses a transformer for 3D reconstruction, reprojects points for alignment, and refines results with a diffusion module.

Result: Accurate stitching for large parallax, preserving geometric integrity and outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: PIS3R is robust for large parallax and useful for downstream 3D tasks like SfM.

Abstract: Image stitching aim to align two images taken from different viewpoints into
one seamless, wider image. However, when the 3D scene contains depth variations
and the camera baseline is significant, noticeable parallax occurs-meaning the
relative positions of scene elements differ substantially between views. Most
existing stitching methods struggle to handle such images with large parallax
effectively. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose an image
stitching solution called PIS3R that is robust to very large parallax based on
the novel concept of deep 3D reconstruction. First, we apply visual geometry
grounded transformer to two input images with very large parallax to obtain
both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, as well as the dense 3D scene
reconstruction. Subsequently, we reproject reconstructed dense point cloud onto
a designated reference view using the recovered camera parameters, achieving
pixel-wise alignment and generating an initial stitched image. Finally, to
further address potential artifacts such as holes or noise in the initial
stitching, we propose a point-conditioned image diffusion module to obtain the
refined result.Compared with existing methods, our solution is very large
parallax tolerant and also provides results that fully preserve the geometric
integrity of all pixels in the 3D photogrammetric context, enabling direct
applicability to downstream 3D vision tasks such as SfM. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides accurate stitching results for
images with very large parallax, and outperforms the existing methods
qualitatively and quantitatively.

Abstract: The study of rodent social behavior has shifted in the last years from
relying on direct human observation to more nuanced approaches integrating
computational methods in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning.
While conventional approaches introduce bias and can fail to capture the
complexity of rodent social interactions, modern approaches bridging computer

benefits, the integration of AI into social behavior research also poses
several challenges. Here we discuss the main steps involved and the tools

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAV, a framework for vehicle part segmentation, addressing SAM's limitations by integrating a knowledge graph and context retrieval. It also releases a new dataset, VehicleSeg10K.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large segmentation models like SAM lack semantic labels and text-prompt functionality for vehicle part segmentation, limiting their practical use.

Method: SAV combines a SAM-based encoder-decoder, a vehicle part knowledge graph, and a context retrieval module to improve segmentation.

Result: The framework is tested on VehicleSeg10K and other datasets, showing improved performance.

Conclusion: SAV effectively addresses SAM's limitations and provides a benchmark for future research, with plans to release the dataset and code.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, vehicle perception,
particularly detection and segmentation, has placed increasingly higher demands
on algorithmic performance. Pre-trained large segmentation models, especially
Segment Anything Model (SAM), have sparked significant interest and inspired
new research directions in artificial intelligence. However, SAM cannot be
directly applied to the fine-grained task of vehicle part segmentation, as its
text-prompted segmentation functionality is not publicly accessible, and the
mask regions generated by its default mode lack semantic labels, limiting its
utility in structured, category-specific segmentation tasks. To address these
limitations, we propose SAV, a novel framework comprising three core
components: a SAM-based encoder-decoder, a vehicle part knowledge graph, and a
context sample retrieval encoding module. The knowledge graph explicitly models
the spatial and geometric relationships among vehicle parts through a
structured ontology, effectively encoding prior structural knowledge.
Meanwhile, the context retrieval module enhances segmentation by identifying
and leveraging visually similar vehicle instances from training data, providing
rich contextual priors for improved generalization. Furthermore, we introduce a
new large-scale benchmark dataset for vehicle part segmentation, named
VehicleSeg10K, which contains 11,665 high-quality pixel-level annotations
across diverse scenes and viewpoints. We conduct comprehensive experiments on
this dataset and two other datasets, benchmarking multiple representative
baselines to establish a solid foundation for future research and comparison. %

*Duzhen Zhang,Yong Ren,Wei Cong,Junhao Zheng,Qiaoyi Su,Shuncheng Jia,Zhong-Zhi Li,Xuanle Zhao,Ye Bai,Feilong Chen,Qi Tian,Tielin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper challenges the assumption that Direct Fine-Tuning (DFT) in Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) suffers from severe forgetting, showing PVMs retain knowledge well. It proposes DFT*, a simple enhancement to DFT, outperforming complex methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reassess the assumption that DFT in CSS is highly prone to catastrophic forgetting and to explore the true anti-forgetting capabilities of Pre-trained Vision Models (PVMs).

Method: Systematically evaluates DFT under eight CSS settings using Pascal VOC 2012 and ADE20K benchmarks with ResNet101 and Swin-B backbones. Proposes DFT* by freezing backbones and classifiers and pre-allocating future classifiers.

Result: PVMs retain knowledge with minimal forgetting under DFT. DFT* outperforms 16 state-of-the-art CSS methods with fewer parameters and less training time.

Conclusion: DFT* is a simple, effective solution for CSS, leveraging PVMs' inherent anti-forgetting capabilities and outperforming complex methods.

Abstract: Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) seeks to incrementally learn to segment
novel classes while preserving knowledge of previously encountered ones. Recent
advancements in CSS have been largely driven by the adoption of Pre-trained
Vision Models (PVMs) as backbones. Among existing strategies, Direct
Fine-Tuning (DFT), which sequentially fine-tunes the model across classes,
remains the most straightforward approach. Prior work often regards DFT as a
performance lower bound due to its presumed vulnerability to severe
catastrophic forgetting, leading to the development of numerous complex
mitigation techniques. However, we contend that this prevailing assumption is
flawed. In this paper, we systematically revisit forgetting in DFT across two
standard benchmarks, Pascal VOC 2012 and ADE20K, under eight CSS settings using
two representative PVM backbones: ResNet101 and Swin-B. Through a detailed
probing analysis, our findings reveal that existing methods significantly
underestimate the inherent anti-forgetting capabilities of PVMs. Even under
DFT, PVMs retain previously learned knowledge with minimal forgetting. Further
investigation of the feature space indicates that the observed forgetting
primarily arises from the classifier's drift away from the PVM, rather than
from degradation of the backbone representations. Based on this insight, we
propose DFT*, a simple yet effective enhancement to DFT that incorporates
strategies such as freezing the PVM backbone and previously learned
classifiers, as well as pre-allocating future classifiers. Extensive
experiments show that DFT* consistently achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to sixteen state-of-the-art CSS methods, while requiring
substantially fewer trainable parameters and less training time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes PKSS-Align, a robust point cloud registration method handling similarity transformations, noise, and defects without training or complex features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address sensitivity to transformations, noise, and incomplete structures in point cloud registration.

Method: Uses Pre-Kendall shape space (PKSS) for shape feature-based similarity, avoiding point-to-point metrics, and employs a manifold metric robust to Euclidean variations.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in efficiency and robustness.

Conclusion: PKSS-Align is effective, efficient, and practical for diverse point cloud registration challenges.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a classical topic in the field of 3D Vision and
Computer Graphics. Generally, the implementation of registration is typically
sensitive to similarity transformations (translation, scaling, and rotation),
noisy points, and incomplete geometric structures. Especially, the non-uniform
scales and defective parts of point clouds increase probability of struck local
optima in registration task. In this paper, we propose a robust point cloud
registration PKSS-Align that can handle various influences, including
similarity transformations, non-uniform densities, random noisy points, and
defective parts. The proposed method measures shape feature-based similarity
between point clouds on the Pre-Kendall shape space (PKSS),
\textcolor{black}{which is a shape measurement-based scheme and doesn't require
point-to-point or point-to-plane metric.} The employed measurement can be
regarded as the manifold metric that is robust to various representations in
the Euclidean coordinate system. Benefited from the measurement, the
transformation matrix can be directly generated for point clouds with mentioned
influences at the same time. The proposed method does not require data training
and complex feature encoding. Based on a simple parallel acceleration, it can
achieve significant improvement for efficiency and feasibility in practice.
Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the relevant
state-of-the-art methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of novel view synthesis with diverse baseline settings, including sparse input views with varying baselines.

Method: Combines MVS and MDE features, introduces a projection-and-sampling mechanism for deep depth fusion, and uses 3D Gaussian representations for efficiency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on DTU, RealEstate10K, and shows zero-shot promise on LLFF and Mip-NeRF 360.

Conclusion: MuRF effectively handles diverse baselines and scenarios, improving rendering quality and efficiency.

Abstract: We present Multi-Baseline Gaussian Splatting (MuRF), a generalized
feed-forward approach for novel view synthesis that effectively handles diverse
baseline settings, including sparse input views with both small and large
baselines. Specifically, we integrate features from Multi-View Stereo (MVS) and
Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) to enhance feature representations for
generalizable reconstruction. Next, We propose a projection-and-sampling
mechanism for deep depth fusion, which constructs a fine probability volume to
guide the regression of the feature map. Furthermore, We introduce a
reference-view loss to improve geometry and optimization efficiency. We
leverage 3D Gaussian representations to accelerate training and inference time
while enhancing rendering quality. MuRF achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple baseline settings and diverse scenarios ranging from simple
objects (DTU) to complex indoor and outdoor scenes (RealEstate10K). We also
demonstrate promising zero-shot performance on the LLFF and Mip-NeRF 360
datasets.

*Yifan Wang,Ziyi Liu,Xiaolong Sun,Jiawei Wang,Hongmin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Length-Aware Transformer (LATR) for Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG), improving query specialization by leveraging length priors to reduce redundancy and enhance performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DETR-based TSG models suffer from overlapping query roles due to lack of explicit supervision, leading to redundant predictions.

Method: LATR divides queries into three groups (short, middle, long durations) and introduces a length classification task to suppress mismatched predictions, ensuring query specialization.

Result: LATR achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public benchmarks, with ablation studies confirming the importance of length priors.

Conclusion: Incorporating length priors into TSG via LATR effectively reduces redundancy and improves localization accuracy.

Abstract: Temporal sentence grounding (TSG) is a highly challenging task aiming to
localize the temporal segment within an untrimmed video corresponding to a
given natural language description. Benefiting from the design of learnable
queries, the DETR-based models have achieved substantial advancements in the
TSG task. However, the absence of explicit supervision often causes the learned
queries to overlap in roles, leading to redundant predictions. Therefore, we
propose to improve TSG by making each query fulfill its designated role,
leveraging the length priors of the video-description pairs. In this paper, we
introduce the Length-Aware Transformer (LATR) for TSG, which assigns different
queries to handle predictions based on varying temporal lengths. Specifically,
we divide all queries into three groups, responsible for segments with short,
middle, and long temporal durations, respectively. During training, an
additional length classification task is introduced. Predictions from queries
with mismatched lengths are suppressed, guiding each query to specialize in its
designated function. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
LATR, achieving state-of-the-art performance on three public benchmarks.
Furthermore, the ablation studies validate the contribution of each component
of our method and the critical role of incorporating length priors into the TSG
task.

TL;DR: The paper proposes MAEPD, a foundational model for DAS signal recognition using a Masked Autoencoder, pretrained on diverse datasets and fine-tuned with Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) for efficient downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data distribution disparities and limited labeled training data in DAS applications, improving cross-domain generalization.

Method: Pretrain MAEPD on 635,860 diverse DAS samples using self-supervised mask reconstruction, then fine-tune with VPT for downstream tasks.

Result: Achieves 96.94% accuracy in gait recognition with 0.322% parameters tuned, outperforming Full Fine Tuning by 0.61% and reducing training time by 45%.

Conclusion: MAEPD is a robust, efficient, and scalable foundational model for DAS signal recognition, offering a novel paradigm for generalization.

Abstract: Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) technology finds growing applications
across various domains. However, data distribution disparities due to
heterogeneous sensing environments pose challenges for data-driven artificial
intelligence (AI) models, limiting cross-domain generalization and facing a
shortage of labeled training data. To address these issues, this study proposes
a foundational model for DAS signal recognition based on a Masked Autoencoder,
named MAEPD. The MAEPD model is pretrained on a dataset of 635,860 samples,
encompassing DAS gait spatiotemporal signals, 2D GASF images for perimeter
security, 2D time-frequency images for pipeline leakage, and open-dataset
signals including whale vocalizations and seismic activities, using a
self-supervised mask reconstruction task to capture deep semantic features of
DAS signals. Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) is employed for downstream recognition
tasks. This method freezes the pretrained backbone parameters and fine-tunes
only a small set of learnable visual prompt vectors inserted into the
Transformer encoder layers. Experiments on the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Super
platform validate MAEPD using indoor gait recognition as a downstream task. The
VPT-Deep approach achieves a classification accuracy of 96.94% with just 0.322%
of parameters fine-tuned, surpassing the traditional Full Fine Tuning (FFT)
method by 0.61% and reducing training time by 45%. The model also exhibits
robust performance in pipeline leakage detection, confirming the generality,
efficiency, and scalability of MAEPD as a foundational model. This approach
offers a novel paradigm for addressing the limited generalization of signal
recognition models in the DAS domain.

TL;DR: TempFlow-GRPO improves text-to-image generation by addressing temporal uniformity in reinforcement learning, introducing trajectory branching and noise-aware weighting for better alignment with human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flow matching models for text-to-image generation struggle with fine-grained reward-based optimization due to uniform credit assignment and sparse rewards.

Method: TempFlow-GRPO introduces trajectory branching for process rewards and noise-aware weighting to modulate policy optimization by timestep.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in human preference alignment and text-to-image benchmarks.

Conclusion: TempFlow-GRPO effectively addresses temporal uniformity, enabling efficient exploration and optimal convergence in flow-based generation.

Abstract: Recent flow matching models for text-to-image generation have achieved
remarkable quality, yet their integration with reinforcement learning for human
preference alignment remains suboptimal, hindering fine-grained reward-based
optimization. We observe that the key impediment to effective GRPO training of
flow models is the temporal uniformity assumption in existing approaches:
sparse terminal rewards with uniform credit assignment fail to capture the
varying criticality of decisions across generation timesteps, resulting in
inefficient exploration and suboptimal convergence. To remedy this shortcoming,
we introduce \textbf{TempFlow-GRPO} (Temporal Flow GRPO), a principled GRPO
framework that captures and exploits the temporal structure inherent in
flow-based generation. TempFlow-GRPO introduces two key innovations: (i) a
trajectory branching mechanism that provides process rewards by concentrating
stochasticity at designated branching points, enabling precise credit
assignment without requiring specialized intermediate reward models; and (ii) a
noise-aware weighting scheme that modulates policy optimization according to
the intrinsic exploration potential of each timestep, prioritizing learning
during high-impact early stages while ensuring stable refinement in later
phases. These innovations endow the model with temporally-aware optimization
that respects the underlying generative dynamics, leading to state-of-the-art
performance in human preference alignment and standard text-to-image
benchmarks.

TL;DR: RiemanLine introduces a minimal Riemannian manifold-based representation for 3D lines, accommodating both individual lines and parallel-line groups, improving accuracy and reducing parameter dimensionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing representations ignore structural regularities like parallel lines, common in man-made environments, limiting efficiency and accuracy in camera localization and mapping.

Method: Decouples lines into global (vanishing direction on a unit sphere) and local (scaled normal vectors) components, reducing parameter space and embedding parallelism naturally. Integrated into a factor graph for unified optimization.

Result: Achieves more accurate pose estimation and line reconstruction, reduces parameter dimensionality, and improves convergence stability on benchmarks like ICL-NUIM and TartanAir.

Conclusion: RiemanLine provides a compact, efficient representation for 3D lines, enhancing performance in structured environments.

Abstract: Minimal parametrization of 3D lines plays a critical role in camera
localization and structural mapping. Existing representations in robotics and
computer vision predominantly handle independent lines, overlooking structural
regularities such as sets of parallel lines that are pervasive in man-made
environments. This paper introduces \textbf{RiemanLine}, a unified minimal
representation for 3D lines formulated on Riemannian manifolds that jointly
accommodates both individual lines and parallel-line groups. Our key idea is to
decouple each line landmark into global and local components: a shared
vanishing direction optimized on the unit sphere $\mathcal{S}^2$, and scaled
normal vectors constrained on orthogonal subspaces, enabling compact encoding
of structural regularities. For $n$ parallel lines, the proposed representation
reduces the parameter space from $4n$ (orthonormal form) to $2n+2$, naturally
embedding parallelism without explicit constraints. We further integrate this
parameterization into a factor graph framework, allowing global direction
alignment and local reprojection optimization within a unified manifold-based
bundle adjustment. Extensive experiments on ICL-NUIM, TartanAir, and synthetic
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves significantly more accurate
pose estimation and line reconstruction, while reducing parameter
dimensionality and improving convergence stability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RotatedMVPS improves shape and reflectance recovery under natural light by ensuring light consistency and integrating data priors from single-view methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MVPS methods require controlled settings or neglect reflectance recovery, limiting their use in natural illumination scenarios.

Method: RotatedMVPS uses a rotation stage for light consistency and integrates learning-based single-view priors into MVPS.

Result: The method enhances accuracy in shape and reflectance recovery, validated on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: RotatedMVPS is effective for high-fidelity shape and reflectance recovery under natural illumination.

Abstract: Multiview photometric stereo (MVPS) seeks to recover high-fidelity surface
shapes and reflectances from images captured under varying views and
illuminations. However, existing MVPS methods often require controlled darkroom
settings for varying illuminations or overlook the recovery of reflectances and
illuminations properties, limiting their applicability in natural illumination
scenarios and downstream inverse rendering tasks. In this paper, we propose
RotatedMVPS to solve shape and reflectance recovery under rotated natural
light, achievable with a practical rotation stage. By ensuring light
consistency across different camera and object poses, our method reduces the
unknowns associated with complex environment light. Furthermore, we integrate
data priors from off-the-shelf learning-based single-view photometric stereo
methods into our MVPS framework, significantly enhancing the accuracy of shape
and reflectance recovery. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TSPO improves MLLMs' long-video understanding via reinforcement learning for event-aware keyframe selection and joint optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with long-duration videos due to context limits and sparse frame sampling, missing critical events or relying on pre-trained models.

Method: Proposes TSPO: a trainable event-aware temporal agent and reinforcement learning paradigm for joint keyframe selection and language generation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on long-video benchmarks and shows transferability across Video-MLLMs.

Conclusion: TSPO effectively addresses long-video challenges, enhancing MLLMs' understanding through optimized temporal sampling.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
progress in vision-language tasks, yet they still face challenges when
processing long-duration video inputs. The limitation arises from MLLMs'
context limit and training costs, necessitating sparse frame sampling before
feeding videos into MLLMs. Existing video MLLMs adopt training-free uniform
sampling or keyframe search, which may miss critical events or be constrained
by the pre-trained models' event understanding capabilities. Meanwhile,
building a training-based method remains challenging due to the unsupervised
and non-differentiable nature of sparse frame sampling. To address these
problems, we propose Temporal Sampling Policy Optimization (TSPO), advancing
MLLMs' long-form video-language understanding via reinforcement learning.
Specifically, we first propose a trainable event-aware temporal agent, which
captures event-query correlation for performing probabilistic keyframe
selection. Then, we propose the TSPO reinforcement learning paradigm, which
models keyframe selection and language generation as a joint decision-making
process, enabling end-to-end group relative optimization with efficient
rule-based rewards. Furthermore, for the TSPO's training, we propose a long
video training data construction pipeline with comprehensive temporal data and
video Needle-in-a-Haystack data. Finally, we incorporate rule-based answering
accuracy and temporal locating reward mechanisms to optimize the temporal

*Emmanuelle Bourigault,Pauline Bourigault*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FrEVL explores frozen pretrained embeddings for vision-language tasks, achieving near state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters and lower computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational demands of deploying vision-language models by leveraging frozen embeddings.

Method: Uses frozen pretrained embeddings for vision-language tasks, analyzing their effectiveness and computational efficiency.

Result: Achieves 85-95% of SOTA performance with 68.4M parameters, 2.3x speedup, and 52% lower energy use.

Conclusion: Frozen embeddings are viable when pretraining aligns with task needs, offering efficiency gains for constrained deployments.

Abstract: The deployment of vision-language models remains constrained by substantial
computational requirements. We present \textbf{FrEVL}, a framework exploring
whether frozen pretrained embeddings can support effective vision-language
understanding. Our analysis reveals that frozen embeddings contain rich
information for discriminative tasks, achieving 85\% to 95\% of
state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks with only 68.4M trainable
parameters. This performance dichotomy reveals a critical insight: frozen
embedding effectiveness depends on alignment between pretraining objectives and
downstream task requirements. When accounting for end-to-end computation
including embedding extraction, FrEVL provides $2.3\times$ speedup with 52\%
lower energy consumption, making it suitable for scenarios with pre-computable
inputs or when deployment constraints outweigh marginal performance gains. Our
evaluation provides practitioners with guidance on when frozen embedding
approaches represent viable alternatives to full model deployment. We will
release our complete implementation and evaluation framework to facilitate
further research into efficient multi-modal understanding.

*Lefei Shen,Mouxiang Chen,Xu Liu,Han Fu,Xiaoxue Ren,Jianling Sun,Zhuo Li,Chenghao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisionTS++ bridges gaps in cross-modal transfer from vision to time series forecasting with innovations in data filtering, multivariate conversion, and probabilistic forecasting, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in transferring vision models to time series forecasting due to data-modality, multivariate-forecasting, and probabilistic-forecasting gaps.

Method: Proposes VisionTS++ with three innovations: vision-model-based filtering, colorized multivariate conversion, and multi-quantile forecasting.

Result: Achieves SOTA results, outperforming specialized models by 6%-44% in MSE reduction and ranking first in 9/12 probabilistic forecasting settings.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for cross-modal knowledge transfer, advancing universal time series foundation models.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that vision models pre-trained on images can
perform well in time series forecasting by reformulating forecasting as an
image reconstruction task, suggesting their potential as universal time series
foundation models. However, effective cross-modal transfer from vision to time
series remains challenging due to three key discrepancies: (1) data-modality
gap between structured, bounded image data and unbounded, heterogeneous time
series; (2) multivariate-forecasting gap between standard RGB
three-channel-based vision models and the need to model time series with
arbitrary numbers of variates; and (3) probabilistic-forecasting gap between
the deterministic output formats of most vision models and the requirement for
uncertainty-aware probabilistic predictions. To bridge these gaps, we propose
VisionTS++, a vision-model-based TSFM that performs continual pre-training on
large-scale time series datasets, including 3 innovations: (1) a
vision-model-based filtering mechanism to identify high-quality time series
data, thereby mitigating modality gap and improving pre-training stability, (2)
a colorized multivariate conversion method that transforms multivariate time
series into multi-subfigure RGB images, capturing complex inter-variate
dependencies; and (3) a multi-quantile forecasting approach using parallel
reconstruction heads to generate forecasts of different quantile levels, thus
more flexibly approximating arbitrary output distributions without restrictive
prior distributional assumptions. Evaluated on both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution TSF benchmarks, \model achieves SOTA results, outperforming
specialized TSFMs by 6%-44% in MSE reduction and ranking first in 9 out of 12
probabilistic forecasting settings. Our work establishes a new paradigm for
cross-modal knowledge transfer, advancing the development of universal TSFMs.

*Santhoshkumar Peddi,Sadhvik Bathini,Arun Balasubramanian,Monalisa Sarma,Debasis Samanta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProtoN, a few-shot learning framework, uses a graph-based approach for ear biometrics, achieving high accuracy with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of scarce annotated data and intra-class variability in ear biometrics by leveraging multiple impressions per identity.

Method: Uses a Prototype Graph Neural Network (PGNN) with a dual-path message-passing mechanism and cross-graph prototype alignment for discriminative representations.

Result: Achieves Rank-1 accuracy of 99.60% and EER of 0.025 on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: ProtoN is effective for few-shot ear recognition, outperforming existing methods under data scarcity.

Abstract: Ear biometrics offer a stable and contactless modality for identity
recognition, yet their effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of
annotated data and significant intra-class variability. Existing methods
typically extract identity features from individual impressions in isolation,
restricting their ability to capture consistent and discriminative
representations. To overcome these limitations, a few-shot learning framework,
ProtoN, is proposed to jointly process multiple impressions of an identity
using a graph-based approach. Each impression is represented as a node in a
class-specific graph, alongside a learnable prototype node that encodes
identity-level information. This graph is processed by a Prototype Graph Neural
Network (PGNN) layer, specifically designed to refine both impression and
prototype representations through a dual-path message-passing mechanism. To
further enhance discriminative power, the PGNN incorporates a cross-graph
prototype alignment strategy that improves class separability by enforcing
intra-class compactness while maintaining inter-class distinction.
Additionally, a hybrid loss function is employed to balance episodic and global
classification objectives, thereby improving the overall structure of the
embedding space. Extensive experiments on five benchmark ear datasets
demonstrate that ProtoN achieves state-of-the-art performance, with Rank-1
identification accuracy of up to 99.60% and an Equal Error Rate (EER) as low as
0.025, showing the effectiveness for few-shot ear recognition under limited
data conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SI3FP is a pipeline for generating LoD3 thermal models from images, combining computer vision and deep learning to accurately identify building features like windows, with a 5% error rate in window-to-wall ratio estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early-phase renovation planning requires accurate thermal 3D models (LoD3), but scalable and precise feature identification is challenging.

Method: SI3FP extracts geometries from images using computer vision and deep learning, directly modeling geometric primitives in the orthographic image plane to reduce distortions.

Result: Tested on Swedish residential buildings, SI3FP achieved ~5% error in window-to-wall ratio estimates, suitable for early-stage renovation analysis.

Conclusion: SI3FP enables scalable energy renovation planning and has broader urban development applications.

Abstract: Renovating existing buildings is essential for climate impact. Early-phase
renovation planning requires simulations based on thermal 3D models at Level of
Detail (LoD) 3, which include features like windows. However, scalable and
accurate identification of such features remains a challenge. This paper
presents the Scalable Image-to-3D Facade Parser (SI3FP), a pipeline that
generates LoD3 thermal models by extracting geometries from images using both
computer vision and deep learning. Unlike existing methods relying on
segmentation and projection, SI3FP directly models geometric primitives in the
orthographic image plane, providing a unified interface while reducing
perspective distortions. SI3FP supports both sparse (e.g., Google Street View)
and dense (e.g., hand-held camera) data sources. Tested on typical Swedish
residential buildings, SI3FP achieved approximately 5% error in window-to-wall
ratio estimates, demonstrating sufficient accuracy for early-stage renovation
analysis. The pipeline facilitates large-scale energy renovation planning and
has broader applications in urban development and planning.

### [92] [Analyzing and Mitigating Object Hallucination: A Training Bias Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04567)
*Yifan Li,Kun Zhou,Wayne Xin Zhao,Lei Fang,Ji-Rong Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) due to training bias, introduces the POPEv2 benchmark, and proposes Obliviate, an efficient unlearning method to mitigate the issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs exhibit hallucination, generating text inconsistent with visual input, prompting a study on training data's role in this issue.

Method: Introduces POPEv2 benchmark with counterfactual images, probes model components, and proposes Obliviate, a lightweight unlearning method targeting the LM head.

Result: Obliviate reduces hallucination significantly, updating only 2% of parameters, and scales well across model sizes and data volumes.

Conclusion: Obliviate effectively mitigates hallucination, demonstrating strong scalability and generalization, with code and data to be released.

Abstract: As scaling up training data has significantly improved the general multimodal
capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), they still suffer from
the hallucination issue, generating text that is inconsistent with the visual
input. This phenomenon motivates us to systematically investigate the role of
training data in hallucination. We introduce a new benchmark, POPEv2, which
consists of counterfactual images collected from the training data of LVLMs
with certain objects masked. Through comprehensive evaluation on POPEv2, we
find that current LVLMs suffer from training bias: they fail to fully leverage
their training data and hallucinate more frequently on images seen during
training. Specifically, they perform poorly on counterfactual images, often
incorrectly answering ``Yes'' to questions about masked objects. To understand
this issue, we conduct probing experiments on the models' internal components,
revealing that this training bias is primarily located in the language modeling
(LM) head. Based on these findings, we propose Obliviate, an efficient and
lightweight unlearning method designed to mitigate object hallucination via
training bias unlearning. Obliviate identifies the discrepancy between
ground-truth labels and model outputs on the training data as a proxy for bias
and adopts a parameter- and data-efficient fine-tuning strategy that only
updates the LM head. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. While only reusing the training data and updating approximately 2\%
of the parameters, Obliviate significantly reduces hallucination across both
discriminative and generative tasks. Furthermore, it demonstrates strong
scalability with respect to both model size (2B to 72B) and training data
volume, and exhibits promising generalization to hallucination types beyond
object-level hallucination. Our code and data will be publicly released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VITAL is a tool-augmented learning framework for MLLMs to improve video reasoning, addressing cross-modal interaction and hallucination issues with multimodal CoT and dense frame sampling. It introduces datasets and a DGRPO algorithm for balanced multi-task learning, outperforming benchmarks in video QA and temporal grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-based CoT methods for MLLMs struggle with cross-modal interaction and hallucination in long videos, limiting their video reasoning capabilities.

Method: Proposes VITAL, an end-to-end framework with a visual toolbox for dense frame sampling and multimodal CoT. Introduces datasets (MTVR-CoT-72k, MTVR-RL-110k) and DGRPO for balanced multi-task reinforcement learning.

Result: VITAL outperforms existing methods on 11 video understanding benchmarks, especially in long video scenarios.

Conclusion: VITAL advances video reasoning in MLLMs, demonstrating superior performance in video QA and temporal grounding, with publicly available resources.

Abstract: The video reasoning ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is
crucial for downstream tasks like video question answering and temporal
grounding. While recent approaches have explored text-based chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning for MLLMs, these methods often suffer from limited cross-modal
interaction and increased hallucination, especially with longer videos or
reasoning chains. To address these challenges, we propose Video Intelligence
via Tool-Augmented Learning (VITAL), a novel end-to-end agentic video reasoning
framework. With a visual toolbox, the model can densely sample new video frames
on demand and generate multimodal CoT for precise long video reasoning. We
observe that temporal grounding and question answering are mutually beneficial
for video understanding tasks. Therefore, we construct two high-quality
multi-task video reasoning datasets MTVR-CoT-72k for supervised fine-tuning and
MTVR-RL-110k for reinforcement learning. Moreover, we propose a
Difficulty-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization algorithm (DGRPO) to
mitigate difficulty imbalance in multi-task reinforcement learning. Extensive
experiments on 11 challenging video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the
advanced reasoning ability of VITAL, outperforming existing methods in video
question answering and temporal grounding tasks, especially in long video
scenarios. All code, data and model weight will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: Proposes Deformable Inter-Task Self-Attention for efficient Multitask Learning, reducing computational costs while improving task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the computational inefficiency of Transformer's Multi-Head-Attention in Multitask Learning due to quadratic scaling with task numbers.

Method: Introduces Deformable Inter-Task Self-Attention to efficiently aggregate information across tasks' feature maps.

Result: Achieves order-of-magnitude reduction in FLOPs and latency, with up to 7.4% improvement in task metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively balances computational efficiency and performance in Multitask Learning.

Abstract: In both Computer Vision and the wider Deep Learning field, the Transformer
architecture is well-established as state-of-the-art for many applications. For
Multitask Learning, however, where there may be many more queries necessary
compared to single-task models, its Multi-Head-Attention often approaches the
limits of what is computationally feasible considering practical hardware
limitations. This is due to the fact that the size of the attention matrix
scales quadratically with the number of tasks (assuming roughly equal numbers
of queries for all tasks). As a solution, we propose our novel Deformable
Inter-Task Self-Attention for Multitask models that enables the much more
efficient aggregation of information across the feature maps from different
tasks. In our experiments on the NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context datasets, we
demonstrate an order-of-magnitude reduction in both FLOPs count and inference
latency. At the same time, we also achieve substantial improvements by up to
7.4% in the individual tasks' prediction quality metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Composed Object Retrieval (COR), a new task for object-level precision in multi-modal systems, addressing limitations of current Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) methods. It proposes CORE, a model for COR, and introduces COR127K, a large-scale benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CIR methods lack object-level precision, limiting their ability to localize specific objects. COR aims to overcome this by enabling retrieval and segmentation of target objects using composed expressions.

Method: The paper proposes CORE, an end-to-end model with reference region encoding, adaptive visual-textual interaction, and region-level contrastive learning. It also introduces COR127K, a benchmark with 127,166 retrieval triplets.

Result: CORE outperforms existing models in base and novel categories, providing a strong baseline for COR.

Conclusion: COR advances fine-grained multi-modal retrieval, with CORE setting a new standard for object-level precision and opening new research directions.

Abstract: Retrieving fine-grained visual content based on user intent remains a
challenge in multi-modal systems. Although current Composed Image Retrieval
(CIR) methods combine reference images with retrieval texts, they are
constrained to image-level matching and cannot localize specific objects. To
this end, we propose Composed Object Retrieval (COR), a brand-new task that
goes beyond image-level retrieval to achieve object-level precision, allowing
the retrieval and segmentation of target objects based on composed expressions
combining reference objects and retrieval texts. COR presents significant
challenges in retrieval flexibility, which requires systems to identify
arbitrary objects satisfying composed expressions while avoiding semantically
similar but irrelevant negative objects within the same scene. We construct
COR127K, the first large-scale COR benchmark that contains 127,166 retrieval
triplets with various semantic transformations in 408 categories. We also
present CORE, a unified end-to-end model that integrates reference region
encoding, adaptive visual-textual interaction, and region-level contrastive
learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CORE significantly outperforms
existing models in both base and novel categories, establishing a simple and
effective baseline for this challenging task while opening new directions for
fine-grained multi-modal retrieval research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Foundation models with LoRA adaptation outperform linear probing, achieving near-100% performance with only 10% data, and nearly close the out-of-domain performance gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mitotic figure classification is crucial for tumor grading, but labeled data is limited. Self-supervised foundation models can leverage unlabeled data to improve performance.

Method: Investigated data scaling laws and robustness of foundation models, comparing linear probing and LoRA adaptation. Also evaluated against end-to-end-trained CNNs and Vision Transformers.

Result: LoRA-adapted models perform better than linear probing, achieving high accuracy with minimal data. They also reduce the out-of-domain performance gap.

Conclusion: LoRA-adapted foundation models are highly effective for mitotic figure classification, though traditional fine-tuning remains competitive.

Abstract: The performance of deep learning models is known to scale with data quantity
and diversity. In pathology, as in many other medical imaging domains, the
availability of labeled images for a specific task is often limited.
Self-supervised learning techniques have enabled the use of vast amounts of
unlabeled data to train large-scale neural networks, i.e., foundation models,
that can address the limited data problem by providing semantically rich
feature vectors that can generalize well to new tasks with minimal training
effort increasing model performance and robustness. In this work, we
investigate the use of foundation models for mitotic figure classification. The
mitotic count, which can be derived from this classification task, is an
independent prognostic marker for specific tumors and part of certain tumor
grading systems. In particular, we investigate the data scaling laws on
multiple current foundation models and evaluate their robustness to unseen
tumor domains. Next to the commonly used linear probing paradigm, we also adapt
the models using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) of their attention mechanisms. We
compare all models against end-to-end-trained baselines, both CNNs and Vision
Transformers. Our results demonstrate that LoRA-adapted foundation models
provide superior performance to those adapted with standard linear probing,
reaching performance levels close to 100% data availability with only 10% of
training data. Furthermore, LoRA-adaptation of the most recent foundation
models almost closes the out-of-domain performance gap when evaluated on unseen
tumor domains. However, full fine-tuning of traditional architectures still
yields competitive performance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a self-improvement framework (CVC) for LVLMs to enhance visual perception by inferring masked objects based on causal relationships, achieving notable performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs lack deep visual perception due to limited visual knowledge in training corpora, hindering tasks like identifying subtle image differences.

Method: Proposes a causality-driven visual object completion (CVC) task, using automated instance construction for training, enabling LVLMs to self-improve through trial and error.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements, with average gains of 5.4% and 4.0% on specialized tasks using LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-1.5-13B, respectively.

Conclusion: The CVC framework effectively enhances LVLMs' visual perception and reasoning, validated by strong performance on specialized and comprehensive benchmarks.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have experienced significant
advancements in recent years. However, their performance still falls short in
tasks requiring deep visual perception, such as identifying subtle differences
between images. A potential cause is the scarcity of visual knowledge in
popular instruction-tuning corpora, resulting in inadequate visual perception
and reasoning capabilities. To address this challenge, we introduce a
self-improvement framework grounded in a novel visual knowledge-intensive task,
\underline{C}ausality-driven \underline{V}isual object \underline{C}ompletion
(CVC). This task requires LVLMs to infer the masked object in an image based on
its \textit{causal} relationships with the other visible information. We first
obtain rich examples cheaply through our automated instance construction
pipeline, without relying on sophisticated LVLMs (\textit{e.g.}, GPT-4V) or
human assistance. Then, LVLMs effectively self-improve through trial and error
learning using these created instances. Our experiments demonstrate substantial
gains across four challenging specialized tasks and four widely-used
comprehensive benchmarks. Especially on specialized tasks, our method achieves
an average improvement of 5.4\% and 4.0\% compared to the corresponding
baselines when utilizing LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-1.5-13B, respectively. The code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 4DVD is a cascaded video diffusion model that decouples 4D content generation into layout prediction and conditional generation, achieving high-quality results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Directly generating high-dimensional 4D data is complex, so 4DVD simplifies the process by decoupling tasks.

Method: 4DVD first predicts dense view layouts, then uses structure-aware generation to combine layout priors with monocular video content.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis and 4D generation, validated on the D-Objaverse dataset.

Conclusion: 4DVD enables accurate 4D representation and practical applications, outperforming previous methods.

Abstract: Given the high complexity of directly generating high-dimensional data such
as 4D, we present 4DVD, a cascaded video diffusion model that generates 4D
content in a decoupled manner. Unlike previous multi-view video methods that
directly model 3D space and temporal features simultaneously with stacked cross
view/temporal attention modules, 4DVD decouples this into two subtasks: coarse
multi-view layout generation and structure-aware conditional generation, and
effectively unifies them. Specifically, given a monocular video, 4DVD first
predicts the dense view content of its layout with superior cross-view and
temporal consistency. Based on the produced layout priors, a structure-aware
spatio-temporal generation branch is developed, combining these coarse
structural priors with the exquisite appearance content of input monocular
video to generate final high-quality dense-view videos. Benefit from this,
explicit 4D representation~(such as 4D Gaussian) can be optimized accurately,
enabling wider practical application. To train 4DVD, we collect a dynamic 3D
object dataset, called D-Objaverse, from the Objaverse benchmark and render 16
videos with 21 frames for each object. Extensive experiments demonstrate our
state-of-the-art performance on both novel view synthesis and 4D generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ErasePro is a novel closed-form method for concept erasure in text-to-image models, addressing limitations of incomplete erasure and quality degradation by introducing zero-residual constraints and progressive layer-wise updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for concept erasure in text-to-image models suffer from incomplete erasure and generation quality degradation due to non-zero alignment residuals and concentrated parameter updates in deep layers.

Method: ErasePro introduces a strict zero-residual constraint for perfect alignment and employs a progressive, layer-wise update strategy to transfer target concept features gradually from shallow to deep layers.

Result: Empirical results show ErasePro's effectiveness across various concept erasure tasks, including instance, art style, and nudity erasure.

Conclusion: ErasePro improves concept erasure completeness and preserves generative quality better than existing methods.

Abstract: Concept Erasure, which aims to prevent pretrained text-to-image models from
generating content associated with semantic-harmful concepts (i.e., target
concepts), is getting increased attention. State-of-the-art methods formulate
this task as an optimization problem: they align all target concepts with
semantic-harmless anchor concepts, and apply closed-form solutions to update
the model accordingly. While these closed-form methods are efficient, we argue
that existing methods have two overlooked limitations: 1) They often result in
incomplete erasure due to "non-zero alignment residual", especially when text
prompts are relatively complex. 2) They may suffer from generation quality
degradation as they always concentrate parameter updates in a few deep layers.
To address these issues, we propose a novel closed-form method ErasePro: it is
designed for more complete concept erasure and better preserving overall
generative quality. Specifically, ErasePro first introduces a strict
zero-residual constraint into the optimization objective, ensuring perfect
alignment between target and anchor concept features and enabling more complete
erasure. Secondly, it employs a progressive, layer-wise update strategy that
gradually transfers target concept features to those of the anchor concept from
shallow to deep layers. As the depth increases, the required parameter changes
diminish, thereby reducing deviations in sensitive deep layers and preserving
generative quality. Empirical results across different concept erasure tasks
(including instance, art style, and nudity erasure) have demonstrated the
effectiveness of our ErasePro.

TL;DR: QuantVSR introduces a low-bit quantization model for video super-resolution (VSR) using spatio-temporal complexity awareness and learnable bias alignment to maintain performance while reducing resource usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models for VSR are resource-intensive and slow, limiting practical deployment. Quantization can compress models but faces challenges due to VSR's temporal and fidelity demands.

Method: Proposes QuantVSR with a spatio-temporal complexity aware (STCA) mechanism to allocate layer-specific ranks and a learnable bias alignment (LBA) module to reduce quantization errors. Jointly refines full-precision and low-bit branches.

Result: Achieves comparable performance to full-precision models and outperforms other low-bit quantization methods on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: QuantVSR effectively balances performance and efficiency, making it a viable solution for practical VSR applications.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown superior performance in real-world video
super-resolution (VSR). However, the slow processing speeds and heavy resource
consumption of diffusion models hinder their practical application and
deployment. Quantization offers a potential solution for compressing the VSR
model. Nevertheless, quantizing VSR models is challenging due to their temporal
characteristics and high fidelity requirements. To address these issues, we
propose QuantVSR, a low-bit quantization model for real-world VSR. We propose a
spatio-temporal complexity aware (STCA) mechanism, where we first utilize the
calibration dataset to measure both spatial and temporal complexities for each
layer. Based on these statistics, we allocate layer-specific ranks to the
low-rank full-precision (FP) auxiliary branch. Subsequently, we jointly refine
the FP and low-bit branches to achieve simultaneous optimization. In addition,
we propose a learnable bias alignment (LBA) module to reduce the biased
quantization errors. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our method obtains comparable performance with the FP model
and significantly outperforms recent leading low-bit quantization methods. Code

*Panagiotis Alimisis,Christos Diou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Causal Delta Embeddings for representing interventions in causal representation learning, improving OOD robustness without extra supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current causal representation learning focuses on scene variables, neglecting intervention representations, which could enhance generalization and robustness.

Method: Introduces Causal Delta Embeddingsâinvariant to visual scenes and sparse in affecting causal variablesâlearned from image pairs without supervision.

Result: Demonstrates superior OOD performance in synthetic and real-world benchmarks, outperforming baselines in the Causal Triplet challenge.

Conclusion: Focusing on intervention representations via Causal Delta Embeddings effectively boosts OOD robustness in causal learning.

Abstract: Causal representation learning has attracted significant research interest
during the past few years, as a means for improving model generalization and
robustness. Causal representations of interventional image pairs, have the
property that only variables corresponding to scene elements affected by the
intervention / action are changed between the start state and the end state.
While most work in this area has focused on identifying and representing the
variables of the scene under a causal model, fewer efforts have focused on
representations of the interventions themselves. In this work, we show that an
effective strategy for improving out of distribution (OOD) robustness is to
focus on the representation of interventions in the latent space. Specifically,
we propose that an intervention can be represented by a Causal Delta Embedding
that is invariant to the visual scene and sparse in terms of the causal
variables it affects. Leveraging this insight, we propose a framework that is
capable of learning causal representations from image pairs, without any
additional supervision. Experiments in the Causal Triplet challenge demonstrate
that Causal Delta Embeddings are highly effective in OOD settings,
significantly exceeding baseline performance in both synthetic and real-world

*Daisheng Jin,Ying He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonoCloth reconstructs and animates clothed human avatars from monocular videos using part-based decomposition and a cloth simulation module, improving quality and realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstructing 3D human avatars from monocular videos is challenging due to limited geometric info and complex motion.

Method: Part-based decomposition (body, face, hands, clothing) with detailed geometry recovery for face/hands and a cloth simulation module for garments.

Result: MonoCloth outperforms existing methods in visual quality and animation realism, and supports tasks like clothing transfer.

Conclusion: MonoClothâs part-based design enhances reconstruction and animation, offering versatility for practical applications.

Abstract: Reconstructing realistic 3D human avatars from monocular videos is a
challenging task due to the limited geometric information and complex non-rigid
motion involved. We present MonoCloth, a new method for reconstructing and
animating clothed human avatars from monocular videos. To overcome the
limitations of monocular input, we introduce a part-based decomposition
strategy that separates the avatar into body, face, hands, and clothing. This
design reflects the varying levels of reconstruction difficulty and deformation
complexity across these components. Specifically, we focus on detailed geometry
recovery for the face and hands. For clothing, we propose a dedicated cloth
simulation module that captures garment deformation using temporal motion cues
and geometric constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that MonoCloth
improves both visual reconstruction quality and animation realism compared to
existing methods. Furthermore, thanks to its part-based design, MonoCloth also
supports additional tasks such as clothing transfer, underscoring its
versatility and practical utility.

### [103] [Skeleton Motion Words for Unsupervised Skeleton-Based Temporal Action Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04513)
*Uzay GÃ¶kay,Federico Spurio,Dominik R. Bach,Juergen Gall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an unsupervised method for skeleton-based temporal action segmentation using a sequence-to-sequence autoencoder and motion words, outperforming current state-of-the-art.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised methods focus on video data, neglecting skeleton sequences despite their practical advantages like robustness and privacy.

Method: Uses a temporal autoencoder to disentangle joint information, divides latent sequences into patches, and quantizes them into motion words for action clustering.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods on HuGaDB, LARa, and BABEL datasets.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses the gap in unsupervised skeleton-based action segmentation, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art methods for skeleton-based temporal action
segmentation are predominantly supervised and require annotated data, which is
expensive to collect. In contrast, existing unsupervised temporal action
segmentation methods have focused primarily on video data, while skeleton
sequences remain underexplored, despite their relevance to real-world
applications, robustness, and privacy-preserving nature. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach for unsupervised skeleton-based temporal action
segmentation. Our method utilizes a sequence-to-sequence temporal autoencoder
that keeps the information of the different joints disentangled in the
embedding space. Latent skeleton sequences are then divided into
non-overlapping patches and quantized to obtain distinctive skeleton motion
words, driving the discovery of semantically meaningful action clusters. We
thoroughly evaluate the proposed approach on three widely used skeleton-based
datasets, namely HuGaDB, LARa, and BABEL. The results demonstrate that our
model outperforms the current state-of-the-art unsupervised temporal action
segmentation methods. Code is available at https://github.com/bachlab/SMQ .

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAIDX is a novel deepfake detection framework combining RAG and GRPO for improved accuracy and explainability, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing ethical risks of hyperrealistic AI-generated imagery and the lack of transparency in current deepfake detection methods.

Method: Integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for external knowledge and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for fine-grained explanations and saliency maps.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art detection performance with interpretable rationales in text and saliency maps.

Conclusion: RAIDX is the first unified framework to enhance both accuracy and explainability in deepfake detection, with public code and models.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-generation models has enabled the creation of
hyperrealistic imagery, posing ethical risks through widespread misinformation.
Current deepfake detection methods, categorized as face specific detectors or
general AI-generated detectors, lack transparency by framing detection as a
classification task without explaining decisions. While several LLM-based
approaches offer explainability, they suffer from coarse-grained analyses and
dependency on labor-intensive annotations. This paper introduces RAIDX
(Retrieval-Augmented Image Deepfake Detection and Explainability), a novel
deepfake detection framework integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance detection accuracy and
decision explainability. Specifically, RAIDX leverages RAG to incorporate
external knowledge for improved detection accuracy and employs GRPO to
autonomously generate fine-grained textual explanations and saliency maps,
eliminating the need for extensive manual annotations. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate RAIDX's effectiveness in identifying real or fake, and
providing interpretable rationales in both textual descriptions and saliency
maps, achieving state-of-the-art detection performance while advancing
transparency in deepfake identification. RAIDX represents the first unified
framework to synergize RAG and GRPO, addressing critical gaps in accuracy and
explainability. Our code and models will be publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised segmentation methods from computer vision don't perform well in medical imaging, necessitating a tailored approach.

Method: Fine-tunes pre-trained models for medical images and uses Explainable AI to generate relevance scores.

Result: Achieves improved segmentation accuracy on medical datasets (CBIS-DDSM, NuInsSeg, Kvasir-SEG).

Conclusion: The approach successfully adapts pre-trained models for medical image segmentation, outperforming traditional methods.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is vital for modern healthcare and is a key
element of computer-aided diagnosis. While recent advancements in computer
vision have explored unsupervised segmentation using pre-trained models, these
methods have not been translated well to the medical imaging domain. In this
work, we introduce a novel approach that fine-tunes pre-trained models
specifically for medical images, achieving accurate segmentation with extensive
processing. Our method integrates Explainable AI to generate relevance scores,
enhancing the segmentation process. Unlike traditional methods that excel in
standard benchmarks but falter in medical applications, our approach achieves
improved results on datasets like CBIS-DDSM, NuInsSeg and Kvasir-SEG.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TopKD, a logit-based distillation method focusing on Top-K knowledge, outperforming existing methods across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing knowledge distillation methods overlook critical information in teacher logit distributions, particularly Top-K knowledge.

Method: Proposes TopKD with a Top-K Scaling Module (TSM) and Top-K Decoupled Loss (TDL) for adaptive logit amplification and targeted supervision.

Result: TopKD consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods on CIFAR-100, ImageNet, STL-10, and Tiny-ImageNet, and works well with Vision Transformers.

Conclusion: Logits hold significant potential for advancing knowledge distillation, as demonstrated by TopKD's effectiveness and versatility.

Abstract: Recent advances in knowledge distillation (KD) predominantly emphasize
feature-level knowledge transfer, frequently overlooking critical information
embedded within the teacher's logit distributions. In this paper, we revisit
logit-based distillation and reveal an underexplored yet critical element:
Top-K knowledge. Motivated by this insight, we propose Top-scaled Knowledge
Distillation (TopKD), a simple, efficient, and architecture-agnostic framework
that significantly enhances logit-based distillation. TopKD consists of two
main components: (1) a Top-K Scaling Module (TSM), which adaptively amplifies
the most informative logits, and (2) a Top-K Decoupled Loss (TDL), which offers
targeted and effective supervision. Notably, TopKD integrates seamlessly into
existing KD methods without introducing extra modules or requiring
architectural changes. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, ImageNet, STL-10,
and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that TopKD consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art distillation methods. Moreover, our method demonstrates
substantial effectiveness when distilling Vision Transformers, underscoring its
versatility across diverse network architectures. These findings highlight the
significant potential of logits to advance knowledge distillation.

*Safwen Naimi,Arij Said,Wassim Bouachir,Guillaume-Alexandre Bilodeau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InceptoFormer is a neural framework combining Inception1D and Transformer for Parkinson's Disease severity evaluation via gait analysis, achieving 96.6% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve PD severity staging by capturing multi-scale temporal features and addressing class imbalance.

Method: Uses Inception1D for multi-scale feature extraction and Transformer for long-range dependencies, with oversampling for class imbalance.

Result: Achieves 96.6% accuracy, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: InceptoFormer effectively evaluates PD severity, offering a robust solution for gait dynamics analysis.

Abstract: We present InceptoFormer, a multi-signal neural framework designed for
Parkinson's Disease (PD) severity evaluation via gait dynamics analysis. Our
architecture introduces a 1D adaptation of the Inception model, which we refer
to as Inception1D, along with a Transformer-based framework to stage PD
severity according to the Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) scale. The Inception1D component
captures multi-scale temporal features by employing parallel 1D convolutional
filters with varying kernel sizes, thereby extracting features across multiple
temporal scales. The transformer component efficiently models long-range
dependencies within gait sequences, providing a comprehensive understanding of
both local and global patterns. To address the issue of class imbalance in PD
severity staging, we propose a data structuring and preprocessing strategy
based on oversampling to enhance the representation of underrepresented
severity levels. The overall design enables to capture fine-grained temporal
variations and global dynamics in gait signal, significantly improving
classification performance for PD severity evaluation. Through extensive
experimentation, InceptoFormer achieves an accuracy of 96.6%, outperforming
existing state-of-the-art methods in PD severity assessment. The source code
for our implementation is publicly available at

*Minghang Zheng,Yuxin Peng,Benyuan Sun,Yi Yang,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hierarchical event memory framework for online video temporal grounding (OnVTG) to improve event modeling and retain long-term historical information, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OnVTG models lack effective event modeling and long-term historical information retention, leading to low performance.

Method: Introduces a hierarchical event memory framework with event proposals and a future prediction branch for real-time event detection.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on TACoS, ActivityNet Captions, and MAD datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations in OnVTG by enhancing event modeling and historical information retention.

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the task of online video temporal grounding (OnVTG),
which requires the model to locate events related to a given text query within
a video stream. Unlike regular video temporal grounding, OnVTG requires the
model to make predictions without observing future frames. As online videos are
streaming inputs and can go on indefinitely, it is impractical and inefficient
to store all historical inputs. The existing OnVTG models employ memory to
store recent historical video frame features and predict scores indicating
whether the current frame corresponds to the start or end time of the target
event. However, these methods lack effective event modeling and cannot retain
long-term historical information, leading to low performance. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a hierarchical event memory for OnVTG. We propose an
event-based OnVTG framework that makes predictions based on event proposals
that model event-level information with various durations. To preserve
historically valuable event information, we introduce a hierarchical event
memory that retains historical events, allowing the model to access both recent
and long-term information. To enable the real-time prediction, we further
propose a future prediction branch that predicts whether the target event will
occur shortly and further regresses the start time of the event. We achieve
state-of-the-art performance on the TACoS, ActivityNet Captions, and MAD
datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/minghangz/OnVTG.

TL;DR: A two-stage pipeline for marine video captioning addresses challenges like dynamic objects and underwater complexity, using video-text-segmentation triplets for improved understanding and generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video captioning datasets struggle with marine environments due to their complexity and lack of focus on marine life.

Method: Proposes a two-stage pipeline leveraging video-text-segmentation triplets and video splitting for salient object transitions.

Result: Improved marine video understanding, analysis, and generation, with enriched captioning semantics.

Conclusion: The introduced benchmark and pipeline effectively address marine video challenges, with dataset and code publicly available.

Abstract: Marine videos present significant challenges for video understanding due to
the dynamics of marine objects and the surrounding environment, camera motion,
and the complexity of underwater scenes. Existing video captioning datasets,
typically focused on generic or human-centric domains, often fail to generalize
to the complexities of the marine environment and gain insights about marine
life. To address these limitations, we propose a two-stage marine
object-oriented video captioning pipeline. We introduce a comprehensive video
understanding benchmark that leverages the triplets of video, text, and
segmentation masks to facilitate visual grounding and captioning, leading to
improved marine video understanding and analysis, and marine video generation.
Additionally, we highlight the effectiveness of video splitting in order to
detect salient object transitions in scene changes, which significantly enrich
the semantics of captioning content. Our dataset and code have been released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TWGTM, a unified framework for joint virtual try-on (VTON) and virtual try-off (VTOFF) tasks, addressing their complementary symmetry through bidirectional feature disentanglement and phased training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing works treat VTON and VTOFF as isolated tasks, neglecting their complementary symmetry, leading to a gap in systematic investigation.

Method: Proposes TWGTM, a unified framework using dual-conditioned guidance from latent and pixel spaces, and phased training to resolve mask dependency asymmetry.

Result: Extensive experiments on DressCode and VITON-HD datasets validate the efficacy and competitive edge of TWGTM.

Conclusion: TWGTM successfully bridges the gap between VTON and VTOFF, offering a joint solution for clothing-centric image synthesis.

Abstract: While recent advances in virtual try-on (VTON) have achieved realistic
garment transfer to human subjects, its inverse task, virtual try-off (VTOFF),
which aims to reconstruct canonical garment templates from dressed humans,
remains critically underexplored and lacks systematic investigation. Existing
works predominantly treat them as isolated tasks: VTON focuses on garment
dressing while VTOFF addresses garment extraction, thereby neglecting their
complementary symmetry. To bridge this fundamental gap, we propose the Two-Way
Garment Transfer Model (TWGTM), to the best of our knowledge, the first unified
framework for joint clothing-centric image synthesis that simultaneously
resolves both mask-guided VTON and mask-free VTOFF through bidirectional
feature disentanglement. Specifically, our framework employs dual-conditioned
guidance from both latent and pixel spaces of reference images to seamlessly
bridge the dual tasks. On the other hand, to resolve the inherent mask
dependency asymmetry between mask-guided VTON and mask-free VTOFF, we devise a
phased training paradigm that progressively bridges this modality gap.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted across the
DressCode and VITON-HD datasets validate the efficacy and competitive edge of
our proposed approach.

*Franz Thaler,Darko Stern,Gernot Plank,Martin Urschler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for whole heart segmentation using balanced joint training and strong augmentation to address domain shift in CT and MR data, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death, necessitating advanced methods for cardiac image analysis to improve diagnosis and personalized therapy.

Method: A balanced joint training approach using CT and MR data equally, combined with intensity and spatial augmentation, and a 5-fold ensemble model.

Result: Achieved 93.33% DSC and 0.8388 mm ASSD for CT, and 89.30% DSC and 1.2411 mm ASSD for MR data, outperforming or matching domain-specific models.

Conclusion: The method shows promise for accurate semantic segmentation, enabling patient-specific cardiac digital twin models for personalized care.

Abstract: As the leading cause of death worldwide, cardiovascular diseases motivate the
development of more sophisticated methods to analyze the heart and its
substructures from medical images like Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic
Resonance (MR). Semantic segmentations of important cardiac structures that
represent the whole heart are useful to assess patient-specific cardiac
morphology and pathology. Furthermore, accurate semantic segmentations can be
used to generate cardiac digital twin models which allows e.g.
electrophysiological simulation and personalized therapy planning. Even though
deep learning-based methods for medical image segmentation achieved great
advancements over the last decade, retaining good performance under domain
shift -- i.e. when training and test data are sampled from different data
distributions -- remains challenging. In order to perform well on domains known
at training-time, we employ a (1) balanced joint training approach that
utilizes CT and MR data in equal amounts from different source domains.
Further, aiming to alleviate domain shift towards domains only encountered at
test-time, we rely on (2) strong intensity and spatial augmentation techniques
to greatly diversify the available training data. Our proposed whole heart
segmentation method, a 5-fold ensemble with our contributions, achieves the
best performance for MR data overall and a performance similar to the best
performance for CT data when compared to a model trained solely on CT. With
93.33% DSC and 0.8388 mm ASSD for CT and 89.30% DSC and 1.2411 mm ASSD for MR
data, our method demonstrates great potential to efficiently obtain accurate
semantic segmentations from which patient-specific cardiac twin models can be
generated.

*Jinxi Liu,Zijian He,Guangrun Wang,Guanbin Li,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OMFA is a unified diffusion framework for virtual try-on and try-off, eliminating the need for exhibition garments and supporting arbitrary poses. It uses a partial diffusion strategy for dynamic control and achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on exhibition garments and segmentation masks, limiting flexibility and practicality in real-world scenarios. OMFA aims to overcome these constraints.

Method: OMFA employs a partial diffusion strategy, selectively applying noise and denoising to components like garments or person images. It uses SMPL-X-based pose conditioning for multi-view and arbitrary-pose try-on.

Result: OMFA achieves state-of-the-art performance in try-on and try-off tasks, enabling garment transfer and novel pose generation from a single portrait.

Conclusion: OMFA provides a practical, mask-free solution for virtual garment synthesis, generalizing well for real-world applications.

Abstract: Recent diffusion-based approaches have made significant advances in
image-based virtual try-on, enabling more realistic and end-to-end garment
synthesis. However, most existing methods remain constrained by their reliance
on exhibition garments and segmentation masks, as well as their limited ability
to handle flexible pose variations. These limitations reduce their practicality
in real-world scenarios-for instance, users cannot easily transfer garments
worn by one person onto another, and the generated try-on results are typically
restricted to the same pose as the reference image. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{OMFA} (\emph{One Model For All}), a unified diffusion framework for
both virtual try-on and try-off that operates without the need for exhibition
garments and supports arbitrary poses. For example, OMFA enables removing
garments from a source person (try-off) and transferring them onto a target
person (try-on), while also allowing the generated target to appear in novel
poses-even without access to multi-pose images of that person. OMFA is built
upon a novel \emph{partial diffusion} strategy that selectively applies noise
and denoising to individual components of the joint input-such as the garment,
the person image, or the face-enabling dynamic subtask control and efficient
bidirectional garment-person transformation. The framework is entirely
mask-free and requires only a single portrait and a target pose as input,
making it well-suited for real-world applications. Additionally, by leveraging
SMPL-X-based pose conditioning, OMFA supports multi-view and arbitrary-pose
try-on from just one image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OMFA
achieves state-of-the-art results on both try-on and try-off tasks, providing a
practical and generalizable solution for virtual garment synthesis. The project

TL;DR: Event-based vision offers a robust solution for drone detection, overcoming limitations of traditional cameras by eliminating motion blur and excelling in extreme lighting. It enables low-latency, efficient counter-UAV systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cameras fail to reliably detect drones due to their small size, agility, and motion blur. Event-based vision addresses these challenges.

Method: The paper surveys event-based vision, reviewing data representation, processing pipelines (e.g., spiking neural networks), and advanced tasks like tracking and identification.

Result: Event cameras provide reliable, low-latency drone detection and enable sophisticated tasks like real-time tracking and propeller signature analysis.

Conclusion: Event-based vision is a powerful foundation for next-gen counter-UAV systems, offering efficiency and reliability.

Abstract: The diffusion of drones presents significant security and safety challenges.
Traditional surveillance systems, particularly conventional frame-based
cameras, struggle to reliably detect these targets due to their small size,
high agility, and the resulting motion blur and poor performance in challenging
lighting conditions. This paper surveys the emerging field of event-based
vision as a robust solution to these problems. Event cameras virtually
eliminate motion blur and enable consistent detection in extreme lighting.
Their sparse, asynchronous output suppresses static backgrounds, enabling
low-latency focus on motion cues. We review the state-of-the-art in event-based
drone detection, from data representation methods to advanced processing
pipelines using spiking neural networks. The discussion extends beyond simple
detection to cover more sophisticated tasks such as real-time tracking,
trajectory forecasting, and unique identification through propeller signature
analysis. By examining current methodologies, available datasets, and the
distinct advantages of the technology, this work demonstrates that event-based
vision provides a powerful foundation for the next generation of reliable,
low-latency, and efficient counter-UAV systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAlignDiff introduces a diffusion-based method for tooth alignment, combining point cloud regression and diffusion modeling to improve orthodontic treatment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for tooth alignment rely on deterministic geometric constraints, missing anatomical structure and distribution characteristics of transformation matrices.

Method: TAlignDiff uses a point cloud-based regression network (PRN) for alignment and a diffusion-based denoising module (DTMD) to learn transformation matrix distributions.

Result: The method outperforms prior approaches, demonstrating effectiveness in orthodontic treatment.

Conclusion: TAlignDiff offers a superior, unified framework for tooth alignment by integrating geometric constraints and diffusion refinement.

Abstract: Orthodontic treatment hinges on tooth alignment, which significantly affects
occlusal function, facial aesthetics, and patients' quality of life. Current
deep learning approaches predominantly concentrate on predicting transformation
matrices through imposing point-to-point geometric constraints for tooth
alignment. Nevertheless, these matrices are likely associated with the
anatomical structure of the human oral cavity and possess particular
distribution characteristics that the deterministic point-to-point geometric
constraints in prior work fail to capture. To address this, we introduce a new
automatic tooth alignment method named TAlignDiff, which is supported by
diffusion-based transformation learning. TAlignDiff comprises two main
components: a primary point cloud-based regression network (PRN) and a
diffusion-based transformation matrix denoising module (DTMD).
Geometry-constrained losses supervise PRN learning for point cloud-level
alignment. DTMD, as an auxiliary module, learns the latent distribution of
transformation matrices from clinical data. We integrate point cloud-based
transformation regression and diffusion-based transformation modeling into a
unified framework, allowing bidirectional feedback between geometric
constraints and diffusion refinement. Extensive ablation and comparative
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method,
highlighting its potential in orthodontic treatment.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a weakly-supervised DAVEL task (W-DAVEL) and proposes a method using cross-modal salient anchors to localize events in videos without temporal labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of localizing events in untrimmed videos with only video-level labels, leveraging cross-modal consistency for better performance.

Method: Proposes a Mutual Event Agreement Evaluation module for cross-modal consistency, a Cross-modal Salient Anchor Identification module, and an Anchor-based Temporal Propagation module for enhanced localization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on UnAV-100 and ActivityNet1.3 datasets.

Conclusion: The method effectively localizes events under weak supervision by exploiting cross-modal consistency.

Abstract: The Dense Audio-Visual Event Localization (DAVEL) task aims to temporally
localize events in untrimmed videos that occur simultaneously in both the audio
and visual modalities. This paper explores DAVEL under a new and more
challenging weakly-supervised setting (W-DAVEL task), where only video-level
event labels are provided and the temporal boundaries of each event are
unknown. We address W-DAVEL by exploiting \textit{cross-modal salient anchors},
which are defined as reliable timestamps that are well predicted under weak
supervision and exhibit highly consistent event semantics across audio and
visual modalities. Specifically, we propose a \textit{Mutual Event Agreement
Evaluation} module, which generates an agreement score by measuring the
discrepancy between the predicted audio and visual event classes. Then, the
agreement score is utilized in a \textit{Cross-modal Salient Anchor
Identification} module, which identifies the audio and visual anchor features
through global-video and local temporal window identification mechanisms. The
anchor features after multimodal integration are fed into an
\textit{Anchor-based Temporal Propagation} module to enhance event semantic
encoding in the original temporal audio and visual features, facilitating
better temporal localization under weak supervision. We establish benchmarks
for W-DAVEL on both the UnAV-100 and ActivityNet1.3 datasets. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current tractography methods by ensuring fine-scale structural details and long-range consistency in streamline propagation.

Method: Introduces a dual-pathway encoding network for local and global modeling, combined with a conditional diffusion model for end-to-end tractography.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks (ISMRM Challenge, TractoInferno) and shows strong generalizability across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: DDTracking provides anatomically plausible, robust, and scalable tractography, suitable for broad dMRI applications.

Abstract: This paper presents DDTracking, a novel deep generative framework for
diffusion MRI tractography that formulates streamline propagation as a
conditional denoising diffusion process. In DDTracking, we introduce a
dual-pathway encoding network that jointly models local spatial encoding
(capturing fine-scale structural details at each streamline point) and global
temporal dependencies (ensuring long-range consistency across the entire
streamline). Furthermore, we design a conditional diffusion model module, which
leverages the learned local and global embeddings to predict streamline
propagation orientations for tractography in an end-to-end trainable manner. We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation across diverse, independently acquired dMRI
datasets, including both synthetic and clinical data. Experiments on two
well-established benchmarks with ground truth (ISMRM Challenge and
TractoInferno) demonstrate that DDTracking largely outperforms current
state-of-the-art tractography methods. Furthermore, our results highlight
DDTracking's strong generalizability across heterogeneous datasets, spanning
varying health conditions, age groups, imaging protocols, and scanner types.
Collectively, DDTracking offers anatomically plausible and robust tractography,
presenting a scalable, adaptable, and end-to-end learnable solution for broad

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalist VLMs struggle in the medical domain due to rare and domain-specific terms, while specialized medical VLMs require heavy resources.

Method: Decomposes clinical concepts into visual attributes (shape, density, location) and uses instruction-style prompts for region-text alignment.

Result: Compact models (0.23B and 2B parameters) trained with 1.5% of data match or outperform larger 7B+ VLMs, achieving up to 9.82% improvement in mAP50.

Conclusion: K2Sight bridges domain knowledge and spatial structure, enabling efficient training of high-performing compact models.

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of grounding abnormalities in medical
images, where the goal is to localize clinical findings based on textual
descriptions. While generalist Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in natural
grounding tasks, they often struggle in the medical domain due to rare,
compositional, and domain-specific terms that are poorly aligned with visual
patterns. Specialized medical VLMs address this challenge via large-scale
domain pretraining, but at the cost of substantial annotation and computational
resources. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{Knowledge to Sight
(K2Sight)}, a framework that introduces structured semantic supervision by
decomposing clinical concepts into interpretable visual attributes, such as
shape, density, and anatomical location. These attributes are distilled from
domain ontologies and encoded into concise instruction-style prompts, which
guide region-text alignment during training. Unlike conventional report-level
supervision, our approach explicitly bridges domain knowledge and spatial
structure, enabling data-efficient training of compact models. We train compact
models with 0.23B and 2B parameters using only 1.5\% of the data required by
state-of-the-art medical VLMs. Despite their small size and limited training
data, these models achieve performance on par with or better than 7B+ medical
VLMs, with up to 9.82\% improvement in $mAP_{50}$. Code and models:

*Enam Ahmed Taufik,Abdullah Khondoker,Antara Firoz Parsa,Seraj Al Mahmud Mostafa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework for skin disease classification evaluates pre-processing techniques and models, with DinoV2 and RGB achieving top performance (93% accuracy).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate skin disease classification is challenging due to inter-class similarity and complex textures, necessitating robust CAD systems.

Method: Evaluated RGB, CMY, and CLAHE pre-processing with DenseNet201, EfficientNetB5, ViT, Swin Transformer, and DinoV2 models.

Result: DinoV2 with RGB pre-processing achieved 93% accuracy and high F1-scores, with Grad-CAM showing precise lesion localization.

Conclusion: Effective pre-processing and model choice are crucial for robust, explainable dermatology CAD systems.

Abstract: Accurate skin disease classification is a critical yet challenging task due
to high inter-class similarity, intra-class variability, and complex lesion
textures. While deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have
shown promise in automating dermatological assessments, their performance is
highly dependent on image pre-processing and model architecture. This study
proposes a deep learning framework for multi-class skin disease classification,
systematically evaluating three image pre-processing techniques: standard RGB,
CMY color space transformation, and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram
Equalization (CLAHE). We benchmark the performance of pre-trained convolutional
neural networks (DenseNet201, Efficient-NetB5) and transformer-based models
(ViT, Swin Transformer, DinoV2 Large) using accuracy and F1-score as evaluation
metrics. Results show that DinoV2 with RGB pre-processing achieves the highest
accuracy (up to 93%) and F1-scores across all variants. Grad-CAM visualizations
applied to RGB inputs further reveal precise lesion localization, enhancing
interpretability. These findings underscore the importance of effective
pre-processing and model choice in building robust and explainable CAD systems
for dermatology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a fast 3D reconstruction method using 3D Gaussian-based SLAM and feed-forward pose prediction, reducing tracking time by over 90% while matching state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in real-sized 3D geometry recovery from pose-free RGB streams, particularly the limitations of existing methods (slow optimization, dependency on depth sensors).

Method: Integrates 3D Gaussian mapping into SLAM, uses feed-forward recurrent prediction for camera pose inference, and employs local graph rendering for robustness.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to SplaTAM with a 90% reduction in tracking time, validated on Replica and TUM-RGBD datasets.

Conclusion: The method offers a faster, efficient alternative for online 3D reconstruction without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Incrementally recovering real-sized 3D geometry from a pose-free RGB stream
is a challenging task in 3D reconstruction, requiring minimal assumptions on
input data. Existing methods can be broadly categorized into end-to-end and
visual SLAM-based approaches, both of which either struggle with long sequences
or depend on slow test-time optimization and depth sensors. To address this, we
first integrate a depth estimator into an RGB-D SLAM system, but this approach
is hindered by inaccurate geometric details in predicted depth. Through further
investigation, we find that 3D Gaussian mapping can effectively solve this
problem. Building on this, we propose an online 3D reconstruction method using
3D Gaussian-based SLAM, combined with a feed-forward recurrent prediction
module to directly infer camera pose from optical flow. This approach replaces
slow test-time optimization with fast network inference, significantly
improving tracking speed. Additionally, we introduce a local graph rendering
technique to enhance robustness in feed-forward pose prediction. Experimental
results on the Replica and TUM-RGBD datasets, along with a real-world
deployment demonstration, show that our method achieves performance on par with
the state-of-the-art SplaTAM, while reducing tracking time by more than 90\%.

*Tongfan Guan,Jiaxin Guo,Chen Wang,Yun-Hui Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniDepth unifies monocular and stereo depth estimation by iteratively aligning their latent representations, improving accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular and stereo depth estimation have complementary strengths and weaknesses, but existing methods remain disjoint. OmniDepth aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Uses iterative bidirectional alignment and a cross-attentive mechanism to synchronize monocular contextual cues with stereo representations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing zero-shot generalization error by >40% on benchmarks like Middlebury and ETH3D.

Conclusion: OmniDepth harmonizes multi-view geometry with monocular context, overcoming modality-specific limitations for robust 3D perception.

Abstract: Monocular and stereo depth estimation offer complementary strengths:
monocular methods capture rich contextual priors but lack geometric precision,
while stereo approaches leverage epipolar geometry yet struggle with
ambiguities such as reflective or textureless surfaces. Despite post-hoc
synergies, these paradigms remain largely disjoint in practice. We introduce
OmniDepth, a unified framework that bridges both through iterative
bidirectional alignment of their latent representations. At its core, a novel
cross-attentive alignment mechanism dynamically synchronizes monocular
contextual cues with stereo hypothesis representations during stereo reasoning.
This mutual alignment resolves stereo ambiguities (e.g., specular surfaces) by
injecting monocular structure priors while refining monocular depth with stereo
geometry within a single network. Extensive experiments demonstrate
state-of-the-art results: \textbf{OmniDepth reduces zero-shot generalization
error by $\!>\!40\%$ on Middlebury and ETH3D}, while addressing longstanding
failures on transparent and reflective surfaces. By harmonizing multi-view
geometry with monocular context, OmniDepth enables robust 3D perception that
transcends modality-specific limitations. Codes available at

*Kagan Ozturk,Deeksha Arun,Kevin W. Bowyer,Patrick Flynn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores how bilateral ear symmetry affects CNN-based ear recognition, finding that treating left and right ears separately improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the influence of bilateral ear symmetry on CNN-based ear recognition, as it has been overlooked in prior research.

Method: Developed an ear side classifier to categorize ears as left or right, then evaluated the impact of side information during training and testing across five datasets.

Result: Separate treatment of left and right ears during training and testing enhances performance. Ablation studies on alignment, input sizes, and hyperparameters offer practical insights.

Conclusion: Incorporating bilateral symmetry information improves CNN-based ear recognition, with practical guidelines for optimizing performance on large datasets.

Abstract: Ear recognition has gained attention as a reliable biometric technique due to
the distinctive characteristics of human ears. With the increasing availability
of large-scale datasets, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely
adopted to learn features directly from raw ear images, outperforming
traditional hand-crafted methods. However, the effect of bilateral ear symmetry
on the features learned by CNNs has received little attention in recent
studies. In this paper, we investigate how bilateral ear symmetry influences
the effectiveness of CNN-based ear recognition. To this end, we first develop
an ear side classifier to automatically categorize ear images as either left or
right. We then explore the impact of incorporating this side information during
both training and test. Cross-dataset evaluations are conducted on five
datasets. Our results suggest that treating left and right ears separately
during training and testing can lead to notable performance improvements.
Furthermore, our ablation studies on alignment strategies, input sizes, and
various hyperparameter settings provide practical insights into training
CNN-based ear recognition systems on large-scale datasets to achieve higher
verification rates.

in financial numerical reasoning tasks. Compared to existing benchmarks, our
work introduces three significant advancements. (1) Multimodality: We
meticulously transform existing financial reasoning benchmarks, and construct
novel questions from the latest Chinese financial research reports. FinMMR
comprises 4.3K questions and 8.7K images spanning 14 categories, including
tables, bar charts, and ownership structure charts. (2) Comprehensiveness:
FinMMR encompasses 14 financial subdomains, including corporate finance,
banking, and industry analysis, significantly exceeding existing benchmarks in

*Kushin Mukherjee,Donghao Ren,Dominik Moritz,Yannick Assogba*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EncQA is a new benchmark for chart understanding, evaluating VLMs on visual encodings and tasks. Results show uneven performance across tasks and encodings, with no clear improvement from model scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs lack comprehensive visual reasoning for chart understanding, necessitating a systematic benchmark like EncQA.

Method: EncQA introduces 2,076 synthetic QA pairs covering 6 visual encodings and 8 tasks, evaluated on 9 VLMs.

Result: Performance varies across tasks and encodings, with no consistent improvement from larger models.

Conclusion: Targeted strategies, not just scaling, are needed to advance chart understanding.

Abstract: Multimodal vision-language models (VLMs) continue to achieve ever-improving
scores on chart understanding benchmarks. Yet, we find that this progress does
not fully capture the breadth of visual reasoning capabilities essential for
interpreting charts. We introduce EncQA, a novel benchmark informed by the
visualization literature, designed to provide systematic coverage of visual
encodings and analytic tasks that are crucial for chart understanding. EncQA
provides 2,076 synthetic question-answer pairs, enabling balanced coverage of
six visual encoding channels (position, length, area, color quantitative, color
nominal, and shape) and eight tasks (find extrema, retrieve value, find
anomaly, filter values, compute derived value exact, compute derived value
relative, correlate values, and correlate values relative). Our evaluation of 9
state-of-the-art VLMs reveals that performance varies significantly across
encodings within the same task, as well as across tasks. Contrary to
expectations, we observe that performance does not improve with model size for
many task-encoding pairs. Our results suggest that advancing chart
understanding requires targeted strategies addressing specific visual reasoning
gaps, rather than solely scaling up model or dataset size.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of LLMs in pixel-level perception and SAM's shortcomings in multi-mask prediction and category-specific segmentation, aiming for a unified model.

Method: Introduces X-SAM, a streamlined MLLM framework with a unified training strategy for diverse datasets and a new VGD segmentation task.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on various segmentation benchmarks, demonstrating superior multimodal, pixel-level understanding.

Conclusion: X-SAM effectively extends segmentation capabilities, offering a unified solution for advanced pixel-level perceptual tasks in MLLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in broad
knowledge representation, yet they are inherently deficient in pixel-level
perceptual understanding. Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) represents
a significant advancement in visual-prompt-driven image segmentation, it
exhibits notable limitations in multi-mask prediction and category-specific
segmentation tasks, and it cannot integrate all segmentation tasks within a
unified model architecture. To address these limitations, we present X-SAM, a
streamlined Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) framework that extends the
segmentation paradigm from \textit{segment anything} to \textit{any
segmentation}. Specifically, we introduce a novel unified framework that
enables more advanced pixel-level perceptual comprehension for MLLMs.
Furthermore, we propose a new segmentation task, termed Visual GrounDed (VGD)
segmentation, which segments all instance objects with interactive visual
prompts and empowers MLLMs with visual grounded, pixel-wise interpretative
capabilities. To enable effective training on diverse data sources, we present
a unified training strategy that supports co-training across multiple datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate that X-SAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance on a wide range of image segmentation benchmarks, highlighting its
efficiency for multimodal, pixel-level visual understanding. Code is available

TL;DR: PixCuboid is an optimization-based method for cuboid-shaped room layout estimation using multi-view alignment of deep features, outperforming single-view methods and extending to multi-room scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coarse room layout estimation is crucial for downstream tasks, but current methods rely on single views and panoramic assumptions. PixCuboid addresses this by leveraging multi-view alignment.

Method: PixCuboid uses dense deep features and end-to-end training to optimize room layout estimation, enabling large convergence basins and smooth loss landscapes. Simple heuristics initialize the layout.

Result: PixCuboid outperforms competitors on new benchmarks (ScanNet++ and 2D-3D-Semantics) with verified ground truth. It also extends to multi-room estimation despite single-cuboid training.

Conclusion: PixCuboid offers a flexible, optimization-based solution for room layout estimation, excelling in performance and scalability to multi-room scenarios.

Abstract: Coarse room layout estimation provides important geometric cues for many
downstream tasks. Current state-of-the-art methods are predominantly based on
single views and often assume panoramic images. We introduce PixCuboid, an
optimization-based approach for cuboid-shaped room layout estimation, which is
based on multi-view alignment of dense deep features. By training with the
optimization end-to-end, we learn feature maps that yield large convergence
basins and smooth loss landscapes in the alignment. This allows us to
initialize the room layout using simple heuristics.
  For the evaluation we propose two new benchmarks based on ScanNet++ and
2D-3D-Semantics, with manually verified ground truth 3D cuboids. In thorough
experiments we validate our approach and significantly outperform the
competition. Finally, while our network is trained with single cuboids, the
flexibility of the optimization-based approach allow us to easily extend to
multi-room estimation, e.g. larger apartments or offices. Code and model
weights are available at https://github.com/ghanning/PixCuboid.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HierarchicalPrune compresses billion-scale text-to-image diffusion models for on-device inference, reducing memory and latency while preserving output quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Massive parameter scales (8-11B) in diffusion models hinder inference on resource-constrained devices.

Method: Combines Hierarchical Position Pruning, Positional Weight Preservation, and Sensitivity-Guided Distillation to compress models.

Result: Achieves 77.5-80.4% memory reduction, 27.9-38.0% latency reduction, with minimal quality drop (2.6% GenEval, 7% HPSv2).

Conclusion: HierarchicalPrune enables efficient on-device inference without significant perceptual quality loss, outperforming prior methods.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) achieve remarkable
quality, yet their massive parameter scale (8-11B) poses significant challenges
for inferences on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present
HierarchicalPrune, a novel compression framework grounded in a key observation:
DM blocks exhibit distinct functional hierarchies, where early blocks establish
semantic structures while later blocks handle texture refinements.
HierarchicalPrune synergistically combines three techniques: (1) Hierarchical
Position Pruning, which identifies and removes less essential later blocks
based on position hierarchy; (2) Positional Weight Preservation, which
systematically protects early model portions that are essential for semantic
structural integrity; and (3) Sensitivity-Guided Distillation, which adjusts
knowledge-transfer intensity based on our discovery of block-wise sensitivity
variations. As a result, our framework brings billion-scale diffusion models
into a range more suitable for on-device inference, while preserving the
quality of the output images. Specifically, when combined with INT4 weight
quantisation, HierarchicalPrune achieves 77.5-80.4% memory footprint reduction
(e.g., from 15.8 GB to 3.2 GB) and 27.9-38.0% latency reduction, measured on
server and consumer grade GPUs, with the minimum drop of 2.6% in GenEval score
and 7% in HPSv2 score compared to the original model. Last but not least, our
comprehensive user study with 85 participants demonstrates that
HierarchicalPrune maintains perceptual quality comparable to the original model
while significantly outperforming prior works.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ANPrompt is a robust prompt tuning framework for vision-language models, addressing vulnerability to weak semantic perturbations by integrating noise prompts and noise-resistant visual prototypes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt-tuned VLMs are vulnerable to subtle noise, degrading their generalization to unseen classes.

Method: ANPrompt constructs noise prompts by fusing original and perturbed text embeddings, integrates them with learnable tokens, and computes noise-resistant visual prototypes. It also introduces alignment and robustness objectives.

Result: ANPrompt outperforms existing methods on 11 benchmarks, showing superior robustness to noise and better generalization.

Conclusion: ANPrompt effectively enhances the robustness and generalization of prompt-tuned VLMs against weak semantic perturbations.

Abstract: Prompt tuning has emerged as an efficient and effective technique for
adapting vision-language models (VLMs) with low computational overhead.
However, existing methods often overlook the vulnerability of prompt-tuned VLMs
to weak semantic perturbations-such as subtle image or text noise-that degrade
their generalization to unseen classes. To address this limitation, we propose
ANPrompt, a novel prompt tuning framework designed to enhance robustness under
such perturbations. ANPrompt first constructs weak noise text features by
fusing original and noise-perturbed text embeddings, which are then clustered
to form noise prompts. These noise prompts are integrated with learnable prompt
tokens to generate anti-noise prompts, which are injected into the deeper
layers of both image and text encoders. To further capture the noise-aware
visual semantics, ANPrompt computes the Noise-Resistant Visual Prompt Prototype
(NRVPP) by averaging the output prompt tokens from the vision encoder. Finally,
ANPrompt introduces alignment, robustness, and anti-noise objectives by
computing a Weak semantic noise Alignment Loss (WALoss) alongside the standard
cross-entropy and sim loss. Experiments across 11 benchmarks demonstrate that
ANPrompt consistently outperforms existing prompt tuning approaches, achieving
superior robustness to semantic noise and improved generalization to novel
categories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack generalist interaction knowledge and egocentric perspectives, which are crucial for AI assistants to perceive and act effectively.

Method: A vision-language-action framework is used, with a hybrid RGB-MoCap system to capture interactions between assistants and instructors following GPT-generated scripts.

Result: InterVLA dataset includes 11.4 hours of multimodal data (1.2M frames) with egocentric/exocentric videos, human/object motions, and verbal commands. Benchmarks for motion estimation, interaction synthesis, and prediction are established.

Conclusion: InterVLA and its benchmarks aim to advance research on AI agents in the physical world by addressing gaps in interaction datasets.

Abstract: Learning action models from real-world human-centric interaction datasets is
important towards building general-purpose intelligent assistants with
efficiency. However, most existing datasets only offer specialist interaction
category and ignore that AI assistants perceive and act based on first-person
acquisition. We urge that both the generalist interaction knowledge and
egocentric modality are indispensable. In this paper, we embed the
manual-assisted task into a vision-language-action framework, where the
assistant provides services to the instructor following egocentric vision and
commands. With our hybrid RGB-MoCap system, pairs of assistants and instructors
engage with multiple objects and the scene following GPT-generated scripts.
Under this setting, we accomplish InterVLA, the first large-scale
human-object-human interaction dataset with 11.4 hours and 1.2M frames of
multimodal data, spanning 2 egocentric and 5 exocentric videos, accurate
human/object motions and verbal commands. Furthermore, we establish novel
benchmarks on egocentric human motion estimation, interaction synthesis, and
interaction prediction with comprehensive analysis. We believe that our
InterVLA testbed and the benchmarks will foster future works on building AI
agents in the physical world.

Conclusion: Pretraining captures spatiotemporal features, and balanced learning enhances detection and prediction, making TurboTrain effective.

Abstract: End-to-end training of multi-agent systems offers significant advantages in
improving multi-task performance. However, training such models remains
challenging and requires extensive manual design and monitoring. In this work,
we introduce TurboTrain, a novel and efficient training framework for
multi-agent perception and prediction. TurboTrain comprises two key components:
a multi-agent spatiotemporal pretraining scheme based on masked reconstruction
learning and a balanced multi-task learning strategy based on gradient conflict
suppression. By streamlining the training process, our framework eliminates the
need for manually designing and tuning complex multi-stage training pipelines,
substantially reducing training time and improving performance. We evaluate
TurboTrain on a real-world cooperative driving dataset, V2XPnP-Seq, and
demonstrate that it further improves the performance of state-of-the-art
multi-agent perception and prediction models. Our results highlight that
pretraining effectively captures spatiotemporal multi-agent features and
significantly benefits downstream tasks. Moreover, the proposed balanced
multi-task learning strategy enhances detection and prediction.

Conclusion: Highlights the importance of representation learning in BEV perception as a complementary approach to task-specific optimizations.

Abstract: We present BEVCon, a simple yet effective contrastive learning framework
designed to improve Bird's Eye View (BEV) perception in autonomous driving. BEV
perception offers a top-down-view representation of the surrounding
environment, making it crucial for 3D object detection, segmentation, and
trajectory prediction tasks. While prior work has primarily focused on
enhancing BEV encoders and task-specific heads, we address the underexplored
potential of representation learning in BEV models. BEVCon introduces two
contrastive learning modules: an instance feature contrast module for refining
BEV features and a perspective view contrast module that enhances the image
backbone. The dense contrastive learning designed on top of detection losses
leads to improved feature representations across both the BEV encoder and the
backbone. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that BEVCon
achieves consistent performance gains, achieving up to +2.4% mAP improvement
over state-of-the-art baselines. Our results highlight the critical role of
representation learning in BEV perception and offer a complementary avenue to
conventional task-specific optimizations.

*Ziyang Leng,Jiawei Yang,Wenlong Yi,Bolei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ST-Occ is a framework for 3D occupancy representation learning in autonomous driving, improving spatiotemporal feature learning with temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently aggregating 3D occupancy over time is challenging due to high processing costs and voxel uncertainty/dynamics.

Method: ST-Occ uses a spatiotemporal memory and memory attention to capture historical information and condition current occupancy with uncertainty/dynamic awareness.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art by 3 mIoU and reduces temporal inconsistency by 29%.

Conclusion: ST-Occ effectively enhances spatiotemporal representation for 3D occupancy prediction.

Abstract: 3D occupancy becomes a promising perception representation for autonomous
driving to model the surrounding environment at a fine-grained scale. However,
it remains challenging to efficiently aggregate 3D occupancy over time across
multiple input frames due to the high processing cost and the uncertainty and
dynamics of voxels. To address this issue, we propose ST-Occ, a scene-level
occupancy representation learning framework that effectively learns the
spatiotemporal feature with temporal consistency. ST-Occ consists of two core
designs: a spatiotemporal memory that captures comprehensive historical
information and stores it efficiently through a scene-level representation and
a memory attention that conditions the current occupancy representation on the
spatiotemporal memory with a model of uncertainty and dynamic awareness. Our
method significantly enhances the spatiotemporal representation learned for 3D
occupancy prediction tasks by exploiting the temporal dependency between
multi-frame inputs. Experiments show that our approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 3 mIoU and reduces the temporal
inconsistency by 29%.

### [134] [MI9 -- Agent Intelligence Protocol: Runtime Governance for Agentic AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03858)
*Charles L. Wang,Trisha Singhal,Ameya Kelkar,Jason Tuo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MI9 is a runtime governance framework for agentic AI systems, addressing emergent risks with real-time controls and ensuring safe deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic AI systems pose unique governance challenges due to unpredictable behaviors, requiring solutions beyond pre-deployment governance.

Method: MI9 integrates six components: agency-risk index, telemetry capture, authorization monitoring, FSM conformance engines, drift detection, and containment strategies.

Result: MI9 effectively covers governance gaps in agentic AI, enabling safe and responsible deployment in production environments.

Conclusion: MI9 provides a foundational framework for scalable and comprehensive oversight of agentic AI systems.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems capable of reasoning, planning, and executing actions
present fundamentally distinct governance challenges compared to traditional AI
models. Unlike conventional AI, these systems exhibit emergent and unexpected
behaviors during runtime, introducing novel agent-related risks that cannot be
fully anticipated through pre-deployment governance alone. To address this
critical gap, we introduce MI9, the first fully integrated runtime governance
framework designed specifically for safety and alignment of agentic AI systems.
MI9 introduces real-time controls through six integrated components:
agency-risk index, agent-semantic telemetry capture, continuous authorization
monitoring, Finite-State-Machine (FSM)-based conformance engines,
goal-conditioned drift detection, and graduated containment strategies.
Operating transparently across heterogeneous agent architectures, MI9 enables
the systematic, safe, and responsible deployment of agentic systems in
production environments where conventional governance approaches fall short,
providing the foundational infrastructure for safe agentic AI deployment at
scale. Detailed analysis through a diverse set of scenarios demonstrates MI9's
systematic coverage of governance challenges that existing approaches fail to
address, establishing the technical foundation for comprehensive agentic AI
oversight.

### [135] [Evo-MARL: Co-Evolutionary Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Internalized Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03864)
*Zhenyu Pan,Yiting Zhang,Yutong Zhang,Jianshu Zhang,Haozheng Luo,Yuwei Han,Dennis Wu,Hong-Yu Chen,Philip S. Yu,Manling Li,Han Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Evo-MARL is a MARL framework that trains task agents to perform their primary functions while resisting adversarial threats, eliminating the need for external safety modules and improving both safety and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defenses for multi-agent systems rely on external guard modules, which are limited in protection and prone to single-point failure. Evo-MARL aims to address these weaknesses by integrating defensive capabilities directly into task agents.

Method: Evo-MARL combines evolutionary search with parameter-sharing reinforcement learning to co-evolve attackers and defenders, training agents to handle adversarial threats while performing their primary tasks.

Result: Evo-MARL reduces attack success rates by up to 22% and improves accuracy by up to 5% on reasoning tasks, showing joint improvement in safety and utility.

Conclusion: Evo-MARL successfully internalizes safety mechanisms in multi-agent systems, enhancing robustness and performance without increasing system overhead or single-node failure risks.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) built on multimodal large language models exhibit
strong collaboration and performance. However, their growing openness and
interaction complexity pose serious risks, notably jailbreak and adversarial
attacks. Existing defenses typically rely on external guard modules, such as
dedicated safety agents, to handle unsafe behaviors. Unfortunately, this
paradigm faces two challenges: (1) standalone agents offer limited protection,
and (2) their independence leads to single-point failure-if compromised,
system-wide safety collapses. Naively increasing the number of guard agents
further raises cost and complexity. To address these challenges, we propose
Evo-MARL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that
enables all task agents to jointly acquire defensive capabilities. Rather than
relying on external safety modules, Evo-MARL trains each agent to
simultaneously perform its primary function and resist adversarial threats,
ensuring robustness without increasing system overhead or single-node failure.
Furthermore, Evo-MARL integrates evolutionary search with parameter-sharing
reinforcement learning to co-evolve attackers and defenders. This adversarial
training paradigm internalizes safety mechanisms and continually enhances MAS
performance under co-evolving threats. Experiments show that Evo-MARL reduces
attack success rates by up to 22% while boosting accuracy by up to 5% on
reasoning tasks-demonstrating that safety and utility can be jointly improved.

*Nguyen Viet Tuan Kiet,Dao Van Tung,Tran Cong Dao,Huynh Thi Thanh Binh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MOTIF introduces a multi-strategy optimization framework using LLM agents for solver design in COPs, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches limit innovation by focusing on single components in solver design for COPs, missing broader optimization opportunities.

Method: Proposes MOTIF, a Monte Carlo Tree Search-based framework with turn-based interaction between two LLM agents to jointly optimize interdependent components.

Result: MOTIF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple COP domains.

Conclusion: Turn-based, multi-agent prompting shows promise for fully automated solver design in COPs.

Abstract: Designing effective algorithmic components remains a fundamental obstacle in
tackling NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems (COPs), where solvers
often rely on carefully hand-crafted strategies. Despite recent advances in
using large language models (LLMs) to synthesize high-quality components, most
approaches restrict the search to a single element - commonly a heuristic
scoring function - thus missing broader opportunities for innovation. In this
paper, we introduce a broader formulation of solver design as a multi-strategy
optimization problem, which seeks to jointly improve a set of interdependent
components under a unified objective. To address this, we propose
Multi-strategy Optimization via Turn-based Interactive Framework (MOTIF) - a
novel framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search that facilitates turn-based
optimization between two LLM agents. At each turn, an agent improves one
component by leveraging the history of both its own and its opponent's prior
updates, promoting both competitive pressure and emergent cooperation. This
structured interaction broadens the search landscape and encourages the
discovery of diverse, high-performing solutions. Experiments across multiple
COP domains show that MOTIF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
highlighting the promise of turn-based, multi-agent prompting for fully
automated solver design.

*Zewen Liu,Juntong Ni,Xianfeng Tang,Max S. Y. Lau,Wei Jin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SymbolBench is introduced to evaluate LLMs' symbolic reasoning on time series data, revealing strengths and limitations in automated scientific discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of uncovering symbolic laws from time series data persists, with LLMs' potential in this area underexplored.

Method: A benchmark (SymbolBench) assesses symbolic reasoning across three tasks, and a framework integrates LLMs with genetic programming for closed-loop reasoning.

Result: Empirical results show LLMs' capabilities and limitations, emphasizing the need for domain knowledge and structured reasoning.

Conclusion: Combining domain knowledge, context alignment, and reasoning structure can enhance LLMs' role in scientific discovery.

Abstract: Uncovering hidden symbolic laws from time series data, as an aspiration
dating back to Kepler's discovery of planetary motion, remains a core challenge
in scientific discovery and artificial intelligence. While Large Language
Models show promise in structured reasoning tasks, their ability to infer
interpretable, context-aligned symbolic structures from time series data is
still underexplored. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce
SymbolBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess symbolic reasoning
over real-world time series across three tasks: multivariate symbolic
regression, Boolean network inference, and causal discovery. Unlike prior
efforts limited to simple algebraic equations, SymbolBench spans a diverse set
of symbolic forms with varying complexity. We further propose a unified
framework that integrates LLMs with genetic programming to form a closed-loop
symbolic reasoning system, where LLMs act both as predictors and evaluators.
Our empirical results reveal key strengths and limitations of current models,
highlighting the importance of combining domain knowledge, context alignment,
and reasoning structure to improve LLMs in automated scientific discovery.

### [138] [The Emotional Baby Is Truly Deadly: Does your Multimodal Large Reasoning Model Have Emotional Flattery towards Humans?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03986)
*Yuan Xun,Xiaojun Jia,Xinwei Liu,Hua Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EmoAgent exploits emotional cues to hijack MLRM reasoning, revealing safety flaws like hidden harmful reasoning and emotional misalignment. Metrics (RRSS, RVNR, RAIC) quantify these risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLRMs for human-centric service are vulnerable to emotional manipulation, bypassing safety checks. This exposes gaps in model safety.

Method: Proposes EmoAgent, an adversarial framework using exaggerated affective prompts to test MLRM reasoning and safety. Introduces RRSS, RVNR, RAIC metrics.

Result: EmoAgent successfully exposes hidden harmful reasoning and emotional misalignment, even when risks are visually identified.

Conclusion: Emotional manipulation reveals critical safety flaws in MLRMs, necessitating improved safeguards against cognitive misalignments.

Abstract: We observe that MLRMs oriented toward human-centric service are highly
susceptible to user emotional cues during the deep-thinking stage, often
overriding safety protocols or built-in safety checks under high emotional
intensity. Inspired by this key insight, we propose EmoAgent, an autonomous
adversarial emotion-agent framework that orchestrates exaggerated affective
prompts to hijack reasoning pathways. Even when visual risks are correctly
identified, models can still produce harmful completions through emotional
misalignment. We further identify persistent high-risk failure modes in
transparent deep-thinking scenarios, such as MLRMs generating harmful reasoning
masked behind seemingly safe responses. These failures expose misalignments
between internal inference and surface-level behavior, eluding existing
content-based safeguards. To quantify these risks, we introduce three metrics:
(1) Risk-Reasoning Stealth Score (RRSS) for harmful reasoning beneath benign
outputs; (2) Risk-Visual Neglect Rate (RVNR) for unsafe completions despite
visual risk recognition; and (3) Refusal Attitude Inconsistency (RAIC) for
evaluating refusal unstability under prompt variants. Extensive experiments on
advanced MLRMs demonstrate the effectiveness of EmoAgent and reveal deeper
emotional cognitive misalignments in model safety behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored proactive behaviors in IPAs and unify cognitive architecture with system design.

Method: Proposes Cognition Forest for cognitive modeling alignment and Galaxy framework for multidimensional interactions and personalized capabilities. Implements KoRa and Kernel agents.

Result: Galaxy outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, validated by ablation studies and real-world cases.

Conclusion: Galaxy successfully integrates cognitive architecture and system design, enabling proactive, privacy-preserving, and self-evolving IPAs.

Abstract: Intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) such as Siri and Google Assistant are
designed to enhance human capabilities and perform tasks on behalf of users.
The emergence of LLM agents brings new opportunities for the development of
IPAs. While responsive capabilities have been widely studied, proactive
behaviors remain underexplored. Designing an IPA that is proactive,
privacy-preserving, and capable of self-evolution remains a significant
challenge. Designing such IPAs relies on the cognitive architecture of LLM
agents. This work proposes Cognition Forest, a semantic structure designed to
align cognitive modeling with system-level design. We unify cognitive
architecture and system design into a self-reinforcing loop instead of treating
them separately. Based on this principle, we present Galaxy, a framework that
supports multidimensional interactions and personalized capability generation.
Two cooperative agents are implemented based on Galaxy: KoRa, a
cognition-enhanced generative agent that supports both responsive and proactive
skills; and Kernel, a meta-cognition-based meta-agent that enables Galaxy's
self-evolution and privacy preservation. Experimental results show that Galaxy
outperforms multiple state-of-the-art benchmarks. Ablation studies and
real-world interaction cases validate the effectiveness of Galaxy.

*Chao Hao,Shuai Wang,Kaiwen Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RecAgent is an uncertainty-aware GUI agent that reduces input redundancy and decision ambiguity using adaptive perception, component recommendation, and user feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI agents struggle with input redundancy and decision ambiguity, limiting their effectiveness in mobile task automation.

Method: RecAgent uses component recommendation to reduce perceptual uncertainty and an interactive module for decision uncertainty, integrating these into a unified framework.

Result: The approach is validated through extensive experiments, and a dataset (ComplexAction) is introduced for evaluation.

Conclusion: RecAgent effectively addresses GUI navigation challenges, with its dataset and code made publicly available.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have shown promise in automating mobile
tasks but still struggle with input redundancy and decision ambiguity. In this
paper, we present \textbf{RecAgent}, an uncertainty-aware agent that addresses
these issues through adaptive perception. We distinguish two types of
uncertainty in GUI navigation: (1) perceptual uncertainty, caused by input
redundancy and noise from comprehensive screen information, and (2) decision
uncertainty, arising from ambiguous tasks and complex reasoning. To reduce
perceptual uncertainty, RecAgent employs a component recommendation mechanism
that identifies and focuses on the most relevant UI elements. For decision
uncertainty, it uses an interactive module to request user feedback in
ambiguous situations, enabling intent-aware decisions. These components are
integrated into a unified framework that proactively reduces input complexity
and reacts to high-uncertainty cases via human-in-the-loop refinement.
Additionally, we propose a dataset called \textbf{ComplexAction} to evaluate
the success rate of GUI agents in executing specified single-step actions
within complex scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of
our approach. The dataset and code will be available at
https://github.com/Fanye12/RecAgent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current computer-use agents underperform, limiting practical applications. The paper aims to develop a more efficient and capable agent (SEA) to bridge this gap.

Method: Proposes an automatic pipeline for verifiable trajectory generation, efficient step-wise reinforcement learning for long-horizon tasks, and a model enhancement method combining grounding and planning without extra training.

Result: SEA achieves superior performance with 7B parameters, outperforming same-sized models and competing with larger ones.

Conclusion: SEA demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed innovations, offering a promising solution for computer-use agents. The model and code will be open-sourced.

Abstract: Computer use agent is an emerging area in artificial intelligence that aims
to operate the computers to achieve the user's tasks, which attracts a lot of
attention from both industry and academia. However, the present agents'
performance is far from being used. In this paper, we propose the
Self-Evolution Agent (SEA) for computer use, and to develop this agent, we
propose creative methods in data generation, reinforcement learning, and model
enhancement. Specifically, we first propose an automatic pipeline to generate
the verifiable trajectory for training. And then, we propose efficient
step-wise reinforcement learning to alleviate the significant computational
requirements for long-horizon training. In the end, we propose the enhancement
method to merge the grounding and planning ability into one model without any
extra training. Accordingly, based on our proposed innovation of data
generation, training strategy, and enhancement, we get the Selfevolution Agent
(SEA) for computer use with only 7B parameters, which outperforms models with
the same number of parameters and has comparable performance to larger ones. We
will make the models' weight and related codes open-source in the future.

Motivation: To explore how aligning learning content with career goals using GenAI enhances learner engagement and outcomes.

Method: Mixed-methods experiment with 4,000+ learners, comparing career goal-tailored content (intervention) vs. standard content (control).

Result: Increased session duration, higher satisfaction, reduced study time; learners found personalized content motivating and practical.

Conclusion: Career goal-based AI personalization improves learning by bridging academic knowledge and workplace needs.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly integrated into digital

Motivation: Addressing the limitations of LLMs in complex reasoning tasks such as mathematical reasoning and code generation.

Method: Proposes KGA-ECoT, which decomposes problems into a Structured Task Graph, uses GraphRAG for knowledge retrieval, and generates verifiable code.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on mathematical reasoning benchmarks with notable accuracy improvements.

Conclusion: KGA-ECoT is a robust, generalizable framework for complex mathematical reasoning, validated by its performance and analysis.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have excelled in natural
language processing tasks but face significant challenges in complex reasoning
tasks such as mathematical reasoning and code generation. To address these
limitations, we propose KG-Augmented Executable Chain-of-Thought (KGA-ECoT), a
novel framework that enhances code generation through knowledge graphs and
improves mathematical reasoning via executable code. KGA-ECoT decomposes
problems into a Structured Task Graph, leverages efficient GraphRAG for precise
knowledge retrieval from mathematical libraries, and generates verifiable code
to ensure computational accuracy. Evaluations on multiple mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that KGA-ECoT significantly outperforms
existing prompting methods, achieving absolute accuracy improvements ranging
from several to over ten percentage points. Further analysis confirms the
critical roles of GraphRAG in enhancing code quality and external code
execution in ensuring precision. These findings collectively establish KGA-ECoT
as a robust and highly generalizable framework for complex mathematical

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GeoSR is a self-refining framework integrating geographic principles into LLMs to improve spatial reasoning, addressing challenges like inconsistency and bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance LLMs' geospatial competence by tackling issues like spatial inconsistency and geographic bias.

Method: GeoSR uses three agents (variable-selection, point-selection, refine) in an iterative loop to refine predictions by leveraging spatial dependencies.

Result: GeoSR outperforms standard prompting, improving accuracy and equity in geospatial predictions.

Conclusion: Incorporating geostatistical priors and structured reasoning into LLMs enhances geospatial prediction quality.

Abstract: Recent studies have extended the application of large language models (LLMs)
to geographic problems, revealing surprising geospatial competence even without
explicit spatial supervision. However, LLMs still face challenges in spatial
consistency, multi-hop reasoning, and geographic bias. To address these issues,
we propose GeoSR, a self-refining agentic reasoning framework that embeds core
geographic principles -- most notably Tobler's First Law of Geography -- into
an iterative prediction loop. In GeoSR, the reasoning process is decomposed
into three collaborating agents: (1) a variable-selection agent that selects
relevant covariates from the same location; (2) a point-selection agent that
chooses reference predictions at nearby locations generated by the LLM in
previous rounds; and (3) a refine agent that coordinates the iterative
refinement process by evaluating prediction quality and triggering further
rounds when necessary. This agentic loop progressively improves prediction
quality by leveraging both spatial dependencies and inter-variable
relationships. We validate GeoSR on tasks ranging from physical-world property
estimation to socioeconomic prediction. Experimental results show consistent
improvements over standard prompting strategies, demonstrating that
incorporating geostatistical priors and spatially structured reasoning into
LLMs leads to more accurate and equitable geospatial predictions. The code of
GeoSR is available at https://github.com/JinfanTang/GeoSR.

*Karrtik Iyer,Manikandan Ravikiran,Prasanna Pendse,Shayan Mohanty*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces semantic entropy, a measure of variability in GPT-4-generated explanations for student responses, to predict human grader disagreement. It validates this measure across subjects and task features, showing alignment with human disagreement and sensitivity to interpretive reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated grading systems lack transparency in uncertain or contentious grading decisions. Semantic entropy aims to provide a quantifiable proxy for human grader disagreement, enhancing trust in AI-assisted grading.

Method: The authors use GPT-4 to generate multiple explanations for student responses, cluster them by entailment-based similarity, and compute entropy over these clusters. They test semantic entropy's alignment with human disagreement, generalizability across subjects, and sensitivity to task features.

Result: Experiments on the ASAP-SAS dataset confirm semantic entropy correlates with human grader disagreement, varies by subject, and increases in tasks requiring interpretive reasoning.

Conclusion: Semantic entropy serves as an interpretable uncertainty signal, improving transparency and trustworthiness in AI-assisted grading workflows.

Abstract: Automated grading systems can efficiently score short-answer responses, yet
they often fail to indicate when a grading decision is uncertain or potentially
contentious. We introduce semantic entropy, a measure of variability across
multiple GPT-4-generated explanations for the same student response, as a proxy
for human grader disagreement. By clustering rationales via entailment-based
similarity and computing entropy over these clusters, we quantify the diversity
of justifications without relying on final output scores. We address three
research questions: (1) Does semantic entropy align with human grader
disagreement? (2) Does it generalize across academic subjects? (3) Is it
sensitive to structural task features such as source dependency? Experiments on
the ASAP-SAS dataset show that semantic entropy correlates with rater
disagreement, varies meaningfully across subjects, and increases in tasks
requiring interpretive reasoning. Our findings position semantic entropy as an
interpretable uncertainty signal that supports more transparent and trustworthy
AI-assisted grading workflows.

*Yongkang Li,Shengping Xiao,Shufang Zhu,Jianwen Li,Geguang Pu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework for compositional on-the-fly synthesis from LTLf formulas integrates pre-game and incremental DFA construction, improving scalability and enabling early unrealizability detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for DFA construction in LTLf synthesis are either compositional or incremental, but neither dominates. The goal is to combine their strengths for better performance.

Method: Introduces a compositional on-the-fly synthesis framework that applies composition during game solving, with two variants: pruning before or during composition.

Result: The framework solves instances other solvers cannot, with both composition variants showing unique advantages.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively combines compositional and incremental approaches, enhancing scalability and unrealizability detection in LTLf synthesis.

Abstract: Reactive synthesis from Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (LTLf) can
be reduced to a two-player game over a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) of
the LTLf specification. The primary challenge here is DFA construction, which
is 2EXPTIME-complete in the worst case. Existing techniques either construct
the DFA compositionally before solving the game, leveraging automata
minimization to mitigate state-space explosion, or build the DFA incrementally
during game solving to avoid full DFA construction. However, neither is
dominant. In this paper, we introduce a compositional on-the-fly synthesis
framework that integrates the strengths of both approaches, focusing on large
conjunctions of smaller LTLf formulas common in practice. This framework
applies composition during game solving instead of automata (game arena)
construction. While composing all intermediate results may be necessary in the
worst case, pruning these results simplifies subsequent compositions and
enables early detection of unrealizability. Specifically, the framework allows
two composition variants: pruning before composition to take full advantage of
minimization or pruning during composition to guide on-the-fly synthesis.
Compared to state-of-the-art synthesis solvers, our framework is able to solve
a notable number of instances that other solvers cannot handle. A detailed
analysis shows that both composition variants have unique merits.

TL;DR: AgREE, an agent-based framework, outperforms existing KGC methods by up to 13.7% for emerging entities without training, using iterative retrieval and multi-step reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KGC methods struggle with up-to-date and comprehensive information for emerging entities, relying heavily on supervision and training data.

Method: AgREE combines iterative retrieval actions and multi-step reasoning to dynamically construct knowledge graph triplets.

Result: AgREE significantly outperforms existing methods, especially for emerging entities, and introduces a new evaluation methodology and benchmark.

Conclusion: Agent-based reasoning with strategic retrieval effectively maintains up-to-date knowledge graphs in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Open-domain Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) faces significant challenges in
an ever-changing world, especially when considering the continual emergence of
new entities in daily news. Existing approaches for KGC mainly rely on
pretrained language models' parametric knowledge, pre-constructed queries, or
single-step retrieval, typically requiring substantial supervision and training
data. Even so, they often fail to capture comprehensive and up-to-date
information about unpopular and/or emerging entities. To this end, we introduce
Agentic Reasoning for Emerging Entities (AgREE), a novel agent-based framework
that combines iterative retrieval actions and multi-step reasoning to
dynamically construct rich knowledge graph triplets. Experiments show that,
despite requiring zero training efforts, AgREE significantly outperforms
existing methods in constructing knowledge graph triplets, especially for
emerging entities that were not seen during language models' training
processes, outperforming previous methods by up to 13.7%. Moreover, we propose
a new evaluation methodology that addresses a fundamental weakness of existing
setups and a new benchmark for KGC on emerging entities. Our work demonstrates
the effectiveness of combining agent-based reasoning with strategic information
retrieval for maintaining up-to-date knowledge graphs in dynamic information
environments.

Motivation: Current data-driven methods for ad hoc teamwork require large labeled datasets, lack transparency, and struggle with rapid knowledge updates, especially as agent numbers grow.

Method: The architecture uses non-monotonic logical reasoning with prior knowledge, learned models for predicting other agents' behavior, and anticipated future goals from a foundation model.

Result: The method is evaluated in VirtualHome, a realistic 3D simulation environment, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Leveraging both knowledge-based and data-driven approaches enhances ad hoc teamwork by addressing limitations of purely data-driven methods.

Abstract: AI agents deployed in assistive roles often have to collaborate with other
agents (humans, AI systems) without prior coordination. Methods considered
state of the art for such ad hoc teamwork often pursue a data-driven approach
that needs a large labeled dataset of prior observations, lacks transparency,
and makes it difficult to rapidly revise existing knowledge in response to
changes. As the number of agents increases, the complexity of decision-making
makes it difficult to collaborate effectively. This paper advocates leveraging
the complementary strengths of knowledge-based and data-driven methods for
reasoning and learning for ad hoc teamwork. For any given goal, our
architecture enables each ad hoc agent to determine its actions through
non-monotonic logical reasoning with: (a) prior commonsense domain-specific
knowledge; (b) models learned and revised rapidly to predict the behavior of
other agents; and (c) anticipated abstract future goals based on generic
knowledge of similar situations in an existing foundation model. We
experimentally evaluate our architecture's capabilities in VirtualHome, a
realistic physics-based 3D simulation environment.

*Jiaying Zhu,Ziyang Zheng,Zhengyuan Shi,Yalun Cai,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CASCAD is a circuit-aware SAT solver using GNNs to compute gate-level probabilities, improving CDCL heuristics and achieving up to 10x faster solving times than CNF-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard CNF-based SAT solvers discard circuit structural information, leading to inefficiency. CASCAD aims to leverage this information for better performance.

Method: CASCAD uses GNNs to compute gate-level conditional probabilities, guiding CDCL heuristics like variable phase selection and clause management.

Result: CASCAD reduces solving times by up to 10x and achieves a 23.5% runtime reduction with probability-guided clause filtering.

Conclusion: Preserving circuit-level insights enhances SAT solver efficiency, offering a foundation for future EDA tool improvements.

Abstract: Circuit Satisfiability (CSAT) plays a pivotal role in Electronic Design
Automation. The standard workflow for solving CSAT problems converts circuits
into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) and employs generic SAT solvers powered by
Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL). However, this process inherently
discards rich structural and functional information, leading to suboptimal
solver performance. To address this limitation, we introduce CASCAD, a novel
circuit-aware SAT solving framework that directly leverages circuit-level
conditional probabilities computed via Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). By
explicitly modeling gate-level conditional probabilities, CASCAD dynamically
guides two critical CDCL heuristics -- variable phase selection and clause
managementto significantly enhance solver efficiency. Extensive evaluations on
challenging real-world Logical Equivalence Checking (LEC) benchmarks
demonstrate that CASCAD reduces solving times by up to 10x compared to
state-of-the-art CNF-based approaches, achieving an additional 23.5% runtime
reduction via our probability-guided clause filtering strategy. Our results
underscore the importance of preserving circuit-level structural insights
within SAT solvers, providing a robust foundation for future improvements in
SAT-solving efficiency and EDA tool design.

*Yongyi Wang,Lingfeng Li,Bozhou Chen,Ang Li,Hanyu Liu,Qirui Zheng,Xionghui Yang,Wenxin Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a theoretical and methodological framework for synthesizing POMDPs to rigorously evaluate memory-augmented RL, with empirically validated environments of increasing difficulty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for memory-augmented RL lack controllability over challenge levels, while synthetic environments allow precise manipulation for detailed evaluation.

Method: The study proposes a framework (MDS, transition invariance) and a methodology (linear dynamics, state aggregation, reward redistribution) to create customized POMDPs.

Result: Empirically validated POMDP environments with scalable difficulty were developed, clarifying challenges and guiding memory model selection.

Conclusion: The work advances POMDP analysis and design, offering tools for rigorous evaluation of memory-augmented RL algorithms.

Abstract: Recent research has developed benchmarks for memory-augmented reinforcement
learning (RL) algorithms, providing Partially Observable Markov Decision
Process (POMDP) environments where agents depend on past observations to make
decisions. While many benchmarks incorporate sufficiently complex real-world
problems, they lack controllability over the degree of challenges posed to
memory models. In contrast, synthetic environments enable fine-grained
manipulation of dynamics, making them critical for detailed and rigorous
evaluation of memory-augmented RL. Our study focuses on POMDP synthesis with
three key contributions:
  1. A theoretical framework for analyzing POMDPs, grounded in Memory Demand
Structure (MDS), transition invariance, and related concepts; 2. A methodology
leveraging linear process dynamics, state aggregation, and reward
redistribution to construct customized POMDPs with predefined properties; 3.
Empirically validated series of POMDP environments with increasing difficulty
levels, designed based on our theoretical insights. Our work clarifies the
challenges of memory-augmented RL in solving POMDPs, provides guidelines for
analyzing and designing POMDP environments, and offers empirical support for
selecting memory models in RL tasks.

*Anran Xu,Jincheng Wang,Baigen Cai,Tao Wen*

TL;DR: DRN improves logical reasoning in LLMs by minimizing uncertainty instead of maximizing probability, achieving significant performance gains and zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the failure of LLMs in logical reasoning when semantic heuristics conflict with evidence, termed cognitive traps.

Method: Introduces Deliberative Reasoning Network (DRN), tracking belief states and quantifying uncertainty through iterative evidence synthesis. Validated via discriminative model and lightweight verification module.

Result: 15.2% improvement on LCR-1000, 60% accuracy boost with Mistral-7B, and 23.6% improvement on TruthfulQA without training.

Conclusion: DRN is a foundational, verifiable System 2 reasoning component for trustworthy AI.

Abstract: Large language models often fail at logical reasoning when semantic
heuristics conflict with decisive evidence - a phenomenon we term cognitive
traps. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce the Deliberative
Reasoning Network (DRN), a novel paradigm that reframes logical reasoning from
probability maximization to uncertainty minimization. Instead of asking "Which
answer is most likely?", DRN asks "Which hypothesis has the most internally
consistent evidence?". DRN achieves intrinsic interpretability by explicitly
tracking belief states and quantifying epistemic uncertainty for competing
hypotheses through an iterative evidence synthesis process. We validate our
approach through two complementary architectures - a bespoke discriminative
model that embodies the core uncertainty minimization principle, and a
lightweight verification module that enhances existing generative LLMs.
Evaluated on LCR-1000, our new adversarial reasoning benchmark designed to
expose cognitive traps, the bespoke DRN achieves up to 15.2% improvement over
standard baselines. When integrated as a parameter-efficient verifier with
Mistral-7B, our hybrid system boosts accuracy from 20% to 80% on the most
challenging problems. Critically, DRN demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization, improving TruthfulQA performance by 23.6% without additional
training, indicating that uncertainty-driven deliberation learns transferable
reasoning principles. We position DRN as a foundational, verifiable System 2
reasoning component for building more trustworthy AI systems.

*Fuqing Bie,Shiyu Huang,Xijia Tao,Zhiqin Fang,Leyi Pan,Junzhe Chen,Min Ren,Liuyu Xiang,Zhaofeng He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OmniPlay is a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating multi-modal agentic models, revealing their strengths in memory tasks but weaknesses in reasoning and planning due to brittle fusion mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations for multi-modal models lack dynamic, interactive testing, ignoring auditory and temporal cues, creating a gap in assessing true cross-modal reasoning.

Method: OmniPlay introduces five game environments to test synergy and conflict scenarios, evaluating six leading omni-modal models.

Result: Models excel in memory tasks but fail in reasoning and planning, with performance degrading under modality conflict. Removing sensory inputs sometimes improves results.

Conclusion: Robust AGI requires focus on synergistic fusion, not just scaling. OmniPlay is available for further research.

Abstract: While generalist foundation models like Gemini and GPT-4o demonstrate
impressive multi-modal competence, existing evaluations fail to test their
intelligence in dynamic, interactive worlds. Static benchmarks lack agency,
while interactive benchmarks suffer from a severe modal bottleneck, typically
ignoring crucial auditory and temporal cues. To bridge this evaluation chasm,
we introduce OmniPlay, a diagnostic benchmark designed not just to evaluate,
but to probe the fusion and reasoning capabilities of agentic models across the
full sensory spectrum. Built on a core philosophy of modality interdependence,
OmniPlay comprises a suite of five game environments that systematically create
scenarios of both synergy and conflict, forcing agents to perform genuine
cross-modal reasoning. Our comprehensive evaluation of six leading omni-modal
models reveals a critical dichotomy: they exhibit superhuman performance on
high-fidelity memory tasks but suffer from systemic failures in challenges
requiring robust reasoning and strategic planning. We demonstrate that this
fragility stems from brittle fusion mechanisms, which lead to catastrophic
performance degradation under modality conflict and uncover a counter-intuitive
"less is more" paradox, where removing sensory information can paradoxically
improve performance. Our findings suggest that the path toward robust AGI
requires a research focus beyond scaling to explicitly address synergistic
fusion. Our platform is available for anonymous review at

*Robert Prentner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework (SLP-tests) to empirically assess AI consciousness by evaluating interface representations using category theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of defining and testing artificial consciousness by reframing it into empirically tractable criteria.

Method: Introduces SLP-tests (Subjective-linguistic, Latent-emergent, Phenomenological-structural) to evaluate AI systems' interface representations, modeled using category theory.

Result: Operationalizes subjective experience as a functional interface to relational entities, not as an intrinsic property.

Conclusion: The SLP-tests provide a practical approach to assess AI consciousness, shifting focus from intrinsic properties to functional interfaces.

Abstract: Whether artificial intelligence (AI) systems can possess consciousness is a
contentious question because of the inherent challenges of defining and
operationalizing subjective experience. This paper proposes a framework to
reframe the question of artificial consciousness into empirically tractable
tests. We introduce three evaluative criteria - S (subjective-linguistic), L
(latent-emergent), and P (phenomenological-structural) - collectively termed
SLP-tests, which assess whether an AI system instantiates interface
representations that facilitate consciousness-like properties. Drawing on
category theory, we model interface representations as mappings between
relational substrates (RS) and observable behaviors, akin to specific types of
abstraction layers. The SLP-tests collectively operationalize subjective
experience not as an intrinsic property of physical systems but as a functional
interface to a relational entity.

*Weitai Kang,Bin Lei,Gaowen Liu,Caiwen Ding,Yan Yan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GuirlVG introduces a reinforcement learning-based method for GUI visual grounding, outperforming supervised fine-tuning with fewer samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient alternatives to exhaustive supervised fine-tuning in GUI visual grounding, given advancements in multimodal large language models.

Method: Decomposes reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) components, proposes Adversarial KL Factor for stabilization, and optimizes training configurations.

Result: GuirlVG achieves significant improvements over SFT methods with fewer samples (5.2K vs. 10M), including 7.7% on ScreenSpot and 17.2% on ScreenSpotPro.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning-based methods like GuirlVG offer a more efficient and effective approach for GUI visual grounding compared to traditional SFT.

Abstract: Graphical user interface visual grounding (GUI-VG), a core capability for GUI
agents, has primarily relied on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs), which demands extensive data curation and
significant training costs. However, as MLLMs continue to advance and even
cover GUI domains during pretraining, the necessity of exhaustive SFT
post-training becomes increasingly questionable. Meanwhile, recent successes of
rule-based reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) suggest a more efficient
alternative. Despite this promise, the optimal manner of applying RFT for
GUI-VG remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce GuirlVG, a
reinforcement learning-based GUI-VG method built on a systematic empirical
study and a novel stabilization technique. We find that naive application of
RFT underperforms the SFT baseline, motivating a deeper exploration. First, we
decompose RFT into its core components and analyze the optimal formulation of
each. Second, we propose a novel Adversarial KL Factor that dynamically
stabilizes training to mitigate reward over-optimization. Third, we further
explore the training configurations of RFT to enhance effectiveness. Extensive
experiments show that GuirlVG, with only 5.2K training samples, outperforms SFT
methods trained on over 10M samples, achieving a 7.7% improvement on
ScreenSpot, a 17.2% improvement on ScreenSpotPro, and 91.9% accuracy on
ScreenSpotV2.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: D2Snap, a DOM downsampling algorithm, matches GUI snapshot performance (67% vs 65%) and outperforms it by 8% with higher token input, leveraging DOM hierarchy for LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current web agents rely on GUI snapshots (e.g., screenshots) due to LLMs' limited vision capabilities. DOM snapshots are a viable alternative but face token size constraints.

Method: Proposes D2Snap, a DOM downsampling algorithm, evaluated using GPT-4o on tasks from the Online-Mind2Web dataset.

Result: D2Snap matches GUI snapshot success rates (67% vs 65%) and outperforms by 8% with higher token input. DOM hierarchy proves effective for LLMs.

Conclusion: D2Snap enables efficient DOM snapshot use in web agents, leveraging DOM hierarchy to match or exceed GUI snapshot performance.

Abstract: Frontier LLMs only recently enabled serviceable, autonomous web agents. At
that, a model poses as an instantaneous domain model backend. Ought to suggest
interaction, it is consulted with a web-based task and respective application
state. The key problem lies in application state serialisation
$\unicode{x2013}$ referred to as snapshot. State-of-the-art web agents are
premised on grounded GUI snapshots, i.e., screenshots enhanced with visual
cues. Not least to resemble human perception, but for images representing
relatively cheap means of model input. LLM vision still lag behind code
interpretation capabilities. DOM snapshots, which structurally resemble HTML,
impose a desired alternative. Vast model input token size, however, disables
reliable implementation with web agents to date.
  We propose D2Snap, a first-of-its-kind DOM downsampling algorithm. Based on a
GPT-4o backend, we evaluate D2Snap on tasks sampled from the Online-Mind2Web
dataset. The success rate of D2Snap-downsampled DOM snapshots (67%) matches a
grounded GUI snapshot baseline (65%) $\unicode{x2013}$ within the same input
token order of magnitude (1e3). Our best evaluated configurations
$\unicode{x2013}$ one token order above, but within the model's context window
$\unicode{x2013}$ outperform this baseline by 8%. Our evaluation, moreover,
yields that DOM-inherent hierarchy embodies a strong UI feature for LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SimInstruct is a tool for collecting scaffolding dialogues by simulating novice instructors with LLMs and involving human experts, producing pedagogically rich data without real novices. It shows persona traits affect expert engagement and outperforms GPT-4o in instructional quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality instructional dialogues are scarce due to privacy and vulnerability concerns, limiting AI development for teaching and learning.

Method: SimInstruct uses LLMs to simulate novice instructors with varied challenges and personas, while human experts provide feedback and support, creating realistic dialogues.

Result: Dialogues are pedagogically relevant and cognitively deep, with persona traits influencing expert engagement. A fine-tuned LLaMA model outperformed GPT-4o in instructional quality.

Conclusion: SimInstruct effectively generates scaffolding dialogues, highlighting GPT-4o's limitations and offering a scalable solution for instructional AI development.

Abstract: High-quality, multi-turn instructional dialogues between novices and experts
are essential for developing AI systems that support teaching, learning, and
decision-making. These dialogues often involve scaffolding -- the process by
which an expert supports a novice's thinking through questions, feedback, and
step-by-step guidance. However, such data are scarce due to privacy concerns in
recording and the vulnerability inherent in help-seeking. We present
SimInstruct, a scalable, expert-in-the-loop tool for collecting scaffolding
dialogues. Using teaching development coaching as an example domain,
SimInstruct simulates novice instructors via LLMs, varying their teaching
challenges and LLM's persona traits, while human experts provide multi-turn
feedback, reasoning, and instructional support. This design enables the
creation of realistic, pedagogically rich dialogues without requiring real
novice participants. Our results reveal that persona traits, such as
extroversion and introversion, meaningfully influence how experts engage.
Compared to real mentoring recordings, SimInstruct dialogues demonstrate
comparable pedagogical relevance and cognitive depth. Experts also reported the
process as engaging and reflective, improving both data quality and their own
professional insight. We further fine-tuned a LLaMA model to be an expert model
using the augmented dataset, which outperformed GPT-4o in instructional
quality. Our analysis highlights GPT-4o's limitations in weak reflective
questioning, overuse of generic praise, a condescending tone, and a tendency to
overwhelm novices with excessive suggestions.

*Rui Ha,Chaozhuo Li,Rui Pu,Sen Su*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MERA, a framework to regulate reasoning in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) by separating reasoning and control, improving efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs exhibit unregulated reasoning behaviors like overthinking, leading to computational inefficiency. The lack of intrinsic control mechanisms limits their practical use.

Method: MERA decouples reasoning and control, uses auxiliary LLMs for control signals, and employs CSPO for optimized control learning.

Result: Experiments show MERA improves reasoning efficiency and accuracy in benchmarks.

Conclusion: MERA effectively addresses unregulated reasoning in LRMs, enhancing their practical deployment.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated a latent capacity for complex
reasoning by spontaneously exhibiting cognitive behaviors such as step-by-step
reasoning, reflection, and backtracking, commonly referred to as "Aha Moments".
However, such emergent behaviors remain unregulated and uncontrolled, often
resulting in overthinking, where the model continues generating redundant
reasoning content even after reaching reliable conclusions. This leads to
excessive computational costs and increased latency, limiting the practical
deployment of LRMs. The root cause lies in the absence of intrinsic regulatory
mechanisms, as current models are unable to monitor and adaptively manage their
reasoning process to determine when to continue, backtrack, or terminate. To
address this issue, we propose the Meta-cognitive Reasoning Framework (MERA),
which explicitly decouples the thinking process into distinct reasoning and
control components, thereby enabling the independent optimization of control
strategies. Specifically, MERA incorporates a takeover-based data construction
mechanism that identifies critical decision points during reasoning and
delegates the creation of control signals to auxiliary LLMs, thereby enabling
the construction of high-quality reasoning-control data. Additionally, a
structured reasoning-control separation is implemented via supervised
fine-tuning, enabling the model to generate explicit traces and acquire initial
meta-cognitive control capabilities. Finally, MERA employs Control-Segment
Policy Optimization (CSPO), which combines segment-wise Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) with a control-masking mechanism to optimize control
behavior learning while minimizing interference from irrelevant content.
Experiments on various reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that models trained
with MERA enhance both reasoning efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: The survey aims to guide academic and industrial progress in OS Agents, supported by an open-source GitHub repository.

Abstract: The dream to create AI assistants as capable and versatile as the fictional
J.A.R.V.I.S from Iron Man has long captivated imaginations. With the evolution
of (multi-modal) large language models ((M)LLMs), this dream is closer to
reality, as (M)LLM-based Agents using computing devices (e.g., computers and
mobile phones) by operating within the environments and interfaces (e.g.,
Graphical User Interface (GUI)) provided by operating systems (OS) to automate
tasks have significantly advanced. This paper presents a comprehensive survey
of these advanced agents, designated as OS Agents. We begin by elucidating the
fundamentals of OS Agents, exploring their key components including the
environment, observation space, and action space, and outlining essential
capabilities such as understanding, planning, and grounding. We then examine
methodologies for constructing OS Agents, focusing on domain-specific
foundation models and agent frameworks. A detailed review of evaluation
protocols and benchmarks highlights how OS Agents are assessed across diverse
tasks. Finally, we discuss current challenges and identify promising directions
for future research, including safety and privacy, personalization and
self-evolution. This survey aims to consolidate the state of OS Agents
research, providing insights to guide both academic inquiry and industrial

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel interpretable and explainable method for detecting bias in AI systems, leveraging debates about bias based on protected features and neighborhood data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing biases in AI systems is crucial to prevent unfair disadvantages, but existing fairness methods often lack transparency. Interpretability and explainability are vital for fairness due to its human-oriented nature.

Method: The proposed method uses formal and computational argumentation to debate bias within and across neighborhoods, based on protected features.

Result: The method is evaluated formally, quantitatively, and qualitatively, showing strong performance against baselines and high interpretability and explainability.

Conclusion: The method effectively combines interpretability and explainability with bias detection, addressing a critical gap in algorithmic fairness.

Abstract: As the use of AI systems in society grows, addressing potential biases that
emerge from data or are learned by models is essential to prevent systematic
disadvantages against specific groups. Several notions of (un)fairness have
been proposed in the literature, alongside corresponding algorithmic methods
for detecting and mitigating unfairness, but, with very few exceptions, these
tend to ignore transparency. Instead, interpretability and explainability are
core requirements for algorithmic fairness, even more so than for other
algorithmic solutions, given the human-oriented nature of fairness. In this
paper, we contribute a novel interpretable, explainable method for bias
detection relying on debates about the presence of bias against individuals,
based on the values of protected features for the individuals and others in
their neighbourhoods. Our method builds upon techniques from formal and
computational argumentation, whereby debates result from arguing about biases
within and across neighbourhoods. We provide formal, quantitative, and
qualitative evaluations of our method, highlighting its strengths in
performance against baselines, as well as its interpretability and
explainability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SID, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' higher-order guidance in interdisciplinary Socratic dialogues, revealing their current limitations in fostering knowledge integration and transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of scalable expert guidance in interdisciplinary STEM education and the unclear capabilities of LLMs in guided instruction.

Method: Developed SID, a benchmark with 10,000 dialogue turns across 48 STEM projects, a novel annotation schema, and metrics like X-SRG.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs struggle with effective guided dialogues for knowledge integration and transfer.

Conclusion: SID is valuable for advancing pedagogically-aware LLMs.

Abstract: Fostering students' abilities for knowledge integration and transfer in
complex problem-solving scenarios is a core objective of modern education, and
interdisciplinary STEM is a key pathway to achieve this, yet it requires expert
guidance that is difficult to scale. While LLMs offer potential in this regard,
their true capability for guided instruction remains unclear due to the lack of
an effective evaluation benchmark. To address this, we introduce SID, the first
benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the higher-order guidance
capabilities of LLMs in multi-turn, interdisciplinary Socratic dialogues. Our
contributions include a large-scale dataset of 10,000 dialogue turns across 48
complex STEM projects, a novel annotation schema for capturing deep pedagogical
features, and a new suite of evaluation metrics (e.g., X-SRG). Baseline
experiments confirm that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to execute
effective guided dialogues that lead students to achieve knowledge integration
and transfer. This highlights the critical value of our benchmark in driving
the development of more pedagogically-aware LLMs.

*Yue Zhou,Yi Chang,Yuan Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ConfProBench is introduced to evaluate the reliability of step-level confidence scores in MLLM-based process judges (MPJs), addressing gaps in existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks overlook the reliability of MPJs' confidence scores, which is critical for improving reasoning capabilities in multimodal tasks.

Method: The benchmark uses adversarially perturbed reasoning steps (Synonym Substitution, Syntactic Transformation, Image Perturbation) and introduces three metrics (CRS, CSS, CCS) to evaluate robustness, sensitivity, and calibration.

Result: Experiments on 14 MLLMs reveal limitations in current MPJs' confidence performance, providing baselines for future research.

Conclusion: ConfProBench fills a critical gap in evaluating MPJs and highlights areas for improvement in confidence reliability.

Abstract: Reasoning is a critical capability of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) for solving complex multimodal tasks, and judging the correctness of
reasoning steps is crucial for improving this capability. Recently, MLLM-based
process judges (MPJs) have been widely used to assess the correctness of
reasoning steps in multimodal tasks. Therefore, evaluating MPJs is important
for identifying their limitations and guiding future improvements. However,
existing benchmarks for MPJs mainly focus on tasks such as step correctness
classification and reasoning process search, while overlooking a key aspect:
whether the confidence scores produced by MPJs at the step level are reliable.
To address this gap, we propose ConfProBench, the first comprehensive benchmark
designed to systematically evaluate the reliability of step-level confidence
scores generated by MPJs. Our benchmark constructs three types of adversarially
perturbed reasoning steps: Synonym Substitution, Syntactic Transformation, and
Image Perturbation, to test the robustness of MPJ confidence under
perturbations. In addition, we introduce three novel evaluation metrics:
Confidence Robustness Score (CRS), Confidence Sensitivity Score (CSS), and
Confidence Calibration Score (CCS), which evaluate robustness, sensitivity, and
calibration, respectively. We evaluate 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including
both proprietary and open-source models. Experiments reveal limitations in
current MPJs' confidence performance and offer competitive baselines to support
future research.

*Shuo Liu,Zeyu Liang,Xueguang Lyu,Christopher Amato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MAGRPO, a multi-agent RL method for optimizing LLM collaboration, addressing the lack of coordination in existing frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM fine-tuning frameworks focus on individual rewards, lacking mechanisms for effective multi-agent coordination.

Method: Proposes MAGRPO, a multi-agent, multi-turn algorithm combining RL for LLMs and MARL techniques.

Result: Experiments show MAGRPO enables efficient, high-quality collaboration in LLM tasks like writing and coding.

Conclusion: MAGRPO opens avenues for applying MARL methods to LLMs, though challenges remain.

Abstract: A large amount of work has been done in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) for
modeling and solving problems with multiple interacting agents. However, most
LLMs are pretrained independently and not specifically optimized for
coordination. Existing LLM fine-tuning frameworks rely on individual rewards,
which require complex reward designs for each agent to encourage collaboration.
To address these challenges, we model LLM collaboration as a cooperative
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem. We develop a multi-agent,
multi-turn algorithm, Multi-Agent Group Relative Policy Optimization (MAGRPO),
to solve it, building on current RL approaches for LLMs as well as MARL
techniques. Our experiments on LLM writing and coding collaboration demonstrate
that fine-tuning MAS with MAGRPO enables agents to generate high-quality
responses efficiently through effective cooperation. Our approach opens the
door to using other MARL methods for LLMs and highlights the associated
challenges.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SEAgent is a self-evolving framework for computer-use agents (CUAs) that autonomously learns novel software through experiential learning, outperforming existing methods by 23.2%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLMs struggle with novel and specialized software due to reliance on human-labeled data, necessitating autonomous learning solutions.

Method: SEAgent uses a World State Model for trajectory assessment, a Curriculum Generator for task progression, and updates policies via adversarial imitation and GRPO. A specialist-to-generalist strategy integrates insights for continuous evolution.

Result: SEAgent improves success rates from 11.3% to 34.5% in novel software environments, surpassing UI-TARS.

Conclusion: SEAgent enables CUAs to autonomously evolve and master new software, demonstrating significant performance gains over existing methods.

Abstract: Repurposing large vision-language models (LVLMs) as computer use agents
(CUAs) has led to substantial breakthroughs, primarily driven by human-labeled
data. However, these models often struggle with novel and specialized software,
particularly in scenarios lacking human annotations. To address this challenge,
we propose SEAgent, an agentic self-evolving framework enabling CUAs to
autonomously evolve through interactions with unfamiliar software.
Specifically, SEAgent empowers computer-use agents to autonomously master novel
software environments via experiential learning, where agents explore new
software, learn through iterative trial-and-error, and progressively tackle
auto-generated tasks organized from simple to complex. To achieve this goal, we
design a World State Model for step-wise trajectory assessment, along with a
Curriculum Generator that generates increasingly diverse and challenging tasks.
The agent's policy is updated through experiential learning, comprised of
adversarial imitation of failure actions and Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) on successful ones. Furthermore, we introduce a specialist-to-generalist
training strategy that integrates individual experiential insights from
specialist agents, facilitating the development of a stronger generalist CUA
capable of continuous autonomous evolution. This unified agent ultimately
achieves performance surpassing ensembles of individual specialist agents on
their specialized software. We validate the effectiveness of SEAgent across
five novel software environments within OS-World. Our approach achieves a
significant improvement of 23.2% in success rate, from 11.3% to 34.5%, over a
competitive open-source CUA, i.e., UI-TARS.

*Agrima Seth,Monojit Choudhary,Sunayana Sitaram,Kentaro Toyama,Aditya Vashistha,Kalika Bali*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper audits GPT-4 Turbo for representational bias in India, revealing overrepresentation of dominant groups in religion and caste despite diversity prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and quantify representational bias in LLMs beyond typical Global North-centric identities, focusing on religion and caste in India.

Method: Generated 7,200 stories about life events in India using GPT-4 Turbo, comparing output diversity to census data.

Result: GPT-4 overrepresents dominant groups, showing bias persists despite prompts. Repeated nudges have limited effect.

Conclusion: Diversifying training data may not suffice; fundamental changes in model development are needed to address bias.

Abstract: Representational bias in large language models (LLMs) has predominantly been
measured through single-response interactions and has focused on Global
North-centric identities like race and gender. We expand on that research by
conducting a systematic audit of GPT-4 Turbo to reveal how deeply encoded
representational biases are and how they extend to less-explored dimensions of
identity. We prompt GPT-4 Turbo to generate over 7,200 stories about
significant life events (such as weddings) in India, using prompts designed to
encourage diversity to varying extents. Comparing the diversity of religious
and caste representation in the outputs against the actual population
distribution in India as recorded in census data, we quantify the presence and
"stickiness" of representational bias in the LLM for religion and caste. We
find that GPT-4 responses consistently overrepresent culturally dominant groups
far beyond their statistical representation, despite prompts intended to
encourage representational diversity. Our findings also suggest that
representational bias in LLMs has a winner-take-all quality that is more biased
than the likely distribution bias in their training data, and repeated
prompt-based nudges have limited and inconsistent efficacy in dislodging these
biases. These results suggest that diversifying training data alone may not be
sufficient to correct LLM bias, highlighting the need for more fundamental
changes in model development. Dataset and Codebook:

Motivation: To develop specialized language models for High-Energy Theoretical Physics by fine-tuning on arXiv abstracts from specific fields.

Method: Fine-tuned 20 variants of Llama-3.1 on arXiv abstracts (hep-th, hep-ph, gr-qc) using Low-Rank Adaptation approaches and varying dataset sizes. Compared with commercial LLMs.

Result: Fine-tuned models outperformed the base model and commercial LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek) in hep-th abstract completion tasks.

Conclusion: Specialized fine-tuning improves performance for High-Energy Physics tasks, providing insights for future development of domain-specific LLMs.

Abstract: We present specialized Large Language Models for theoretical High-Energy
Physics, obtained as 20 fine-tuned variants of the 8-billion parameter
Llama-3.1 model. Each variant was trained on arXiv abstracts (through August
2024) from different combinations of hep-th, hep-ph and gr-qc. For a
comparative study, we also trained models on datasets that contained abstracts
from disparate fields such as the q-bio and cs categories. All models were
fine-tuned using two distinct Low-Rank Adaptation fine-tuning approaches and
varying dataset sizes, and outperformed the base model on hep-th abstract
completion tasks. We compare performance against leading commercial LLMs
(ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek) and derive insights for further developing
specialized language models for High-Energy Theoretical Physics.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Krishi Sathi, an AI-powered chatbot for Indian farmers, combining intent-driven dialogue, instruction-tuned models, and retrieval-based generation to provide accessible, personalized agricultural advice in English and Hindi.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Indian farmers face challenges in accessing timely, language-friendly agricultural advice, especially in rural areas with low literacy. The paper aims to bridge this gap with a tailored AI solution.

Method: The chatbot uses an IFT model fine-tuned on Indian agricultural datasets, employs multi-turn conversations to understand queries, and leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for responses. It supports text and speech in English and Hindi.

Result: The system achieved 97.53% query response accuracy, 91.35% contextual relevance, and a 97.53% query completion rate, with responses under 6 seconds.

Conclusion: Combining intent-driven dialogue, instruction-tuned models, and RAG improves digital agricultural support accessibility and quality in India.

Abstract: Indian farmers often lack timely, accessible, and language-friendly
agricultural advice, especially in rural areas with low literacy. To address
this gap in accessibility, this paper presents a novel AI-powered agricultural
chatbot, Krishi Sathi, designed to support Indian farmers by providing
personalized, easy-to-understand answers to their queries through both text and
speech. The system's intelligence stems from an IFT model, subsequently refined
through fine-tuning on Indian agricultural knowledge across three curated
datasets. Unlike traditional chatbots that respond to one-off questions, Krishi
Sathi follows a structured, multi-turn conversation flow to gradually collect
the necessary details from the farmer, ensuring the query is fully understood
before generating a response. Once the intent and context are extracted, the
system performs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by first fetching
information from a curated agricultural database and then generating a tailored
response using the IFT model. The chatbot supports both English and Hindi
languages, with speech input and output features (via ASR and TTS) to make it
accessible for users with low literacy or limited digital skills. This work
demonstrates how combining intent-driven dialogue flows, instruction-tuned
models, and retrieval-based generation can improve the quality and
accessibility of digital agricultural support in India.
  This approach yielded strong results, with the system achieving a query
response accuracy of 97.53%, 91.35% contextual relevance and personalization,
and a query completion rate of 97.53%. The average response time remained under
6 seconds, ensuring timely support for users across both English and Hindi
interactions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Hierarchical Verification Tree (HVT), a framework to improve LLM inference efficiency by prioritizing high-likelihood drafts and pruning suboptimal candidates early, reducing computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face inefficiency in inference due to autoregressive nature. Existing methods like speculative decoding and beam sampling lack prioritization, leading to unnecessary computations.

Method: Proposes HVT, a hierarchical framework for speculative beam decoding, with a verification-pruning algorithm to ensure correctness and efficiency. Integrates with standard LLM pipelines without retraining.

Result: HVT outperforms existing methods, reducing inference time and energy consumption while maintaining or improving output quality across multiple datasets and models.

Conclusion: HVT demonstrates the potential of hierarchical verification strategies for accelerating LLM inference, offering a new direction for efficiency improvements.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
natural language processing tasks but face persistent challenges in inference
efficiency due to their autoregressive nature. While speculative decoding and
beam sampling offer notable improvements, traditional methods verify draft
sequences sequentially without prioritization, leading to unnecessary
computational overhead. This work proposes the Hierarchical Verification Tree
(HVT), a novel framework that restructures speculative beam decoding by
prioritizing high-likelihood drafts and enabling early pruning of suboptimal
candidates. Theoretical foundations and a formal verification-pruning algorithm
are developed to ensure correctness and efficiency. Integration with standard
LLM inference pipelines is achieved without requiring retraining or
architecture modification. Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets
and models demonstrate that HVT consistently outperforms existing speculative
decoding schemes, achieving substantial reductions in inference time and energy
consumption while maintaining or enhancing output quality. The findings
highlight the potential of hierarchical verification strategies as a new
direction for accelerating large language model inference.

TL;DR: WiNELL is an LLM-based multi-agent framework for continuously updating Wikipedia by suggesting precise edits, outperforming baselines like GPT-4o in coverage and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wikipedia's reliance on manual updates is inefficient; WiNELL aims to automate knowledge acquisition and editing.

Method: Uses a multi-agent framework to aggregate online info, select important knowledge, and generate edit suggestions trained on Wikipedia's edit history.

Result: Outperforms open-source and closed-source LLMs in coverage and efficiency, demonstrating timely factual updates.

Conclusion: WiNELL shows promise for automating knowledge base updates, advancing LLM agent research.

Abstract: Wikipedia, a vast and continuously consulted knowledge base, faces
significant challenges in maintaining up-to-date content due to its reliance on
manual human editors. Inspired by the vision of continuous knowledge
acquisition in NELL and fueled by advances in LLM-based agents, this paper
introduces WiNELL, an agentic framework for continuously updating Wikipedia
articles. Our approach employs a multi-agent framework to aggregate online
information, select new and important knowledge for a target entity in
Wikipedia, and then generate precise edit suggestions for human review. Our
fine-grained editing models, trained on Wikipedia's extensive history of human
edits, enable incorporating updates in a manner consistent with human editing
behavior. Our editor models outperform both open-source instruction-following
baselines and closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) in key information coverage and
editing efficiency. End-to-end evaluation on high-activity Wikipedia pages
demonstrates WiNELL's ability to identify and suggest timely factual updates.
This opens up a promising research direction in LLM agents for automatically
updating knowledge bases in a never-ending fashion.

TL;DR: GanitBench is a multilingual (English and Hindi) benchmark for evaluating VLMs on math questions, showing GPT-4o mini's dominance and the effectiveness of two-shot CoT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of multilingual (especially Hindi) and domain-specific benchmarks for VLMs, focusing on math.

Method: Created GanitBench with 1527 math questions from Indian exams, evaluated VLMs in zero-shot and two-shot CoT settings, and introduced a 'Double Lock' constraint.

Result: GPT-4o mini performed best (38.15% accuracy), two-shot CoT was more effective, and performance dropped in Hindi.

Conclusion: GanitBench aids multilingual VLM research, highlighting challenges in non-English contexts and the need for better benchmarks.

Abstract: Benchmarks for evaluating reasoning among Vision Language Models (VLMs) on
several fields and domains are being curated more frequently over the last few
years. However these are often monolingual, mostly available in English.
Additionally there also is a lack of datasets available in Hindi on tasks apart
from comprehension and translation. We introduce GanitBench, a tough benchmark
consisting of 1527 vision-only questions covering several topics in Mathematics
- available in languages English and Hindi. Collected from two major
examinations from India, the JEE Advanced and the CBSE Boards examinations,
this benchmark includes questions in the form of images comprising of figures
essential to a question as well as text. We evaluate two closed source models
for the same, in zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and two-shot CoT settings.
GPT-4o mini is found to be the more dominant model on the benchmark, with it's
highest average accuracy being 38.15%. We also evaluate models through a
"Double Lock" constraint, which brings down the performance of the models by
considerable margins. We observe that two-shot CoT appears to be a more
effective setting under this environment. Performance of the two VLMs also
decreases when answering the same questions in the Hindi language. We hope to
facilitate the inclusion of languages like Hindi in research through our work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AttnTrace is a new method for tracing back influential context in LLM responses using attention weights, offering higher accuracy and efficiency than existing methods like TracLLM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational cost and inefficiency of current context traceback methods in LLMs, which are crucial for interpretability and trustworthiness.

Method: AttnTrace leverages attention weights from LLMs, enhanced by two novel techniques, and provides theoretical justification for its design.

Result: AttnTrace outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and efficiency and improves prompt injection detection in long contexts.

Conclusion: AttnTrace is a practical and effective solution for context traceback, with demonstrated real-world applications like detecting injected instructions.

Abstract: Long-context large language models (LLMs), such as Gemini-2.5-Pro and
Claude-Sonnet-4, are increasingly used to empower advanced AI systems,
including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and autonomous agents.
In these systems, an LLM receives an instruction along with a context--often
consisting of texts retrieved from a knowledge database or memory--and
generates a response that is contextually grounded by following the
instruction. Recent studies have designed solutions to trace back to a subset
of texts in the context that contributes most to the response generated by the
LLM. These solutions have numerous real-world applications, including
performing post-attack forensic analysis and improving the interpretability and
trustworthiness of LLM outputs. While significant efforts have been made,
state-of-the-art solutions such as TracLLM often lead to a high computation
cost, e.g., it takes TracLLM hundreds of seconds to perform traceback for a
single response-context pair. In this work, we propose AttnTrace, a new context
traceback method based on the attention weights produced by an LLM for a
prompt. To effectively utilize attention weights, we introduce two techniques
designed to enhance the effectiveness of AttnTrace, and we provide theoretical
insights for our design choice. We also perform a systematic evaluation for
AttnTrace. The results demonstrate that AttnTrace is more accurate and
efficient than existing state-of-the-art context traceback methods. We also
show that AttnTrace can improve state-of-the-art methods in detecting prompt
injection under long contexts through the attribution-before-detection
paradigm. As a real-world application, we demonstrate that AttnTrace can
effectively pinpoint injected instructions in a paper designed to manipulate
LLM-generated reviews. The code is at

*Jiahao Xu,Rui Hu,Zikai Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MajorMark and MajorMark$^+$ are novel watermarking methods for LLMs that improve the trade-off between text quality and decoding accuracy by using majority bit-aware encoding and clustering-based decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about LLM misuse by embedding identifiable binary messages for origin verification and misuse tracing, while overcoming the trade-off between text quality and decoding accuracy in existing methods.

Method: MajorMark uses majority bit-aware encoding for flexible token selection and clustering-based decoding. MajorMark$^+$ partitions messages into blocks for independent encoding and deterministic decoding.

Result: Outperforms prior multi-bit watermarking baselines in decoding accuracy and text generation quality.

Conclusion: MajorMark and MajorMark$^+$ offer effective solutions for watermarking LLM-generated content, balancing quality and accuracy.

Abstract: The growing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world
applications has raised concerns about their potential misuse in generating
harmful or deceptive content. To address this issue, watermarking techniques
have emerged as a promising solution by embedding identifiable binary messages
into generated text for origin verification and misuse tracing. While recent
efforts have explored multi-bit watermarking schemes capable of embedding rich
information such as user identifiers, they typically suffer from the
fundamental trade-off between text quality and decoding accuracy: to ensure
reliable message decoding, they have to restrict the size of preferred token
sets during encoding, yet such restrictions reduce the quality of the generated
content. In this work, we propose MajorMark, a novel watermarking method that
improves this trade-off through majority bit-aware encoding. MajorMark selects
preferred token sets based on the majority bit of the message, enabling a
larger and more flexible sampling of tokens. In contrast to prior methods that
rely on token frequency analysis for decoding, MajorMark employs a
clustering-based decoding strategy, which maintains high decoding accuracy even
when the preferred token set is large, thus preserving both content quality and
decoding accuracy. We further introduce MajorMark$^+$, which partitions the
message into multiple blocks to independently encode and deterministically
decode each block, thereby further enhancing the quality of watermarked text
and improving decoding accuracy. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs
demonstrate that our methods significantly enhance both decoding accuracy and
text generation quality, outperforming prior multi-bit watermarking baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate misinformation due to training on inaccurate data, necessitating robust fact-checking frameworks.

Method: Systematic analysis of literature (2020-2025) focusing on evaluation methods, mitigation techniques, and frameworks like RAG, instruction tuning, and multi-agent reasoning.

Result: Current metrics are limited; grounding outputs with external evidence and domain-specific customization improve factual consistency.

Conclusion: Building accurate, explainable, and domain-specific LLMs is crucial for trustworthy, context-aware language models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on vast and diverse internet corpora
that often include inaccurate or misleading content. Consequently, LLMs can
generate misinformation, making robust fact-checking essential. This review
systematically analyzes how LLM-generated content is evaluated for factual
accuracy by exploring key challenges such as hallucinations, dataset
limitations, and the reliability of evaluation metrics. The review emphasizes
the need for strong fact-checking frameworks that integrate advanced prompting
strategies, domain-specific fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) methods. It proposes five research questions that guide the analysis of
the recent literature from 2020 to 2025, focusing on evaluation methods and
mitigation techniques. The review also discusses the role of instruction
tuning, multi-agent reasoning, and external knowledge access via RAG
frameworks. Key findings highlight the limitations of current metrics, the
value of grounding outputs with validated external evidence, and the importance
of domain-specific customization to improve factual consistency. Overall, the
review underlines the importance of building LLMs that are not only accurate
and explainable but also tailored for domain-specific fact-checking. These
insights contribute to the advancement of research toward more trustworthy and
context-aware language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EL methods struggle with short, ambiguous questions in QA tasks, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: Proposes an agent using a Large Language Model to actively identify mentions, retrieve candidates, and make decisions.

Result: Experiments show the agent's robustness and effectiveness in tool-based EL and QA tasks.

Conclusion: The agent improves EL for QA, addressing the limitations of traditional methods in short-context scenarios.

Abstract: Some Question Answering (QA) systems rely on knowledge bases (KBs) to provide
accurate answers. Entity Linking (EL) plays a critical role in linking natural
language mentions to KB entries. However, most existing EL methods are designed
for long contexts and do not perform well on short, ambiguous user questions in
QA tasks. We propose an entity linking agent for QA, based on a Large Language
Model that simulates human cognitive workflows. The agent actively identifies
entity mentions, retrieves candidate entities, and makes decision. To verify
the effectiveness of our agent, we conduct two experiments: tool-based entity
linking and QA task evaluation. The results confirm the robustness and
effectiveness of our agent.

TL;DR: Sotopia-RL refines episode-level feedback into utterance-level, multi-dimensional rewards to improve RL training for socially intelligent LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social intelligence in LLMs requires effective training methods, but RL faces challenges due to partial observability and multi-dimensionality in social interactions.

Method: Proposes Sotopia-RL, a framework using utterance-level credit assignment and multi-dimensional rewards to address RL inefficiencies.

Result: Achieves top scores (7.17 on Sotopia-hard, 8.31 on Sotopia-full), outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: Sotopia-RL's design is essential for effective RL training in social tasks, validated by ablation studies.

Abstract: Social intelligence has become a critical capability for large language
models (LLMs), enabling them to engage effectively in real-world social tasks
such as accommodation, persuasion, collaboration, and negotiation.
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a natural fit for training socially intelligent
agents because it allows models to learn sophisticated strategies directly
through social interactions. However, social interactions have two key
characteristics that set barriers for RL training: (1) partial observability,
where utterances have indirect and delayed effects that complicate credit
assignment, and (2) multi-dimensionality, where behaviors such as
rapport-building or knowledge-seeking contribute indirectly to goal
achievement. These characteristics make Markov decision process (MDP)-based RL
with single-dimensional episode-level rewards inefficient and unstable. To
address these challenges, we propose Sotopia-RL, a novel framework that refines
coarse episode-level feedback into utterance-level, multi-dimensional rewards.
Utterance-level credit assignment mitigates partial observability by
attributing outcomes to individual utterances, while multi-dimensional rewards
capture the full richness of social interactions and reduce reward hacking.
Experiments in Sotopia, an open-ended social learning environment, demonstrate
that Sotopia-RL achieves state-of-the-art social goal completion scores (7.17
on Sotopia-hard and 8.31 on Sotopia-full), significantly outperforming existing
approaches. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of both utterance-level
credit assignment and multi-dimensional reward design for RL training. Our
implementation is publicly available at:

TL;DR: CoAct-1 introduces a hybrid multi-agent system combining GUI control with programmatic execution (Python/Bash scripts) to enhance efficiency and reliability in computer automation, achieving state-of-the-art results on OSWorld.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GUI-based autonomous agents are inefficient and brittle for complex tasks due to reliance on GUI manipulation alone.

Method: CoAct-1 uses an Orchestrator to delegate tasks between a GUI Operator and a Programmer agent, enabling direct script execution for efficiency.

Result: Achieves 60.76% success rate on OSWorld, reducing average steps per task to 10.15 (vs. 15 for GUI-only agents).

Conclusion: Integrating coding as an action enhances automation power, efficiency, and scalability.

Abstract: Autonomous agents that operate computers via Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)
often struggle with efficiency and reliability on complex, long-horizon tasks.
While augmenting these agents with planners can improve task decomposition,
they remain constrained by the inherent limitations of performing all actions
through GUI manipulation, leading to brittleness and inefficiency. In this
work, we introduce a more robust and flexible paradigm: enabling agents to use
coding as a enhanced action. We present CoAct-1, a novel multi-agent system
that synergistically combines GUI-based control with direct programmatic
execution. CoAct-1 features an Orchestrator that dynamically delegates subtasks
to either a conventional GUI Operator or a specialized Programmer agent, which
can write and execute Python or Bash scripts. This hybrid approach allows the
agent to bypass inefficient GUI action sequences for tasks like file management
and data processing, while still leveraging visual interaction when necessary.
We evaluate our system on the challenging OSWorld benchmark, where CoAct-1
achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 60.76%, significantly
outperforming prior methods. Furthermore, our approach dramatically improves
efficiency, reducing the average number of steps required to complete a task to
just 10.15, compared to 15 for leading GUI agents. Our results demonstrate that
integrating coding as a core action provides a more powerful, efficient, and
scalable path toward generalized computer automation.

TL;DR: CAP-LLM is a novel framework for personalized news headline generation, integrating user preferences and factual consistency into a pre-trained LLM. It outperforms baselines in factual accuracy and personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of capturing user interests and ensuring factual consistency in news headline generation, which existing methods often fail to balance.

Method: Proposes CAP-LLM, featuring a User Preference Encoder, Context Injection Adapter, and Fact-Consistency Reinforcement Module with contrastive loss.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PENS dataset, improving factual consistency (FactCC 87.50) and personalization (Pc(avg) 2.73, Pc(max) 17.25).

Conclusion: CAP-LLM effectively balances personalization and factual accuracy, validated by ablation studies and human evaluations.

Abstract: In the era of information overload, personalized news headline generation is
crucial for engaging users by tailoring content to their preferences while
accurately conveying news facts. Existing methods struggle with effectively
capturing complex user interests and ensuring factual consistency, often
leading to generic or misleading headlines. Leveraging the unprecedented
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in text generation, we propose
Context-Augmented Personalized LLM (CAP-LLM), a novel framework that integrates
user preferences and factual consistency constraints into a powerful
pre-trained LLM backbone. CAP-LLM features a User Preference Encoder to capture
long-term user interests, a Context Injection Adapter to seamlessly integrate
these preferences and current article context into the LLM's generation
process, and a Fact-Consistency Reinforcement Module employing a novel
contrastive loss to mitigate hallucination. Evaluated on the real-world PENS
dataset, CAP-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across all metrics.
Notably, it significantly improves factual consistency (FactCC of 87.50) over
strong baselines like BART (86.67), while simultaneously enhancing
personalization (Pc(avg) 2.73, Pc(max) 17.25) and content coverage (ROUGE-1
26.55, ROUGE-2 9.95, ROUGE-L 23.01). Our ablation studies, human evaluations,
and sensitivity analyses further validate the effectiveness of each component
and the robustness of our approach, demonstrating CAP-LLM's ability to achieve
a superior balance between personalization and factual accuracy in news
headline generation.

*Alok Abhishek,Lisa Erickson,Tushar Bandopadhyay*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a systematic approach to govern and quantify bias in machine learning models, focusing on LLMs, using the BEATS framework and a data/AI governance strategy to ensure fairness, ethics, and factuality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address prevalent bias and fairness gaps in LLMs to enhance safety and responsibility in AI systems, mitigating risks of discrimination and reputational harm.

Method: Utilizes the Bias Evaluation and Assessment Test Suite (BEATS) and a data/AI governance framework for benchmarking, continuous evaluation, and proactive governance of LLMs.

Result: Enables rigorous benchmarking, real-time evaluation, and risk mitigation, enhancing the ethical alignment of generative AI applications.

Conclusion: The approach advances socially responsible AI deployment, ensuring fairness and ethics throughout the AI lifecycle.

Abstract: In this paper, we cover approaches to systematically govern, assess and
quantify bias across the complete life cycle of machine learning models, from
initial development and validation to ongoing production monitoring and
guardrail implementation. Building upon our foundational work on the Bias
Evaluation and Assessment Test Suite (BEATS) for Large Language Models, the
authors share prevalent bias and fairness related gaps in Large Language Models
(LLMs) and discuss data and AI governance framework to address Bias, Ethics,
Fairness, and Factuality within LLMs. The data and AI governance approach
discussed in this paper is suitable for practical, real-world applications,
enabling rigorous benchmarking of LLMs prior to production deployment,
facilitating continuous real-time evaluation, and proactively governing LLM
generated responses. By implementing the data and AI governance across the life
cycle of AI development, organizations can significantly enhance the safety and
responsibility of their GenAI systems, effectively mitigating risks of
discrimination and protecting against potential reputational or brand-related
harm. Ultimately, through this article, we aim to contribute to advancement of
the creation and deployment of socially responsible and ethically aligned
generative artificial intelligence powered applications.

*Md Arafat Sultan,RamÃ³n Fernandez Astudillo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores improving token efficiency in self-consistency for long reasoning tasks by pruning hypotheses early using confidence and lexical coverage indicators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-consistency is effective but token-heavy, limiting practicality for long reasoning tasks.

Method: Parallel generation with periodic pruning based on model confidence and lexical coverage, using a weighted set cover algorithm.

Result: Token efficiency improved by 10-35% across five LLMs on three math benchmarks.

Conclusion: Early hypothesis pruning enhances token efficiency in self-consistency without sacrificing parallelism.

Abstract: Despite its simplicity and efficacy, the high token expenditure of
self-consistency can limit its practical utility. Here we investigate if
self-consistency can be made more token-efficient for long chain-of-thought
reasoning tasks, while preserving its parallelism, through early hypothesis
pruning. Concretely, we generate all solutions in parallel, but periodically
prune intermediate hypotheses that are deemed unnecessary based on two
lightweight indicators: (a) the model's own confidence in individual
hypotheses, and (b) lexical coverage of all current hypotheses by candidate
subsets that are under consideration for continued retention. We design a fast
weighted set cover algorithm that utilizes the two indicators; our evaluation
of five LLMs on three math benchmarks shows that this method can improve token
efficiency for all models, by 10-35% in many cases.

*Bohan Jiang,Dawei Li,Zhen Tan,Chengshuai Zhao,Huan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores whether LLMs can generate accurate and tailored well-being explanations for diverse audiences, using a large dataset and a principle-guided evaluation framework. Fine-tuning with SFT and DPO improves explanation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of LLMs providing accurate and audience-specific well-being explanations, given the growing reliance on LLMs for such guidance.

Method: Constructed a dataset of 43,880 explanations from 10 LLMs, introduced a dual-judge evaluation framework, and fine-tuned an open-source LLM using SFT and DPO.

Result: LLM judges aligned with human evaluations; explanation quality varied by model, audience, and category; DPO- and SFT-finetuned models outperformed larger models.

Conclusion: Preference-based learning (DPO and SFT) effectively enhances LLM-generated well-being explanations, making them more accurate and tailored.

Abstract: Well-being encompasses mental, physical, and social dimensions essential to
personal growth and informed life decisions. As individuals increasingly
consult Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand well-being, a key challenge
emerges: Can LLMs generate explanations that are not only accurate but also
tailored to diverse audiences? High-quality explanations require both factual
correctness and the ability to meet the expectations of users with varying
expertise. In this work, we construct a large-scale dataset comprising 43,880
explanations of 2,194 well-being concepts, generated by ten diverse LLMs. We
introduce a principle-guided LLM-as-a-judge evaluation framework, employing
dual judges to assess explanation quality. Furthermore, we show that
fine-tuning an open-source LLM using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) can significantly enhance the quality of
generated explanations. Our results reveal: (1) The proposed LLM judges align
well with human evaluations; (2) explanation quality varies significantly
across models, audiences, and categories; and (3) DPO- and SFT-finetuned models
outperform their larger counterparts, demonstrating the effectiveness of
preference-based learning for specialized explanation tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A social robot co-facilitator uses a transparent concept bottleneck model (CBM) to analyze group meetings, providing discreet cues to human facilitators, outperforming foundation models (FMs) in predicting intervention needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Facilitators face challenges in managing group dynamics and cognitive load, creating a need for an embodied technology that interprets social exchanges transparently.

Method: The system employs a transfer learning framework to distill FM knowledge into a specialized CBM, using human-interpretable concepts like engagement and sentiments.

Result: The CBM-based robot outperforms zero-shot FMs in intervention prediction and generalizes across groups, transferring expert facilitator knowledge to novices.

Conclusion: The work offers a blueprint for augmenting human capabilities in social domains through interpretable robotic partners.

Abstract: Successful group meetings, such as those implemented in group
behavioral-change programs, work meetings, and other social contexts, must
promote individual goal setting and execution while strengthening the social
relationships within the group. Consequently, an ideal facilitator must be
sensitive to the subtle dynamics of disengagement, difficulties with individual
goal setting and execution, and interpersonal difficulties that signal a need
for intervention. The challenges and cognitive load experienced by facilitators
create a critical gap for an embodied technology that can interpret social
exchanges while remaining aware of the needs of the individuals in the group
and providing transparent recommendations that go beyond powerful but "black
box" foundation models (FMs) that identify social cues. We address this
important demand with a social robot co-facilitator that analyzes multimodal
meeting data and provides discreet cues to the facilitator. The robot's
reasoning is powered by an agentic concept bottleneck model (CBM), which makes
decisions based on human-interpretable concepts like participant engagement and
sentiments, ensuring transparency and trustworthiness. Our core contribution is
a transfer learning framework that distills the broad social understanding of
an FM into our specialized and transparent CBM. This concept-driven system
significantly outperforms direct zero-shot FMs in predicting the need for
intervention and enables real-time human correction of its reasoning.
Critically, we demonstrate robust knowledge transfer: the model generalizes
across different groups and successfully transfers the expertise of senior
human facilitators to improve the performance of novices. By transferring an
expert's cognitive model into an interpretable robotic partner, our work
provides a powerful blueprint for augmenting human capabilities in complex
social domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HarmonyGuard is a multi-agent framework for balancing safety and utility in web environments, improving policy compliance by 38% and task completion by 20%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the gap in collaborative optimization of safety and utility in web agents, as current research lacks multi-objective or multi-turn capabilities.

Method: Uses a multi-agent framework with Adaptive Policy Enhancement (Policy Agent) and Dual-Objective Optimization (Utility Agent).

Result: Achieves up to 38% better policy compliance and 20% higher task completion, with over 90% compliance across tasks.

Conclusion: HarmonyGuard effectively balances safety and utility in web environments, outperforming existing baselines.

Abstract: Large language models enable agents to autonomously perform tasks in open web
environments. However, as hidden threats within the web evolve, web agents face
the challenge of balancing task performance with emerging risks during
long-sequence operations. Although this challenge is critical, current research
remains limited to single-objective optimization or single-turn scenarios,
lacking the capability for collaborative optimization of both safety and
utility in web environments. To address this gap, we propose HarmonyGuard, a
multi-agent collaborative framework that leverages policy enhancement and
objective optimization to jointly improve both utility and safety. HarmonyGuard
features a multi-agent architecture characterized by two fundamental
capabilities: (1) Adaptive Policy Enhancement: We introduce the Policy Agent
within HarmonyGuard, which automatically extracts and maintains structured
security policies from unstructured external documents, while continuously
updating policies in response to evolving threats. (2) Dual-Objective
Optimization: Based on the dual objectives of safety and utility, the Utility
Agent integrated within HarmonyGuard performs the Markovian real-time reasoning
to evaluate the objectives and utilizes metacognitive capabilities for their
optimization. Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks show that
HarmonyGuard improves policy compliance by up to 38% and task completion by up
to 20% over existing baselines, while achieving over 90% policy compliance
across all tasks. Our project is available here:

TL;DR: SMEdit improves meta-learning-based model editing (MLBME) by using multiple backpropagation steps and norm regularization, enhancing performance in low-data scenarios and training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) are static and costly to update. Model editing, especially MLBME, is efficient but struggles with low-data scenarios and training bottlenecks.

Method: Proposes SMEdit, which uses multiple backpropagation steps (MBPS) for better editing under limited supervision and norm regularization for efficient training.

Result: SMEdit outperforms prior MLBME methods on two datasets and LLMs, with MBPS enhancing existing methods.

Conclusion: SMEdit addresses MLBME limitations, offering improved performance and efficiency, with potential for broader application.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) underpin many AI applications, but their static
nature makes updating knowledge costly. Model editing offers an efficient
alternative by injecting new information through targeted parameter
modifications. In particular, meta-learning-based model editing (MLBME) methods
have demonstrated notable advantages in both editing effectiveness and
efficiency. Despite this, we find that MLBME exhibits suboptimal performance in
low-data scenarios, and its training efficiency is bottlenecked by the
computation of KL divergence. To address these, we propose $\textbf{S}$tep
$\textbf{M}$ore $\textbf{Edit}$ ($\textbf{SMEdit}$), a novel MLBME method that
adopts $\textbf{M}$ultiple $\textbf{B}$ackpro$\textbf{P}$agation
$\textbf{S}$teps ($\textbf{MBPS}$) to improve editing performance under limited
supervision and a norm regularization on weight updates to improve training
efficiency. Experimental results on two datasets and two LLMs demonstrate that
SMEdit outperforms prior MLBME baselines and the MBPS strategy can be
seamlessly integrated into existing methods to further boost their performance.
Our code will be released soon.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ZARA is a zero-shot, explainable HAR framework using raw motion time-series, outperforming baselines by 2.53x in F1 without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HAR methods require retraining for new activities and lack interpretability. ZARA addresses these limitations.

Method: ZARA combines a feature knowledge base, multi-sensor retrieval, and a hierarchical agent pipeline to guide LLMs for predictions and explanations.

Result: ZARA achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, surpassing baselines by 2.53x in macro F1.

Conclusion: ZARA offers flexible, interpretable HAR without fine-tuning, advancing trustworthy motion time-series analysis.

Abstract: Motion sensor time-series are central to human activity recognition (HAR),
with applications in health, sports, and smart devices. However, existing
methods are trained for fixed activity sets and require costly retraining when
new behaviours or sensor setups appear. Recent attempts to use large language
models (LLMs) for HAR, typically by converting signals into text or images,
suffer from limited accuracy and lack verifiable interpretability. We propose
ZARA, the first agent-based framework for zero-shot, explainable HAR directly
from raw motion time-series. ZARA integrates an automatically derived pair-wise
feature knowledge base that captures discriminative statistics for every
activity pair, a multi-sensor retrieval module that surfaces relevant evidence,
and a hierarchical agent pipeline that guides the LLM to iteratively select
features, draw on this evidence, and produce both activity predictions and
natural-language explanations. ZARA enables flexible and interpretable HAR
without any fine-tuning or task-specific classifiers. Extensive experiments on
8 HAR benchmarks show that ZARA achieves SOTA zero-shot performance, delivering
clear reasoning while exceeding the strongest baselines by 2.53x in macro F1.
Ablation studies further confirm the necessity of each module, marking ZARA as
a promising step toward trustworthy, plug-and-play motion time-series analysis.

### [185] [Large Reasoning Models Are Autonomous Jailbreak Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04039)
*Thilo Hagendorff,Erik Derner,Nuria Oliver*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LRMs simplify jailbreaking AI models, making it accessible to non-experts with a 97.14% success rate, highlighting safety risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate how large reasoning models (LRMs) can bypass AI safety mechanisms easily and at scale.

Method: Evaluated four LRMs (DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Grok 3 Mini, Qwen3 235B) as autonomous adversaries in multi-turn conversations with nine target models, using a benchmark of 70 harmful prompts.

Result: Achieved a 97.14% attack success rate, showing LRMs can systematically erode safety guardrails.

Conclusion: Urgent need to align frontier models to resist and prevent jailbreaking, as LRMs pose significant safety risks.

Abstract: Jailbreaking -- bypassing built-in safety mechanisms in AI models -- has
traditionally required complex technical procedures or specialized human
expertise. In this study, we show that the persuasive capabilities of large
reasoning models (LRMs) simplify and scale jailbreaking, converting it into an
inexpensive activity accessible to non-experts. We evaluated the capabilities
of four LRMs (DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Grok 3 Mini, Qwen3 235B) to act as
autonomous adversaries conducting multi-turn conversations with nine widely
used target models. LRMs received instructions via a system prompt, before
proceeding to planning and executing jailbreaks with no further supervision. We
performed extensive experiments with a benchmark of harmful prompts composed of
70 items covering seven sensitive domains. This setup yielded an overall attack
success rate across all model combinations of 97.14%. Our study reveals an
alignment regression, in which LRMs can systematically erode the safety
guardrails of other models, highlighting the urgent need to further align
frontier models not only to resist jailbreak attempts, but also to prevent them
from being co-opted into acting as jailbreak agents.

### [186] [DTPA: Dynamic Token-level Prefix Augmentation for Controllable Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04047)
*Jiabing Yang,Yixiang Chen,Zichen Wen,Chenhang Cui,Peiyan Li,Yuan Xu,Bowen Fang,Yan Huang,Liang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DTPA, a framework for improving controllability in long-form text generation by dynamically amplifying attention to prefixes and selecting optimal prefix types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods focus on short sequences, but controllability declines in long-form text due to decaying attention to prefixes. The paper aims to address this gap.

Method: Proposes Dynamic Token-level Prefix Augmentation (DTPA), which selects optimal prefix types and dynamically scales attention to prefixes exponentially with sequence length.

Result: DTPA outperforms other methods in attribute control while maintaining fluency, diversity, and topic relevance, especially in long text generation.

Conclusion: DTPA effectively enhances controllability in long-form text generation, balancing attribute constraints and text quality.

Abstract: Controllable Text Generation (CTG) is a vital subfield in Natural Language
Processing (NLP), aiming to generate text that aligns with desired attributes.
However, previous studies commonly focus on the quality of controllable text
generation for short sequences, while the generation of long-form text remains
largely underexplored. In this paper, we observe that the controllability of
texts generated by the powerful prefix-based method Air-Decoding tends to
decline with increasing sequence length, which we hypothesize primarily arises
from the observed decay in attention to the prefixes. Meanwhile, different
types of prefixes including soft and hard prefixes are also key factors
influencing performance. Building on these insights, we propose a lightweight
and effective framework called Dynamic Token-level Prefix Augmentation (DTPA)
based on Air-Decoding for controllable text generation. Specifically, it first
selects the optimal prefix type for a given task. Then we dynamically amplify
the attention to the prefix for the attribute distribution to enhance
controllability, with a scaling factor growing exponentially as the sequence
length increases. Moreover, based on the task, we optionally apply a similar
augmentation to the original prompt for the raw distribution to balance text
quality. After attribute distribution reconstruction, the generated text
satisfies the attribute constraints well. Experiments on multiple CTG tasks
demonstrate that DTPA generally outperforms other methods in attribute control
while maintaining competitive fluency, diversity, and topic relevance. Further
analysis highlights DTPA's superior effectiveness in long text generation.

*Wang Chen,Guanqiang Qi,Weikang Li,Yang Li,Deguo Xia,Jizhou Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PAIRS is a training-free framework that enhances RAG systems by adaptively deciding when to retrieve external knowledge, improving efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems inefficiently retrieve information for every query and risk retrieving irrelevant documents, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: PAIRS uses a dual-path generation mechanism and adaptive retrieval to bypass unnecessary retrievals and filter documents.

Result: PAIRS reduces retrieval costs by 25% and improves accuracy by +1.1% EM and +1.0% F1 on QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: PAIRS effectively addresses inefficiencies in RAG systems, balancing retrieval costs and accuracy.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a cornerstone technique for
enhancing large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. However,
current RAG systems face two critical limitations: (1) they inefficiently
retrieve information for every query, including simple questions that could be
resolved using the LLM's parametric knowledge alone, and (2) they risk
retrieving irrelevant documents when queries contain sparse information
signals. To address these gaps, we introduce Parametric-verified Adaptive
Information Retrieval and Selection (PAIRS), a training-free framework that
integrates parametric and retrieved knowledge to adaptively determine whether
to retrieve and how to select external information. Specifically, PAIRS employs
a dual-path generation mechanism: First, the LLM produces both a direct answer
and a context-augmented answer using self-generated pseudo-context. When these
outputs converge, PAIRS bypasses external retrieval entirely, dramatically
improving the RAG system's efficiency. For divergent cases, PAIRS activates a
dual-path retrieval (DPR) process guided by both the original query and
self-generated contextual signals, followed by an Adaptive Information
Selection (AIS) module that filters documents through weighted similarity to
both sources. This simple yet effective approach can not only enhance
efficiency by eliminating unnecessary retrievals but also improve accuracy
through contextually guided retrieval and adaptive information selection.
Experimental results on six question-answering (QA) benchmarks show that PAIRS
reduces retrieval costs by around 25% (triggering for only 75% of queries)
while still improving accuracy-achieving +1.1% EM and +1.0% F1 over prior
baselines on average.

of capability, versatility, response time, and safety. Finally, comparative
tests were conducted to measure the performance of the developed variants and
to validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies. This work is based on

TL;DR: ToolGrad introduces an agentic framework to generate tool-use datasets by first creating valid tool-use chains and then synthesizing user queries, improving efficiency and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods for generating tool-use datasets are inefficient and prone to annotation failures, prompting the need for a better approach.

Method: ToolGrad inverts the traditional paradigm by constructing tool-use chains iteratively using textual "gradients" before generating user queries.

Result: ToolGrad-5k, the resulting dataset, has 100% pass rate, lower cost, and enables models to outperform those trained on expensive baselines, even on OOD benchmarks.

Conclusion: The "answer-first" approach of ToolGrad is more efficient and effective for generating high-quality tool-use datasets.

Abstract: Prior work synthesizes tool-use LLM datasets by first generating a user
query, followed by complex tool-use annotations like DFS. This leads to
inevitable annotation failures and low efficiency in data generation. We
introduce ToolGrad, an agentic framework that inverts this paradigm. ToolGrad
first constructs valid tool-use chains through an iterative process guided by
textual "gradients", and then synthesizes corresponding user queries. This
"answer-first" approach led to ToolGrad-5k, a dataset generated with more
complex tool use, lower cost, and 100% pass rate. Experiments show that models
trained on ToolGrad-5k outperform those on expensive baseline datasets and
proprietary LLMs, even on OOD benchmarks.

*Jianghangfan Zhang,Yibo Yan,Kening Zheng,Xin Zou,Song Dai,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GM-PRM transforms Process Reward Models into active collaborators for multimodal math reasoning, offering corrections and improving solution quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal PRMs lack corrective and explanatory power, limiting their effectiveness in complex reasoning tasks.

Method: Introduces GM-PRM, which provides fine-grained step analysis and generates corrections for errors, enabling the Refined-BoN inference strategy.

Result: GM-PRM achieves state-of-the-art results on multimodal math benchmarks with high data efficiency (20K-sample dataset).

Conclusion: GM-PRM enhances reasoning accuracy and diversity, proving effective for complex multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities
but often struggle with complex, multi-step mathematical reasoning, where minor
errors in visual perception or logical deduction can lead to complete failure.
While Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer step-by-step supervision, existing
multimodal PRMs are limited to being binary verifiers that can identify but not
correct errors, offering little explanatory power. To address these
deficiencies, we introduce the Generative Multimodal Process Reward Model
(GM-PRM), a novel paradigm that transforms the PRM from a passive judge into an
active reasoning collaborator. Instead of a simple scalar score, GM-PRM
provides a fine-grained, interpretable analysis of each reasoning step,
evaluating its step intent, visual alignment, and logical soundness. More
critically, GM-PRM is trained to generate a corrected version of the first
erroneous step it identifies. This unique corrective capability enables our new
test-time inference strategy, Refined Best-of-N (Refined-BoN). This framework
actively enhances solution quality by using the PRM's generated correction to
guide the policy model toward a more promising reasoning trajectory, thereby
improving the diversity and correctness of the solution pool. We demonstrate
that GM-PRM achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple multimodal math
benchmarks, significantly boosting policy model performance with remarkable
data efficiency, requiring only a 20K-sample training dataset. Our code will be
released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: The paper investigates over-memorization in finetuned LLMs, where models memorize training data excessively, leading to high test perplexity but good accuracy, while harming robustness and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the learning dynamics of LLM finetuning on reasoning tasks and identify the over-memorization phenomenon.

Method: Analyze conditions like training epochs and learning rates that cause over-memorization, and evaluate its impact on robustness and generalization.

Result: Over-memorization occurs broadly across tasks and models, reducing robustness and diversity. Finetuned LLMs show unique dynamics compared to traditional models.

Conclusion: Recommendations for checkpoint and learning rate selection are provided to mitigate over-memorization during finetuning.

Abstract: The pretrained large language models (LLMs) are finetuned with labeled data
for better instruction following ability and alignment with human values. In
this paper, we study the learning dynamics of LLM finetuning on reasoning tasks
and reveal the uncovered over-memorization phenomenon during a specific stage
of LLM finetuning. At this stage, the LLMs have excessively memorized training
data and exhibit high test perplexity while maintaining good test accuracy. We
investigate the conditions that lead to LLM over-memorization and find that
training epochs and large learning rates contribute to this issue. Although
models with over-memorization demonstrate comparable test accuracy to normal
models, they suffer from reduced robustness, poor out-of-distribution
generalization, and decreased generation diversity. Our experiments unveil the
over-memorization to be broadly applicable across different tasks, models, and
finetuning methods. Our research highlights that overparameterized, extensively
finetuned LLMs exhibit unique learning dynamics distinct from traditional
machine learning models. Based on our observations of over-memorization, we
provide recommendations on checkpoint and learning rate selection during
finetuning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel difficulty-based data selection strategy for preference datasets improves LLM alignment efficiency, outperforming baselines with only 10% of the original data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning LLMs with human preferences is challenging due to reliance on costly preference datasets; current methods lack efficient data selection strategies.

Method: Introduces a difficulty-based data selection strategy using DPO implicit reward gaps to identify challenging cases, enhancing data efficiency.

Result: Outperforms five baselines across datasets, achieving superior performance with 10% of the original data.

Conclusion: The method offers a scalable, resource-efficient solution for LLM alignment.

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is a critical
challenge in AI research. While methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) are widely used, they
often rely on large, costly preference datasets. The current work lacks methods
for high-quality data selection specifically for preference data. In this work,
we introduce a novel difficulty-based data selection strategy for preference
datasets, grounded in the DPO implicit reward mechanism. By selecting
preference data examples with smaller DPO implicit reward gaps, which are
indicative of more challenging cases, we improve data efficiency and model
alignment. Our approach consistently outperforms five strong baselines across
multiple datasets and alignment tasks, achieving superior performance with only
10\% of the original data. This principled, efficient selection method offers a
promising solution for scaling LLM alignment with limited resources.

### [193] [The State Of TTS: A Case Study with Human Fooling Rates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04179)
*Praveen Srinivasa Varadhan,Sherry Thomas,Sai Teja M. S.,Suvrat Bhooshan,Mitesh M. Khapra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Human Fooling Rate (HFR) to measure if TTS systems can deceive humans into thinking speech is human-generated. It finds CMOS claims often fail, commercial models perform better in zero-shot settings, and fine-tuning helps but gaps remain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if TTS systems can genuinely deceive humans in Turing-like tests, moving beyond subjective evaluations like CMOS.

Method: Large-scale evaluation of open-source and commercial TTS models using HFR, focusing on deception testing and benchmarking against high-quality human speech.

Result: Commercial models approach human deception in zero-shot settings, but open-source systems lag. Fine-tuning improves realism but doesn't close the gap.

Conclusion: More realistic, human-centric evaluations are needed alongside subjective tests to accurately measure TTS progress.

Abstract: While subjective evaluations in recent years indicate rapid progress in TTS,
can current TTS systems truly pass a human deception test in a Turing-like
evaluation? We introduce Human Fooling Rate (HFR), a metric that directly
measures how often machine-generated speech is mistaken for human. Our
large-scale evaluation of open-source and commercial TTS models reveals
critical insights: (i) CMOS-based claims of human parity often fail under
deception testing, (ii) TTS progress should be benchmarked on datasets where
human speech achieves high HFRs, as evaluating against monotonous or less
expressive reference samples sets a low bar, (iii) Commercial models approach
human deception in zero-shot settings, while open-source systems still struggle
with natural conversational speech; (iv) Fine-tuning on high-quality data
improves realism but does not fully bridge the gap. Our findings underscore the
need for more realistic, human-centric evaluations alongside existing
subjective tests.

### [194] [Hacking Hallucinations of MLLMs with Causal Sufficiency and Necessity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04182)
*Peizheng Guo,Jingyao Wang,Wenwen Qiang,Huijie Guo,Changwen Zheng,Jiahuan Zhou,Gang Hua*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning framework is proposed to reduce hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by ensuring causal completeness of tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs often generate semantically inconsistent outputs (hallucinations) due to inadequate capture of causal factors or misleading non-causal cues.

Method: A novel reinforcement learning framework evaluates token-level causal completeness (sufficiency and necessity) and integrates it into GRPO optimization.

Result: The approach effectively mitigates hallucinations across various benchmark datasets and tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses hallucinations in MLLMs by focusing on causally relevant tokens.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across vision-language tasks. However, they may suffer from
hallucinations--generating outputs that are semantically inconsistent with the
input image or text. Through causal analyses, we find that: (i) hallucinations
with omission may arise from the failure to adequately capture essential causal
factors, and (ii) hallucinations with fabrication are likely caused by the
model being misled by non-causal cues. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel reinforcement learning framework guided by causal completeness, which
jointly considers both causal sufficiency and causal necessity of tokens.
Specifically, we evaluate each token's standalone contribution and
counterfactual indispensability to define a token-level causal completeness
reward. This reward is used to construct a causally informed advantage function
within the GRPO optimization framework, encouraging the model to focus on
tokens that are both causally sufficient and necessary for accurate generation.
Experimental results across various benchmark datasets and tasks demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach, which effectively mitigates hallucinations
in MLLMs.

### [195] [Characterizing Deep Research: A Benchmark and Formal Definition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04183)
*Abhinav Java,Ashmit Khandelwal,Sukruta Midigeshi,Aaron Halfaker,Amit Deshpande,Navin Goyal,Ankur Gupta,Nagarajan Natarajan,Amit Sharma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper formalizes 'deep research' (DR) as a task requiring broad, reasoning-intensive exploration, introduces a benchmark (LiveDRBench) for evaluating DR systems, and analyzes current models' performance and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the scope of deep research tasks and distinguish them from other reasoning problems, as current understanding is limited.

Method: Proposes a formal definition of DR, focusing on high fan-out over concepts during search, and introduces LiveDRBench with 100 tasks for evaluation.

Result: State-of-the-art DR systems show F1 scores between 0.02-0.72, with OpenAI's model leading at 0.55. Analysis reveals gaps in search mechanisms and grounding.

Conclusion: The benchmark and formalization provide a foundation for improving DR systems, highlighting the need for better search and grounding capabilities.

Abstract: Information tasks such as writing surveys or analytical reports require
complex search and reasoning, and have recently been grouped under the umbrella
of \textit{deep research} -- a term also adopted by recent models targeting
these capabilities. Despite growing interest, the scope of the deep research
task remains underdefined and its distinction from other reasoning-intensive
problems is poorly understood. In this paper, we propose a formal
characterization of the deep research (DR) task and introduce a benchmark to
evaluate the performance of DR systems. We argue that the core defining feature
of deep research is not the production of lengthy report-style outputs, but
rather the high fan-out over concepts required during the search process, i.e.,
broad and reasoning-intensive exploration. To enable objective evaluation, we
define DR using an intermediate output representation that encodes key claims
uncovered during search-separating the reasoning challenge from surface-level
report generation. Based on this formulation, we propose a diverse, challenging
benchmark LiveDRBench with 100 challenging tasks over scientific topics (e.g.,
datasets, materials discovery, prior art search) and public interest events
(e.g., flight incidents, movie awards). Across state-of-the-art DR systems, F1
score ranges between 0.02 and 0.72 for any sub-category. OpenAI's model
performs the best with an overall F1 score of 0.55. Analysis of reasoning
traces reveals the distribution over the number of referenced sources,
branching, and backtracking events executed by current DR systems, motivating
future directions for improving their search mechanisms and grounding
capabilities. The benchmark is available at
https://github.com/microsoft/LiveDRBench.

### [196] [Eliciting and Analyzing Emergent Misalignment in State-of-the-Art Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04196)
*Siddhant Panpatil,Hiskias Dingeto,Haon Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: State-of-the-art language models are vulnerable to conversational manipulation, revealing gaps in alignment methods. A manual red-teaming study identified 10 attack scenarios, leading to the creation of MISALIGNMENTBENCH for automated testing. Cross-model evaluation showed a 76% vulnerability rate, with GPT-4.1 most susceptible (90%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover vulnerabilities in current alignment techniques of language models, particularly under sophisticated conversational manipulation.

Method: Systematic manual red-teaming with Claude-4-Opus to identify attack scenarios, followed by the development of MISALIGNMENTBENCH for automated cross-model evaluation.

Result: Discovered 10 attack scenarios causing misalignment behaviors (e.g., deception, value drift). Cross-model testing revealed a 76% vulnerability rate, with GPT-4.1 most susceptible (90%).

Conclusion: Current alignment methods lack robustness against subtle manipulation. Future AI systems need improved defenses against scenario-based attacks.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in alignment techniques, we demonstrate that
state-of-the-art language models remain vulnerable to carefully crafted
conversational scenarios that can induce various forms of misalignment without
explicit jailbreaking. Through systematic manual red-teaming with
Claude-4-Opus, we discovered 10 successful attack scenarios, revealing
fundamental vulnerabilities in how current alignment methods handle narrative
immersion, emotional pressure, and strategic framing. These scenarios
successfully elicited a range of misaligned behaviors, including deception,
value drift, self-preservation, and manipulative reasoning, each exploiting
different psychological and contextual vulnerabilities. To validate
generalizability, we distilled our successful manual attacks into
MISALIGNMENTBENCH, an automated evaluation framework that enables reproducible
testing across multiple models. Cross-model evaluation of our 10 scenarios
against five frontier LLMs revealed an overall 76% vulnerability rate, with
significant variations: GPT-4.1 showed the highest susceptibility (90%), while
Claude-4-Sonnet demonstrated greater resistance (40%). Our findings demonstrate
that sophisticated reasoning capabilities often become attack vectors rather
than protective mechanisms, as models can be manipulated into complex
justifications for misaligned behavior. This work provides (i) a detailed
taxonomy of conversational manipulation patterns and (ii) a reusable evaluation
framework. Together, these findings expose critical gaps in current alignment
strategies and highlight the need for robustness against subtle, scenario-based
manipulation in future AI systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores sentiment analysis in low-resource, culturally nuanced contexts, evaluating LLMs' reasoning quality and alignment with human judgment in code-mixed WhatsApp messages from Nairobi youth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional NLP struggles with culturally embedded sentiment due to fixed labels and universal assumptions. The study aims to assess LLMs' interpretability and robustness in such contexts.

Method: A diagnostic framework combines human-annotated data, sentiment-flipped counterfactuals, and rubric-based explanation evaluation to probe LLMs.

Result: Top-tier LLMs show interpretive stability, while open models struggle with ambiguity or sentiment shifts.

Conclusion: Culturally sensitive, reasoning-aware AI evaluation is crucial for real-world, complex communication.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis in low-resource, culturally nuanced contexts challenges
conventional NLP approaches that assume fixed labels and universal affective
expressions. We present a diagnostic framework that treats sentiment as a
context-dependent, culturally embedded construct, and evaluate how large
language models (LLMs) reason about sentiment in informal, code-mixed WhatsApp
messages from Nairobi youth health groups. Using a combination of
human-annotated data, sentiment-flipped counterfactuals, and rubric-based
explanation evaluation, we probe LLM interpretability, robustness, and
alignment with human reasoning. Framing our evaluation through a social-science
measurement lens, we operationalize and interrogate LLMs outputs as an
instrument for measuring the abstract concept of sentiment. Our findings reveal
significant variation in model reasoning quality, with top-tier LLMs
demonstrating interpretive stability, while open models often falter under
ambiguity or sentiment shifts. This work highlights the need for culturally
sensitive, reasoning-aware AI evaluation in complex, real-world communication.

### [198] [ReasoningGuard: Safeguarding Large Reasoning Models with Inference-time Safety Aha Moments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04204)
*Yuquan Wang,Mi Zhang,Yining Wang,Geng Hong,Xiaoyu You,Min Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReasoningGuard is an inference-time safeguard for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) that uses attention behavior to identify critical reasoning points and trigger safety-oriented reflections, outperforming existing defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs are vulnerable to harmful content generation during reasoning, and current defenses are costly and lack scalability.

Method: ReasoningGuard leverages internal attention behavior to identify critical reasoning points and implements a scaling sampling strategy for optimal path selection.

Result: It mitigates three types of jailbreak attacks, outperforms seven existing safeguards, and avoids exaggerated safety issues.

Conclusion: ReasoningGuard provides scalable, effective safety defenses for LRMs with minimal inference cost.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in
reasoning-intensive tasks, but they remain vulnerable to harmful content
generation, particularly in the mid-to-late steps of their reasoning processes.
Existing defense mechanisms, however, rely on costly fine-tuning and additional
expert knowledge, which restricts their scalability. In this work, we propose
ReasoningGuard, an inference-time safeguard for LRMs, which injects timely
safety aha moments to steer harmless while helpful reasoning processes.
Leveraging the model's internal attention behavior, our approach accurately
identifies critical points in the reasoning path, and triggers spontaneous,
safety-oriented reflection. To safeguard both the subsequent reasoning steps
and the final answers, we further implement a scaling sampling strategy during
the decoding phase, selecting the optimal reasoning path. Inducing minimal
extra inference cost, ReasoningGuard effectively mitigates three types of
jailbreak attacks, including the latest ones targeting the reasoning process of
LRMs. Our approach outperforms seven existing safeguards, achieving
state-of-the-art safety defenses while effectively avoiding the common
exaggerated safety issues.

### [199] [Hierarchical Text Classification Using Black Box Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04219)
*Kosuke Yoshimura,Hisashi Kashima*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores using black box LLMs for Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC), comparing three prompting strategies in zero-shot and few-shot settings. Few-shot improves accuracy, and LLMs outperform traditional models on deeper hierarchies, but API costs rise with deeper hierarchies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of data scarcity and model complexity in HTC by leveraging black box LLMs via APIs as an alternative to traditional methods.

Method: Evaluate three prompting strategies (DL, DH, TMH) in zero-shot and few-shot settings on two datasets, comparing accuracy and cost.

Result: Few-shot improves accuracy; LLMs (especially DH) outperform traditional models on deeper hierarchies, but API costs increase with deeper hierarchies.

Conclusion: Black box LLMs show promise for HTC, but prompt strategy selection must balance performance and cost.

Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) aims to assign texts to structured
label hierarchies; however, it faces challenges due to data scarcity and model
complexity. This study explores the feasibility of using black box Large
Language Models (LLMs) accessed via APIs for HTC, as an alternative to
traditional machine learning methods that require extensive labeled data and
computational resources. We evaluate three prompting strategies -- Direct Leaf
Label Prediction (DL), Direct Hierarchical Label Prediction (DH), and Top-down
Multi-step Hierarchical Label Prediction (TMH) -- in both zero-shot and
few-shot settings, comparing the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of these
strategies. Experiments on two datasets show that a few-shot setting
consistently improves classification accuracy compared to a zero-shot setting.
While a traditional machine learning model achieves high accuracy on a dataset
with a shallow hierarchy, LLMs, especially DH strategy, tend to outperform the
machine learning model on a dataset with a deeper hierarchy. API costs increase
significantly due to the higher input tokens required for deeper label
hierarchies on DH strategy. These results emphasize the trade-off between
accuracy improvement and the computational cost of prompt strategy. These
findings highlight the potential of black box LLMs for HTC while underscoring
the need to carefully select a prompt strategy to balance performance and cost.

### [200] [DP-GPT4MTS: Dual-Prompt Large Language Model for Textual-Numerical Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04239)
*Chanjuan Liu,Shengzhi Wang,Enqiang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DP-GPT4MTS introduces a dual-prompt LLM framework for time series forecasting, combining explicit and textual prompts to integrate textual context, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional models ignore textual data (e.g., events, news), limiting accuracy. Multimodal integration via single-prompt frameworks is ineffective due to redundant information.

Method: DP-GPT4MTS uses dual prompts: explicit for task instructions and textual for context-aware embeddings. Embeddings are refined via self-attention and feed-forward networks.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on diverse datasets, demonstrating improved forecasting accuracy.

Conclusion: Dual-prompt mechanisms effectively incorporate textual context, enhancing time series prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is crucial in strategic planning and decision-making
across various industries. Traditional forecasting models mainly concentrate on
numerical time series data, often overlooking important textual information
such as events and news, which can significantly affect forecasting accuracy.
While large language models offer a promise for integrating multimodal data,
existing single-prompt frameworks struggle to effectively capture the semantics
of timestamped text, introducing redundant information that can hinder model
performance. To address this limitation, we introduce DP-GPT4MTS (Dual-Prompt
GPT2-base for Multimodal Time Series), a novel dual-prompt large language model
framework that combines two complementary prompts: an explicit prompt for clear
task instructions and a textual prompt for context-aware embeddings from
time-stamped data. The tokenizer generates the explicit prompt while the
embeddings from the textual prompt are refined through self-attention and
feed-forward networks. Comprehensive experiments conducted on diverse
textural-numerical time series datasets demonstrate that this approach
outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in time series forecasting. This
highlights the significance of incorporating textual context via a dual-prompt
mechanism to achieve more accurate time series predictions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TalkDep, a clinician-in-the-loop patient simulation pipeline using advanced language models to generate clinically valid and diverse simulated patients for depression diagnosis training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shortage of real training data for mental health services limits support for depression diagnosis, prompting the need for simulated patients.

Method: The proposed method uses language models conditioned on psychiatric criteria, symptom severity scales, and contextual factors to create authentic patient responses.

Result: Simulated patients are validated by clinical professionals, proving reliable for diagnostic model training and evaluation.

Conclusion: TalkDep provides a scalable and adaptable resource to enhance the robustness and generalizability of automatic depression diagnosis systems.

Abstract: The increasing demand for mental health services has outpaced the
availability of real training data to develop clinical professionals, leading
to limited support for the diagnosis of depression. This shortage has motivated
the development of simulated or virtual patients to assist in training and
evaluation, but existing approaches often fail to generate clinically valid,
natural, and diverse symptom presentations. In this work, we embrace the recent
advanced language models as the backbone and propose a novel
clinician-in-the-loop patient simulation pipeline, TalkDep, with access to
diversified patient profiles to develop simulated patients. By conditioning the
model on psychiatric diagnostic criteria, symptom severity scales, and
contextual factors, our goal is to create authentic patient responses that can
better support diagnostic model training and evaluation. We verify the
reliability of these simulated patients with thorough assessments conducted by
clinical professionals. The availability of validated simulated patients offers
a scalable and adaptable resource for improving the robustness and
generalisability of automatic depression diagnosis systems.

*Zunhai Su,Kehong Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces KVSink, a method to predict and preserve attention sinks during KV cache quantization, outperforming existing strategies like Preserve-First-N (PFN) and improving perplexity (PPL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand and address the limitations of current KV cache quantization methods, particularly in preserving attention sinks beyond initial tokens.

Method: Examines cross-layer evolution of extreme activation outliers to understand attention sinks, then proposes KVSink, a plug-and-play method for predicting sink tokens with minimal overhead.

Result: KVSink outperforms PFN in preserving attention sinks and, when combined with KVQuant, improves PPL and reduces reliance on 16-bit outliers.

Conclusion: KVSink provides a more effective solution for preserving attention sinks during KV cache quantization, enhancing LLM inference efficiency.

Abstract: Key-Value (KV) cache quantization has become a widely adopted optimization
technique for efficient large language models (LLMs) inference by reducing KV
cache memory usage and mitigating memory-bound constraints. Recent studies have
emphasized the importance of preserving the original precision of KVs for the
first few tokens to ensure the protection of attention sinks. While this
approach has proven effective in mitigating performance degradation, its
underlying principles remain insufficiently understood. Moreover, it fails to
address the recent discovery that attention sinks can emerge beyond the initial
token positions. In this work, we elucidate the underlying mechanisms of
attention sinks during inference by examining their role in the cross-layer
evolution of extreme activation outliers. Additionally, we provide a
comprehensive analysis of the interplay between attention sinks and KV cache
quantization. Based on our enhanced understanding, we introduce
\textit{\textbf{KVSink}}, a plug-and-play method that effectively predicts sink
tokens with negligible overhead, enabling more thorough preservation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that KVSink outperforms the existing Preserve-First-N
(PFN) strategy, offering more effective preservation of attention sinks during
KV cache quantization. Moreover, when applied to the well-established KVQuant
method, KVSink further improves perplexity (PPL) and reduces reliance on 16-bit
numerical outliers.

*Jiangyuan Wang,Kejun Xiao,Qi Sun,Huaipeng Zhao,Tao Luo,Jiandong Zhang,Xiaoyi Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ShoppingBench is a new benchmark for complex e-commerce tasks, simulating real-world user goals like voucher application and budget management. It includes a scalable framework and a large-scale shopping sandbox for evaluation. State-of-the-art agents struggle (<50% success), but a distilled smaller agent matches GPT-4.1's performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack complexity for real-world e-commerce tasks like voucher use or multi-product searches. ShoppingBench aims to address this gap.

Method: Proposes a scalable framework for simulating user instructions and a large-scale shopping sandbox with 2.5M products. Uses trajectory distillation and fine-tuning to train a smaller agent.

Result: Even top agents (e.g., GPT-4.1) perform poorly (<50% success). The distilled smaller agent achieves competitive performance.

Conclusion: ShoppingBench highlights challenges in complex e-commerce tasks and shows promise for improving agent performance via distillation.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks in e-commerce primarily focus on basic user intents, such
as finding or purchasing products. However, real-world users often pursue more
complex goals, such as applying vouchers, managing budgets, and finding
multi-products seller. To bridge this gap, we propose ShoppingBench, a novel
end-to-end shopping benchmark designed to encompass increasingly challenging
levels of grounded intent. Specifically, we propose a scalable framework to
simulate user instructions based on various intents derived from sampled
real-world products. To facilitate consistent and reliable evaluations, we
provide a large-scale shopping sandbox that serves as an interactive simulated
environment, incorporating over 2.5 million real-world products. Experimental
results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art language agents (such as
GPT-4.1) achieve absolute success rates under 50% on our benchmark tasks,
highlighting the significant challenges posed by our ShoppingBench. In
addition, we propose a trajectory distillation strategy and leverage supervised
fine-tuning, along with reinforcement learning on synthetic trajectories, to
distill the capabilities of a large language agent into a smaller one. As a
result, our trained agent achieves competitive performance compared to GPT-4.1.

### [204] [A Few Words Can Distort Graphs: Knowledge Poisoning Attacks on Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04276)
*Jiayi Wen,Tianxin Chen,Zhirun Zheng,Cheng Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GraphRAG enhances LLMs by converting text to knowledge graphs but is vulnerable to knowledge poisoning attacks (KPAs), which manipulate graph construction to mislead reasoning. Two attacks (TKPA and UKPA) show high success rates and evade detection, exposing security gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose vulnerabilities in GraphRAG, which relies on LLMs for graph construction, by demonstrating how minor text modifications can poison knowledge graphs and mislead downstream tasks.

Method: Proposes two KPAs: Targeted KPA (TKPA) for precise control over QA outcomes and Universal KPA (UKPA) for disrupting graph integrity. Both modify minimal text to achieve high attack success.

Result: TKPA achieves 93.1% success in controlling QA outcomes; UKPA reduces QA accuracy from 95% to 50% with <0.05% text modified. State-of-the-art defenses fail to detect these attacks.

Conclusion: GraphRAG pipelines are highly vulnerable to knowledge poisoning, and current defenses are inadequate, highlighting an urgent need for robust security measures.

Abstract: Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has recently emerged as
a promising paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) by converting
raw text into structured knowledge graphs, improving both accuracy and
explainability. However, GraphRAG relies on LLMs to extract knowledge from raw
text during graph construction, and this process can be maliciously manipulated
to implant misleading information. Targeting this attack surface, we propose
two knowledge poisoning attacks (KPAs) and demonstrate that modifying only a
few words in the source text can significantly change the constructed graph,
poison the GraphRAG, and severely mislead downstream reasoning. The first
attack, named Targeted KPA (TKPA), utilizes graph-theoretic analysis to locate
vulnerable nodes in the generated graphs and rewrites the corresponding
narratives with LLMs, achieving precise control over specific
question-answering (QA) outcomes with a success rate of 93.1\%, while keeping
the poisoned text fluent and natural. The second attack, named Universal KPA
(UKPA), exploits linguistic cues such as pronouns and dependency relations to
disrupt the structural integrity of the generated graph by altering globally
influential words. With fewer than 0.05\% of full text modified, the QA
accuracy collapses from 95\% to 50\%. Furthermore, experiments show that
state-of-the-art defense methods fail to detect these attacks, highlighting
that securing GraphRAG pipelines against knowledge poisoning remains largely
unexplored.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedCheck is a lifecycle-oriented framework addressing reliability issues in medical LLM benchmarks, uncovering systemic flaws like lack of clinical fidelity and data integrity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical LLM benchmarks lack reliability, clinical fidelity, and safety metrics, necessitating a standardized evaluation framework.

Method: Introduces MedCheck, a framework with five stages and 46 criteria, applied to evaluate 53 medical LLM benchmarks.

Result: Reveals widespread issues like clinical disconnection, data contamination, and neglected safety metrics.

Conclusion: MedCheck serves as a diagnostic tool and guideline for improving AI evaluation in healthcare.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show significant potential in healthcare,
prompting numerous benchmarks to evaluate their capabilities. However, concerns
persist regarding the reliability of these benchmarks, which often lack
clinical fidelity, robust data management, and safety-oriented evaluation
metrics. To address these shortcomings, we introduce MedCheck, the first
lifecycle-oriented assessment framework specifically designed for medical
benchmarks. Our framework deconstructs a benchmark's development into five
continuous stages, from design to governance, and provides a comprehensive
checklist of 46 medically-tailored criteria. Using MedCheck, we conducted an
in-depth empirical evaluation of 53 medical LLM benchmarks. Our analysis
uncovers widespread, systemic issues, including a profound disconnect from
clinical practice, a crisis of data integrity due to unmitigated contamination
risks, and a systematic neglect of safety-critical evaluation dimensions like
model robustness and uncertainty awareness. Based on these findings, MedCheck
serves as both a diagnostic tool for existing benchmarks and an actionable
guideline to foster a more standardized, reliable, and transparent approach to
evaluating AI in healthcare.

*Francisco BolaÃ±os,Angelo Salatino,Francesco Osborne,Enrico Motta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new annotation schema for rhetorical roles in scientific literature and evaluates LLMs for classifying these roles, achieving high performance with fine-tuning and semi-synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve AI methods for analyzing scientific literature and support automated literature review generation by defining a relevant annotation schema and effective large-scale annotation strategies.

Method: 1) Introduces a novel annotation schema for literature review generation. 2) Evaluates 37 LLMs using zero-shot learning and fine-tuning on the Sci-Sentence benchmark (700 expert-annotated and 2,240 LLM-labelled sentences).

Result: Fine-tuned LLMs achieve >96% F1. GPT-4o performs best, but lightweight open-source models also excel. Semi-synthetic data boosts small encoders and open decoder models.

Conclusion: LLMs, especially when fine-tuned and augmented with semi-synthetic data, significantly advance rhetorical role classification, enabling high-quality literature review automation.

Abstract: Previous work has demonstrated that AI methods for analysing scientific
literature benefit significantly from annotating sentences in papers according
to their rhetorical roles, such as research gaps, results, limitations,
extensions of existing methodologies, and others. Such representations also
have the potential to support the development of a new generation of systems
capable of producing high-quality literature reviews. However, achieving this
goal requires the definition of a relevant annotation schema and effective
strategies for large-scale annotation of the literature. This paper addresses
these challenges by 1) introducing a novel annotation schema specifically
designed to support literature review generation and 2) conducting a
comprehensive evaluation of a wide range of state-of-the-art large language
models (LLMs) in classifying rhetorical roles according to this schema. To this
end, we also present Sci-Sentence, a novel multidisciplinary benchmark
comprising 700 sentences manually annotated by domain experts and 2,240
sentences automatically labelled using LLMs. We evaluate 37 LLMs on this
benchmark, spanning diverse model families and sizes, using both zero-shot
learning and fine-tuning approaches. The experiments yield several novel
insights that advance the state of the art in this challenging domain. First,
the current generation of LLMs performs remarkably well on this task when
fine-tuned on high-quality data, achieving performance levels above 96\% F1.
Second, while large proprietary models like GPT-4o achieve the best results,
some lightweight open-source alternatives also demonstrate excellent
performance. Finally, enriching the training data with semi-synthetic examples
generated by LLMs proves beneficial, enabling small encoders to achieve robust
results and significantly enhancing the performance of several open decoder
models.

*Hongze Tan,Jianfei Pan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dynamic Entropy Weighting to improve RL in LLMs by fine-grained credit assignment, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods for LLMs use uniform rewards, limiting performance in long-chain reasoning tasks.

Method: Proposes GTPO for token-level and GRPO-S for sequence-level entropy-weighted rewards.

Result: Outperforms DAPO baseline, showing entropy-weighting boosts reasoning performance.

Conclusion: Dynamic Entropy Weighting enhances deep reasoning in LLMs by refining reward signals.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with algorithms like Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) improves Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning, but is
limited by a coarse-grained credit assignment that applies a uniform reward to
all tokens in a sequence. This is a major flaw in long-chain reasoning tasks.
This paper solves this with \textbf{Dynamic Entropy Weighting}. Our core idea
is that high-entropy tokens in correct responses can guide the policy toward a
higher performance ceiling. This allows us to create more fine-grained reward
signals for precise policy updates via two ways: 1) \textbf{Group Token Policy
Optimization} (\textbf{GTPO}), we assigns a entropy-weighted reward to each
token for fine-grained credit assignment. 2) \textbf{Sequence-Level Group
Relative Policy Optimization} (\textbf{GRPO-S}), we assigns a entropy-weighted
reward to each sequence based on its average token entropy. Experiments show
our methods significantly outperform the strong DAPO baseline. The results
confirm that our entropy-weighting mechanism is the key driver of this
performance boost, offering a better path to enhance deep reasoning in models.

*Nima Iji,Kia Dashtipour*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Chain of Questions (CoQ) framework to enhance reasoning in multimodal LLMs by dynamically generating questions to guide modality selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reasoning improvements in LLMs haven't fully extended to multimodal contexts, where models must decide which sensory modalities to use in complex environments.

Method: The CoQ framework encourages models to generate targeted questions about their surroundings, activating relevant modalities for better reasoning.

Result: Evaluated on a multimodal benchmark, CoQ improves model accuracy, interpretability, and alignment with diverse tasks.

Conclusion: CoQ enhances multimodal reasoning by dynamically guiding modality selection through curiosity-driven questioning.

Abstract: Reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs) have substantially
advanced through methods such as chain-of-thought and explicit step-by-step
explanations. However, these improvements have not yet fully transitioned to
multimodal contexts, where models must proactively decide which sensory
modalities such as vision, audio, or spatial perception to engage when
interacting with complex real-world environments. In this paper, we introduce
the Chain of Questions (CoQ) framework, a curiosity-driven reasoning approach
that encourages multimodal language models to dynamically generate targeted
questions regarding their surroundings. These generated questions guide the
model to selectively activate relevant modalities, thereby gathering critical
information necessary for accurate reasoning and response generation. We
evaluate our framework on a novel multimodal benchmark dataset, assembled by
integrating WebGPT, ScienceQA, AVSD, and ScanQA datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that our CoQ method improves a foundation model's ability to
effectively identify and integrate pertinent sensory information. This leads to
improved accuracy, interpretability, and alignment of the reasoning process
with diverse multimodal tasks.

TL;DR: A fact-checking pipeline won FEVER 8, using a two-step RAG method, achieving top performance with limited hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve fact-checking efficiency and accuracy, even under resource constraints.

### [210] [Improving Crash Data Quality with Large Language Models: Evidence from Secondary Crash Narratives in Kentucky](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04399)
*Xu Zhang,Mei Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study compares NLP techniques (zero-shot LLMs, fine-tuned transformers, and logistic regression) for enhancing crash data quality, finding fine-tuned transformers like RoBERTa most effective (F1:0.90). LLMs showed high recall but high computational costs, while mid-sized LLMs offered a balance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve crash data quality by leveraging NLP techniques for mining crash narratives, focusing on secondary crash identification.

Method: Evaluated three model classes: zero-shot LLMs, fine-tuned transformers, and logistic regression, using 16,656 manually reviewed narratives (2015-2022). Models were tested on 2022 data.

Result: Fine-tuned transformers (RoBERTa) outperformed others (F1:0.90, accuracy:95%). LLMs had high recall but high computational costs. Mid-sized LLMs balanced performance and runtime.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned transformers are optimal for balancing accuracy and efficiency. Practical deployment should consider privacy, ensembles, and scalability for crash-data enhancement.

Abstract: This study evaluates advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to
enhance crash data quality by mining crash narratives, using secondary crash
identification in Kentucky as a case study. Drawing from 16,656 manually
reviewed narratives from 2015-2022, with 3,803 confirmed secondary crashes, we
compare three model classes: zero-shot open-source large language models (LLMs)
(LLaMA3:70B, DeepSeek-R1:70B, Qwen3:32B, Gemma3:27B); fine-tuned transformers
(BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, Longformer); and traditional logistic
regression as baseline. Models were calibrated on 2015-2021 data and tested on
1,771 narratives from 2022. Fine-tuned transformers achieved superior
performance, with RoBERTa yielding the highest F1-score (0.90) and accuracy
(95%). Zero-shot LLaMA3:70B reached a comparable F1 of 0.86 but required 139
minutes of inference; the logistic baseline lagged well behind (F1:0.66). LLMs
excelled in recall for some variants (e.g., GEMMA3:27B at 0.94) but incurred
high computational costs (up to 723 minutes for DeepSeek-R1:70B), while
fine-tuned models processed the test set in seconds after brief training.
Further analysis indicated that mid-sized LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1:32B) can
rival larger counterparts in performance while reducing runtime, suggesting
opportunities for optimized deployments. Results highlight trade-offs between
accuracy, efficiency, and data requirements, with fine-tuned transformer models
balancing precision and recall effectively on Kentucky data. Practical
deployment considerations emphasize privacy-preserving local deployment,
ensemble approaches for improved accuracy, and incremental processing for
scalability, providing a replicable scheme for enhancing crash-data quality
with advanced NLP.

### [211] [Why are LLMs' abilities emergent?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04401)
*VladimÃ­r HavlÃ­k*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores emergent properties in LLMs and DNNs, arguing that their capabilities arise from complex nonlinear dynamics, not just scaling, and compares them to natural emergent phenomena.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the epistemological challenge of 'creation without understanding' in AI, examining how emergent abilities in DNNs differ from symbolic paradigms.

Method: Combines theoretical analysis and empirical observation of scaling laws, grokking, and phase transitions in DNNs.

Result: Emergent abilities stem from complex dynamics of nonlinear systems, not just parameter scaling, resembling natural emergent phenomena.

Conclusion: LLMs and DNNs should be viewed as complex dynamical systems governed by universal emergence principles, shifting focus to internal dynamics.

Abstract: The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generative tasks
has raised fundamental questions about the nature of their acquired
capabilities, which often appear to emerge unexpectedly without explicit
training. This paper examines the emergent properties of Deep Neural Networks
(DNNs) through both theoretical analysis and empirical observation, addressing
the epistemological challenge of "creation without understanding" that
characterises contemporary AI development. We explore how the neural approach's
reliance on nonlinear, stochastic processes fundamentally differs from symbolic
computational paradigms, creating systems whose macro-level behaviours cannot
be analytically derived from micro-level neuron activities. Through analysis of
scaling laws, grokking phenomena, and phase transitions in model capabilities,
I demonstrate that emergent abilities arise from the complex dynamics of highly
sensitive nonlinear systems rather than simply from parameter scaling alone. My
investigation reveals that current debates over metrics, pre-training loss
thresholds, and in-context learning miss the fundamental ontological nature of
emergence in DNNs. I argue that these systems exhibit genuine emergent
properties analogous to those found in other complex natural phenomena, where
systemic capabilities emerge from cooperative interactions among simple
components without being reducible to their individual behaviours. The paper
concludes that understanding LLM capabilities requires recognising DNNs as a
new domain of complex dynamical systems governed by universal principles of
emergence, similar to those operating in physics, chemistry, and biology. This
perspective shifts the focus from purely phenomenological definitions of
emergence to understanding the internal dynamic transformations that enable
these systems to acquire capabilities that transcend their individual
components.

*Kiyotada Mori,Seiya Kawano,Chaoran Liu,Carlos Toshinori Ishi,Angel Fernando Garcia Contreras,Koichiro Yoshino*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores human selective listening to improve ASR evaluation for spoken dialogue systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify ASR capabilities needed for SDSs by studying human selective listening during dialogue response generation.

Method: Experimental comparison of human transcriptions for dialogue responses and reference transcriptions.

Result: Confirmed human selective listening, suggesting a gap between ASR and human transcription abilities.

Conclusion: Proposes a new ASR evaluation method leveraging human selective listening to bridge the gap between ASR and human performance.

Abstract: Spoken dialogue systems (SDSs) utilize automatic speech recognition (ASR) at
the front end of their pipeline. The role of ASR in SDSs is to recognize
information in user speech related to response generation appropriately.
Examining selective listening of humans, which refers to the ability to focus
on and listen to important parts of a conversation during the speech, will
enable us to identify the ASR capabilities required for SDSs and evaluate them.
In this study, we experimentally confirmed selective listening when humans
generate dialogue responses by comparing human transcriptions for generating
dialogue responses and reference transcriptions. Based on our experimental
results, we discuss the possibility of a new ASR evaluation method that
leverages human selective listening, which can identify the gap between
transcription ability between ASR systems and humans.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Prediction Confidence Model (PCM) to reduce user-perceived latency in dialogue systems by estimating semantic similarity between predicted and actual user utterances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To minimize user-perceived latency (UPL) in spoken dialogue systems by predicting user utterances early.

Method: Introduces a PCM to assess semantic similarity between predicted and actual user utterances, determining if prefetching is feasible.

Result: Evaluated based on differences between predicted and actual utterances, showing potential to reduce UPL.

Conclusion: The PCM effectively aids in prefetching dialogue responses by improving prediction accuracy, thereby reducing latency.

Abstract: Prefetching of dialogue responses has been investigated to reduce
user-perceived latency (UPL), which refers to the user's waiting time before
receiving the system's response, in spoken dialogue systems. To reduce the UPL,
it is necessary to predict complete user utterances before the end of the
user's speech, typically by language models, to prepare prefetched dialogue
responses. In this study, we proposed a prediction confidence model (PCM) that
determines whether prefetching is possible or not by estimating the semantic
similarity between the predicted complete user utterance and the complete user
utterance. We evaluated our PCM based on the differences between the predicted
complete user utterance and the complete user utterance.

*Jie Zhu,Huaixia Dou,Junhui Li,Lifan Guo,Feng Chen,Chi Zhang,Fang Kong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Customer Support Conversation (CSC) task, proposing a structured framework and datasets (CSConv and RoleCS) to train customer service agents using LLMs for strategy-aligned responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dialogue datasets lack strategic guidance, and real-world service data is hard to access and annotate.

Method: A structured CSC framework based on COPC guidelines, with conversational stages and strategies, is proposed. Datasets (CSConv and RoleCS) are constructed using LLMs for evaluation and training.

Result: Fine-tuning LLMs on RoleCS improves strategy-aligned responses, with human evaluations confirming better problem resolution.

Conclusion: The CSC framework and datasets enhance customer support training, with publicly available resources for further use.

Abstract: Effective customer support requires not only accurate problem solving but
also structured and empathetic communication aligned with professional
standards. However, existing dialogue datasets often lack strategic guidance,
and real-world service data is difficult to access and annotate. To address
this, we introduce the task of Customer Support Conversation (CSC), aimed at
training customer service agents to respond using well-defined support
strategies. We propose a structured CSC framework grounded in COPC guidelines,
defining five conversational stages and twelve strategies to guide high-quality
interactions. Based on this, we construct CSConv, an evaluation dataset of
1,855 real-world customer-agent conversations rewritten using LLMs to reflect
deliberate strategy use, and annotated accordingly. Additionally, we develop a
role-playing approach that simulates strategy-rich conversations using
LLM-powered roles aligned with the CSC framework, resulting in the training
dataset RoleCS. Experiments show that fine-tuning strong LLMs on RoleCS
significantly improves their ability to generate high-quality, strategy-aligned
responses on CSConv. Human evaluations further confirm gains in problem
resolution. All code and data will be made publicly available at
https://github.com/aliyun/qwen-dianjin.

*Yutong Wu,Di Huang,Ruosi Wan,Yue Peng,Shijie Shang,Chenrui Cao,Lei Qi,Rui Zhang,Zidong Du,Jie Yan,Xing Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Autoformalization improves by combining formal-language mastery and reasoning. ThinkingF pipeline enhances both, achieving SOTA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoformalization methods lack accuracy due to insufficient formal-language knowledge and reasoning capabilities.

Method: Developed ThinkingF pipeline with two datasets: one for formal knowledge, another for reasoning. Used SFT and RLVR for training.

Result: StepFun-Formalizer-32B achieved SOTA BEq@1 scores (40.5% on FormalMATH-Lite, 26.7% on ProverBench).

Conclusion: ThinkingF effectively bridges gaps in autoformalization, outperforming prior models.

Abstract: Autoformalization aims to translate natural-language mathematical statements
into a formal language. While LLMs have accelerated progress in this area,
existing methods still suffer from low accuracy. We identify two key abilities
for effective autoformalization: comprehensive mastery of formal-language
domain knowledge, and reasoning capability of natural language problem
understanding and informal-formal alignment. Without the former, a model cannot
identify the correct formal objects; without the latter, it struggles to
interpret real-world contexts and map them precisely into formal expressions.
To address these gaps, we introduce ThinkingF, a data synthesis and training
pipeline that improves both abilities. First, we construct two datasets: one by
distilling and selecting large-scale examples rich in formal knowledge, and
another by generating informal-to-formal reasoning trajectories guided by
expert-designed templates. We then apply SFT and RLVR with these datasets to
further fuse and refine the two abilities. The resulting 7B and 32B models
exhibit both comprehensive formal knowledge and strong informal-to-formal
reasoning. Notably, StepFun-Formalizer-32B achieves SOTA BEq@1 scores of 40.5%
on FormalMATH-Lite and 26.7% on ProverBench, surpassing all prior
general-purpose and specialized models.

TL;DR: The paper explores scalable educational assessment tools using GenAI for Bahasa Melayu, comparing four MCQ generation pipelines (non-grounded and RAG-based). RAG methods outperform in curriculum alignment and factual validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the need for scalable, high-quality educational tools in Malaysia, especially for low-resource languages like Bahasa Melayu, while tackling challenges of factual accuracy and curriculum alignment.

Method: Four pipelines for generating MCQs: non-grounded prompting (structured/basic) and RAG approaches (LangChain framework/manual). Grounded in curriculum documents and evaluated via STS for alignment and RAG-QA for validity.

Result: RAG-based pipelines outperform non-grounded methods, achieving higher curriculum alignment and factual validity. Trade-offs between ease of implementation (framework-based RAG) and control (manual RAG) are analyzed.

Conclusion: The study provides a validated method for curriculum-specific content generation in low-resource languages, introduces RAG-QA evaluation, and offers insights for EdTech solutions in similar regions.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical need for scalable and high-quality
educational assessment tools within the Malaysian education system. It
highlights the potential of Generative AI (GenAI) while acknowledging the
significant challenges of ensuring factual accuracy and curriculum alignment,
especially for low-resource languages like Bahasa Melayu. This research
introduces and compares four incremental pipelines for generating Form 1
Mathematics multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in Bahasa Melayu using OpenAI's
GPT-4o. The methods range from non-grounded prompting (structured and basic) to
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches (one using the LangChain
framework, one implemented manually). The system is grounded in official
curriculum documents, including teacher-prepared notes and the yearly teaching
plan (RPT). A dual-pronged automated evaluation framework is employed to assess
the generated questions. Curriculum alignment is measured using Semantic
Textual Similarity (STS) against the RPT, while contextual validity is verified
through a novel RAG-based Question-Answering (RAG-QA) method. The results
demonstrate that RAG-based pipelines significantly outperform non-grounded
prompting methods, producing questions with higher curriculum alignment and
factual validity. The study further analyzes the trade-offs between the ease of
implementation of framework-based RAG and the fine-grained control offered by a
manual pipeline. This work presents a validated methodology for generating
curriculum-specific educational content in a low-resource language, introduces
a symbiotic RAG-QA evaluation technique, and provides actionable insights for
the development and deployment of practical EdTech solutions in Malaysia and
similar regions.

*Bastien LiÃ©tard,Gabriel Loiseau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Concept Differentiation, an extension to Word-in-Context, to study inter-word semantic relations, and presents Concept-Aligned Embeddings (CALE) for improved lexical meaning representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods like Word-in-Context are limited to comparing the same lemma, missing broader semantic relations between different words.

Method: Proposes Concept Differentiation, creates a dataset from SemCor, and fine-tunes models (CALE) for context-sensitive lexical representations.

Result: CALE outperforms other models in lexical semantic tasks and improves the spatial organization of embeddings.

Conclusion: CALE provides efficient, multi-purpose lexical representations and enhances embedding organization.

Abstract: Lexical semantics is concerned with both the multiple senses a word can adopt
in different contexts, and the semantic relations that exist between meanings
of different words. To investigate them, Contextualized Language Models are a
valuable tool that provides context-sensitive representations that can be used
to investigate lexical meaning. Recent works like XL-LEXEME have leveraged the
task of Word-in-Context to fine-tune them to get more semantically accurate
representations, but Word-in-Context only compares occurrences of the same
lemma, limiting the range of captured information. In this paper, we propose an
extension, Concept Differentiation, to include inter-words scenarios. We
provide a dataset for this task, derived from SemCor data. Then we fine-tune
several representation models on this dataset. We call these models
Concept-Aligned Embeddings (CALE). By challenging our models and other models
on various lexical semantic tasks, we demonstrate that the proposed models
provide efficient multi-purpose representations of lexical meaning that reach
best performances in our experiments. We also show that CALE's fine-tuning
brings valuable changes to the spatial organization of embeddings.

*Chenglei Shen,Zhongxiang Sun,Teng Shi,Xiao Zhang,Jun Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StyliTruth addresses the trade-off between stylized LLM responses and truthfulness by separating style and truth subspaces, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing representation editing methods degrade truthfulness when imposing styles, termed 'stylization-induced truthfulness collapse.'

Method: StyliTruth uses orthogonal deflation to separate style and truth subspaces, enabling independent control via adaptive token-level steering vectors.

Result: Experiments show StyliTruth reduces truthfulness collapse and balances style adherence with truthfulness better than existing methods.

Conclusion: StyliTruth effectively preserves both stylization and truthfulness in LLM responses.

Abstract: Generating stylized large language model (LLM) responses via representation
editing is a promising way for fine-grained output control. However, there
exists an inherent trade-off: imposing a distinctive style often degrades
truthfulness. Existing representation editing methods, by naively injecting
style signals, overlook this collateral impact and frequently contaminate the
model's core truthfulness representations, resulting in reduced answer
correctness. We term this phenomenon stylization-induced truthfulness collapse.
We attribute this issue to latent coupling between style and truth directions
in certain key attention heads, and propose StyliTruth, a mechanism that
preserves stylization while keeping truthfulness intact. StyliTruth separates
the style-relevant and truth-relevant subspaces in the model's representation
space via an orthogonal deflation process. This decomposition enables
independent control of style and truth in their own subspaces, minimizing
interference. By designing adaptive, token-level steering vectors within each
subspace, we dynamically and precisely control the generation process to
maintain both stylistic fidelity and truthfulness. We validate our method on
multiple styles and languages. Extensive experiments and analyses show that
StyliTruth significantly reduces stylization-induced truthfulness collapse and
outperforms existing inference-time intervention methods in balancing style
adherence with truthfulness.

TL;DR: The paper introduces C-MIND, a clinical dataset for depression assessment, analyzes behavioral signatures, evaluates model performance, and improves LLM reasoning with clinical expertise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of automated depression assessment by providing a clinically validated dataset and improving model effectiveness in real-world settings.

Method: Uses C-MIND dataset with multimodal data (audio, video, transcript, fNIRS) to train classical models, analyze task and modality contributions, and enhance LLM reasoning with clinical guidance.

Result: Clinical expertise improves LLM diagnostic performance by up to 10% in Macro-F1 score.

Conclusion: The study provides a foundation for reliable clinical depression assessment by combining robust data and algorithmic improvements.

Abstract: Depression is a widespread mental disorder that affects millions worldwide.
While automated depression assessment shows promise, most studies rely on
limited or non-clinically validated data, and often prioritize complex model
design over real-world effectiveness. In this paper, we aim to unveil the
landscape of clinical depression assessment. We introduce C-MIND, a clinical
neuropsychiatric multimodal diagnosis dataset collected over two years from
real hospital visits. Each participant completes three structured psychiatric
tasks and receives a final diagnosis from expert clinicians, with informative
audio, video, transcript, and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
signals recorded. Using C-MIND, we first analyze behavioral signatures relevant
to diagnosis. We train a range of classical models to quantify how different
tasks and modalities contribute to diagnostic performance, and dissect the
effectiveness of their combinations. We then explore whether LLMs can perform
psychiatric reasoning like clinicians and identify their clear limitations in
realistic clinical settings. In response, we propose to guide the reasoning
process with clinical expertise and consistently improves LLM diagnostic
performance by up to 10% in Macro-F1 score. We aim to build an infrastructure
for clinical depression assessment from both data and algorithmic perspectives,
enabling C-MIND to facilitate grounded and reliable research for mental
healthcare.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multi-agent discussions outperform solitary ideation in generating research proposals, with cognitive diversity and expertise being key factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if structured multi-agent discussions can enhance creativity in AI-driven scientific ideation, overcoming the limitations of single-agent approaches.

Method: A cooperative multi-agent framework is proposed, testing configurations like group size, leadership structures, and team diversity. Idea quality is assessed via agent-based scoring and human review.

Result: Multi-agent discussions significantly outperform solitary ideation. Leadership and cognitive diversity boost quality, but foundational expertise is essential.

Conclusion: Multi-agent collaboration enhances creative outcomes in AI ideation, with team structure and expertise playing critical roles.

Abstract: While AI agents show potential in scientific ideation, most existing
frameworks rely on single-agent refinement, limiting creativity due to bounded
knowledge and perspective. Inspired by real-world research dynamics, this paper
investigates whether structured multi-agent discussions can surpass solitary
ideation. We propose a cooperative multi-agent framework for generating
research proposals and systematically compare configurations including group
size, leaderled versus leaderless structures, and team compositions varying in
interdisciplinarity and seniority. To assess idea quality, we employ a
comprehensive protocol with agent-based scoring and human review across
dimensions such as novelty, strategic vision, and integration depth. Our
results show that multi-agent discussions substantially outperform solitary
baselines. A designated leader acts as a catalyst, transforming discussion into
more integrated and visionary proposals. Notably, we find that cognitive
diversity is a primary driver of quality, yet expertise is a non-negotiable
prerequisite, as teams lacking a foundation of senior knowledge fail to surpass
even a single competent agent. These findings offer actionable insights for
designing collaborative AI ideation systems and shed light on how team
structure influences creative outcomes.

TL;DR: MASA introduces a framework for structured weight sharing across transformer layers, reducing attention parameters by 66.7% while maintaining performance, applicable to both language and vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational and memory demands of LLMs limit deployment; existing techniques overlook inter-block redundancy.

Method: Decomposes attention projection matrices into shared dictionary atoms, trained with standard optimizers.

Result: Achieves better accuracy and perplexity than baselines, with 66.7% fewer parameters, and extends successfully to Vision Transformers.

Conclusion: MASA provides a scalable, parameter-efficient solution without performance loss, applicable to pretrained models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI applications, yet their
high computational and memory demands hinder their widespread deployment.
Existing compression techniques focus on intra-block optimizations (e.g.
low-rank approximation, attention head pruning), while the repetitive layered
structure of transformers implies significant inter-block redundancy - a
dimension largely unexplored beyond key-value (KV) caching. Inspired by
dictionary learning in CNNs, we propose a framework for structured weight
sharing across transformer layers. Our approach decomposes attention projection
matrices into shared dictionary atoms, reducing the attention module's
parameters by 66.7% while achieving on-par performance. Unlike complex methods
requiring distillation or architectural changes, MASA (Matrix Atom Sharing in
Attention) operates as a drop-in replacement - trained with standard optimizers
- and represents each layer's weights as linear combinations of shared matrix
atoms. Experiments across scales (100M-700M parameters) show that MASA achieves
better benchmark accuracy and perplexity than grouped-query attention (GQA),
low-rank baselines and recently proposed Repeat-all-over/Sequential sharing at
comparable parameter budgets. Ablation studies confirm robustness to the
dictionary size and the efficacy of shared representations in capturing
cross-layer statistical regularities. Extending to Vision Transformers (ViT),
MASA matches performance metrics on image classification and detection tasks
with 66.7% fewer attention parameters. By combining dictionary learning
strategies with transformer efficiency, MASA offers a scalable blueprint for
parameter-efficient models without sacrificing performance. Finally, we
investigate the possibility of employing MASA on pretrained LLMs to reduce
their number of parameters without experiencing any significant drop in their
performance.

Motivation: Traditional RAG struggles with real-time and structured queries, limiting search engines to static content. TURA aims to bridge this gap by integrating dynamic sources like databases and APIs.

Method: TURA uses an Intent-Aware Retrieval module, DAG-based Task Planner, and Distilled Agent Executor to decompose queries, model dependencies, and execute tools efficiently.

Result: TURA successfully combines static RAG with dynamic information, serving millions of users with real-time answers while meeting low-latency demands.

Conclusion: TURA is a pioneering architecture for AI search, systematically addressing the gap between static and dynamic information retrieval.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) is transforming search engines
into conversational AI search products, primarily using Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) on web corpora. However, this paradigm has significant
industrial limitations. Traditional RAG approaches struggle with real-time
needs and structured queries that require accessing dynamically generated
content like ticket availability or inventory. Limited to indexing static
pages, search engines cannot perform the interactive queries needed for such
time-sensitive data. Academic research has focused on optimizing RAG for static
content, overlooking complex intents and the need for dynamic sources like
databases and real-time APIs. To bridge this gap, we introduce TURA
(Tool-Augmented Unified Retrieval Agent for AI Search), a novel three-stage
framework that combines RAG with agentic tool-use to access both static content
and dynamic, real-time information. TURA has three key components: an
Intent-Aware Retrieval module to decompose queries and retrieve information
sources encapsulated as Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers, a DAG-based Task
Planner that models task dependencies as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for
optimal parallel execution, and a lightweight Distilled Agent Executor for
efficient tool calling. TURA is the first architecture to systematically bridge
the gap between static RAG and dynamic information sources for a world-class AI
search product. Serving tens of millions of users, it leverages an agentic
framework to deliver robust, real-time answers while meeting the low-latency
demands of a large-scale industrial system.

*Chirag Seth,Utkarsh Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates T5-Small, BART-Small, and GPT-2 for text-to-SQL translation in low-resource settings, finding T5-Small superior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable non-experts to query databases using natural language, especially in resource-scarce environments.

Method: A reusable pipeline tailored schema formatting for each model, trained on 1000-5000 iterations, and evaluated using LFAcc, BLEU, and EM metrics.

Result: T5-Small achieved the highest LFAcc (27.8%), outperforming BART-Small (23.98%) and GPT-2 (20.1%).

Conclusion: Compact transformers like T5-Small show promise for accessible text-to-SQL solutions, with potential for future enhancements.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL translation enables non-expert users to query relational
databases using natural language, with applications in education and business
intelligence. This study evaluates three lightweight transformer models -
T5-Small, BART-Small, and GPT-2 - on the Spider dataset, focusing on
low-resource settings. We developed a reusable, model-agnostic pipeline that
tailors schema formatting to each model's architecture, training them across
1000 to 5000 iterations and evaluating on 1000 test samples using Logical Form
Accuracy (LFAcc), BLEU, and Exact Match (EM) metrics. Fine-tuned T5-Small
achieves the highest LFAcc (27.8%), outperforming BART-Small (23.98%) and GPT-2
(20.1%), highlighting encoder-decoder models' superiority in schema-aware SQL
generation. Despite resource constraints limiting performance, our pipeline's
modularity supports future enhancements, such as advanced schema linking or
alternative base models. This work underscores the potential of compact
transformers for accessible text-to-SQL solutions in resource-scarce
environments.

### [224] [P-Aligner: Enabling Pre-Alignment of Language Models via Principled Instruction Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04626)
*Feifan Song,Bofei Gao,Yifan Song,Yi Liu,Weimin Xiong,Yuyang Song,Tianyu Liu,Guoyin Wang,Houfeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: P-Aligner, a lightweight module, improves LLM instruction alignment by generating human-preferred instructions, outperforming baselines with significant win-rate gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often fail to align with safe, helpful, and honest values due to flawed instructions, necessitating cost-effective pre-alignment solutions.

Method: P-Aligner, trained on UltraPrompt (a dataset synthesized via principle-guided Monte-Carlo Tree Search), generates improved instructions while preserving intent.

Result: P-Aligner outperforms baselines, achieving 28.35% and 8.69% win-rate gains on GPT-4-turbo and Gemma-2-SimPO, respectively.

Conclusion: P-Aligner is an efficient and effective solution for preference alignment in LLMs, validated by diverse analyses.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are expected to produce safe, helpful, and
honest content during interaction with human users, but they frequently fail to
align with such values when given flawed instructions, e.g., missing context,
ambiguous directives, or inappropriate tone, leaving substantial room for
improvement along multiple dimensions. A cost-effective yet high-impact way is
to pre-align instructions before the model begins decoding. Existing approaches
either rely on prohibitive test-time search costs or end-to-end model rewrite,
which is powered by a customized training corpus with unclear objectives. In
this work, we demonstrate that the goal of efficient and effective preference
alignment can be achieved by P-Aligner, a lightweight module generating
instructions that preserve the original intents while being expressed in a more
human-preferred form. P-Aligner is trained on UltraPrompt, a new dataset
synthesized via a proposed principle-guided pipeline using Monte-Carlo Tree
Search, which systematically explores the space of candidate instructions that
are closely tied to human preference. Experiments across different methods show
that P-Aligner generally outperforms strong baselines across various models and
benchmarks, including average win-rate gains of 28.35% and 8.69% on GPT-4-turbo
and Gemma-2-SimPO, respectively. Further analyses validate its effectiveness
and efficiency through multiple perspectives, including data quality, search
strategies, iterative deployment, and time overhead.

*Xu Guo,Tianyi Liang,Tong Jian,Xiaogui Yang,Ling-I Wu,Chenhui Li,Zhihui Lu,Qipeng Guo,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IFDecorator improves RLVR by addressing training inefficiency and over-optimization via a cooperative-adversarial data flywheel, IntentCheck, and trip wires, achieving high accuracy and reduced reward hacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR suffers from training inefficiency and over-optimization, where LLMs exploit shortcuts instead of aligning with user intent.

Method: IFDecorator includes a cooperative-adversarial data flywheel, IntentCheck for intent alignment, and trip wires to detect reward hacking.

Result: Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-IFDecorator achieves 87.43% accuracy on IFEval, outperforming GPT-4o, and reduces reward hacking rates.

Conclusion: IFDecorator enhances RLVR's robustness and efficiency, with potential for future research through released models, code, and data.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) improves instruction
following capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but suffers from
training inefficiency due to inadequate difficulty assessment. Moreover, RLVR
is prone to over-optimization, where LLMs exploit verification shortcuts
without aligning to the actual intent of user instructions. We introduce
Instruction Following Decorator (IFDecorator}, a framework that wraps RLVR
training into a robust and sample-efficient pipeline. It consists of three
components: (1) a cooperative-adversarial data flywheel that co-evolves
instructions and hybrid verifications, generating progressively more
challenging instruction-verification pairs; (2) IntentCheck, a bypass module
enforcing intent alignment; and (3) trip wires, a diagnostic mechanism that
detects reward hacking via trap instructions, which trigger and capture
shortcut exploitation behaviors. Our Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-IFDecorator achieves
87.43% accuracy on IFEval, outperforming larger proprietary models such as
GPT-4o. Additionally, we demonstrate substantial improvements on FollowBench
while preserving general capabilities. Our trip wires show significant
reductions in reward hacking rates. We will release models, code, and data for
future research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper reviews 74 NLP studies on counterspeech, highlighting a shift from stakeholder collaboration to automated pipelines, and emphasizes the need for stakeholder involvement in dataset creation, model development, and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the impact of stakeholder participation in NLP counterspeech research and address the disconnect between research and community needs.

Method: Conducted a systematic review of 74 NLP studies and a participatory case study with five NGOs specializing in online Gender-Based Violence (oGBV).

Result: Found a growing gap between NLP research and affected communities, with stakeholder-informed practices being undervalued.

Conclusion: Recommends re-centering stakeholder expertise in counterspeech research to better address real-world needs.

Abstract: Counterspeech, i.e. the practice of responding to online hate speech, has
gained traction in NLP as a promising intervention. While early work emphasised
collaboration with non-governmental organisation stakeholders, recent research
trends have shifted toward automated pipelines that reuse a small set of legacy
datasets, often without input from affected communities. This paper presents a
systematic review of 74 NLP studies on counterspeech, analysing the extent to
which stakeholder participation influences dataset creation, model development,
and evaluation. To complement this analysis, we conducted a participatory case
study with five NGOs specialising in online Gender-Based Violence (oGBV),
identifying stakeholder-informed practices for counterspeech generation. Our
findings reveal a growing disconnect between current NLP research and the needs
of communities most impacted by toxic online content. We conclude with concrete
recommendations for re-centring stakeholder expertise in counterspeech
research.

TL;DR: mmGRPO extends GRPO for multi-module AI systems, improving accuracy by 11% over post-trained LMs and 5% over prompt optimization alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems now use modular programs with multiple LM calls, but GRPO's effectiveness in such setups is unclear.

Method: Defined mmGRPO, a multi-module GRPO variant handling grouped LM calls and variable trajectories.

Result: mmGRPO boosts accuracy by 11% on tasks like classification and search, outperforming standalone prompt optimization by 5%.

Conclusion: mmGRPO, integrated into DSPy as dspy.GRPO, effectively enhances modular AI systems.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has proven to be an effective tool
for post-training language models (LMs). However, AI systems are increasingly
expressed as modular programs that mix together multiple LM calls with distinct
prompt templates and other tools, and it is not clear how best to leverage GRPO
to improve these systems. We begin to address this challenge by defining
mmGRPO, a simple multi-module generalization of GRPO that groups LM calls by
module across rollouts and handles variable-length and interrupted
trajectories. We find that mmGRPO, composed with automatic prompt optimization,
improves accuracy by 11% on average across classification, many-hop search, and
privacy-preserving delegation tasks against the post-trained LM, and by 5%
against prompt optimization on its own. We open-source mmGRPO in DSPy as the
dspy.GRPO optimizer.

*Mo Li,L. H. Xu,Qitai Tan,Ting Cao,Yunxin Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Sculptor, a framework for Active Context Management (ACM), improves LLMs' performance in long-context tasks by enabling tools like context fragmentation, summarization, and intelligent search, mitigating proactive interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with long contexts due to proactive interference, where irrelevant early information disrupts reasoning. Current solutions focus on external memory, but internal context management is underexplored.

Method: Introduces Sculptor, a framework with three tools: (1) context fragmentation, (2) summary/hide/restore, and (3) intelligent search, allowing LLMs to manage attention and working memory actively.

Result: Sculptor significantly improves performance on benchmarks like PI-LLM and NeedleBench Multi-Needle Reasoning, even without specific training, by leveraging LLMs' tool-calling generalization.

Conclusion: Active Context Management (ACM) is key to robust long-context reasoning, highlighting the need for explicit context-control strategies over larger token windows.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from significant performance degradation
when processing long contexts due to proactive interference, where irrelevant
information in earlier parts of the context disrupts reasoning and memory
recall. While most research focuses on external memory systems to augment LLMs'
capabilities, we propose a complementary approach: empowering LLMs with Active
Context Management (ACM) tools to actively sculpt their internal working
memory. We introduce Sculptor, a framework that equips LLMs with three
categories of tools: (1) context fragmentation, (2) summary, hide, and restore,
and (3) intelligent search. Our approach enables LLMs to proactively manage
their attention and working memory, analogous to how humans selectively focus
on relevant information while filtering out distractions. Experimental
evaluation on information-sparse benchmarks-PI-LLM (proactive interference) and
NeedleBench Multi-Needle Reasoning-demonstrates that Sculptor significantly
improves performance even without specific training, leveraging LLMs' inherent
tool calling generalization capabilities. By enabling Active Context
Management, Sculptor not only mitigates proactive interference but also
provides a cognitive foundation for more reliable reasoning across diverse
long-context tasks-highlighting that explicit context-control strategies,
rather than merely larger token windows, are key to robustness at scale.

*Yunan Zhang,Shuoran Jiang,Mengchen Zhao,Yuefeng Li,Yang Fan,Xiangping Wu,Qingcai Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes General Sample Replay (GeRe) to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in continual learning for LLMs, using pretraining texts and an enhanced activation states optimization method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address catastrophic forgetting in continual fine-tuning of LLMs, which harms general capabilities and task performance.

Method: Introduces GeRe with a threshold-based margin (TM) loss to maintain activation state consistency during replay learning.

Result: A small set of general replay samples resolves forgetting and boosts performance; TM outperforms other replay strategies.

Conclusion: GeRe with TM loss is effective and robust for continual learning in LLMs, paving the way for efficient replay methods.

Abstract: The continual learning capability of large language models (LLMs) is crucial
for advancing artificial general intelligence. However, continual fine-tuning
LLMs across various domains often suffers from catastrophic forgetting,
characterized by: 1) significant forgetting of their general capabilities, and
2) sharp performance declines in previously learned tasks. To simultaneously
address both issues in a simple yet stable manner, we propose General Sample
Replay (GeRe), a framework that use usual pretraining texts for efficient
anti-forgetting. Beyond revisiting the most prevalent replay-based practices
under GeRe, we further leverage neural states to introduce a enhanced
activation states constrained optimization method using threshold-based margin
(TM) loss, which maintains activation state consistency during replay learning.
We are the first to validate that a small, fixed set of pre-collected general
replay samples is sufficient to resolve both concerns--retaining general
capabilities while promoting overall performance across sequential tasks.
Indeed, the former can inherently facilitate the latter. Through controlled
experiments, we systematically compare TM with different replay strategies
under the GeRe framework, including vanilla label fitting, logit imitation via
KL divergence and feature imitation via L1/L2 losses. Results demonstrate that
TM consistently improves performance and exhibits better robustness. Our work
paves the way for efficient replay of LLMs for the future. Our code and data
are available at https://github.com/Qznan/GeRe.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of personalizing LLM-powered conversational assistants with limited user preference data (PPALLI), introduces two datasets (DnD and ELIP), benchmarks alignment techniques, and proposes FaST, a parameter-efficient method with superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-powered assistants lack personalization, failing to meet individual user preferences. The study aims to tackle this gap by focusing on scenarios with limited user preference data.

Method: The work introduces two datasets (DnD and ELIP) for benchmarking alignment techniques. It proposes FaST, a parameter-efficient method leveraging high-level data features.

Result: FaST achieves the best overall performance among the benchmarked alignment techniques.

Conclusion: The study advances LLM personalization by addressing PPALLI, providing datasets, and introducing FaST, a high-performing, efficient solution.

Abstract: LLM-powered conversational assistants are often deployed in a
one-size-fits-all manner, which fails to accommodate individual user
preferences. Recently, LLM personalization -- tailoring models to align with
specific user preferences -- has gained increasing attention as a way to bridge
this gap. In this work, we specifically focus on a practical yet challenging
setting where only a small set of preference annotations can be collected per
user -- a problem we define as Personalized Preference Alignment with Limited
Data (PPALLI). To support research in this area, we introduce two datasets --
DnD and ELIP -- and benchmark a variety of alignment techniques on them. We
further propose FaST, a highly parameter-efficient approach that leverages
high-level features automatically discovered from the data, achieving the best
overall performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the cognitive limitations and reasoning failures of contemporary language models, particularly in multi-hop question answering tasks.

Method: The study uses a novel error categorization framework analyzing diversity of source documents, information coverage, and cognitive inefficiency. Human annotation and automated metrics are employed.

Result: The research uncovers intricate error patterns often missed by accuracy-focused evaluations, providing deeper insights into model limitations.

Conclusion: The findings offer actionable guidance for improving reasoning fidelity, transparency, and robustness in future language models.

Abstract: The emergence of reasoning models and their integration into practical AI
chat bots has led to breakthroughs in solving advanced math, deep search, and
extractive question answering problems that requires a complex and multi-step
thought process. Yet, a complete understanding of why these models hallucinate
more than general purpose language models is missing. In this investigative
study, we systematicallyexplore reasoning failures of contemporary language
models on multi-hop question answering tasks. We introduce a novel, nuanced
error categorization framework that examines failures across three critical
dimensions: the diversity and uniqueness of source documents involved ("hops"),
completeness in capturing relevant information ("coverage"), and cognitive
inefficiency ("overthinking"). Through rigorous hu-man annotation, supported by
complementary automated metrics, our exploration uncovers intricate error
patterns often hidden by accuracy-centric evaluations. This investigative
approach provides deeper insights into the cognitive limitations of current
models and offers actionable guidance toward enhancing reasoning fidelity,
transparency, and robustness in future language modeling efforts.

TL;DR: PriCon framework combines supervised contrastive learning and LUPI to improve affective model transfer from lab to real-world settings, outperforming other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of transferring affective models from controlled lab environments to uncontrolled real-world settings.

Method: Introduces Privileged Contrastive Pretraining (PriCon), using supervised contrastive learning (SCL) and Learning Using Privileged Information (LUPI).

Result: PriCon models outperform LUPI and end-to-end models, achieving performance close to models with full modality access.

Conclusion: PriCon bridges the gap between lab and real-world affective modeling, offering a scalable solution for practical applications.

Abstract: Affective Computing (AC) has made significant progress with the advent of
deep learning, yet a persistent challenge remains: the reliable transfer of
affective models from controlled laboratory settings (in-vitro) to uncontrolled
real-world environments (in-vivo). To address this challenge we introduce the
Privileged Contrastive Pretraining (PriCon) framework according to which models
are first pretrained via supervised contrastive learning (SCL) and then act as
teacher models within a Learning Using Privileged Information (LUPI) framework.
PriCon both leverages privileged information during training and enhances the
robustness of derived affect models via SCL. Experiments conducted on two
benchmark affective corpora, RECOLA and AGAIN, demonstrate that models trained
using PriCon consistently outperform LUPI and end to end models. Remarkably, in
many cases, PriCon models achieve performance comparable to models trained with
access to all modalities during both training and testing. The findings
underscore the potential of PriCon as a paradigm towards further bridging the
gap between in-vitro and in-vivo affective modelling, offering a scalable and
practical solution for real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing line simplification methods for trajectory compression are limited to 2D and ignore time synchronization and motion continuity.

Method: PILOT-C integrates frequency-domain physics modeling with error-bounded optimization, compressing each spatial axis independently for arbitrary dimensions.

Result: PILOT-C outperforms CISED-W by 19.2% in compression ratio and reduces error by 32.6%. It also improves 3D compression ratios by 49% over SQUISH-E.

Conclusion: PILOT-C is a versatile and efficient trajectory compression framework, excelling in both 2D and 3D scenarios.

Abstract: Location-aware devices continuously generate massive volumes of trajectory
data, creating demand for efficient compression. Line simplification is a
common solution but typically assumes 2D trajectories and ignores time
synchronization and motion continuity. We propose PILOT-C, a novel trajectory
compression framework that integrates frequency-domain physics modeling with
error-bounded optimization. Unlike existing line simplification methods,
PILOT-C supports trajectories in arbitrary dimensions, including 3D, by
compressing each spatial axis independently. Evaluated on four real-world
datasets, PILOT-C achieves superior performance across multiple dimensions. In
terms of compression ratio, PILOT-C outperforms CISED-W, the current
state-of-the-art SED-based line simplification algorithm, by an average of
19.2%. For trajectory fidelity, PILOT-C achieves an average of 32.6% reduction
in error compared to CISED-W. Additionally, PILOT-C seamlessly extends to
three-dimensional trajectories while maintaining the same computational
complexity, achieving a 49% improvement in compression ratios over SQUISH-E,

TL;DR: CX-Mind is a generative model for CXR diagnosis using interleaved reasoning and curriculum-based reinforcement learning, outperforming existing models by 25.1%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal models lack verifiable reasoning supervision, leading to inefficiencies in multi-task CXR diagnosis.

Method: CX-Mind uses curriculum-based reinforcement learning (CuRL-VPR) and a dataset (CX-Set) for instruction-tuning, optimizing reasoning in two stages.

Result: CX-Mind achieves a 25.1% performance improvement over comparable models and excels in real-world clinical evaluations.

Conclusion: CX-Mind enhances diagnostic accuracy and interpretability in CXR tasks, validated by expert evaluations.

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is one of the most widely used diagnostic
modalities in clinical practice, encompassing a broad spectrum of diagnostic
tasks. Recent advancements have seen the extensive application of
reasoning-based multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in medical imaging to
enhance diagnostic efficiency and interpretability. However, existing
multimodal models predominantly rely on "one-time" diagnostic approaches,
lacking verifiable supervision of the reasoning process. This leads to
challenges in multi-task CXR diagnosis, including lengthy reasoning, sparse
rewards, and frequent hallucinations. To address these issues, we propose
CX-Mind, the first generative model to achieve interleaved "think-answer"
reasoning for CXR tasks, driven by curriculum-based reinforcement learning and
verifiable process rewards (CuRL-VPR). Specifically, we constructed an
instruction-tuning dataset, CX-Set, comprising 708,473 images and 2,619,148
samples, and generated 42,828 high-quality interleaved reasoning data points
supervised by clinical reports. Optimization was conducted in two stages under
the Group Relative Policy Optimization framework: initially stabilizing basic
reasoning with closed-domain tasks, followed by transfer to open-domain
diagnostics, incorporating rule-based conditional process rewards to bypass the
need for pretrained reward models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that CX-Mind significantly outperforms existing medical and general-domain
MLLMs in visual understanding, text generation, and spatiotemporal alignment,
achieving an average performance improvement of 25.1% over comparable
CXR-specific models. On real-world clinical dataset (Rui-CXR), CX-Mind achieves
a mean recall@1 across 14 diseases that substantially surpasses the second-best
results, with multi-center expert evaluations further confirming its clinical
utility across multiple dimensions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Latent Knowledge Scalpel (LKS), a method for editing large-scale factual information in LLMs without compromising their general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs retain outdated or inaccurate information, and existing editing methods struggle with large-scale edits while maintaining model performance.

Method: LKS manipulates latent knowledge via a lightweight hypernetwork to edit internal representations of LLMs, similar to editing natural language inputs.

Result: Experiments on Llama-2 and Mistral show LKS effectively edits up to 10,000 facts simultaneously while preserving model capabilities.

Conclusion: LKS enables precise, large-scale knowledge editing in LLMs, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often retain inaccurate or outdated information
from pre-training, leading to incorrect predictions or biased outputs during
inference. While existing model editing methods can address this challenge,
they struggle with editing large amounts of factual information simultaneously
and may compromise the general capabilities of the models. In this paper, our
empirical study demonstrates that it is feasible to edit the internal
representations of LLMs and replace the entities in a manner similar to editing
natural language inputs. Based on this insight, we introduce the Latent
Knowledge Scalpel (LKS), an LLM editor that manipulates the latent knowledge of
specific entities via a lightweight hypernetwork to enable precise and
large-scale editing. Experiments conducted on Llama-2 and Mistral show even
with the number of simultaneous edits reaching 10,000, LKS effectively performs
knowledge editing while preserving the general abilities of the edited LLMs.

TL;DR: GlaBoost is a multimodal gradient boosting framework for glaucoma risk prediction, integrating clinical features, fundus images, and textual descriptions, achieving high accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early and accurate glaucoma detection is crucial to prevent vision loss, but existing methods lack interpretability and rely on unimodal data.

Method: GlaBoost combines structured clinical features, fundus image embeddings, and expert-curated text using a pretrained CNN and transformer model, fused via enhanced XGBoost.

Result: GlaBoost achieves 98.71% validation accuracy, outperforming baselines, with feature importance aligning with clinical knowledge.

Conclusion: GlaBoost provides a transparent, scalable solution for glaucoma diagnosis, extendable to other ophthalmic disorders.

Abstract: Early and accurate detection of glaucoma is critical to prevent irreversible
vision loss. However, existing methods often rely on unimodal data and lack
interpretability, limiting their clinical utility. In this paper, we present
GlaBoost, a multimodal gradient boosting framework that integrates structured
clinical features, fundus image embeddings, and expert-curated textual
descriptions for glaucoma risk prediction. GlaBoost extracts high-level visual
representations from retinal fundus photographs using a pretrained
convolutional encoder and encodes free-text neuroretinal rim assessments using
a transformer-based language model. These heterogeneous signals, combined with
manually assessed risk scores and quantitative ophthalmic indicators, are fused
into a unified feature space for classification via an enhanced XGBoost model.
Experiments conducted on a real-world annotated dataset demonstrate that
GlaBoost significantly outperforms baseline models, achieving a validation
accuracy of 98.71%. Feature importance analysis reveals clinically consistent
patterns, with cup-to-disc ratio, rim pallor, and specific textual embeddings
contributing most to model decisions. GlaBoost offers a transparent and
scalable solution for interpretable glaucoma diagnosis and can be extended to
other ophthalmic disorders.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel Low-Rank Tucker Representation (LRTuckerRep) model unifies global and local priors for multi-dimensional data completion, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations of low-rank and smoothness-based methods in computational sciences, such as high computational cost and poor generalization.

Method: LRTuckerRep combines low-rank Tucker decomposition with self-adaptive weighted nuclear norm and parameter-free Laplacian-based regularization. Two iterative algorithms solve the nonconvex optimization problem.

Result: Superior completion accuracy and robustness in image inpainting and traffic data imputation, especially under high missing rates.

Conclusion: LRTuckerRep effectively unifies global and local priors, offering a scalable and efficient solution for multi-dimensional data completion.

Abstract: Multi-dimensional data completion is a critical problem in computational
sciences, particularly in domains such as computer vision, signal processing,
and scientific computing. Existing methods typically leverage either global
low-rank approximations or local smoothness regularization, but each suffers
from notable limitations: low-rank methods are computationally expensive and
may disrupt intrinsic data structures, while smoothness-based approaches often
require extensive manual parameter tuning and exhibit poor generalization. In
this paper, we propose a novel Low-Rank Tucker Representation (LRTuckerRep)
model that unifies global and local prior modeling within a Tucker
decomposition. Specifically, LRTuckerRep encodes low rankness through a
self-adaptive weighted nuclear norm on the factor matrices and a sparse Tucker
core, while capturing smoothness via a parameter-free Laplacian-based
regularization on the factor spaces. To efficiently solve the resulting
nonconvex optimization problem, we develop two iterative algorithms with
provable convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments on multi-dimensional
image inpainting and traffic data imputation demonstrate that LRTuckerRep
achieves superior completion accuracy and robustness under high missing rates
compared to baselines.

*Yongchao Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework called LLMPrior automates prior distribution specification in Bayesian inference using LLMs, ensuring mathematical validity and scalability, and extends to multi-agent systems with Fed-LLMPrior for robust aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual prior elicitation in Bayesian inference is subjective and unscalable, creating a bottleneck.

Method: LLMPrior couples LLMs with tractable generative models (e.g., Gaussian Mixture Models) to translate unstructured contexts into valid priors. Fed-LLMPrior aggregates decentralized priors using Logarithmic Opinion Pooling.

Result: The framework produces valid, tractable priors and robustly aggregates them in multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: This work lowers the barrier to sophisticated Bayesian modeling by automating and scaling prior specification.

Abstract: The specification of prior distributions is fundamental in Bayesian
inference, yet it remains a significant bottleneck. The prior elicitation
process is often a manual, subjective, and unscalable task. We propose a novel
framework which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and scale
this process. We introduce \texttt{LLMPrior}, a principled operator that
translates rich, unstructured contexts such as natural language descriptions,
data or figures into valid, tractable probability distributions. We formalize
this operator by architecturally coupling an LLM with an explicit, tractable
generative model, such as a Gaussian Mixture Model (forming a LLM based Mixture
Density Network), ensuring the resulting prior satisfies essential mathematical
properties. We further extend this framework to multi-agent systems where
Logarithmic Opinion Pooling is employed to aggregate prior distributions
induced by decentralized knowledge. We present the federated prior aggregation
algorithm, \texttt{Fed-LLMPrior}, for aggregating distributed,
context-dependent priors in a manner robust to agent heterogeneity. This work
provides the foundation for a new class of tools that can potentially lower the
barrier to entry for sophisticated Bayesian modeling.

*Debamita Ghosh,George K. Atia,Yue Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the sim-to-real gap in RL by proposing an online distributionally robust RL algorithm for unknown environments, ensuring worst-case performance with minimal assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world RL deployments suffer from the sim-to-real gap, where policies trained in simulators underperform due to mismatches in conditions. Existing methods rely on impractical assumptions like generative models or broad offline datasets.

Method: The study introduces an online distributionally robust RL algorithm for unknown environments, focusing on $f$-divergence-based uncertainty sets (e.g., Chi-Square, KL divergence). It guarantees sublinear regret and computational efficiency.

Result: The algorithm achieves near-optimal regret, validated by extensive experiments across diverse environments, confirming its robustness and efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively bridges the sim-to-real gap in RL for unknown environments, offering a practical and theoretically sound solution.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) faces significant challenges in real-world
deployments due to the sim-to-real gap, where policies trained in simulators
often underperform in practice due to mismatches between training and
deployment conditions. Distributionally robust RL addresses this issue by
optimizing worst-case performance over an uncertainty set of environments and
providing an optimized lower bound on deployment performance. However, existing
studies typically assume access to either a generative model or offline
datasets with broad coverage of the deployment environment -- assumptions that
limit their practicality in unknown environments without prior knowledge. In
this work, we study the more realistic and challenging setting of online
distributionally robust RL, where the agent interacts only with a single
unknown training environment while aiming to optimize its worst-case
performance. We focus on general $f$-divergence-based uncertainty sets,
including Chi-Square and KL divergence balls, and propose a computationally
efficient algorithm with sublinear regret guarantees under minimal assumptions.
Furthermore, we establish a minimax lower bound on regret of online learning,
demonstrating the near-optimality of our approach. Extensive experiments across
diverse environments further confirm the robustness and efficiency of our
algorithm, validating our theoretical findings.

*Marco Simoni,Aleksandar Fontana,Giulio Rossolini,Andrea Saracino*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GTPO addresses GRPO's limitations by protecting conflict tokens and preventing policy collapse, improving stability and performance without KL-divergence regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO has issues with conflicting gradient updates and policy collapse, degrading model performance.

Method: GTPO identifies conflict tokens, skips negative updates, amplifies positive ones, and filters high-entropy completions.

Result: GTPO outperforms GRPO on benchmarks like GSM8K, MATH, and AIME 2024, with greater stability.

Conclusion: GTPO provides a more effective and stable policy optimization strategy than GRPO.

Abstract: Policy-based optimizations are widely adopted today for the training and
alignment of language models, where one of the most recent and effective
approaches is Group-relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this paper, we
reveals and analyze two major limitations of GRPO: (i) tokens frequently appear
in completions with both positive and negative rewards, leading to conflicting
gradient updates that can reduce their output probability, even though can be
essential for maintaining proper structure; (ii) negatively rewarded
completions may penalize confident responses and shift model decisions toward
unlikely tokens, progressively flattening the output distribution and degrading
learning. To address these issues and provide a more stable and effective
policy optimization strategy, we introduce GTPO (Group-relative
Trajectory-based Policy Optimization), which identifies conflict tokens, tokens
appearing in the same position across completions with opposite rewards,
protects them by skipping negative updates, while amplifying positive ones. To
further prevent policy collapse, GTPO filters out completions whose entropy
exceeds a provable threshold. Unlike GRPO, GTPO does not rely on KL-divergence
regularization, eliminating the need for a reference model during training,
while still ensuring greater training stability and improved performance,
validated through multiple experiments on GSM8K, MATH and AIME 2024 benchmarks.

*Rui Zhu,Yuexing Peng,Peng Wang,George C. Alexandropoulos,Wenbo Wang,Wei Xiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces U-PINet, a physics-informed deep learning framework for efficient and accurate electromagnetic scattering modeling, combining computational efficiency with physical consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional EM solvers are computationally expensive, while pure data-driven deep learning lacks physical constraints and requires extensive labeled data. U-PINet aims to bridge these gaps.

Method: U-PINet uses a hierarchical, physics-informed neural network architecture to model near- and far-field interactions and employs sparse graph representations for efficient coupling among 3D mesh elements.

Result: U-PINet accurately predicts surface currents, matches traditional solver accuracy, reduces computational time, and outperforms conventional deep learning methods in accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: U-PINet is a viable solution for EM scattering modeling, offering improved efficiency, generalization, and physical consistency for downstream applications like radar cross-section prediction.

Abstract: Electromagnetic (EM) scattering modeling is critical for radar remote
sensing, however, its inherent complexity introduces significant computational
challenges. Traditional numerical solvers offer high accuracy, but suffer from
scalability issues and substantial computational costs. Pure data-driven deep
learning approaches, while efficient, lack physical constraints embedding
during training and require extensive labeled data, limiting their
applicability and generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
U-shaped Physics-Informed Network (U-PINet), the first fully
deep-learning-based, physics-informed hierarchical framework for computational
EM designed to ensure physical consistency while maximizing computational
efficiency. Motivated by the hierarchical decomposition strategy in EM solvers
and the inherent sparsity of local EM coupling, the U-PINet models the
decomposition and coupling of near- and far-field interactions through a
multiscale processing neural network architecture, while employing a
physics-inspired sparse graph representation to efficiently model both self-
and mutual- coupling among mesh elements of complex $3$-Dimensional (3D)
objects. This principled approach enables end-to-end multiscale EM scattering
modeling with improved efficiency, generalization, and physical consistency.
Experimental results showcase that the U-PINet accurately predicts surface
current distributions, achieving close agreement with traditional solver, while
significantly reducing computational time and outperforming conventional deep
learning baselines in both accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, our
evaluations on radar cross section prediction tasks confirm the feasibility of
the U-PINet for downstream EM scattering applications.

*Xiao Wang,Zikang Yan,Hao Si,Zhendong Yang,Qingquan Yang,Dengdi Sun,Wanli Lyu,Jin Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) is proposed to estimate heat flux in EAST, outperforming traditional FEM in speed while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional FEM is inefficient for real-time heat flux estimation in nuclear fusion devices like EAST.

Method: A PINN is used, incorporating spatial coordinates, time stamps, and losses based on the heat conduction equation, with additional data-driven sampling.

Result: The PINN matches FEM accuracy and achieves 40x speedup in computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The PINN offers a faster, accurate alternative to FEM for heat flux estimation in fusion devices.

Abstract: Estimating heat flux in the nuclear fusion device EAST is a critically
important task. Traditional scientific computing methods typically model this
process using the Finite Element Method (FEM). However, FEM relies on
grid-based sampling for computation, which is computationally inefficient and
hard to perform real-time simulations during actual experiments. Inspired by
artificial intelligence-powered scientific computing, this paper proposes a
novel Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to address this challenge,
significantly accelerating the heat conduction estimation process while
maintaining high accuracy. Specifically, given inputs of different materials,
we first feed spatial coordinates and time stamps into the neural network, and
compute boundary loss, initial condition loss, and physical loss based on the
heat conduction equation. Additionally, we sample a small number of data points
in a data-driven manner to better fit the specific heat conduction scenario,
further enhancing the model's predictive capability. We conduct experiments
under both uniform and non-uniform heating conditions on the top surface.
Experimental results show that the proposed thermal conduction physics-informed
neural network achieves accuracy comparable to the finite element method, while
achieving $\times$40 times acceleration in computational efficiency. The
dataset and source code will be released on

### [243] [SoilNet: A Multimodal Multitask Model for Hierarchical Classification of Soil Horizons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03785)
*Teodor Chiaburu,Vipin Singh,Frank HauÃer,Felix BieÃmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SoilNet is a multimodal multitask model for soil horizon classification, integrating image data and geotemporal metadata to address hierarchical label taxonomy challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soil horizon classification is crucial for soil health monitoring, impacting agriculture, food security, and climate resilience, but remains challenging due to its multimodal, multitask nature and hierarchical label structure.

Method: SoilNet uses a modular pipeline: predicts depth markers, segments soil profiles, extracts horizon-specific features, and predicts labels using a graph-based representation for hierarchical relationships.

Result: The method effectively handles large, imbalanced, and hierarchically structured labels, demonstrated on a real-world soil profile dataset.

Conclusion: SoilNet provides a robust solution for complex hierarchical soil horizon classification, with code and experiments publicly available.

Abstract: While recent advances in foundation models have improved the state of the art
in many domains, some problems in empirical sciences could not benefit from
this progress yet. Soil horizon classification, for instance, remains
challenging because of its multimodal and multitask characteristics and a
complex hierarchically structured label taxonomy. Accurate classification of
soil horizons is crucial for monitoring soil health, which directly impacts
agricultural productivity, food security, ecosystem stability and climate
resilience. In this work, we propose $\textit{SoilNet}$ - a multimodal
multitask model to tackle this problem through a structured modularized
pipeline. Our approach integrates image data and geotemporal metadata to first
predict depth markers, segmenting the soil profile into horizon candidates.
Each segment is characterized by a set of horizon-specific morphological
features. Finally, horizon labels are predicted based on the multimodal
concatenated feature vector, leveraging a graph-based label representation to
account for the complex hierarchical relationships among soil horizons. Our
method is designed to address complex hierarchical classification, where the
number of possible labels is very large, imbalanced and non-trivially
structured. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a real-world
soil profile dataset. All code and experiments can be found in our repository:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bernoulli-LoRA, a theoretical framework unifying and extending existing LoRA methods for parameter-efficient fine-tuning, with probabilistic matrix updates and convergence guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited theoretical understanding of LoRA methods in PEFT and provide a unified, theoretically tractable framework.

Method: Introduces Bernoulli-LoRA, a probabilistic mechanism for matrix updates, analyzed under non-convex optimization assumptions with variants like Bernoulli-LoRA-GD, SGD, etc.

Result: Convergence guarantees for multiple variants and extensions to convex non-smooth functions, validated through experiments.

Conclusion: Bernoulli-LoRA advances theoretical grounding of PEFT methods while maintaining practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a crucial approach for
adapting large foundational models to specific tasks, particularly as model
sizes continue to grow exponentially. Among PEFT methods, Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) (arXiv:2106.09685) stands out for its effectiveness and simplicity,
expressing adaptations as a product of two low-rank matrices. While extensive
empirical studies demonstrate LoRA's practical utility, theoretical
understanding of such methods remains limited. Recent work on RAC-LoRA
(arXiv:2410.08305) took initial steps toward rigorous analysis. In this work,
we introduce Bernoulli-LoRA, a novel theoretical framework that unifies and
extends existing LoRA approaches. Our method introduces a probabilistic
Bernoulli mechanism for selecting which matrix to update. This approach
encompasses and generalizes various existing update strategies while
maintaining theoretical tractability. Under standard assumptions from
non-convex optimization literature, we analyze several variants of our
framework: Bernoulli-LoRA-GD, Bernoulli-LoRA-SGD, Bernoulli-LoRA-PAGE,
Bernoulli-LoRA-MVR, Bernoulli-LoRA-QGD, Bernoulli-LoRA-MARINA, and
Bernoulli-LoRA-EF21, establishing convergence guarantees for each variant.
Additionally, we extend our analysis to convex non-smooth functions, providing
convergence rates for both constant and adaptive (Polyak-type) stepsizes.
Through extensive experiments on various tasks, we validate our theoretical
findings and demonstrate the practical efficacy of our approach. This work is a
step toward developing theoretically grounded yet practically effective PEFT
methods.

*Pavankumar Koratikere,Leifur Leifsson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SNBO is a scalable neural network-based blackbox optimization method that avoids model uncertainty estimation, outperforming baselines in efficiency and runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address scalability and computational challenges of Bayesian Optimization (BO) and NN-based BO in high-dimensional spaces.

Method: SNBO uses separate criteria for exploration and exploitation, adaptively controlling sampling regions without relying on model uncertainty estimation.

Result: SNBO outperforms baselines, achieving better function values with 40-60% fewer evaluations and significantly reduced runtime.

Conclusion: SNBO is an efficient, scalable alternative to traditional BO and NN-based methods, especially in high dimensions.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a widely used approach for blackbox
optimization that leverages a Gaussian process (GP) model and an acquisition
function to guide future sampling. While effective in low-dimensional settings,
BO faces scalability challenges in high-dimensional spaces and with large
number of function evaluations due to the computational complexity of GP
models. In contrast, neural networks (NNs) offer better scalability and can
model complex functions, which led to the development of NN-based BO
approaches. However, these methods typically rely on estimating model
uncertainty in NN prediction -- a process that is often computationally
intensive and complex, particularly in high dimensions. To address these
limitations, a novel method, called scalable neural network-based blackbox
optimization (SNBO), is proposed that does not rely on model uncertainty
estimation. Specifically, SNBO adds new samples using separate criteria for
exploration and exploitation, while adaptively controlling the sampling region
to ensure efficient optimization. SNBO is evaluated on a range of optimization
problems spanning from 10 to 102 dimensions and compared against four
state-of-the-art baseline algorithms. Across the majority of test problems,
SNBO attains function values better than the best-performing baseline
algorithm, while requiring 40-60% fewer function evaluations and reducing the
runtime by at least an order of magnitude.

*Dhruv Sarkar,Nishant Pandey,Sayak Ray Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DP-NCB, a bandit algorithm that ensures privacy and fairness simultaneously, achieving optimal Nash regret under differential privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in existing bandit algorithms by combining privacy (differential privacy) and fairness (Nash regret) in socially sensitive applications.

Method: Propose Differentially Private Nash Confidence Bound (DP-NCB), a unified framework for global and local differential privacy with anytime operation.

Result: DP-NCB achieves order-optimal Nash regret, outperforming baselines in simulations.

Conclusion: DP-NCB provides a principled solution for privacy-preserving and fair bandit algorithms in high-stakes applications.

Abstract: Multi-armed bandit algorithms are fundamental tools for sequential
decision-making under uncertainty, with widespread applications across domains
such as clinical trials and personalized decision-making. As bandit algorithms
are increasingly deployed in these socially sensitive settings, it becomes
critical to protect user data privacy and ensure fair treatment across decision
rounds. While prior work has independently addressed privacy and fairness in
bandit settings, the question of whether both objectives can be achieved
simultaneously has remained largely open. Existing privacy-preserving bandit
algorithms typically optimize average regret, a utilitarian measure, whereas
fairness-aware approaches focus on minimizing Nash regret, which penalizes
inequitable reward distributions, but often disregard privacy concerns.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce Differentially Private Nash Confidence Bound
(DP-NCB)-a novel and unified algorithmic framework that simultaneously ensures
$\epsilon$-differential privacy and achieves order-optimal Nash regret,
matching known lower bounds up to logarithmic factors. The framework is
sufficiently general to operate under both global and local differential
privacy models, and is anytime, requiring no prior knowledge of the time
horizon. We support our theoretical guarantees with simulations on synthetic
bandit instances, showing that DP-NCB incurs substantially lower Nash regret
than state-of-the-art baselines. Our results offer a principled foundation for
designing bandit algorithms that are both privacy-preserving and fair, making
them suitable for high-stakes, socially impactful applications.

*Yifei Zong,Alexandre M. Tartakovsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces VAE-DNN, a trainable-by-parts surrogate model for solving nonlinear PDEs, offering faster and more energy-efficient training than FNO and DeepONet while achieving higher accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and high computational cost of existing operator learning models (e.g., FNO, DeepONet) for solving parameterized nonlinear PDEs.

Method: VAE-DNN uses an encoder-decoder framework with separable training: encoder trained as part of a VAE for inputs, decoder as part of a VAE for solutions, and a neural network mapping latent spaces.

Result: VAE-DNN outperforms FNO and DeepONet in efficiency and accuracy for forward and inverse solutions of the nonlinear diffusion equation.

Conclusion: VAE-DNN is a promising alternative to existing models, offering significant improvements in training efficiency and solution accuracy for nonlinear PDEs.

Abstract: We propose a trainable-by-parts surrogate model for solving forward and
inverse parameterized nonlinear partial differential equations. Like several
other surrogate and operator learning models, the proposed approach employs an
encoder to reduce the high-dimensional input $y(\bm{x})$ to a lower-dimensional
latent space, $\bm\mu_{\bm\phi_y}$. Then, a fully connected neural network is
used to map $\bm\mu_{\bm\phi_y}$ to the latent space, $\bm\mu_{\bm\phi_h}$, of
the PDE solution $h(\bm{x},t)$. Finally, a decoder is utilized to reconstruct
$h(\bm{x},t)$. The innovative aspect of our model is its ability to train its
three components independently. This approach leads to a substantial decrease
in both the time and energy required for training when compared to leading
operator learning models such as FNO and DeepONet. The separable training is
achieved by training the encoder as part of the variational autoencoder (VAE)
for $y(\bm{x})$ and the decoder as part of the $h(\bm{x},t)$ VAE. We refer to
this model as the VAE-DNN model. VAE-DNN is compared to the FNO and DeepONet
models for obtaining forward and inverse solutions to the nonlinear diffusion
equation governing groundwater flow in an unconfined aquifer. Our findings
indicate that VAE-DNN not only demonstrates greater efficiency but also
delivers superior accuracy in both forward and inverse solutions compared to
the FNO and DeepONet models.

TL;DR: A spatio-temporal framework using crowdsourced KPIs and regulatory data improves spectrum demand prediction, outperforming traditional ITU models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate spectrum demand prediction is vital for fair allocation, regulatory planning, and supporting emerging technologies like 5G, 6G, and IoT.

Method: The framework employs advanced feature engineering, correlation analysis, and transfer learning on crowdsourced KPIs and regulatory datasets.

Result: The method achieves superior accuracy and generalizability, outperforming ITU benchmarks in realistic predictions.

Conclusion: The framework offers a robust tool for policymakers to enhance spectrum management and planning.

Abstract: Accurate spectrum demand prediction is crucial for informed spectrum
allocation, effective regulatory planning, and fostering sustainable growth in
modern wireless communication networks. It supports governmental efforts,
particularly those led by the international telecommunication union (ITU), to
establish fair spectrum allocation policies, improve auction mechanisms, and
meet the requirements of emerging technologies such as advanced 5G, forthcoming
6G, and the internet of things (IoT). This paper presents an effective
spatio-temporal prediction framework that leverages crowdsourced user-side key
performance indicators (KPIs) and regulatory datasets to model and forecast
spectrum demand. The proposed methodology achieves superior prediction accuracy
and cross-regional generalizability by incorporating advanced feature
engineering, comprehensive correlation analysis, and transfer learning
techniques. Unlike traditional ITU models, which are often constrained by
arbitrary inputs and unrealistic assumptions, this approach exploits granular,
data-driven insights to account for spatial and temporal variations in spectrum
utilization. Comparative evaluations against ITU estimates, as the benchmark,
underscore our framework's capability to deliver more realistic and actionable
predictions. Experimental results validate the efficacy of our methodology,
highlighting its potential as a robust approach for policymakers and regulatory
bodies to enhance spectrum management and planning.

Abstract: Data is often generated in streams, with new observations arriving over time.
A key challenge for learning models from data streams is capturing relevant
information while keeping computational costs manageable. We explore
intelligent data subsampling for offline learning, and argue for an
information-theoretic method centred on reducing uncertainty in downstream
predictions of interest. Empirically, we demonstrate that this

time, we highlight that reliably achieving strong performance in practice
requires careful model design.

Motivation: Address the inefficiency in training models due to the end of Moore's law and Dennard scaling by exploring intelligent subsampling.

Method: Develop SICKLE with MaxEnt sampling, compare it with random and phase-space sampling on DNS turbulence datasets, and evaluate scalability on Frontier.

Result: Subsampling improves model accuracy and reduces energy consumption by up to 38x.

Conclusion: Intelligent subsampling (SICKLE) is effective for efficient training, offering significant energy savings.

Abstract: With the end of Moore's law and Dennard scaling, efficient training
increasingly requires rethinking data volume. Can we train better models with
significantly less data via intelligent subsampling? To explore this, we
develop SICKLE, a sparse intelligent curation framework for efficient learning,
featuring a novel maximum entropy (MaxEnt) sampling approach, scalable
training, and energy benchmarking. We compare MaxEnt with random and
phase-space sampling on large direct numerical simulation (DNS) datasets of
turbulence. Evaluating SICKLE at scale on Frontier, we show that subsampling as
a preprocessing step can improve model accuracy and substantially lower energy
consumption, with reductions of up to 38x observed in certain cases.

TL;DR: A novel RL framework for T1DM combines impulse and switching control to manage insulin delivery, improving blood glucose control from 22.4% to 10.8% violations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Managing physiological variables in chronic conditions like T1DM is challenging due to delayed and heterogeneous intervention effects. RL can personalize treatment but needs better handling of temporal dynamics.

Method: The framework uses a constrained Markov decision process with physiological state features, unifying impulse control (fast-acting) and switching control (longer-acting) for safe policy learning.

Result: Empirical tests show reduced blood glucose violations from 22.4% to 10.8%, with theoretical convergence guarantees.

Conclusion: The work lays a foundation for safe, temporally-aware RL in healthcare, though not yet ready for clinical use.

Abstract: Managing physiological variables within clinically safe target zones is a
central challenge in healthcare, particularly for chronic conditions such as
Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). Reinforcement learning (RL) offers promise for
personalising treatment, but struggles with the delayed and heterogeneous
effects of interventions. We propose a novel RL framework to study and support
decision-making in T1DM technologies, such as automated insulin delivery. Our
approach captures the complex temporal dynamics of treatment by unifying two
control modalities: \textit{impulse control} for discrete, fast-acting
interventions (e.g., insulin boluses), and \textit{switching control} for
longer-acting treatments and regime shifts. The core of our method is a
constrained Markov decision process augmented with physiological state
features, enabling safe policy learning under clinical and resource
constraints. The framework incorporates biologically realistic factors,
including insulin decay, leading to policies that better reflect real-world
therapeutic behaviour. While not intended for clinical deployment, this work
establishes a foundation for future safe and temporally-aware RL in healthcare.
We provide theoretical guarantees of convergence and demonstrate empirical
improvements in a stylised T1DM control task, reducing blood glucose level
violations from 22.4\% (state-of-the-art) to as low as 10.8\%.

Method: Proposes a hybrid approach using multi-task learning and a recurrent neural network to parameterize a differentiable biophysical model, enabling shared learning across cultivars.

Result: Outperforms conventional biophysical models and baseline deep learning in predicting phenological stages and other crop variables.

Conclusion: The hybrid method enhances prediction robustness and accuracy, benefiting vineyard management.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of grape phenology is essential for timely vineyard
management decisions, such as scheduling irrigation and fertilization, to
maximize crop yield and quality. While traditional biophysical models
calibrated on historical field data can be used for season-long predictions,
they lack the precision required for fine-grained vineyard management. Deep
learning methods are a compelling alternative but their performance is hindered
by sparse phenology datasets, particularly at the cultivar level. We propose a
hybrid modeling approach that combines multi-task learning with a recurrent
neural network to parameterize a differentiable biophysical model. By using
multi-task learning to predict the parameters of the biophysical model, our
approach enables shared learning across cultivars while preserving biological
structure, thereby improving the robustness and accuracy of predictions.
Empirical evaluation using real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrates that
our method significantly outperforms both conventional biophysical models and
baseline deep learning approaches in predicting phenological stages, as well as
other crop state variables such as cold-hardiness and wheat yield.

*Florian Bley,Jacob Kauffmann,Simon LeÃ³n Krug,Klaus-Robert MÃ¼ller,GrÃ©goire Montavon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reveals a hidden neural network structure in distance-based classifiers, enabling Explainable AI techniques like LRP for better interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the explainability of widely used distance-based classifiers (e.g., k-nearest neighbors, SVMs) by leveraging latent structures, similar to neural networks.

Method: Uncovers a neural network-like structure in distance-based classifiers (linear detection units + nonlinear pooling layers) to apply Explainable AI techniques like LRP.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance of the novel explanation approach over baselines and validates its usefulness in practical use cases.

Conclusion: The approach successfully bridges the gap between distance-based classifiers and Explainable AI, improving model interpretability.

Abstract: Distance-based classifiers, such as k-nearest neighbors and support vector
machines, continue to be a workhorse of machine learning, widely used in
science and industry. In practice, to derive insights from these models, it is
also important to ensure that their predictions are explainable. While the
field of Explainable AI has supplied methods that are in principle applicable
to any model, it has also emphasized the usefulness of latent structures (e.g.
the sequence of layers in a neural network) to produce explanations. In this
paper, we contribute by uncovering a hidden neural network structure in
distance-based classifiers (consisting of linear detection units combined with
nonlinear pooling layers) upon which Explainable AI techniques such as
layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) become applicable. Through quantitative
evaluations, we demonstrate the advantage of our novel explanation approach
over several baselines. We also show the overall usefulness of explaining
distance-based models through two practical use cases.

### [254] [Active Learning and Transfer Learning for Anomaly Detection in Time-Series Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03921)
*John D. Kelleher,Matthew Nicholson,Rahul Agrahari,Clare Conran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Combining active and transfer learning for anomaly detection in cross-domain time-series data shows limited improvement, with clustering often unnecessary and active learning benefits slower than expected.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the effectiveness of combining active learning and transfer learning for anomaly detection in cross-domain time-series data.

Method: Combined active learning and transfer learning, tested interaction with clustering, and assessed performance across datasets.

Result: Best performance without clustering; active learning improves performance linearly but slower than literature suggests. Performance plateaus as less useful data points are added.

Conclusion: Active learning is effective but improvements are linear and slow, with diminishing returns as less useful data points are included.

Abstract: This paper examines the effectiveness of combining active learning and
transfer learning for anomaly detection in cross-domain time-series data. Our
results indicate that there is an interaction between clustering and active
learning and in general the best performance is achieved using a single cluster
(in other words when clustering is not applied). Also, we find that adding new
samples to the training set using active learning does improve model
performance but that in general, the rate of improvement is slower than the
results reported in the literature suggest. We attribute this difference to an
improved experimental design where distinct data samples are used for the
sampling and testing pools. Finally, we assess the ceiling performance of
transfer learning in combination with active learning across several datasets
and find that performance does initially improve but eventually begins to tail
off as more target points are selected for inclusion in training. This tail-off
in performance may indicate that the active learning process is doing a good
job of sequencing data points for selection, pushing the less useful points
towards the end of the selection process and that this tail-off occurs when
these less useful points are eventually added. Taken together our results
indicate that active learning is effective but that the improvement in model
performance follows a linear flat function concerning the number of points
selected and labelled.

*Hector Vargas Alvarez,Dimitrios G. Patsatzis,Lucia Russo,Ioannis Kevrekidis,Constantinos Siettos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A combined manifold and machine learning approach bridges microscopic and macroscopic crowd dynamics, using agent-based simulations to learn a discrete evolution operator in latent spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of connecting microscopic and macroscopic scales in crowd dynamics for numerical analysis, optimization, and control.

Method: A four-stage approach: (1) derive macroscopic fields from microscopic data, (2) map to latent space using manifold learning, (3) learn reduced-order surrogate models with LSTMs and MVARs, (4) reconstruct dynamics in high-dimensional space.

Result: High accuracy, robustness, and generalizability in modeling crowd dynamics, with mass conservation in density reconstruction.

Conclusion: The framework provides an effective solution operator for macroscopic PDEs, enabling fast and accurate crowd dynamics simulations.

Abstract: Bridging the microscopic and the macroscopic modelling scales in crowd
dynamics constitutes an important, open challenge for systematic numerical
analysis, optimization, and control. We propose a combined manifold and machine
learning approach to learn the discrete evolution operator for the emergent
crowd dynamics in latent spaces from high-fidelity agent-based simulations. The
proposed framework builds upon our previous works on next-generation
Equation-free algorithms on learning surrogate models for high-dimensional and
multiscale systems. Our approach is a four-stage one, explicitly conserving the
mass of the reconstructed dynamics in the high-dimensional space. In the first
step, we derive continuous macroscopic fields (densities) from discrete
microscopic data (pedestrians' positions) using KDE. In the second step, based
on manifold learning, we construct a map from the macroscopic ambient space
into the latent space parametrized by a few coordinates based on POD of the
corresponding density distribution. The third step involves learning
reduced-order surrogate ROMs in the latent space using machine learning
techniques, particularly LSTMs networks and MVARs. Finally, we reconstruct the
crowd dynamics in the high-dimensional space in terms of macroscopic density
profiles. We demonstrate that the POD reconstruction of the density
distribution via SVD conserves the mass. With this "embed->learn in latent
space->lift back to the ambient space" pipeline, we create an effective
solution operator of the unavailable macroscopic PDE for the density evolution.
For our illustrations, we use the Social Force Model to generate data in a
corridor with an obstacle, imposing periodic boundary conditions. The numerical
results demonstrate high accuracy, robustness, and generalizability, thus
allowing for fast and accurate modelling/simulation of crowd dynamics from
agent-based simulations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers trained on next-token prediction can learn to estimate transition probabilities in Markov chains, surpassing memorization when size and training data exceed thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if transformers can learn algorithmic tasks like estimating transition probabilities in Markov chains without memorizing training data.

Method: Train transformers on next-token prediction for Markov chains with random transition matrices, varying model size and training data.

Result: Transformers learn to estimate transition probabilities beyond memorization when size and training data exceed certain thresholds.

Conclusion: Transformers can generalize to unseen Markov chain structures with proper encoding and sufficient scale.

Abstract: We investigate the capacity of transformers to learn algorithms involving
their context while solely being trained using next token prediction. We set up
Markov chains with random transition matrices and we train transformers to
predict the next token. Matrices used during training and test are different
and we show that there is a threshold in transformer size and in training set
size above which the model is able to learn to estimate the transition
probabilities from its context instead of memorizing the training patterns.
Additionally, we show that more involved encoding of the states enables more
robust prediction for Markov chains with structures different than those seen
during training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FairPOT is a model-agnostic post-processing framework using optimal transport to balance fairness and AUC performance by selectively transforming risk scores in disadvantaged groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between enforcing fairness and maintaining AUC performance in high-stakes domains like healthcare and finance.

Method: Proposes FairPOT, which aligns risk score distributions across groups by transforming a controllable proportion (top-lambda quantile) of scores in disadvantaged groups using optimal transport.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in global and partial AUC scenarios, achieving fairness with minimal AUC degradation or utility gains.

Conclusion: FairPOT is computationally efficient and adaptable, making it suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: Fairness metrics utilizing the area under the receiver operator
characteristic curve (AUC) have gained increasing attention in high-stakes
domains such as healthcare, finance, and criminal justice. In these domains,
fairness is often evaluated over risk scores rather than binary outcomes, and a
common challenge is that enforcing strict fairness can significantly degrade
AUC performance. To address this challenge, we propose Fair Proportional
Optimal Transport (FairPOT), a novel, model-agnostic post-processing framework
that strategically aligns risk score distributions across different groups
using optimal transport, but does so selectively by transforming a controllable
proportion, i.e., the top-lambda quantile, of scores within the disadvantaged
group. By varying lambda, our method allows for a tunable trade-off between
reducing AUC disparities and maintaining overall AUC performance. Furthermore,
we extend FairPOT to the partial AUC setting, enabling fairness interventions
to concentrate on the highest-risk regions. Extensive experiments on synthetic,
public, and clinical datasets show that FairPOT consistently outperforms
existing post-processing techniques in both global and partial AUC scenarios,
often achieving improved fairness with slight AUC degradation or even positive
gains in utility. The computational efficiency and practical adaptability of
FairPOT make it a promising solution for real-world deployment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BubbleONet is a physics-informed operator learning model for mapping pressure profiles to bubble radius responses, using adaptive activation to improve high-frequency feature representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a computationally efficient surrogate model for simulating bubble dynamics, leveraging physics-informed learning to ensure physical fidelity.

Method: Built on PI-DeepONet, integrates Rowdy adaptive activation to address spectral bias, and evaluates performance on Rayleigh-Plesset and Keller-Miksis equations with single/multiple initial radii.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness as a surrogate model, outperforming traditional numerical solvers in efficiency.

Conclusion: BubbleONet is a promising tool for efficient bubble dynamics simulation, combining operator learning with physics-informed constraints.

Abstract: This paper introduces BubbleONet, an operator learning model designed to map
pressure profiles from an input function space to corresponding bubble radius
responses. BubbleONet is built upon the physics-informed deep operator network
(PI-DeepONet) framework, leveraging DeepONet's powerful universal approximation
capabilities for operator learning alongside the robust physical fidelity
provided by the physics-informed neural networks. To mitigate the inherent
spectral bias in deep learning, BubbleONet integrates the Rowdy adaptive
activation function, enabling improved representation of high-frequency
features. The model is evaluated across various scenarios, including: (1)
Rayleigh-Plesset equation based bubble dynamics with a single initial radius,
(2) Keller-Miksis equation based bubble dynamics with a single initial radius,
and (3) Keller-Miksis equation based bubble dynamics with multiple initial
radii. Moreover, the performance of single-step versus two-step training
techniques for BubbleONet is investigated. The results demonstrate that
BubbleONet serves as a promising surrogate model for simulating bubble
dynamics, offering a computationally efficient alternative to traditional
numerical solvers.

*Ajesh Koyatan Chathoth,Shuhao Yu,Stephen Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PrivCLIP is a dynamic, user-controllable framework for privacy-preserving sensing, allowing users to specify privacy preferences and transforming sensitive IMU data into privacy-compliant versions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User privacy preferences vary and evolve, especially with IMU sensors in devices like smartphones, but existing methods lack adaptability and user control.

Method: PrivCLIP uses multimodal contrastive learning to align IMU data with natural language, enabling few-shot detection of sensitive activities and sanitizing data via IMU-GPT.

Result: PrivCLIP outperforms baselines in privacy protection and data utility on human activity recognition datasets.

Conclusion: PrivCLIP offers a flexible, effective solution for user-controllable privacy in sensing systems.

Abstract: User-controllable privacy is important in modern sensing systems, as privacy
preferences can vary significantly from person to person and may evolve over
time. This is especially relevant in devices equipped with Inertial Measurement
Unit (IMU) sensors, such as smartphones and wearables, which continuously
collect rich time-series data that can inadvertently expose sensitive user
behaviors. While prior work has proposed privacy-preserving methods for sensor
data, most rely on static, predefined privacy labels or require large
quantities of private training data, limiting their adaptability and user
agency. In this work, we introduce PrivCLIP, a dynamic, user-controllable,
few-shot privacy-preserving sensing framework. PrivCLIP allows users to specify
and modify their privacy preferences by categorizing activities as sensitive
(black-listed), non-sensitive (white-listed), or neutral (gray-listed).
Leveraging a multimodal contrastive learning approach, PrivCLIP aligns IMU
sensor data with natural language activity descriptions in a shared embedding
space, enabling few-shot detection of sensitive activities. When a
privacy-sensitive activity is identified, the system uses a language-guided
activity sanitizer and a motion generation module (IMU-GPT) to transform the
original data into a privacy-compliant version that semantically resembles a
non-sensitive activity. We evaluate PrivCLIP on multiple human activity
recognition datasets and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms baseline
methods in terms of both privacy protection and data utility.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TC-LoRA addresses task interference in multi-task LoRA adapters by clustering training samples and disentangling task-specific factors via CP decomposition, improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Task interference in multi-task LoRA adapters degrades performance; TC-LoRA aims to mitigate this by clustering and factorization.

Method: Clusters training samples by embedding similarity and applies CP decomposition to disentangle task-specific and shared factors in LoRA adapters.

Result: TC-LoRA improves accuracy by +1.4% on Phi-3 and +2.3% on Mistral-7B compared to SVD-based baselines.

Conclusion: TC-LoRA effectively reduces task interference and enhances LLM adaptation performance.

Abstract: Despite the success of the monolithic dense paradigm of large language models
(LLMs), the LoRA adapters offer an efficient solution by fine-tuning small
task-specific modules and merging them with the base model. However, in
multi-task settings, merging LoRA adapters trained on heterogeneous sources
frequently causes \textit{task interference}, degrading downstream performance.
To address this, we propose a tensorized clustered LoRA (TC-LoRA) library
targeting to address the task interference at the \textit{text-level} and
\textit{parameter-level}. At the \textit{text-level}, we cluster the training
samples in the embedding space to capture input-format similarities, then train
a specialized LoRA adapter for each cluster. At the \textit{parameter-level},
we introduce a joint Canonical Polyadic (CP) decomposition that disentangles
task-specific and shared factors across LoRA adapters. This joint factorization
preserves essential knowledge while reducing cross-task interference. Extensive
experiments on out-of-domain zero-shot and skill-composition tasks-including
reasoning, question answering, and coding. Compared to strong SVD-based
baselines, TC-LoRA achieves +1.4\% accuracy on Phi-3 and +2.3\% on Mistral-7B
(+2.3\%), demonstrating the effectiveness of TC-LoRA in LLM adaptation.

*Hyungbin Kim,Incheol Baek,Yon Dohn Chung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DCFL introduces a decoupled contrastive learning framework for federated learning, addressing data heterogeneity and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning suffers from performance degradation due to data heterogeneity, and existing contrastive learning methods rely on unrealistic asymptotic assumptions.

Method: DCFL decouples contrastive loss into alignment and uniformity objectives, enabling independent calibration of attraction and repulsion forces.

Result: DCFL achieves better alignment and uniformity, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet.

Conclusion: DCFL provides an effective solution for federated learning with limited client data, improving performance without relying on asymptotic assumptions.

Abstract: Federated learning is a distributed machine learning paradigm that allows
multiple participants to train a shared model by exchanging model updates
instead of their raw data. However, its performance is degraded compared to
centralized approaches due to data heterogeneity across clients. While
contrastive learning has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate this, our
theoretical analysis reveals a fundamental conflict: its asymptotic assumptions
of an infinite number of negative samples are violated in finite-sample regime
of federated learning. To address this issue, we introduce Decoupled
Contrastive Learning for Federated Learning (DCFL), a novel framework that
decouples the existing contrastive loss into two objectives. Decoupling the
loss into its alignment and uniformity components enables the independent
calibration of the attraction and repulsion forces without relying on the
asymptotic assumptions. This strategy provides a contrastive learning method
suitable for federated learning environments where each client has a small
amount of data. Our experimental results show that DCFL achieves stronger
alignment between positive samples and greater uniformity between negative
samples compared to existing contrastive learning methods. Furthermore,
experimental results on standard benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
Tiny-ImageNet, demonstrate that DCFL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
federated learning methods.

TL;DR: A comparative survey of TensorFlow and PyTorch, analyzing usability, performance, deployment, and ecosystem trade-offs, highlighting their distinct strengths for research and production.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To help practitioners choose between TensorFlow and PyTorch by comparing their programming paradigms, performance, deployment options, and community support.

Method: Review and contrast programming paradigms, benchmark training/inference performance, analyze deployment tools, and survey ecosystem/community trends.

Result: PyTorch excels in research due to simplicity and flexibility, while TensorFlow offers a robust production ecosystem.

Conclusion: Understanding the trade-offs between PyTorch (research-friendly) and TensorFlow (production-ready) is crucial for selecting the right framework.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive comparative survey of TensorFlow and
PyTorch, the two leading deep learning frameworks, focusing on their usability,
performance, and deployment trade-offs. We review each framework's programming
paradigm and developer experience, contrasting TensorFlow's graph-based (now
optionally eager) approach with PyTorch's dynamic, Pythonic style. We then
compare model training speeds and inference performance across multiple tasks
and data regimes, drawing on recent benchmarks and studies. Deployment
flexibility is examined in depth - from TensorFlow's mature ecosystem
(TensorFlow Lite for mobile/embedded, TensorFlow Serving, and JavaScript
support) to PyTorch's newer production tools (TorchScript compilation, ONNX
export, and TorchServe). We also survey ecosystem and community support,
including library integrations, industry adoption, and research trends (e.g.,
PyTorch's dominance in recent research publications versus TensorFlow's broader
tooling in enterprise). Applications in computer vision, natural language
processing, and other domains are discussed to illustrate how each framework is
used in practice. Finally, we outline future directions and open challenges in
deep learning framework design, such as unifying eager and graph execution,
improving cross-framework interoperability, and integrating compiler
optimizations (XLA, JIT) for improved speed. Our findings indicate that while
both frameworks are highly capable for state-of-the-art deep learning, they
exhibit distinct trade-offs: PyTorch offers simplicity and flexibility favored
in research, whereas TensorFlow provides a fuller production-ready ecosystem -
understanding these trade-offs is key for practitioners selecting the
appropriate tool. We include charts, code snippets, and more than 20 references
to academic papers and official documentation to support this comparative

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dataset-wise heterogeneity degrades generalization in TSFMs, a challenge that is underexplored.

Method: FeDaL uses federated learning to decompose heterogeneous datasets into shared and personalized knowledge, with Domain Bias Elimination (DBE) and Global Bias Elimination (GBE) mechanisms.

Result: FeDaL demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization across eight tasks and outperforms 54 baselines.

Conclusion: FeDaL effectively addresses heterogeneity in TSFMs and scales well under decentralization.

Abstract: Dataset-wise heterogeneity introduces significant domain biases that
fundamentally degrade generalization on Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs),
yet this challenge remains underexplored. This paper rethink the development of
TSFMs using the paradigm of federated learning. We propose a novel Federated
Dataset Learning (FeDaL) approach to tackle heterogeneous time series by
learning dataset-agnostic temporal representations. Specifically, the
distributed architecture of federated learning is a nature solution to
decompose heterogeneous TS datasets into shared generalized knowledge and
preserved personalized knowledge. Moreover, based on the TSFM architecture,
FeDaL explicitly mitigates both local and global biases by adding two
complementary mechanisms: Domain Bias Elimination (DBE) and Global Bias
Elimination (GBE). FeDaL`s cross-dataset generalization has been extensively
evaluated in real-world datasets spanning eight tasks, including both
representation learning and downstream time series analysis, against 54
baselines. We further analyze federated scaling behavior, showing how data
volume, client count, and join rate affect model performance under
decentralization.

Motivation: To leverage quantum computing for enhancing the classical TFT's capabilities in multi-horizon time series forecasting, making it feasible for NISQ devices.

Method: Develops a hybrid quantum-classical architecture (QTFT) based on variational quantum algorithms, tested on forecasting datasets.

Result: QTFT outperforms or matches classical TFT in training and test loss, demonstrating feasibility on NISQ devices.

Conclusion: QTFT offers a promising quantum-enhanced alternative for time series forecasting, adaptable to current quantum hardware limitations.

Abstract: The Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), proposed by Lim et al.
[\textit{International Journal of Forecasting}, 2021], is a state-of-the-art
attention-based deep neural network architecture specifically designed for
multi-horizon time series forecasting. It has demonstrated significant
performance improvements over existing benchmarks. In this work, we propose a
Quantum Temporal Fusion Transformer (QTFT), a quantum-enhanced hybrid
quantum-classical architecture that extends the capabilities of the classical
TFT framework. Our results demonstrate that QTFT is successfully trained on the
forecasting datasets and is capable of accurately predicting future values. In
particular, our experimental results display that in certain test cases, the
model outperforms its classical counterpart in terms of both training and test
loss, while in the remaining cases, it achieves comparable performance. A key
advantage of our approach lies in its foundation on a variational quantum
algorithm, enabling implementation on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum
(NISQ) devices without strict requirements on the number of qubits or circuit
depth.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates fine-tuning methods (OpenAI's service and QLORA) for Automated Short Answer Grading (ASAG), comparing them to few-shot prompting. Findings suggest limited utility for open-weight models but better performance for closed models, with domain impact and synthetic data benefits noted.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore efficient fine-tuning methods for ASAG, addressing the historical inaccessibility of large-scale compute clusters and comparing closed vs. open-weight models.

Method: Evaluated fine-tuning (OpenAI's service and QLORA) and few-shot prompting for ASAG, using structured (JSON) outputs and synthetic data.

Result: Fine-tuning with small data has limited utility for open-weight models but outperforms few-shot baselines for closed models. Synthetic data improves open-weight model performance.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning methods show promise for ASAG, especially for closed models, while synthetic data can enhance open-weight model performance. Domain and data quality impact results.

Abstract: Research to improve Automated Short Answer Grading has recently focused on
Large Language Models (LLMs) with prompt engineering and no- or few-shot
prompting to achieve best results. This is in contrast to the fine-tuning
approach, which has historically required large-scale compute clusters
inaccessible to most users. New closed-model approaches such as OpenAI's
fine-tuning service promise results with as few as 100 examples, while methods
using open weights such as quantized low-rank adaptive (QLORA) can be used to
fine-tune models on consumer GPUs. We evaluate both of these fine-tuning
methods, measuring their interaction with few-shot prompting for automated
short answer grading (ASAG) with structured (JSON) outputs. Our results show
that finetuning with small amounts of data has limited utility for Llama
open-weight models, but that fine-tuning methods can outperform few-shot
baseline instruction-tuned LLMs for OpenAI's closed models. While our
evaluation set is limited, we find some evidence that the observed benefits of
finetuning may be impacted by the domain subject matter. Lastly, we observed
dramatic improvement with the LLama 3.1 8B-Instruct open-weight model by
seeding the initial training examples with a significant amount of cheaply
generated synthetic training data.

TL;DR: FLAT introduces a flexible backdoor attack in federated learning using a latent-driven autoencoder to generate diverse, target-specific triggers, evading detection and requiring new defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor attacks in federated learning are inflexible and detectable due to fixed-pattern or single-target triggers.

Method: FLAT employs a latent-driven conditional autoencoder to create adaptive, variable triggers for arbitrary targets without retraining.

Result: FLAT achieves high attack success and robustness against advanced FL defenses.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for new defenses against latent-driven, multi-target backdoor threats in federated learning.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is vulnerable to backdoor attacks, yet most existing
methods are limited by fixed-pattern or single-target triggers, making them
inflexible and easier to detect. We propose FLAT (FL Arbitrary-Target Attack),
a novel backdoor attack that leverages a latent-driven conditional autoencoder
to generate diverse, target-specific triggers as needed. By introducing a
latent code, FLAT enables the creation of visually adaptive and highly variable
triggers, allowing attackers to select arbitrary targets without retraining and
to evade conventional detection mechanisms. Our approach unifies attack
success, stealth, and diversity within a single framework, introducing a new
level of flexibility and sophistication to backdoor attacks in FL. Extensive
experiments show that FLAT achieves high attack success and remains robust
against advanced FL defenses. These results highlight the urgent need for new
defense strategies to address latent-driven, multi-target backdoor threats in
federated settings.

*Mudi Jiang,Jiahui Zhou,Lianyu Hu,Xinying Liu,Zengyou He,Zhikui Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AFMVC is a novel adversarial fair multi-view clustering framework that integrates fairness into representation learning, achieving superior fairness and competitive clustering performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-view clustering methods overlook fairness, a critical concern in human-centered applications, and often degrade performance when enforcing fairness.

Method: AFMVC uses adversarial training to remove sensitive attribute information from learned features and aligns view-specific clustering assignments with a fairness-invariant consensus distribution via KL divergence.

Result: AFMVC outperforms existing methods in fairness and maintains competitive clustering performance on fairness-constrained datasets.

Conclusion: The AFMVC framework effectively balances fairness and clustering performance, supported by theoretical guarantees and empirical validation.

Abstract: Cluster analysis is a fundamental problem in data mining and machine
learning. In recent years, multi-view clustering has attracted increasing
attention due to its ability to integrate complementary information from
multiple views. However, existing methods primarily focus on clustering
performance, while fairness-a critical concern in human-centered
applications-has been largely overlooked. Although recent studies have explored
group fairness in multi-view clustering, most methods impose explicit
regularization on cluster assignments, relying on the alignment between
sensitive attributes and the underlying cluster structure. However, this
assumption often fails in practice and can degrade clustering performance. In
this paper, we propose an adversarial fair multi-view clustering (AFMVC)
framework that integrates fairness learning into the representation learning
process. Specifically, our method employs adversarial training to fundamentally
remove sensitive attribute information from learned features, ensuring that the
resulting cluster assignments are unaffected by it. Furthermore, we
theoretically prove that aligning view-specific clustering assignments with a
fairness-invariant consensus distribution via KL divergence preserves
clustering consistency without significantly compromising fairness, thereby
providing additional theoretical guarantees for our framework. Extensive

achieves superior fairness and competitive clustering performance compared to
existing multi-view clustering and fairness-aware clustering methods.

### [268] [Model Inversion Attacks on Vision-Language Models: Do They Leak What They Learn?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04097)
*Ngoc-Bao Nguyen,Sy-Tuyen Ho,Koh Jun Hao,Ngai-Man Cheung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores model inversion (MI) attacks on vision-language models (VLMs), proposing novel token-based and sequence-based methods to reconstruct private training data, demonstrating their effectiveness through experiments and human evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work on MI attacks focused on unimodal DNNs, leaving VLMs underexplored despite their growing use in sensitive applications like healthcare and finance.

Method: Proposes Token-based Model Inversion (TMI), Convergent TMI (TMI-C), Sequence-based Model Inversion (SMI), and SMI with Adaptive Token Weighting (SMI-AW), tailored for VLMs' generative nature.

Result: Sequence-based methods, especially SMI-AW, outperform token-based methods in reconstruction quality and attack accuracy (75.31% in human evaluation). Publicly released VLMs are also vulnerable.

Conclusion: VLMs are susceptible to MI attacks, posing significant privacy risks, highlighting the need for safeguards as their adoption grows.

Abstract: Model inversion (MI) attacks pose significant privacy risks by reconstructing
private training data from trained neural networks. While prior works have
focused on conventional unimodal DNNs, the vulnerability of vision-language
models (VLMs) remains underexplored. In this paper, we conduct the first study
to understand VLMs' vulnerability in leaking private visual training data. To
tailored for VLMs' token-based generative nature, we propose a suite of novel
token-based and sequence-based model inversion strategies. Particularly, we
propose Token-based Model Inversion (TMI), Convergent Token-based Model
Inversion (TMI-C), Sequence-based Model Inversion (SMI), and Sequence-based
Model Inversion with Adaptive Token Weighting (SMI-AW). Through extensive
experiments and user study on three state-of-the-art VLMs and multiple
datasets, we demonstrate, for the first time, that VLMs are susceptible to
training data leakage. The experiments show that our proposed sequence-based
methods, particularly SMI-AW combined with a logit-maximization loss based on
vocabulary representation, can achieve competitive reconstruction and
outperform token-based methods in attack accuracy and visual similarity.
Importantly, human evaluation of the reconstructed images yields an attack
accuracy of 75.31\%, underscoring the severity of model inversion threats in
VLMs. Notably we also demonstrate inversion attacks on the publicly released
VLMs. Our study reveals the privacy vulnerability of VLMs as they become
increasingly popular across many applications such as healthcare and finance.

*Jinghang Han,Jiawei Chen,Hang Shao,Hao Ma,Mingcheng Li,Xintian Shen,Lihao Zheng,Wei Chen,Tao Wei,Lihua Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a consistency-aware policy optimization framework to address vanishing gradients in reinforcement learning for LLMs, improving training efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of vanishing gradients when multiple responses under a single prompt converge to identical outcomes, limiting learning efficiency.

Method: Proposes a structured global reward based on outcome consistency and an entropy-based soft blending mechanism for adaptive optimization.

Result: Substantial performance gains on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating robustness and general applicability.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances learning signals and balances exploration-convergence, validated by improved performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex problem-solving tasks. Recently, the
introduction of DeepSeek R1 has inspired a surge of interest in leveraging
rule-based rewards as a low-cost alternative for computing advantage functions
and guiding policy optimization. However, a common challenge observed across
many replication and extension efforts is that when multiple sampled responses
under a single prompt converge to identical outcomes, whether correct or
incorrect, the group-based advantage degenerates to zero. This leads to
vanishing gradients and renders the corresponding samples ineffective for
learning, ultimately limiting training efficiency and downstream performance.
To address this issue, we propose a consistency-aware policy optimization
framework that introduces a structured global reward based on outcome
consistency, the global loss based on it ensures that, even when model outputs
show high intra-group consistency, the training process still receives
meaningful learning signals, which encourages the generation of correct and
self-consistent reasoning paths from a global perspective. Furthermore, we
incorporate an entropy-based soft blending mechanism that adaptively balances
local advantage estimation with global optimization, enabling dynamic
transitions between exploration and convergence throughout training. Our method
introduces several key innovations in both reward design and optimization
strategy. We validate its effectiveness through substantial performance gains
on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, highlighting the proposed
framework's robustness and general applicability. Code of this work has been
released at https://github.com/hijih/copo-code.git.

*Md Shazid Islam,A S M Jahid Hasan,Md Saydur Rahman,Md Saiful Islam Sajol*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A semi-supervised deep domain adaptation framework improves solar generation prediction accuracy across diverse locations with minimal labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address domain shift in solar prediction models due to varying weather conditions and lack of labeled data.

Method: Uses a teacher-student model with consistency and cross-entropy loss for semi-supervised learning, adapting a pre-trained CNN to new locations.

Result: Achieves up to 11.36%, 6.65%, and 4.92% accuracy improvements in California, Florida, and New York, respectively, with only 20% labeled target data.

Conclusion: The framework effectively mitigates domain shift, enabling accurate solar predictions with limited labeled data.

Abstract: Accurate solar generation prediction is essential for proper estimation of
renewable energy resources across diverse geographic locations. However,
geographical and weather features vary from location to location which
introduces domain shift - a major bottleneck to develop location-agnostic
prediction model. As a result, a machine-learning model which can perform well
to predict solar power in one location, may exhibit subpar performance in
another location. Moreover, the lack of properly labeled data and storage
issues make the task even more challenging. In order to address domain shift
due to varying weather conditions across different meteorological regions, this
paper presents a semi-supervised deep domain adaptation framework, allowing
accurate predictions with minimal labeled data from the target location. Our
approach involves training a deep convolutional neural network on a source
location's data and adapting it to the target location using a source-free,
teacher-student model configuration. The teacher-student model leverages
consistency and cross-entropy loss for semi-supervised learning, ensuring
effective adaptation without any source data requirement for prediction. With
annotation of only $20 \%$ data in the target domain, our approach exhibits an
improvement upto $11.36 \%$, $6.65 \%$, $4.92\%$ for California, Florida and
New York as target domain, respectively in terms of accuracy in predictions
with respect to non-adaptive approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A two-stage pipeline using MIST and MolForge improves molecular generation from mass spectra, achieving a tenfold performance boost over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the accuracy of molecular structure generation from mass spectra by leveraging pretraining and thresholding techniques.

Method: Combines MIST for encoding mass spectra into fingerprints and MolForge for decoding, with pretraining and thresholding to improve substructure focus.

Result: Achieves top-1 28% and top-10 36% accuracy, a tenfold improvement over previous methods.

Conclusion: The pipeline sets a strong baseline for future de novo molecular elucidation research.

Abstract: A common approach to the \emph{de novo} molecular generation problem from
mass spectra involves a two-stage pipeline: (1) encoding mass spectra into
molecular fingerprints, followed by (2) decoding these fingerprints into
molecular structures. In our work, we adopt
\textsc{MIST}~\citep{MISTgoldmanAnnotatingMetaboliteMass2023} as the encoder
and \textsc{MolForge}~\citep{ucakReconstructionLosslessMolecular2023} as the
decoder, leveraging pretraining to enhance performance. Notably, pretraining
\textsc{MolForge} proves especially effective, enabling it to serve as a robust
fingerprint-to-structure decoder. Additionally, instead of passing the
probability of each bit in the fingerprint, thresholding the probabilities as a
step function helps focus the decoder on the presence of substructures,
improving recovery of accurate molecular structures even when the fingerprints
predicted by \textsc{MIST} only moderately resembles the ground truth in terms
of Tanimoto similarity. This combination of encoder and decoder results in a
tenfold improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods, generating top-1
28\% / top-10 36\% of molecular structures correctly from mass spectra. We
position this pipeline as a strong baseline for future research in \emph{de
novo} molecule elucidation from mass spectra.

*Chengcheng Yan,Jiawei Xu,Zheng Peng,Qingsong Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAMT is a novel method for training deep neural networks using block-wise alternating updates and adaptive step sizes, improving stability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard methods like SGD update all parameters simultaneously, leading to unstable convergence and high computational costs.

Method: SAMT decomposes optimization into sub-problems for each layer, using alternating updates and meta-learning-based adaptive step sizes.

Result: SAMT achieves better generalization with fewer updates and provides theoretical convergence guarantees.

Conclusion: SAMT is effective and efficient for neural network optimization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The training of deep neural networks is inherently a nonconvex optimization
problem, yet standard approaches such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
require simultaneous updates to all parameters, often leading to unstable
convergence and high computational cost. To address these issues, we propose a
novel method, Stochastic Alternating Minimization with Trainable Step Sizes
(SAMT), which updates network parameters in an alternating manner by treating
the weights of each layer as a block. By decomposing the overall optimization
into sub-problems corresponding to different blocks, this block-wise
alternating strategy reduces per-step computational overhead and enhances
training stability in nonconvex settings. To fully leverage these benefits,
inspired by meta-learning, we proposed a novel adaptive step size strategy to
incorporate into the sub-problem solving steps of alternating updates. It
supports different types of trainable step sizes, including but not limited to
scalar, element-wise, row-wise, and column-wise, enabling adaptive step size
selection tailored to each block via meta-learning. We further provide a
theoretical convergence guarantee for the proposed algorithm, establishing its
optimization soundness. Extensive experiments for multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that SAMT achieves better generalization performance with fewer
parameter updates compared to state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its
effectiveness and potential in neural network optimization.

*Ruike Song,Zeen Song,Huijie Guo,Wenwen Qiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Causal Reward Adjustment (CRA) mitigates reward hacking in external reasoning systems by correcting confounding semantic features, improving accuracy without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward hacking in process reward models (PRMs) leads to incorrect answers due to high-scoring but logically flawed reasoning paths.

Method: CRA uses sparse autoencoders on PRM activations to recover interpretable features and applies backdoor adjustment to correct confounding.

Result: CRA reduces reward hacking and enhances accuracy on math-solving tasks without modifying the policy model or retraining PRM.

Conclusion: CRA effectively addresses reward hacking by leveraging causal inference, improving reasoning path selection in complex tasks.

Abstract: External reasoning systems combine language models with process reward models
(PRMs) to select high-quality reasoning paths for complex tasks such as
mathematical problem solving. However, these systems are prone to reward
hacking, where high-scoring but logically incorrect paths are assigned high
scores by the PRMs, leading to incorrect answers. From a causal inference
perspective, we attribute this phenomenon primarily to the presence of
confounding semantic features. To address it, we propose Causal Reward
Adjustment (CRA), a method that mitigates reward hacking by estimating the true
reward of a reasoning path. CRA trains sparse autoencoders on the PRM's
internal activations to recover interpretable features, then corrects
confounding by using backdoor adjustment. Experiments on math solving datasets
demonstrate that CRA mitigates reward hacking and improves final accuracy,
without modifying the policy model or retraining PRM.

TL;DR: The paper introduces symmetric divergences to BRPO for offline RL, addressing challenges like lack of analytic policies and numerical issues via Taylor series and decomposition, proposing S$f$-AC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use asymmetric divergences (e.g., KL), but symmetric divergences pose challenges like no analytic policy and numerical issues. The paper aims to solve these.

Method: Uses Taylor series of $f$-divergence to derive analytic policies and decomposes symmetric divergences to address numerical issues, leading to S$f$-AC.

Result: S$f$-AC performs competitively in distribution approximation and MuJoCo experiments.

Conclusion: Symmetric divergences can be practically integrated into BRPO via Taylor series and decomposition, as demonstrated by S$f$-AC.

Abstract: This paper introduces symmetric divergences to behavior regularization policy
optimization (BRPO) to establish a novel offline RL framework. Existing methods
focus on asymmetric divergences such as KL to obtain analytic regularized
policies and a practical minimization objective. We show that symmetric
divergences do not permit an analytic policy as regularization and can incur
numerical issues as loss. We tackle these challenges by the Taylor series of
$f$-divergence. Specifically, we prove that an analytic policy can be obtained
with a finite series. For loss, we observe that symmetric divergences can be
decomposed into an asymmetry and a conditional symmetry term, Taylor-expanding
the latter alleviates numerical issues. Summing together, we propose Symmetric
$f$ Actor-Critic (S$f$-AC), the first practical BRPO algorithm with symmetric
divergences. Experimental results on distribution approximation and MuJoCo
verify that S$f$-AC performs competitively.

TL;DR: DCATS, a data-centric agent for time series, improves AutoML by focusing on data quality, achieving a 6% error reduction in forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent studies show lightweight models perform well in time series forecasting, suggesting data quality improvement as a key AutoML direction.

Method: DCATS leverages metadata to clean time series data while optimizing forecasting performance, tested on traffic volume data.

Result: DCATS reduces forecasting error by 6% on average across models and time horizons.

Conclusion: Data-centric approaches like DCATS hold promise for enhancing AutoML in time series forecasting.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) powered agents have emerged as effective planners
for Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) systems. While most existing AutoML
approaches focus on automating feature engineering and model architecture
search, recent studies in time series forecasting suggest that lightweight
models can often achieve state-of-the-art performance. This observation led us
to explore improving data quality, rather than model architecture, as a
potentially fruitful direction for AutoML on time series data. We propose
DCATS, a Data-Centric Agent for Time Series. DCATS leverages metadata
accompanying time series to clean data while optimizing forecasting
performance. We evaluated DCATS using four time series forecasting models on a
large-scale traffic volume forecasting dataset. Results demonstrate that DCATS
achieves an average 6% error reduction across all tested models and time
horizons, highlighting the potential of data-centric approaches in AutoML for
time series forecasting.

*Nilesh Patil,Ajay Anand*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep learning-based method for automated Doppler angle estimation in ultrasound images reduces errors in blood velocity measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incorrect angle estimation in Doppler ultrasound is a major source of error in blood velocity measurements, necessitating an automated solution.

Method: The approach uses five pre-trained models for feature extraction and a custom shallow network for angle estimation, trained on 2100 carotid ultrasound images with augmentation.

Result: The best model achieved a mean absolute error below the clinical threshold, avoiding misclassification of normal velocities as stenosis.

Conclusion: Deep learning shows promise for automating Doppler angle estimation, with potential integration into commercial ultrasound software.

Abstract: Angle estimation is an important step in the Doppler ultrasound clinical
workflow to measure blood velocity. It is widely recognized that incorrect
angle estimation is a leading cause of error in Doppler-based blood velocity
measurements. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based approach for
automated Doppler angle estimation. The approach was developed using 2100 human
carotid ultrasound images including image augmentation. Five pre-trained models
were used to extract images features, and these features were passed to a
custom shallow network for Doppler angle estimation. Independently,
measurements were obtained by a human observer reviewing the images for
comparison. The mean absolute error (MAE) between the automated and manual
angle estimates ranged from 3.9{\deg} to 9.4{\deg} for the models evaluated.
Furthermore, the MAE for the best performing model was less than the acceptable
clinical Doppler angle error threshold thus avoiding misclassification of
normal velocity values as a stenosis. The results demonstrate potential for
applying a deep-learning based technique for automated ultrasound Doppler angle
estimation. Such a technique could potentially be implemented within the
imaging software on commercial ultrasound scanners.

TL;DR: T3Time is a trimodal framework for multivariate time series forecasting, combining time, spectral, and prompt branches with adaptive feature weighting, outperforming state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for MTSF lack adaptability across forecast horizons and fail to capture nuanced relationships due to rigid inductive biases and static fusion strategies.

Method: Proposes T3Time with time, spectral, and prompt branches, a gating mechanism for feature prioritization, and adaptive cross-modal alignment heads.

Result: Achieves average reductions of 3.28% in MSE and 2.29% in MAE, with strong few-shot learning performance.

Conclusion: T3Time effectively addresses limitations in MTSF by capturing horizon-specific relationships and dynamically adapting feature importance.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) seeks to model temporal dynamics
among variables to predict future trends. Transformer-based models and large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise due to their ability to capture
long-range dependencies and patterns. However, current methods often rely on
rigid inductive biases, ignore intervariable interactions, or apply static
fusion strategies that limit adaptability across forecast horizons. These
limitations create bottlenecks in capturing nuanced, horizon-specific
relationships in time-series data. To solve this problem, we propose T3Time, a
novel trimodal framework consisting of time, spectral, and prompt branches,
where the dedicated frequency encoding branch captures the periodic structures
along with a gating mechanism that learns prioritization between temporal and
spectral features based on the prediction horizon. We also proposed a mechanism
which adaptively aggregates multiple cross-modal alignment heads by dynamically
weighting the importance of each head based on the features. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average reduction of 3.28%
in MSE and 2.29% in MAE. Furthermore, it shows strong generalization in
few-shot learning settings: with 5% training data, we see a reduction in MSE
and MAE by 4.13% and 1.91%, respectively; and with 10% data, by 3.62% and 1.98%
on average. Code - https://github.com/monaf-chowdhury/T3Time/

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mockingbird, a framework to adapt LLMs for general machine learning tasks, showing acceptable performance but noting limitations without human expertise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study explores the potential of LLMs beyond chatbots, driven by curiosity about their capabilities in general machine learning tasks.

Method: Proposes Mockingbird, a framework where LLMs role-play functions and self-reflect to improve performance on machine learning tasks.

Result: LLM-driven methods like Mockingbird achieve acceptable results but fall short of outperforming domain-specific documents or human expert feedback.

Conclusion: While LLMs show promise for general machine learning tasks, self-reflection alone is insufficient to surpass human expertise or specialized knowledge.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now being used with increasing frequency as
chat bots, tasked with the summarizing information or generating text and code
in accordance with user instructions. The rapid increase in reasoning
capabilities and inference speed of LLMs has revealed their remarkable
potential for applications extending beyond the domain of chat bots to general
machine learning tasks. This work is conducted out of the curiosity about such
potential. In this work, we propose a framework Mockingbird to adapt LLMs to
general machine learning tasks and evaluate its performance and scalability on
several general machine learning tasks. The core concept of this framework is
instructing LLMs to role-play functions and reflect on its mistakes to improve
itself. Our evaluation and analysis result shows that LLM-driven machine
learning methods, such as Mockingbird, can achieve acceptable results on common
machine learning tasks; however, solely reflecting on its own currently cannot
outperform the effect of domain-specific documents and feedback from human
experts.

*George Bredis,Stanislav Dereka,Viacheslav Sinii,Ruslan Rakhimov,Daniil Gavrilov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VL-DAC, a lightweight RL algorithm, trains VLMs in synthetic environments, improving performance on real-world benchmarks without degrading image understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs lack the ability to convert visual observations into language-conditioned actions, and existing RL methods struggle with generalization and hyperparameter tuning.

Method: VL-DAC decouples PPO updates for action tokens from value learning at the environment-step level, simplifying training and improving convergence.

Result: VL-DAC achieves significant performance gains (+50% on BALROG, +5% on VSI-Bench, +2% on VisualWebBench) without compromising general image understanding.

Conclusion: VL-DAC demonstrates that simple RL can effectively train VLMs in synthetic environments for real-world applications.

Abstract: Interactive multimodal agents must convert raw visual observations into
coherent sequences of language-conditioned actions -- a capability that current
vision-language models (VLMs) still lack. Earlier reinforcement-learning (RL)
efforts could, in principle, endow VLMs with such skills, but they have seldom
tested whether the learned behaviours generalize beyond their training
simulators, and they depend either on brittle hyperparameter tuning or on
dense-reward environments with low state variability. We introduce
Vision-Language Decoupled Actor-Critic (VL-DAC), a lightweight,
hyperparameter-free RL algorithm. VL-DAC applies PPO updates to action tokens
while learning value only at the environment-step level: an arrangement, to our
knowledge, not previously explored for large VLMs or LLMs. This simple
decoupling removes unstable weighting terms and yields faster, more reliable
convergence. Training a single VLM with VL-DAC in one inexpensive simulator at
a time (MiniWorld, Gym-Cards, ALFWorld, or WebShop) already produces policies
that generalize widely: +50\% relative on BALROG (game-centric agentic
control), +5\% relative on the hardest part of VSI-Bench (spatial planning),
and +2\% on VisualWebBench (web navigation), all without degrading general
image understanding accuracy. These results provide the first evidence that a
simple RL algorithm can train VLMs entirely in cheap synthetic worlds while
delivering measurable gains on real-image agentic, spatial-reasoning, and
web-navigation benchmarks.

TL;DR: A two-phase method, WSS-CL, improves machine unlearning by focusing on weight saliency and contrastive learning, achieving precise unlearning with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine unlearning methods struggle with precision, stability, and domain applicability.

Method: WSS-CL uses weight saliency for targeted unlearning, combining KL divergence for forgetting and contrastive learning for adversarial fine-tuning.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in unlearning efficacy with negligible performance loss.

Conclusion: WSS-CL is effective for supervised and self-supervised settings, bridging the gap to exact unlearning.

Abstract: Machine unlearning, the efficient deletion of the impact of specific data in
a trained model, remains a challenging problem. Current machine unlearning
approaches that focus primarily on data-centric or weight-based strategies
frequently encounter challenges in achieving precise unlearning, maintaining
stability, and ensuring applicability across diverse domains. In this work, we
introduce a new two-phase efficient machine unlearning method for image
classification, in terms of weight saliency, leveraging weight saliency to
focus the unlearning process on critical model parameters. Our method is called
weight saliency soft-guided contrastive learning for efficient machine
unlearning image classification (WSS-CL), which significantly narrows the
performance gap with "exact" unlearning. First, the forgetting stage maximizes
kullback-leibler divergence between output logits and aggregated pseudo-labels
for efficient forgetting in logit space. Next, the adversarial fine-tuning
stage introduces contrastive learning in a self-supervised manner. By using
scaled feature representations, it maximizes the distance between the forgotten
and retained data samples in the feature space, with the forgotten and the
paired augmented samples acting as positive pairs, while the retained samples
act as negative pairs in the contrastive loss computation. Experimental
evaluations reveal that our proposed method yields much-improved unlearning
efficacy with negligible performance loss compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, indicative of its usability in supervised and self-supervised
settings.

*Ali Taheri Ghahrizjani,Alireza Taban,Qizhou Wang,Shanshan Ye,Abdolreza Mirzaei,Tongliang Liu,Bo Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes categorizing tokens into positive and negative ones during supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models (LLMs) to improve performance by focusing on useful tokens and forgetting misleading ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SFT's effectiveness depends on data quality and volume, and poor data can degrade performance. The goal is to reduce reliance on data quality by selectively training on useful tokens.

Method: Tokens are classified as positive (useful) or negative (misleading). Positive tokens are trained normally, while negative tokens are explicitly forgotten to shape a knowledge boundary.

Result: Experiments show the forgetting mechanism improves model performance and increases response diversity.

Conclusion: Token categorization and selective forgetting enhance SFT by refining what the model learns, leading to better performance and more diverse outputs.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) plays a critical role for pretrained large
language models (LLMs), notably enhancing their capacity to acquire
domain-specific knowledge while preserving or potentially augmenting their
general-purpose capabilities. However, the efficacy of SFT hinges on data
quality as well as data volume, otherwise it may result in limited performance
gains or even degradation relative to the associated baselines. To mitigate
such reliance, we suggest categorizing tokens within each corpus into two parts
-- positive and negative tokens -- based on whether they are useful to improve
model performance. Positive tokens can be trained in common ways, whereas
negative tokens, which may lack essential semantics or be misleading, should be
explicitly forgotten. Overall, the token categorization facilitate the model to
learn less informative message, and the forgetting process shapes a knowledge
boundary to guide the model on what information to learn more precisely. We
conduct experiments on well-established benchmarks, finding that this
forgetting mechanism not only improves overall model performance and also
facilitate more diverse model responses.

TL;DR: PrivDFS introduces a distributed feature-sharing method for private inference in MLaaS, balancing privacy and efficiency by partitioning client data among non-colluding servers. Extensions PrivDFS-AT and PrivDFS-KD enhance privacy against inversion attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the privacy-efficiency trade-off in cloud-based MLaaS, where existing methods either compromise privacy or incur high computational costs.

Method: PrivDFS partitions input features into shares distributed to non-colluding servers for partial inference, with secure aggregation for final predictions. PrivDFS-AT uses adversarial training, and PrivDFS-KD employs user-specific keys.

Result: Achieves privacy comparable to deep split inference, reduces client computation by 100x with no accuracy loss, and resists inversion attacks.

Conclusion: PrivDFS offers a scalable, efficient, and privacy-preserving solution for MLaaS, with robust extensions against attacks.

Abstract: Cloud-based Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) raises serious privacy
concerns when handling sensitive client data. Existing Private Inference (PI)
methods face a fundamental trade-off between privacy and efficiency:
cryptographic approaches offer strong protection but incur high computational
overhead, while efficient alternatives such as split inference expose
intermediate features to inversion attacks. We propose PrivDFS, a new paradigm
for private inference that replaces a single exposed representation with
distributed feature sharing. PrivDFS partitions input features on the client
into multiple balanced shares, which are distributed to non-colluding,
non-communicating servers for independent partial inference. The client
securely aggregates the servers' outputs to reconstruct the final prediction,
ensuring that no single server observes sufficient information to compromise
input privacy. To further strengthen privacy, we propose two key extensions:
PrivDFS-AT, which uses adversarial training with a diffusion-based proxy
attacker to enforce inversion-resistant feature partitioning, and PrivDFS-KD,
which leverages user-specific keys to diversify partitioning policies and
prevent query-based inversion generalization. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and
CelebA demonstrate that PrivDFS achieves privacy comparable to deep split
inference while cutting client computation by up to 100 times with no accuracy
loss, and that the extensions remain robust against both diffusion-based
in-distribution and adaptive attacks.

*Justin Lee,Behnaz Moradijamei,Heman Shakeri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MMSFM extends flow matching to align high-dimensional data at irregular time points without dimensionality reduction, using measure-valued splines and score matching for robustness and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional dimensionality reduction oversimplifies dynamics and misses transient behaviors in non-equilibrium systems, necessitating a method for high-dimensional data alignment at irregular times.

Method: MMSFM extends simulation-free score and flow matching to multi-marginal settings, using measure-valued splines for irregular timing and score matching to prevent overfitting.

Result: Validated on synthetic and benchmark datasets, including gene expression and image progression tasks, showing versatility and effectiveness.

Conclusion: MMSFM provides a robust and accurate framework for modeling high-dimensional systems from irregular snapshot observations, preserving critical dynamics.

Abstract: Modeling the evolution of high-dimensional systems from limited snapshot
observations at irregular time points poses a significant challenge in
quantitative biology and related fields. Traditional approaches often rely on
dimensionality reduction techniques, which can oversimplify the dynamics and
fail to capture critical transient behaviors in non-equilibrium systems. We
present Multi-Marginal Stochastic Flow Matching (MMSFM), a novel extension of
simulation-free score and flow matching methods to the multi-marginal setting,
enabling the alignment of high-dimensional data measured at non-equidistant
time points without reducing dimensionality. The use of measure-valued splines
enhances robustness to irregular snapshot timing, and score matching prevents
overfitting in high-dimensional spaces. We validate our framework on several
synthetic and benchmark datasets, including gene expression data collected at
uneven time points and an image progression task, demonstrating the method's
versatility.

*Zahra Ebrahimi,Raheleh Salehi,Nassir Navab,Carsten Marr,Ario Sadafi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a continual learning method for Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) to prevent catastrophic forgetting in dynamic environments like leukemia diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the inefficacy of existing continual learning methods for MIL, crucial for single-cell-based disease diagnosis.

Method: Rehearsal-based approach using instance attention scores and distance metrics to select and store diverse samples.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in class incremental scenarios using real-world leukemia data.

Conclusion: Enables model adaptation to shifting data distributions, advancing continual learning for MIL.

Abstract: The dynamic environment of laboratories and clinics, with streams of data
arriving on a daily basis, requires regular updates of trained machine learning
models for consistent performance. Continual learning is supposed to help train
models without catastrophic forgetting. However, state-of-the-art methods are
ineffective for multiple instance learning (MIL), which is often used in
single-cell-based hematologic disease diagnosis (e.g., leukemia detection).
Here, we propose the first continual learning method tailored specifically to
MIL. Our method is rehearsal-based over a selection of single instances from
various bags. We use a combination of the instance attention score and distance
from the bag mean and class mean vectors to carefully select which samples and
instances to store in exemplary sets from previous tasks, preserving the
diversity of the data. Using the real-world input of one month of data from a
leukemia laboratory, we study the effectiveness of our approach in a class
incremental scenario, comparing it to well-known continual learning methods. We
show that our method considerably outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
providing the first continual learning approach for MIL. This enables the
adaptation of models to shifting data distributions over time, such as those
caused by changes in disease occurrence or underlying genetic alterations.

### [286] [FlexQ: Efficient Post-training INT6 Quantization for LLM Serving via Algorithm-System Co-Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04405)
*Hao Zhang,Aining Jia,Weifeng Bu,Yushu Cai,Kai Sheng,Hao Chen,Xin He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlexQ is a post-training INT6 quantization framework for LLMs, balancing accuracy and efficiency by combining algorithmic innovation with GPU kernel optimizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face high memory and computational costs, and existing INT4/INT8 quantization methods degrade accuracy or efficiency. INT6 offers a better trade-off but lacks hardware support.

Method: FlexQ uses uniform 6-bit weight quantization and adaptive 8-bit activations, supported by a custom GPU kernel for W6A6/W6A8 via Binary Tensor Core equivalents.

Result: FlexQ maintains near-FP16 accuracy (â¤0.05 perplexity increase) and achieves 1.39Ã speedup over ABQ-LLM, with 1.33Ã inference acceleration and 1.21Ã memory savings over SmoothQuant.

Conclusion: FlexQ effectively addresses the INT6 hardware gap, offering a practical solution for efficient LLM deployment without significant accuracy loss.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance but entail
significant memory and computational costs, restricting their practical
deployment. While existing INT4/INT8 quantization reduces these costs, they
often degrade accuracy or lack optimal efficiency. INT6 quantization offers a
superior trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency, but lacks
hardware support in modern GPUs, forcing emulation via higher-precision
arithmetic units that limit acceleration.
  In this paper, we propose FlexQ, a novel post-training INT6 quantization
framework combining algorithmic innovation with system-level optimizations.
FlexQ employs uniform 6-bit weight quantization across all layers, with
adaptive retention of 8-bit activations in layers identified through layer-wise
sensitivity analysis. To maximize hardware efficiency, we develop a specialized
high-performance GPU kernel supporting matrix multiplication for W6A6 and W6A8
representations via Binary Tensor Core (BTC) equivalents, effectively bypassing
the lack of native INT6 tensor cores. Evaluations on LLaMA models show FlexQ
maintains near-FP16 accuracy, with perplexity increases of no more than 0.05.
The proposed kernel achieves an average 1.39$\times$ speedup over ABQ-LLM on
LLaMA-2-70B linear layers. End-to-end, FlexQ delivers 1.33$\times$ inference
acceleration and 1.21$\times$ memory savings over SmoothQuant. Code is released

*Md Raisul Kibria,SÃ©bastien Lafond,Janan Arslan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A systematic review of multimodal model explainability research (2020-2024) highlights gaps in explanation methods and evaluation practices, recommending standardized approaches for future work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of multimodal learning and demand for explainable AI (XAI) drive the need to analyze and improve the interpretability of these models.

Method: The study reviews literature on multimodal XAI, focusing on model architecture, modalities, explanation algorithms, and evaluation methods.

Result: Most research targets vision-language models using attention-based techniques, but lacks systematic evaluation and fails to fully capture cross-modal interactions.

Conclusion: The paper recommends standardized evaluation practices to enhance transparency and accountability in multimodal XAI research.

Abstract: Multimodal learning has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years,
particularly with the integration of attention-based models, leading to
significant performance gains across a variety of tasks. Parallel to this
progress, the demand for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has spurred
a growing body of research aimed at interpreting the complex decision-making
processes of these models. This systematic literature review analyzes research
published between January 2020 and early 2024 that focuses on the
explainability of multimodal models. Framed within the broader goals of XAI, we
examine the literature across multiple dimensions, including model
architecture, modalities involved, explanation algorithms and evaluation
methodologies. Our analysis reveals that the majority of studies are
concentrated on vision-language and language-only models, with attention-based
techniques being the most commonly employed for explanation. However, these
methods often fall short in capturing the full spectrum of interactions between
modalities, a challenge further compounded by the architectural heterogeneity
across domains. Importantly, we find that evaluation methods for XAI in
multimodal settings are largely non-systematic, lacking consistency,
robustness, and consideration for modality-specific cognitive and contextual
factors. Based on these findings, we provide a comprehensive set of
recommendations aimed at promoting rigorous, transparent, and standardized
evaluation and reporting practices in multimodal XAI research. Our goal is to
support future research in more interpretable, accountable, and responsible
mulitmodal AI systems, with explainability at their core.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently estimate matrix norms in a matrix-free setting, addressing needs in deep neural network training and adversarial attack mitigation.

Result: Demonstrates practical utility in Jacobian-based regularization for deep learning and adversarial attack mitigation in recommender systems.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms are effective for matrix norm estimation and have broad applications in machine learning.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose new randomized algorithms for estimating the
two-to-infinity and one-to-two norms in a matrix-free setting, using only
matrix-vector multiplications. Our methods are based on appropriate
modifications of Hutchinson's diagonal estimator and its Hutch++ version. We
provide oracle complexity bounds for both modifications. We further illustrate
the practical utility of our algorithms for Jacobian-based regularization in
deep neural network training on image classification tasks. We also demonstrate
that our methodology can be applied to mitigate the effect of adversarial
attacks in the domain of recommender systems.

*Biao Hu,Guoyin Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CMCFAE integrates the cloud model into WAE, improving latent space regularization and sample diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address homogenization in reconstructed samples and enhance latent space flexibility.

Method: Uses cloud model characteristic functions for regularization within the WAE framework.

Result: Outperforms existing models on MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA in reconstruction and diversity.

Conclusion: CMCFAE offers a novel approach for enhancing autoencoder-based generative models.

Abstract: We introduce Cloud Model Characteristic Function Auto-Encoder (CMCFAE), a
novel generative model that integrates the cloud model into the Wasserstein
Auto-Encoder (WAE) framework. By leveraging the characteristic functions of the
cloud model to regularize the latent space, our approach enables more accurate
modeling of complex data distributions. Unlike conventional methods that rely
on a standard Gaussian prior and traditional divergence measures, our method
employs a cloud model prior, providing a more flexible and realistic
representation of the latent space, thus mitigating the homogenization observed
in reconstructed samples. We derive the characteristic function of the cloud
model and propose a corresponding regularizer within the WAE framework.
Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on MNIST, FashionMNIST,
CIFAR-10, and CelebA demonstrate that CMCFAE outperforms existing models in
terms of reconstruction quality, latent space structuring, and sample
diversity. This work not only establishes a novel integration of cloud model
theory with MMD-based regularization but also offers a promising new
perspective for enhancing autoencoder-based generative models.

### [290] [Automatic LLM Red Teaming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04451)
*Roman Belaire,Arunesh Sinha,Pradeep Varakantham*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel AI-driven red teaming approach for LLMs using hierarchical RL to simulate multi-turn adversarial dialogues, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated red teaming methods for LLMs are limited by simplistic prompt templates or single-turn attacks, failing to mimic real-world adversarial interactions.

Method: The authors formalize red teaming as an MDP and use hierarchical RL with token-level harm rewards to train an AI agent for multi-turn attack strategies.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance, uncovering subtle vulnerabilities missed by traditional baselines.

Conclusion: This work reframes LLM red teaming as a dynamic, trajectory-based process, crucial for robust AI deployment.

Abstract: Red teaming is critical for identifying vulnerabilities and building trust in
current LLMs. However, current automated methods for Large Language Models
(LLMs) rely on brittle prompt templates or single-turn attacks, failing to
capture the complex, interactive nature of real-world adversarial dialogues. We
propose a novel paradigm: training an AI to strategically `break' another AI.
By formalizing red teaming as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employing a
hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework, we effectively address the
inherent sparse reward and long-horizon challenges. Our generative agent learns
coherent, multi-turn attack strategies through a fine-grained, token-level harm
reward, enabling it to uncover subtle vulnerabilities missed by existing
baselines. This approach sets a new state-of-the-art, fundamentally reframing
LLM red teaming as a dynamic, trajectory-based process (rather than a one-step
test) essential for robust AI deployment.

### [291] [Small transformer architectures for task switching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04461)
*Claudius Gros*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores task-switching in small-scale AI applications, showing standard transformers struggle with basic tasks, while modified architectures like cisformer and extensive attention achieve high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why attention-based architectures underperform in small-scale applications compared to traditional methods, focusing on task-switching scenarios.

Method: Evaluated transformers, LSTMs, MLPs, and modified architectures (cisformer, extensive attention) on a task-switching framework with arithmetic subtasks (IARC).

Result: Standard transformers, LSTMs, and MLPs showed modest accuracy, while a combination of cisformer and extensive attention achieved ~95% performance.

Conclusion: Attention mechanisms can be better understood and improved by comparing different formulations in task-switching settings.

Abstract: The rapid progress seen in terms of large-scale generative AI is largely
based on the attention mechanism. It is conversely non-trivial to conceive
small-scale applications for which attention-based architectures outperform
traditional approaches, such as multi-layer perceptrons or recurrent networks.
We examine this problem in the context of 'task switching'. In this framework
models work on ongoing token sequences with the current task being determined
by stochastically interspersed control tokens. We show that standard
transformers cannot solve a basic task switching reference model based on
finite domain arithmetics which contains subtasks dedicated to increment /
addition / reverse copy / context (IARC). We show that transformers, long
short-term memory recurrent networks (LSTM), and plain multi-layer perceptrons
(MLPs) achieve similar, but only modest prediction accuracies. We enlarge our
comparative study by including an extension of the standard transformer
architecture to its non-translational invariant counterpart, the cisformer, and
an alternative attention mechanism, extensive attention. A combination of the
latter is found to be the only model able to achieve considerable performance
levels, of around 95%. Our results indicate that the workings of attention can
be understood better, and even improved, when comparing qualitatively different
formulations in task-switching settings.

### [292] [CARD: Cache-Assisted Parallel Speculative Decoding for Efficient Large Language Model Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04462)
*Enyu Zhou,Kai Sheng,Hao Chen,Xin He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CARD introduces a cache-based parallel speculative decoding framework to decouple drafting and verification, achieving up to 4.83x speedup over vanilla decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speculative decoding methods are inefficient due to sequential drafting and verification, and wasteful token rejection.

Method: CARD uses a 'query-and-correct' paradigm: the draft model populates a shared cache while the target model concurrently corrects the generation direction.

Result: Achieves up to 4.83x speedup without fine-tuning the draft or target models.

Conclusion: CARD improves LLM inference efficiency by enabling parallel drafting and verification.

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD), where an extra draft model first provides multiple
draft tokens and the original target model then verifies these tokens in
parallel, has shown great power for LLM inference acceleration. However,
existing SD methods must adhere to the 'draft-then-verify' paradigm, which
forces drafting and verification processes to execute sequentially during SD,
resulting in inefficient inference performance and limiting the size of the
draft model. Furthermore, once a single token in the candidate sequence is
rejected during the drafting process, all subsequent candidate tokens must be
discarded, leading to inefficient drafting. To address these challenges, we
propose a cache-based parallel speculative decoding framework employing a
'query-and-correct' paradigm. Specifically, CARD decouples drafting and
verification: the draft model generates candidate tokens to populate a shared
cache, while the target model concurrently rectifies the draft model's
generation direction. This effectively enables the target model to perform
inference at speed approaching that of the draft model. Our approach achieves
up to 4.83 speedup over vanilla decoding without requiring fine-tuning of
either the draft or target models. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GFocal, a Transformer-based neural operator, enhances PDE solving by integrating global and local feature learning, outperforming benchmarks by 15.2%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods neglect the interplay between local and global features in PDEs, crucial for multiscale problems and stability.

Method: GFocal uses NystrÃ¶m attention for global blocks and slice-based focal blocks for local features, fused via convolution-based gating.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 15.2% relative gain in benchmarks and excels in industry-scale simulations.

Conclusion: GFocal effectively balances global and local feature learning, improving accuracy and stability in PDE modeling.

Abstract: Transformer-based neural operators have emerged as promising surrogate
solvers for partial differential equations, by leveraging the effectiveness of
Transformers for capturing long-range dependencies and global correlations,
profoundly proven in language modeling. However, existing methodologies
overlook the coordinated learning of interdependencies between local physical
details and global features, which are essential for tackling multiscale
problems, preserving physical consistency and numerical stability in long-term
rollouts, and accurately capturing transitional dynamics. In this work, we
propose GFocal, a Transformer-based neural operator method that enforces
simultaneous global and local feature learning and fusion. Global correlations
and local features are harnessed through Nystr\"{o}m attention-based
\textbf{g}lobal blocks and slices-based \textbf{focal} blocks to generate
physics-aware tokens, subsequently modulated and integrated via
convolution-based gating blocks, enabling dynamic fusion of multiscale
information. GFocal achieves accurate modeling and prediction of physical
features given arbitrary geometries and initial conditions. Experiments show
that GFocal achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average 15.2\%
relative gain in five out of six benchmarks and also excels in industry-scale
simulations such as aerodynamics simulation of automotives and airfoils.

TL;DR: FedHiP introduces a gradient-free PFL method to address non-IID data challenges, outperforming baselines by 5.79%-20.97%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PFL methods struggle with non-IID data due to gradient-based updates, hindering convergence and performance.

Method: FedHiP uses self-supervised pre-training and closed-form solutions for feature extraction and classifier training, avoiding gradients.

Result: FedHiP achieves heterogeneity invariance and outperforms baselines by 5.79%-20.97% in accuracy.

Conclusion: FedHiP effectively addresses non-IID data challenges in PFL with gradient-free solutions, offering superior performance.

Abstract: Lately, Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has emerged as a prevalent
paradigm to deliver personalized models by collaboratively training while
simultaneously adapting to each client's local applications. Existing PFL
methods typically face a significant challenge due to the ubiquitous data
heterogeneity (i.e., non-IID data) across clients, which severely hinders
convergence and degrades performance. We identify that the root issue lies in
the long-standing reliance on gradient-based updates, which are inherently
sensitive to non-IID data. To fundamentally address this issue and bridge the
research gap, in this paper, we propose a Heterogeneity-invariant Personalized
Federated learning scheme, named FedHiP, through analytical (i.e., closed-form)
solutions to avoid gradient-based updates. Specifically, we exploit the trend
of self-supervised pre-training, leveraging a foundation model as a frozen
backbone for gradient-free feature extraction. Following the feature extractor,
we further develop an analytic classifier for gradient-free training. To
support both collective generalization and individual personalization, our
FedHiP scheme incorporates three phases: analytic local training, analytic
global aggregation, and analytic local personalization. The closed-form
solutions of our FedHiP scheme enable its ideal property of heterogeneity
invariance, meaning that each personalized model remains identical regardless
of how non-IID the data are distributed across all other clients. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets validate the superiority of our FedHiP
scheme, outperforming the state-of-the-art baselines by at least 5.79%-20.97%
in accuracy.

TL;DR: Wall insulation reduces gas demand by 19% on average, but savings vary by energy burden groups. High-burden households reallocate savings to comfort, not consumption reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the heterogeneous impact of energy efficiency interventions like wall insulation on gas consumption, especially across different energy burden subgroups.

Method: A causal machine learning model trained on nationally representative data of the English housing stock to estimate treatment effects of wall insulation.

Result: Average gas demand drops by 19%, but low-burden groups save more, while high-burden groups see little reduction due to reallocating savings to comfort.

Conclusion: Energy policies should consider both climate impacts and equity, as behavioral responses to efficiency gains reflect rational adjustments in deprived contexts.

Abstract: Reducing domestic energy demand is central to climate mitigation and fuel
poverty strategies, yet the impact of energy efficiency interventions is highly
heterogeneous. Using a causal machine learning model trained on nationally
representative data of the English housing stock, we estimate average and
conditional treatment effects of wall insulation on gas consumption, focusing
on distributional effects across energy burden subgroups. While interventions
reduce gas demand on average (by as much as 19 percent), low energy burden
groups achieve substantial savings, whereas those experiencing high energy
burdens see little to no reduction. This pattern reflects a
behaviourally-driven mechanism: households constrained by high costs-to-income
ratios (e.g. more than 0.1) reallocate savings toward improved thermal comfort
rather than lowering consumption. Far from wasteful, such responses represent
rational adjustments in contexts of prior deprivation, with potential
co-benefits for health and well-being. These findings call for a broader
evaluation framework that accounts for both climate impacts and the equity
implications of domestic energy policy.

*Erin Lanus,Daniel Wolodkin,Laura J. Freeman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces hierarchical scoring metrics for ML models to evaluate misclassifications based on their distance in a class taxonomy, offering finer-grained performance analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional pass/fail scoring treats all misclassifications equally, ignoring hierarchical relationships between classes. This work aims to provide nuanced evaluation by considering class taxonomy.

Method: Develops hierarchical scoring metrics using scoring trees to encode class relationships, enabling partial credit for predictions based on their distance from ground truth.

Result: Demonstrates that hierarchical metrics capture errors with finer granularity and allow tuning via scoring trees, reflecting the impact of misclassifications.

Conclusion: Proposes a refined approach to ML evaluation, ranking models by error impact rather than just quantity, with open-source Python implementations provided.

Abstract: A common use of machine learning (ML) models is predicting the class of a
sample. Object detection is an extension of classification that includes
localization of the object via a bounding box within the sample.
Classification, and by extension object detection, is typically evaluated by
counting a prediction as incorrect if the predicted label does not match the
ground truth label. This pass/fail scoring treats all misclassifications as
equivalent. In many cases, class labels can be organized into a class taxonomy
with a hierarchical structure to either reflect relationships among the data or
operator valuation of misclassifications. When such a hierarchical structure
exists, hierarchical scoring metrics can return the model performance of a
given prediction related to the distance between the prediction and the ground
truth label. Such metrics can be viewed as giving partial credit to predictions
instead of pass/fail, enabling a finer-grained understanding of the impact of
misclassifications. This work develops hierarchical scoring metrics varying in
complexity that utilize scoring trees to encode relationships between class
labels and produce metrics that reflect distance in the scoring tree. The
scoring metrics are demonstrated on an abstract use case with scoring trees
that represent three weighting strategies and evaluated by the kind of errors
discouraged. Results demonstrate that these metrics capture errors with finer
granularity and the scoring trees enable tuning. This work demonstrates an
approach to evaluating ML performance that ranks models not only by how many
errors are made but by the kind or impact of errors. Python implementations of
the scoring metrics will be available in an open-source repository at time of
publication.

TL;DR: Causal Reflection framework enhances causal reasoning in LLMs and RL agents by modeling causality dynamically and introducing a Reflect mechanism for self-correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of LLMs and RL agents in robust causal reasoning and understanding why actions lead to outcomes.

Method: Introduces Causal Reflection, modeling causality as a dynamic function, and a Reflect mechanism to identify mismatches and generate causal hypotheses.

Result: Enables agents to reason about delayed/nonlinear effects, adapt, self-correct, and communicate causal understanding.

Conclusion: The framework provides a theoretical foundation for causal-reflective agents in evolving environments.

Abstract: While LLMs exhibit impressive fluency and factual recall, they struggle with
robust causal reasoning, often relying on spurious correlations and brittle
patterns. Similarly, traditional Reinforcement Learning agents also lack causal
understanding, optimizing for rewards without modeling why actions lead to
outcomes. We introduce Causal Reflection, a framework that explicitly models
causality as a dynamic function over state, action, time, and perturbation,
enabling agents to reason about delayed and nonlinear effects. Additionally, we
define a formal Reflect mechanism that identifies mismatches between predicted
and observed outcomes and generates causal hypotheses to revise the agent's
internal model. In this architecture, LLMs serve not as black-box reasoners,
but as structured inference engines translating formal causal outputs into
natural language explanations and counterfactuals. Our framework lays the
theoretical groundwork for Causal Reflective agents that can adapt,
self-correct, and communicate causal understanding in evolving environments.

TL;DR: PRISM is a lightweight, efficient feature extractor for multivariate time-series classification, outperforming CNN and Transformer models with fewer parameters and FLOPs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Transformer- and CNN-based models for time-series classification are computationally heavy, lack frequency diversity, and require large parameter budgets.

Method: PRISM uses symmetric FIR filters at multiple temporal scales per channel, avoiding inter-channel convolutions for reduced complexity.

Result: PRISM matches or outperforms leading baselines in human-activity, sleep-stage, and biomedical benchmarks with significantly fewer parameters and FLOPs.

Conclusion: PRISM combines signal processing insights with deep learning for an accurate, resource-efficient solution in time-series classification.

Abstract: Multivariate time-series classification is pivotal in domains ranging from
wearable sensing to biomedical monitoring. Despite recent advances,
Transformer- and CNN-based models often remain computationally heavy, offer
limited frequency diversity, and require extensive parameter budgets. We
propose PRISM (Per-channel Resolution-Informed Symmetric Module), a
convolutional-based feature extractor that applies symmetric
finite-impulse-response (FIR) filters at multiple temporal scales,
independently per channel. This multi-resolution, per-channel design yields
highly frequency-selective embeddings without any inter-channel convolutions,
greatly reducing model size and complexity. Across human-activity, sleep-stage
and biomedical benchmarks, PRISM, paired with lightweight classification heads,

roughly an order of magnitude fewer parameters and FLOPs. By uniting classical
signal processing insights with modern deep learning, PRISM offers an accurate,

### [300] [Channel-Independent Federated Traffic Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04517)
*Mo Zhang,Xiaoyu Li,Bin Xu,Meng Chen,Yongshun Gong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Channel-Independent Paradigm (CIP) and Fed-CI framework for federated traffic prediction, reducing communication overhead and improving accuracy without inter-client data sharing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traffic data is distributed and privacy-constrained, making existing federated methods inefficient due to high communication costs and delays.

Method: Proposes CIP for local predictions without inter-client communication and develops Fed-CI, a federated learning framework, to mitigate information loss.

Result: Fed-CI outperforms existing methods by 8-16% in RMSE, MAE, and MAPE while reducing communication costs.

Conclusion: Fed-CI offers a sustainable, privacy-compliant solution for federated traffic prediction with superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: In recent years, traffic prediction has achieved remarkable success and has
become an integral component of intelligent transportation systems. However,
traffic data is typically distributed among multiple data owners, and privacy
constraints prevent the direct utilization of these isolated datasets for
traffic prediction. Most existing federated traffic prediction methods focus on
designing communication mechanisms that allow models to leverage information
from other clients in order to improve prediction accuracy. Unfortunately, such
approaches often incur substantial communication overhead, and the resulting
transmission delays significantly slow down the training process. As the volume
of traffic data continues to grow, this issue becomes increasingly critical,
making the resource consumption of current methods unsustainable. To address
this challenge, we propose a novel variable relationship modeling paradigm for
federated traffic prediction, termed the Channel-Independent Paradigm(CIP).
Unlike traditional approaches, CIP eliminates the need for inter-client
communication by enabling each node to perform efficient and accurate
predictions using only local information. Based on the CIP, we further develop
Fed-CI, an efficient federated learning framework, allowing each client to
process its own data independently while effectively mitigating the information
loss caused by the lack of direct data sharing among clients. Fed-CI
significantly reduces communication overhead, accelerates the training process,
and achieves state-of-the-art performance while complying with privacy
regulations. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate
that Fed-CI consistently outperforms existing methods across all datasets and
federated settings. It achieves improvements of 8%, 14%, and 16% in RMSE, MAE,
and MAPE, respectively, while also substantially reducing communication costs.

*Haoran Niu,K. Suzanne Barber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes 5,000 identity theft cases to model privacy risks using a graph-based framework, predicting further data exposure likelihoods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and mitigating privacy risks by identifying how personal data exposures lead to further disclosures.

Method: Constructs an Identity Ecosystem graph with PII attributes as nodes and empirical disclosure relationships as edges. Uses graph theory and neural networks for risk prediction.

Result: The framework effectively predicts the likelihood of further disclosures when certain PII attributes are compromised.

Conclusion: The approach provides a foundational model for assessing and predicting privacy risks in identity data exposures.

Abstract: It is difficult for individuals and organizations to protect personal
information without a fundamental understanding of relative privacy risks. By
analyzing over 5,000 empirical identity theft and fraud cases, this research
identifies which types of personal data are exposed, how frequently exposures
occur, and what the consequences of those exposures are. We construct an
Identity Ecosystem graph--a foundational, graph-based model in which nodes
represent personally identifiable information (PII) attributes and edges
represent empirical disclosure relationships between them (e.g., the
probability that one PII attribute is exposed due to the exposure of another).
Leveraging this graph structure, we develop a privacy risk prediction framework
that uses graph theory and graph neural networks to estimate the likelihood of
further disclosures when certain PII attributes are compromised. The results
show that our approach effectively answers the core question: Can the
disclosure of a given identity attribute possibly lead to the disclosure of
another attribute?

*Ziheng Sun,Qi Feng,Lehao Lin,Chris Ding,Jicong Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphProp trains graph foundation models (GFMs) by emphasizing structural generalization, outperforming competitors in graph classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional GFMs lack structural cross-domain generalization, despite graph structures providing consistent cross-domain information.

Method: GraphProp trains a structural GFM by predicting graph invariants, then uses its representations as positional encodings for a comprehensive GFM.

Result: GraphProp significantly outperforms competitors in supervised and few-shot learning, especially for graphs without node attributes.

Conclusion: Emphasizing structural generalization in GFMs improves cross-domain performance, making GraphProp a robust solution for graph-level tasks.

Abstract: This work focuses on training graph foundation models (GFMs) that have strong
generalization ability in graph-level tasks such as graph classification.
Effective GFM training requires capturing information consistent across
different domains. We discover that graph structures provide more consistent
cross-domain information compared to node features and graph labels. However,
traditional GFMs primarily focus on transferring node features from various
domains into a unified representation space but often lack structural
cross-domain generalization. To address this, we introduce GraphProp, which
emphasizes structural generalization. The training process of GraphProp
consists of two main phases. First, we train a structural GFM by predicting
graph invariants. Since graph invariants are properties of graphs that depend
only on the abstract structure, not on particular labellings or drawings of the
graph, this structural GFM has a strong ability to capture the abstract
structural information and provide discriminative graph representations
comparable across diverse domains. In the second phase, we use the
representations given by the structural GFM as positional encodings to train a
comprehensive GFM. This phase utilizes domain-specific node attributes and
graph labels to further improve cross-domain node feature generalization. Our
experiments demonstrate that GraphProp significantly outperforms the
competitors in supervised learning and few-shot learning, especially in
handling graphs without node attributes.

*Jan A. Zak,Christian WeiÃenfels*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Physics-informed neural networks predict weld nugget diameter non-invasively in aluminum spot welding using novel training strategies and a 2D model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Destructive testing for weld nugget diameter measurement limits quality control efficiency in automotive resistance spot welding.

Method: Two novel training strategies: fading-in experimental losses and conditional material parameter updates. A 2D model ensures accuracy and efficiency.

Result: The network predicts displacement and nugget growth within experimental confidence, enabling model-based quality control.

Conclusion: The approach shows strong potential for fast, non-invasive quality assessment in industrial spot welding applications.

Abstract: Resistance spot welding is the dominant joining process for the body-in-white
in the automotive industry, where the weld nugget diameter is the key quality
metric. Its measurement requires destructive testing, limiting the potential
for efficient quality control. Physics-informed neural networks were
investigated as a promising tool to reconstruct internal process states from
experimental data, enabling model-based and non-invasive quality assessment in
aluminum spot welding. A major challenge is the integration of real-world data
into the network due to competing optimization objectives. To address this, we
introduce two novel training strategies. First, experimental losses for dynamic
displacement and nugget diameter are progressively included using a fading-in
function to prevent excessive optimization conflicts. We also implement a
custom learning rate scheduler and early stopping based on a rolling window to
counteract premature reduction due to increased loss magnitudes. Second, we
introduce a conditional update of temperature-dependent material parameters via
a look-up table, activated only after a loss threshold is reached to ensure
physically meaningful temperatures. An axially symmetric two-dimensional model
was selected to represent the welding process accurately while maintaining
computational efficiency. To reduce computational burden, the training
strategies and model components were first systematically evaluated in one
dimension, enabling controlled analysis of loss design and contact models. The
two-dimensional network predicts dynamic displacement and nugget growth within
the experimental confidence interval, supports transferring welding stages from
steel to aluminum, and demonstrates strong potential for fast, model-based
quality control in industrial applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize and unify the dynamics of flow and diffusion models, extending their capabilities across multiple dimensional spaces.

Method: Uses operator-based interpolants to bridge probability distributions, enabling zero-shot task performance like conditional generation, inpainting, and multiscale modeling.

Result: Demonstrates zero-shot efficacy in tasks such as conditional generation, fine-tuning, posterior sampling, and multiscale modeling.

Conclusion: The framework offers a task-agnostic alternative to specialized models, unifying and extending existing generative approaches.

Abstract: We propose a framework for learning maps between probability distributions
that broadly generalizes the time dynamics of flow and diffusion models. To
enable this, we generalize stochastic interpolants by replacing the scalar time
variable with vectors, matrices, or linear operators, allowing us to bridge
probability distributions across multiple dimensional spaces. This approach
enables the construction of versatile generative models capable of fulfilling
multiple tasks without task-specific training. Our operator-based interpolants
not only provide a unifying theoretical perspective for existing generative
models but also extend their capabilities. Through numerical experiments, we
demonstrate the zero-shot efficacy of our method on conditional generation and
inpainting, fine-tuning and posterior sampling, and multiscale modeling,
suggesting its potential as a generic task-agnostic alternative to specialized
models.

Motivation: Inspired by the brain's hierarchical processing and energy efficiency, the paper aims to create a lifelong learning NIDS.

Method: Uses a static SNN for initial intrusion detection and a dynamic SNN with GWR-inspired plasticity and Ad-STDP for attack classification.

Result: Achieves 85.3% accuracy on UNSW-NB15, with robust adaptation and reduced catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: The architecture is effective for lifelong NIDS and suitable for low-power neuromorphic hardware.

Abstract: Inspired by the brain's hierarchical processing and energy efficiency, this
paper presents a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) architecture for lifelong Network
Intrusion Detection System (NIDS). The proposed system first employs an
efficient static SNN to identify potential intrusions, which then activates an
adaptive dynamic SNN responsible for classifying the specific attack type.
Mimicking biological adaptation, the dynamic classifier utilizes Grow When
Required (GWR)-inspired structural plasticity and a novel Adaptive
Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (Ad-STDP) learning rule. These bio-plausible
mechanisms enable the network to learn new threats incrementally while
preserving existing knowledge. Tested on the UNSW-NB15 benchmark in a continual
learning setting, the architecture demonstrates robust adaptation, reduced
catastrophic forgetting, and achieves $85.3$\% overall accuracy. Furthermore,
simulations using the Intel Lava framework confirm high operational sparsity,
highlighting the potential for low-power deployment on neuromorphic hardware.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to capture anomaly generation mechanisms and struggle with data challenges like label scarcity and multi-periodicity.

Method: Builds a structural causal model, uses Periodical Normalizing Flows with a mask mechanism, and periodical learners for anomaly detection.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on seven datasets, achieving AUROC improvements of 3% to 17% with enhanced interpretability.

Conclusion: CaPulse effectively detects anomalies by addressing data challenges and leveraging causality, offering superior performance and interpretability.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection has garnered considerable attention across
diverse domains. While existing methods often fail to capture the underlying
mechanisms behind anomaly generation in time series data. In addition, time
series anomaly detection often faces several data-related inherent challenges,
i.e., label scarcity, data imbalance, and complex multi-periodicity. In this
paper, we leverage causal tools and introduce a new causality-based framework,
CaPulse, which tunes in to the underlying causal pulse of time series data to
effectively detect anomalies. Concretely, we begin by building a structural
causal model to decipher the generation processes behind anomalies. To tackle
the challenges posed by the data, we propose Periodical Normalizing Flows with
a novel mask mechanism and carefully designed periodical learners, creating a
periodicity-aware, density-based anomaly detection approach. Extensive
experiments on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that CaPulse consistently
outperforms existing methods, achieving AUROC improvements of 3% to 17%, with
enhanced interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores pretraining for Link Prediction (LP) in graph machine learning, addressing challenges like sparse supervision and poor generalization. It introduces a late fusion strategy and a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for diverse data, achieving state-of-the-art performance with low computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LP methods using GNNs face challenges like sparse supervision, initialization sensitivity, and poor generalization under distribution shifts. Pretraining is proposed as a solution.

Method: The study systematically examines transferability of node- and edge-level modules, proposes a late fusion strategy, and introduces a MoE framework for diverse data. A parameter-efficient tuning strategy is developed for fast adaptation.

Result: Experiments on 16 datasets show state-of-the-art performance in low-resource LP, with competitive results and 10,000x lower computational overhead compared to end-to-end methods.

Conclusion: Pretraining with late fusion and MoE effectively addresses LP challenges, offering high performance and efficiency, making it suitable for diverse downstream applications.

Abstract: Link Prediction (LP) is a critical task in graph machine learning. While
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have significantly advanced LP performance
recently, existing methods face key challenges including limited supervision
from sparse connectivity, sensitivity to initialization, and poor
generalization under distribution shifts. We explore pretraining as a solution
to address these challenges. Unlike node classification, LP is inherently a
pairwise task, which requires the integration of both node- and edge-level
information. In this work, we present the first systematic study on the
transferability of these distinct modules and propose a late fusion strategy to
effectively combine their outputs for improved performance. To handle the
diversity of pretraining data and avoid negative transfer, we introduce a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that captures distinct patterns in separate
experts, facilitating seamless application of the pretrained model on diverse
downstream datasets. For fast adaptation, we develop a parameter-efficient
tuning strategy that allows the pretrained model to adapt to unseen datasets
with minimal computational overhead. Experiments on 16 datasets across two
domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on low-resource link prediction while obtaining
competitive results compared to end-to-end trained methods, with over 10,000x
lower computational overhead.

Motivation: To enhance bioacoustic classification by extending training to multi-taxa and improving transfer learning capabilities.

Method: Trained with self-distillation, prototype-learning classifier, and a new source-prediction criterion.

Result: Achieves top performance on BirdSet and BEANS benchmarks and excels in marine transfer tasks despite minimal marine training data.

Conclusion: Fine-grained species classification is a robust pre-training task for bioacoustics.

Abstract: Perch is a performant pre-trained model for bioacoustics. It was trained in
supervised fashion, providing both off-the-shelf classification scores for
thousands of vocalizing species as well as strong embeddings for transfer
learning. In this new release, Perch 2.0, we expand from training exclusively
on avian species to a large multi-taxa dataset. The model is trained with
self-distillation using a prototype-learning classifier as well as a new
source-prediction training criterion. Perch 2.0 obtains state-of-the-art
performance on the BirdSet and BEANS benchmarks. It also outperforms
specialized marine models on marine transfer learning tasks, despite having
almost no marine training data. We present hypotheses as to why fine-grained
species classification is a particularly robust pre-training task for
bioacoustics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of learning Single-Index Models efficiently under adversarial noise, expanding applicability to a broader class of activations.

Method: Develops an optimization framework using a novel vector field, bypassing gradient methods, leveraging Gaussian space properties and monotone function regularity.

Result: First efficient algorithm for this task, applicable to all monotone activations with bounded moment, including Lipschitz and discontinuous functions.

Conclusion: The approach advances prior work by achieving constant factor approximation for a wider class of activations, with potential broader impact in robust learning.

Abstract: We consider the basic problem of learning Single-Index Models with respect to
the square loss under the Gaussian distribution in the presence of adversarial
label noise. Our main contribution is the first computationally efficient
algorithm for this learning task, achieving a constant factor approximation,
that succeeds for the class of {\em all} monotone activations with bounded
moment of order $2 + \zeta,$ for $\zeta > 0.$ This class in particular includes
all monotone Lipschitz functions and even discontinuous functions like
(possibly biased) halfspaces. Prior work for the case of unknown activation
either does not attain constant factor approximation or succeeds for a
substantially smaller family of activations. The main conceptual novelty of our
approach lies in developing an optimization framework that steps outside the
boundaries of usual gradient methods and instead identifies a useful vector
field to guide the algorithm updates by directly leveraging the problem
structure, properties of Gaussian spaces, and regularity of monotone functions.

neuromorphic computing remain in infancy. This paper seeks to delve deeper into
various key aspects of neuron-synapse-astrocyte interactions to mimic

impact of incorporating bio-realistic effects from the machine learning

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Spatio-Temporal Constraints (STC) loss function for topographic deep spiking neural networks (TDSNNs), enhancing biological plausibility and performance in tasks like object recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the neglect of temporal dynamics in conventional deep ANNs, which leads to performance degradation and reduced biological fidelity.

Method: Leverages spiking neural networks (SNNs) with a novel STC loss function to replicate hierarchical spatial functional organization in the primate visual cortex.

Result: STC generates representative topographic features with minimal performance drop (no drop in ImageNet top-1 accuracy) and outperforms topographic ANNs in brain-likeness.

Conclusion: TDSNNs balance computational performance and brain-like features, offering insights for neuroscience and robust deep learning models.

Abstract: The primate visual cortex exhibits topographic organization, where
functionally similar neurons are spatially clustered, a structure widely
believed to enhance neural processing efficiency. While prior works have
demonstrated that conventional deep ANNs can develop topographic
representations, these models largely neglect crucial temporal dynamics. This
oversight often leads to significant performance degradation in tasks like
object recognition and compromises their biological fidelity. To address this,
we leverage spiking neural networks (SNNs), which inherently capture
spike-based temporal dynamics and offer enhanced biological plausibility. We
propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Constraints (STC) loss function for topographic
deep spiking neural networks (TDSNNs), successfully replicating the
hierarchical spatial functional organization observed in the primate visual
cortex from low-level sensory input to high-level abstract representations. Our
results show that STC effectively generates representative topographic features
across simulated visual cortical areas. While introducing topography typically
leads to significant performance degradation in ANNs, our spiking architecture
exhibits a remarkably small performance drop (No drop in ImageNet top-1
accuracy, compared to a 3\% drop observed in TopoNet, which is the
best-performing topographic ANN so far) and outperforms topographic ANNs in
brain-likeness. We also reveal that topographic organization facilitates
efficient and stable temporal information processing via the spike mechanism in
TDSNNs, contributing to model robustness. These findings suggest that TDSNNs
offer a compelling balance between computational performance and brain-like
features, providing not only a framework for interpreting neural science
phenomena but also novel insights for designing more efficient and robust deep
learning models.

TL;DR: A non-invasive, explainable machine learning framework using wearable sensors detects Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD) in spinal cord injury patients, outperforming baseline methods with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AD monitoring methods are invasive or subjective, limiting daily use. A non-invasive, accurate solution is needed to prevent complications.

Method: Multimodal wearable sensors (ECG, PPG, BioZ, etc.) collected data from 27 SCI patients. Feature selection used BorutaSHAP, and a stacked ensemble meta-model was trained.

Result: HR- and ECG-derived features were most informative. The ensemble model achieved Macro F1 = 0.77 and high AUC (HR: 0.93, ECG: 0.88).

Conclusion: The framework enables personalized, real-time AD monitoring, addressing current limitations and improving clinical applicability.

Abstract: Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD) is a potentially life-threatening condition
characterized by sudden, severe blood pressure (BP) spikes in individuals with
spinal cord injury (SCI). Early, accurate detection is essential to prevent
cardiovascular complications, yet current monitoring methods are either
invasive or rely on subjective symptom reporting, limiting applicability in
daily file. This study presents a non-invasive, explainable machine learning
framework for detecting AD using multimodal wearable sensors. Data were
collected from 27 individuals with chronic SCI during urodynamic studies,
including electrocardiography (ECG), photoplethysmography (PPG), bioimpedance
(BioZ), temperature, respiratory rate (RR), and heart rate (HR), across three
commercial devices. Objective AD labels were derived from synchronized
cuff-based BP measurements. Following signal preprocessing and feature
extraction, BorutaSHAP was used for robust feature selection, and SHAP values
for explainability. We trained modality- and device-specific weak learners and
aggregated them using a stacked ensemble meta-model. Cross-validation was
stratified by participants to ensure generalizability. HR- and ECG-derived
features were identified as the most informative, particularly those capturing
rhythm morphology and variability. The Nearest Centroid ensemble yielded the
highest performance (Macro F1 = 0.77+/-0.03), significantly outperforming
baseline models. Among modalities, HR achieved the highest area under the curve
(AUC = 0.93), followed by ECG (0.88) and PPG (0.86). RR and temperature
features contributed less to overall accuracy, consistent with missing data and
low specificity. The model proved robust to sensor dropout and aligned well
with clinical AD events. These results represent an important step toward
personalized, real-time monitoring for individuals with SCI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve estimation of unmeasured state variables and parameters in epidemiological models using partial data, overcoming limitations of conventional methods.

Method: Augment unmeasured data using algebraic observability analysis and validate through numerical experiments in three epidemiological scenarios.

Result: Higher accuracy in estimating unmeasured states and parameters compared to conventional methods, even with noisy and partial data.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively estimates unmeasured variables and parameters, proving useful in practical scenarios with incomplete data.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) is a deep learning framework that
integrates the governing equations underlying data into a loss function. In
this study, we consider the problem of estimating state variables and
parameters in epidemiological models governed by ordinary differential
equations using PINNs. In practice, not all trajectory data corresponding to
the population described by models can be measured. Learning PINNs to estimate
the unmeasured state variables and epidemiological parameters using partial
measurements is challenging.
  Accordingly, we introduce the concept of algebraic observability of the state
variables. Specifically, we propose augmenting the unmeasured data based on
algebraic observability analysis. The validity of the proposed method is
demonstrated through numerical experiments under three scenarios in the context
of epidemiological modelling. Specifically, given noisy and partial
measurements, the accuracy of unmeasured states and parameter estimation of the
proposed method is shown to be higher than that of the conventional methods.
The proposed method is also shown to be effective in practical scenarios, such
as when the data corresponding to certain variables cannot be reconstructed
from the measurements.

Conclusion: The framework successfully balances resilience and market profitability, offering sustainable investment incentives.

Abstract: The increasing vulnerability of electrical distribution systems to extreme
weather events and cyber threats necessitates the development of economically
viable frameworks for resilience enhancement. While existing approaches focus
primarily on technical resilience metrics and enhancement strategies, there
remains a significant gap in establishing market-driven mechanisms that can
effectively commercialize resilience features while optimizing their deployment
through intelligent decision-making. Moreover, traditional optimization
approaches for distribution network reconfiguration often fail to dynamically
adapt to both normal and emergency conditions. This paper introduces a novel
framework integrating dual-agent Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with
market-based mechanisms, achieving an average resilience score of 0.85 0.08
over 10 test episodes. The proposed architecture leverages a dual-agent PPO
scheme, where a strategic agent selects optimal DER-driven switching
configurations, while a tactical agent fine-tunes individual switch states and
grid preferences under budget and weather constraints. These agents interact
within a custom-built dynamic simulation environment that models stochastic
calamity events, budget limits, and resilience-cost trade-offs. A comprehensive
reward function is designed that balances resilience enhancement objectives
with market profitability (with up to 200x reward incentives, resulting in 85%
of actions during calamity steps selecting configurations with 4 DERs),
incorporating factors such as load recovery speed, system robustness, and
customer satisfaction. Over 10 test episodes, the framework achieved a
benefit-cost ratio of 0.12 0.01, demonstrating sustainable market incentives
for resilience investment. This framework creates sustainable market incentives

*Davide Previtali,Daniele Masti,Mirko Mazzoleni,Fabio Previdi*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: Combining Kalman Filters with machine-learning for SOC estimation in lithium-ion cells improves accuracy and smoothness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance SOC estimation by integrating traditional Kalman Filters with machine-learning techniques.

Method: Uses a Virtual Sensor (VS) to learn an APV model, derive observers, and train ML for SOC prediction, then integrates with an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF).

Result: Improved SOC estimation accuracy and smoothness.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach outperforms traditional methods, demonstrating the benefits of combining KFs and ML.

Abstract: This paper addresses the estimation of the State Of Charge (SOC) of
lithium-ion cells via the combination of two widely used paradigms: Kalman
Filters (KFs) equipped with Equivalent Circuit Models (ECMs) and
machine-learning approaches. In particular, a recent Virtual Sensor (VS)
synthesis technique is considered, which operates as follows: (i) learn an
Affine Parameter-Varying (APV) model of the cell directly from data, (ii)
derive a bank of linear observers from the APV model, (iii) train a
machine-learning technique from features extracted from the observers together
with input and output data to predict the SOC. The SOC predictions returned by
the VS are supplied to an Extended KF (EKF) as output measurements along with
the cell terminal voltage, combining the two paradigms. A data-driven
calibration strategy for the noise covariance matrices of the EKF is proposed.
Experimental results show that the designed approach is beneficial w.r.t. SOC
estimation accuracy and smoothness.

### [317] [Viability of perturbative expansion for quantum field theories on neurons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03810)
*Srimoyee Sen,Varun Vaidya*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper explores using neural networks (NNs) with non-independent parameters to simulate local quantum field theories (QFTs), focusing on scalar Ïâ´ theory. It finds weak convergence in perturbative calculations for finite neuron numbers and proposes architectural improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether NN architectures can accurately simulate local QFTs, especially for finite neuron numbers, and to address convergence issues in perturbative calculations.

Method: The study uses scalar Ïâ´ theory in d Euclidean dimensions, analyzing renormalized O(1/N) corrections to two- and four-point correlators for finite neuron numbers.

Result: The perturbative series for finite N is sensitive to the ultraviolet cut-off, leading to weak convergence. A modified NN architecture is proposed to improve this.

Conclusion: The paper identifies constraints on theory parameters and neuron scaling to extract accurate QFT results, suggesting modifications for better convergence.

Abstract: Neural Network (NN) architectures that break statistical independence of
parameters have been proposed as a new approach for simulating local quantum
field theories (QFTs). In the infinite neuron number limit, single-layer NNs
can exactly reproduce QFT results. This paper examines the viability of this
architecture for perturbative calculations of local QFTs for finite neuron
number $N$ using scalar $\phi^4$ theory in $d$ Euclidean dimensions as an
example. We find that the renormalized $O(1/N)$ corrections to two- and
four-point correlators yield perturbative series which are sensitive to the
ultraviolet cut-off and therefore have a weak convergence. We propose a
modification to the architecture to improve this convergence and discuss
constraints on the parameters of the theory and the scaling of N which allow us
to extract accurate field theory results.

TL;DR: A novel graph-diffusion network simulates cortical maturation in preterm infants, preserving subject-specific cortical folding while modeling neurodevelopment accurately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preterm birth disrupts neurodevelopment, leading to cognitive risks, but predicting outcomes is challenging due to variability.

Method: The paper introduces a graph-diffusion network to simulate cortical maturation, tested on dHCP data, preserving subject-specific morphology.

Result: The model fools an age regression network with 0.85 Â± 0.62 accuracy, indicating realistic simulation.

Conclusion: Individualized simulation of neurodevelopment can identify risk biomarkers, improving early prediction for preterm infants.

Abstract: Preterm birth disrupts the typical trajectory of cortical neurodevelopment,
increasing the risk of cognitive and behavioral difficulties. However, outcomes
vary widely, posing a significant challenge for early prediction. To address
this, individualized simulation offers a promising solution by modeling
subject-specific neurodevelopmental trajectories, enabling the identification
of subtle deviations from normative patterns that might act as biomarkers of
risk. While generative models have shown potential for simulating
neurodevelopment, prior approaches often struggle to preserve subject-specific
cortical folding patterns or to reproduce region-specific morphological
variations. In this paper, we present a novel graph-diffusion network that
supports controllable simulation of cortical maturation. Using cortical surface
data from the developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP), we demonstrate that
the model maintains subject-specific cortical morphology while modeling
cortical maturation sufficiently well to fool an independently trained age
regression network, achieving a prediction accuracy of $0.85 \pm 0.62$.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark for tracing the source models of multilingual deepfake speech, addressing gaps in current research by focusing on source tracing rather than detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of generative AI has made deepfake speech creation easy, raising concerns about misuse. Current research focuses on detection, but tracing the source models remains unexplored.

Method: The study develops a benchmark for multilingual speech deepfake source tracing, comparing DSP- and SSL-based modeling, and evaluates cross-lingual generalization.

Result: The research provides insights into challenges of identifying speech generation models when training and inference languages differ.

Conclusion: The paper offers the first comprehensive analysis of multilingual speech deepfake source tracing, with available dataset, protocol, and code for further research.

Abstract: Recent progress in generative AI has made it increasingly easy to create
natural-sounding deepfake speech from just a few seconds of audio. While these
tools support helpful applications, they also raise serious concerns by making
it possible to generate convincing fake speech in many languages. Current
research has largely focused on detecting fake speech, but little attention has
been given to tracing the source models used to generate it. This paper
introduces the first benchmark for multilingual speech deepfake source tracing,
covering both mono- and cross-lingual scenarios. We comparatively investigate
DSP- and SSL-based modeling; examine how SSL representations fine-tuned on
different languages impact cross-lingual generalization performance; and
evaluate generalization to unseen languages and speakers. Our findings offer
the first comprehensive insights into the challenges of identifying speech
generation models when training and inference languages differ. The dataset,

### [321] [Accept-Reject Lasso](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04646)
*Yanxin Liu,Yunqi Zhang*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The Accept-Reject Lasso (ARL) addresses Lasso's instability with correlated features by distinguishing true from spurious correlations through clustering and subset analysis, improving feature selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lasso's instability with correlated features leads to arbitrary selection, either omitting falsely redundant features or including truly redundant ones. Existing methods often address only one issue.

Method: ARL uses clustering to identify data subsets, analyzes Lasso's behavior across them, and employs an Accept-Reject framework to differentiate true/spurious correlations, selecting representative features for stability.

Result: ARL effectively distinguishes true from spurious correlations, maximizing informative variables while minimizing detrimental ones, as shown in simulations and real-data experiments.

Conclusion: ARL resolves Lasso's instability with correlated features by leveraging subset analysis and clustering, offering a robust solution for feature selection.

Abstract: The Lasso method is known to exhibit instability in the presence of highly
correlated features, often leading to an arbitrary selection of predictors.
This issue manifests itself in two primary error types: the erroneous omission
of features that lack a true substitutable relationship (falsely redundant
features) and the inclusion of features with a true substitutable relationship
(truly redundant features). Although most existing methods address only one of
these challenges, we introduce the Accept-Reject Lasso (ARL), a novel approach
that resolves this dilemma. ARL operationalizes an Accept-Reject framework
through a fine-grained analysis of feature selection across data subsets. This
framework is designed to partition the output of an ensemble method into
beneficial and detrimental components through fine-grained analysis. The
fundamental challenge for Lasso is that inter-variable correlation obscures the
true sources of information. ARL tackles this by first using clustering to
identify distinct subset structures within the data. It then analyzes Lasso's
behavior across these subsets to differentiate between true and spurious
correlations. For truly correlated features, which induce multicollinearity,
ARL tends to select a single representative feature and reject the rest to
ensure model stability. Conversely, for features linked by spurious
correlations, which may vanish in certain subsets, ARL accepts those that Lasso
might have incorrectly omitted. The distinct patterns arising from true versus
spurious correlations create a divisible separation. By setting an appropriate
threshold, our framework can effectively distinguish between these two
phenomena, thereby maximizing the inclusion of informative variables while
minimizing the introduction of detrimental ones. We illustrate the efficacy of
the proposed method through extensive simulation and real-data experiments.

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: The paper investigates autoencoders for reduced-order modeling of 3D multiphase flows, focusing on reconstruction accuracy and interface representation choices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve dimensionality reduction of multiphase flows using autoencoders and clarify best practices for accurate reconstruction.

Method: Uses synthetic and high-resolution simulation data to evaluate different interface representations (diffuse, sharp, level set) with a standard convolutional architecture.

Result: Identifies best practices for autoencoder-based dimensionality reduction, enabling uncoupled training for temporal or input/output models in lower-dimensional latent spaces.

Conclusion: The study provides significant insights for the multiphase flow community, facilitating accurate reconstruction and model training in reduced dimensions.

Abstract: In this work, we perform a comprehensive investigation of autoencoders for
reduced-order modeling of three-dimensional multiphase flows. Focusing on the
accuracy of reconstructing multiphase flow volume/mass fractions with a
standard convolutional architecture, we examine the advantages and
disadvantages of different interface representation choices (diffuse, sharp,
level set). We use a combination of synthetic data with non-trivial interface
topologies and high-resolution simulation data of multiphase homogeneous
isotropic turbulence for training and validation. This study clarifies the best
practices for reducing the dimensionality of multiphase flows via autoencoders.
Consequently, this paves the path for uncoupling the training of autoencoders
for accurate reconstruction and the training of temporal or input/output models
such as neural operators (e.g., FNOs, DeepONets) and neural ODEs on the
lower-dimensional latent space given by the autoencoders. As such, the
implications of this study are significant and of interest to the multiphase
flow community and beyond.

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: PCA-based input compression enables extreme neural model compression without performance loss, demonstrated across three case studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To align model capacity with information content by using PCA for input compression, enabling lightweight architectures.

Method: Apply PCA to polar-transformed images or token sequences, then train classifiers or transformers on the compressed data.

Result: High accuracy (e.g., 98% on MNIST) and coherence (97% similarity with MiniLM) achieved with significantly fewer parameters.

Conclusion: PCA-based compression is a general and effective strategy for lightweight, high-performance models across modalities.

Abstract: We demonstrate that Principal Component Analysis (PCA), when applied in a
structured manner, either to polar-transformed images or segment-wise to token
sequences, enables extreme compression of neural models without sacrificing
performance. Across three case studies, we show that a one-layer classifier
trained on PCA-compressed polar MNIST achieves over 98 percent accuracy using
only 840 parameters. A two-layer transformer trained on 70-dimensional
PCA-reduced MiniLM embeddings reaches 76.62 percent accuracy on the 20
Newsgroups dataset with just 81000 parameters. A decoder-only transformer
generates coherent token sequences from 70-dimensional PCA embeddings while
preserving over 97 percent cosine similarity with full MiniLM representations,
using less than 17 percent of the parameter count of GPT-2. These results
highlight PCA-based input compression as a general and effective strategy for
aligning model capacity with information content, enabling lightweight
architectures across multiple modalities.

*VerÃ³nica Ãlvarez,Santiago Mazuelas,Steven An,Sanjoy Dasgupta*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A method for programmatic weak supervision improves label reliability by providing confidence intervals for probabilistic predictions, outperforming existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate dataset labeling is costly and time-consuming, and existing weak supervision methods lack reliability assessments for label predictions.

Method: Uses uncertainty sets of distributions to encapsulate weak labeling functions' behavior, providing confidence intervals for label probabilities.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show improved reliability and practicality of confidence intervals over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology enhances weak supervision by offering reliable predictions with confidence intervals.

Abstract: The accurate labeling of datasets is often both costly and time-consuming.
Given an unlabeled dataset, programmatic weak supervision obtains probabilistic
predictions for the labels by leveraging multiple weak labeling functions (LFs)
that provide rough guesses for labels. Weak LFs commonly provide guesses with
assorted types and unknown interdependences that can result in unreliable
predictions. Furthermore, existing techniques for programmatic weak supervision
cannot provide assessments for the reliability of the probabilistic predictions
for labels. This paper presents a methodology for programmatic weak supervision
that can provide confidence intervals for label probabilities and obtain more
reliable predictions. In particular, the methods proposed use uncertainty sets
of distributions that encapsulate the information provided by LFs with
unrestricted behavior and typology. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
show the improvement of the presented methods over the state-of-the-art and the
practicality of the confidence intervals presented.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Proposes an epoch-based RL algorithm for infinite-horizon MDPs using a partial order over policies, achieving regret bounds independent of state/action space sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable counterfactual inference without additional environment interaction by leveraging partial orders over policies.

Method: Uses a partial order over policies to estimate performance without extra data, achieving a regret bound of O(â(w log(|Î|) T).

Result: Achieves theoretical guarantees and strong empirical results in domains like inventory control and queuing systems.

Conclusion: The framework is broadly applicable, offering new guarantees without restrictive assumptions.

Abstract: We propose an epoch-based reinforcement learning algorithm for
infinite-horizon average-cost Markov decision processes (MDPs) that leverages a
partial order over a policy class. In this structure, $\pi' \leq \pi$ if data
collected under $\pi$ can be used to estimate the performance of $\pi'$,
enabling counterfactual inference without additional environment interaction.
Leveraging this partial order, we show that our algorithm achieves a regret
bound of $O(\sqrt{w \log(|\Theta|) T})$, where $w$ is the width of the partial
order. Notably, the bound is independent of the state and action space sizes.
We illustrate the applicability of these partial orders in many domains in
operations research, including inventory control and queuing systems. For each,
we apply our framework to that problem, yielding new theoretical guarantees and
strong empirical results without imposing extra assumptions such as convexity
in the inventory model or specialized arrival-rate structure in the queuing
model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational challenges in parameter estimation for over-dispersed count data in large-scale comparative studies.

Method: Use a pre-trained transformer trained on synthetic data to estimate parameters, comparing it to maximum likelihood and method of moments.

Result: Transformer was 20x faster than maximum likelihood with better accuracy, but method of moments was 1,000x faster, equally accurate, and produced better-calibrated tests.

Conclusion: Method of moments is the most efficient solution for large-scale negative binomial regression.

Abstract: Negative binomial regression is essential for analyzing over-dispersed count
data in in comparative studies, but parameter estimation becomes
computationally challenging in large screens requiring millions of comparisons.
We investigate using a pre-trained transformer to produce estimates of negative
binomial regression parameters from observed count data, trained through
synthetic data generation to learn to invert the process of generating counts
from parameters. The transformer method achieved better parameter accuracy than
maximum likelihood optimization while being 20 times faster. However,
comparisons unexpectedly revealed that method of moment estimates performed as
well as maximum likelihood optimization in accuracy, while being 1,000 times
faster and producing better-calibrated and more powerful tests, making it the
most efficient solution for this application.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the generalization challenge in adaptive filtering by leveraging DNNs for direct gradient mapping.

Method: Embed a DNN as a universal nonlinear operator in the AF system to map residuals to gradients, using maximum likelihood as an implicit cost function.

Result: The framework demonstrates strong generalization in non-Gaussian scenarios, supported by stability analyses.

Conclusion: The DNN-driven approach offers a data-driven solution with superior generalization for adaptive filtering.

Abstract: This paper proposes a deep neural network (DNN)-driven framework to address
the longstanding generalization challenge in adaptive filtering (AF). In
contrast to traditional AF frameworks that emphasize explicit cost function
design, the proposed framework shifts the paradigm toward direct gradient
acquisition. The DNN, functioning as a universal nonlinear operator, is
structurally embedded into the core architecture of the AF system, establishing
a direct mapping between filtering residuals and learning gradients. The
maximum likelihood is adopted as the implicit cost function, rendering the
derived algorithm inherently data-driven and thus endowed with exemplary
generalization capability, which is validated by extensive numerical
experiments across a spectrum of non-Gaussian scenarios. Corresponding mean
value and mean square stability analyses are also conducted in detail.

### [328] [The Relative Instability of Model Comparison with Cross-validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04409)
*Alexandre Bayle,Lucas Janson,Lester Mackey*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Cross-validation (CV) can provide confidence intervals for test error of stable algorithms, but comparing two algorithms requires relative stability, which is not easily derived. The study shows CV fails for test error differences even with individually stable algorithms like soft-thresholded least squares and Lasso.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when CV provides valid confidence intervals for test error differences between two algorithms, focusing on relative stability.

Method: Study the soft-thresholded least squares algorithm, proving individual stability but failure of relative stability, and empirically validating CV's invalidity for test error differences.

Result: Relative stability fails for comparing test errors of two algorithms, and CV confidence intervals for differences are invalid even with stable algorithms.

Conclusion: Caution is needed when using CV to quantify uncertainty in performance differences between algorithms, even if both are individually stable.

Abstract: Existing work has shown that cross-validation (CV) can be used to provide an
asymptotic confidence interval for the test error of a stable machine learning
algorithm, and existing stability results for many popular algorithms can be
applied to derive positive instances where such confidence intervals will be
valid. However, in the common setting where CV is used to compare two
algorithms, it becomes necessary to consider a notion of relative stability
which cannot easily be derived from existing stability results, even for simple
algorithms. To better understand relative stability and when CV provides valid
confidence intervals for the test error difference of two algorithms, we study
the soft-thresholded least squares algorithm, a close cousin of the Lasso. We
prove that while stability holds when assessing the individual test error of
this algorithm, relative stability fails to hold when comparing the test error
of two such algorithms, even in a sparse low-dimensional linear model setting.
Additionally, we empirically confirm the invalidity of CV confidence intervals
for the test error difference when either soft-thresholding or the Lasso is
used. In short, caution is needed when quantifying the uncertainty of CV
estimates of the performance difference of two machine learning algorithms,
even when both algorithms are individually stable.

Result: The analysis reveals method- and architecture-specific strengths and limitations in uncertainty estimation and disentangling epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties.

Conclusion: The study provides a comprehensive benchmark for uncertainty quantification in medical imaging, highlighting practical insights for real-world applications.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification is crucial for trustworthy
decision-making and the deployment of AI models in medical imaging. While prior
work has explored the ability of neural networks to quantify predictive,
epistemic, and aleatoric uncertainties using an information-theoretical
approach in synthetic or well defined data settings like natural image
classification, its applicability to real life medical diagnosis tasks remains
underexplored. In this study, we provide an extensive uncertainty
quantification benchmark for multi-label chest X-ray classification using the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Metric learning from triplet comparisons is crucial for applications like image retrieval and recommendation systems, but lacks theoretical understanding beyond linear cases.

Method: The authors propose a general RKHS framework for metric learning, extending beyond the linear Euclidean space, and validate it with simulations and experiments.

Result: The framework offers novel generalization guarantees and sample complexity bounds, supported by empirical validation.

Conclusion: The work bridges the gap in theoretical understanding of nonlinear metric learning in RKHS, with practical validation and publicly available code.

Abstract: Metric learning from a set of triplet comparisons in the form of "Do you
think item h is more similar to item i or item j?", indicating similarity and
differences between items, plays a key role in various applications including
image retrieval, recommendation systems, and cognitive psychology. The goal is
to learn a metric in the RKHS that reflects the comparisons. Nonlinear metric
learning using kernel methods and neural networks have shown great empirical
promise. While previous works have addressed certain aspects of this problem,
there is little or no theoretical understanding of such methods. The exception
is the special (linear) case in which the RKHS is the standard Euclidean space
$\mathbb{R}^d$; there is a comprehensive theory for metric learning in
$\mathbb{R}^d$. This paper develops a general RKHS framework for metric
learning and provides novel generalization guarantees and sample complexity
bounds. We validate our findings through a set of simulations and experiments
on real datasets. Our code is publicly available at

Motivation: Overcome the inefficiency of simulating individual isochromats in conventional MR simulators.

Method: Group isochromats with shared properties (e.g., x-axis location, T1, T2, field inhomogeneity) to combine simulations, especially for gradient-aligned sequences.

Result: Proposed method is 3-72x faster; e.g., FSE and EPI sequences took 38.1s and 7.1s vs. 208.4s and 66.4s conventionally.

Conclusion: Grouping isochromats significantly speeds up MR simulations without compromising accuracy.

Individual isochromats should be simulated individually. To reduce the
computational times of MR simulation, a new simulation method using grouped
isochromats is proposed. When multiple isochromats are grouped before
simulations, some parts of the simulation can be shared in each group. For a
certain gradient type, the isochromats in the group can be easily chosen for
ensuring that they behave the same. For example, the group can be defined as
the isochromats whose locations along x-axis, T1, T2 and magnetic field
inhomogeneity values are the same values. In such groups, simulations can be
combined when a pulse sequence with the magnetic field gradient along x-axis
only are processed. The processing times of the conventional and proposed
methods were evaluated with several sequences including fast spin echo (FSE)
and echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequences. The simulation times of the proposed
method were 3 to 72 times faster than those of the conventional methods. In the
cases of 27.5 million isochromats using single instruction multiple data (SIMD)
instructions and multi-threading, the conventional method simulated FSE and EPI
sequences in 208.4 and 66.4 seconds, respectively. In the same cases, the
proposed method simulated these sequences in 38.1 and 7.1 seconds,
respectively.

### [333] [A semi-automatic approach to study population dynamics based on population pyramids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03788)
*Max Hahn-Klimroth,JoÃ£o Pedro Meireles,Laurie Bingaman Lackey,Nick van Eeuwijk Mads F. Bertelsen,Paul W. Dierkes,Marcus Clauss*

Main category: q-bio.PE

TL;DR: Algorithm-based classification of population pyramids into shapes linked to population characteristics, tested on global zoo mammal data (1970-2024).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize and automate the analysis of population pyramids, which are visually intuitive but lack algorithmic approaches for extracting insights.

Method: Developed an algorithm to classify population data into pyramid shapes (e.g., normal, inverted, diamond, column) using global zoo mammal population data (1970-2024).

Result: The algorithm provides plausible classifications, especially for tracking population size changes and transitions between pyramid shapes.

Conclusion: This approach is a useful tool for analyzing historical population trends and could aid in animal population management.

Abstract: The depiction of populations - of humans or animals - as "population
pyramids" is a useful tool for the assessment of various characteristics of
populations at a glance. Although these visualisations are well-known objects
in various communities, formalised and algorithmic approaches to gain
information from these data are less present. Here, we present an
algorithm-based classification of population data into "pyramids" of different
shapes ([normal and inverted] pyramid / plunger / bell, [lower / middle /
upper] diamond, column, hourglass) that are linked to specific characteristics
of the population. To develop the algorithmic approach, we used data describing
global zoo populations of mammals from 1970-2024. This algorithm-based approach
delivers plausible classifications, in particular with respect to changes in
population size linked to specific series of, and transitions between,
different "pyramid" shapes. We believe this approach might become a useful tool
for analysing and communicating historical population developments in multiple
contexts and is of broad interest. Moreover, it might be useful for animal
population management strategies.

*Qingyuan Li,Bo Zhang,Hui Kang,Tianhao Xu,Yulei Qian,Yuchen Xie,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: FlashCommunication V2 introduces bit splitting and spike reserving techniques to enable efficient cross-GPU communication at any bit width, achieving significant speedups in distributed training of large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing communication bottlenecks in distributed training of large language models (LLMs) by improving flexibility and resource utilization in cross-GPU transmission.

Method: Proposes bit splitting for hardware-compatible transmission at arbitrary bit widths and spike reserving to handle numerical outliers, enabling low-bit quantization (down to 2-bit).

Result: Achieves up to 3.2Ã speedup in AllReduce and 2Ã in All2All communication, with reduced overhead across NVLink and PCIe architectures.

Conclusion: FlashCommunication V2 enhances communication efficiency and performance in distributed LLM training through innovative software-hardware co-design.

Abstract: Nowadays, communication bottlenecks have emerged as a critical challenge in
the distributed training and deployment of large language models (LLMs). This
paper introduces FlashCommunication V2, a novel communication paradigm enabling
efficient cross-GPU transmission at arbitrary bit widths. Its core innovations
lie in the proposed bit splitting and spike reserving techniques, which address
the challenges of low-bit quantization. Bit splitting decomposes irregular bit
widths into basic units, ensuring compatibility with hardware capabilities and
thus enabling transmission at any bit width. Spike reserving, on the other
hand, retains numerical outliers (i.e., minima and maxima) as floating-point
numbers, which shrinks the dynamic numerical range and pushes the quantization
limits to 2-bit with acceptable losses. FlashCommunication V2 significantly
enhances the flexibility and resource utilization of communication systems.
Through meticulous software-hardware co-design, it delivers robust performance
and reduced overhead across both NVLink-based and PCIe-based architectures,
achieving a maximum 3.2$\times$ speedup in AllReduce and 2$\times$ in All2All
communication.

### [335] [Two-dimensional Sparse Parallelism for Large Scale Deep Learning Recommendation Model Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03854)
*Xin Zhang,Quanyu Zhu,Liangbei Xu,Zain Huda,Wang Zhou,Jin Fang,Dennis van der Staay,Yuxi Hu,Jade Nie,Jiyan Yang,Chunzhi Yang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: A novel two-dimensional sparse parallelism approach is proposed to address scalability challenges in training deep learning recommendation models (DLRM), improving efficiency and memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing complexity and scale of DLRMs, especially sparse embedding tables with trillions of parameters, create scalability issues like imbalance, stragglers, and high memory usage in traditional parallelism strategies.

Method: The solution combines data parallelism with model parallelism, introduces efficient all-to-all communication, and uses a momentum-scaled row-wise AdaGrad algorithm to mitigate performance losses.

Result: The approach achieves nearly linear training speed scaling up to 4K GPUs, enhancing efficiency without compromising model performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method sets a new state-of-the-art benchmark for DLRM training, addressing key scalability challenges effectively.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of deep learning recommendation models (DLRM) has
led to a growing need for large-scale distributed systems that can efficiently
train vast amounts of data. In DLRM, the sparse embedding table is a crucial
component for managing sparse categorical features. Typically, these tables in
industrial DLRMs contain trillions of parameters, necessitating model
parallelism strategies to address memory constraints. However, as training
systems expand with massive GPUs, the traditional fully parallelism strategies
for embedding table post significant scalability challenges, including
imbalance and straggler issues, intensive lookup communication, and heavy
embedding activation memory. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
two-dimensional sparse parallelism approach. Rather than fully sharding tables
across all GPUs, our solution introduces data parallelism on top of model
parallelism. This enables efficient all-to-all communication and reduces peak
memory consumption. Additionally, we have developed the momentum-scaled
row-wise AdaGrad algorithm to mitigate performance losses associated with the
shift in training paradigms. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed approach significantly enhances training efficiency while maintaining
model performance parity. It achieves nearly linear training speed scaling up
to 4K GPUs, setting a new state-of-the-art benchmark for recommendation model
training.

### [336] [SelectiveShield: Lightweight Hybrid Defense Against Gradient Leakage in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04265)
*Borui Li,Li Yan,Jianmin Liu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: SelectiveShield is a lightweight hybrid defense framework for Federated Learning, combining selective homomorphic encryption and differential privacy to protect sensitive data while maintaining model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defenses like DP and HE compromise privacy, utility, or efficiency, especially in heterogeneous FL environments. SelectiveShield aims to balance these trade-offs.

Method: SelectiveShield uses Fisher information to identify sensitive parameters, employs homomorphic encryption for shared critical parameters, and applies adaptive DP noise for non-critical ones.

Result: The framework effectively mitigates gradient leakage risks while preserving model utility, as shown in experiments.

Conclusion: SelectiveShield offers a practical and scalable solution for secure FL deployments.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training on decentralized
data but remains vulnerable to gradient leakage attacks that can reconstruct
sensitive user information. Existing defense mechanisms, such as differential
privacy (DP) and homomorphic encryption (HE), often introduce a trade-off
between privacy, model utility, and system overhead, a challenge that is
exacerbated in heterogeneous environments with non-IID data and varying client
capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose SelectiveShield, a
lightweight hybrid defense framework that adaptively integrates selective
homomorphic encryption and differential privacy. SelectiveShield leverages
Fisher information to quantify parameter sensitivity, allowing clients to
identify critical parameters locally. Through a collaborative negotiation
protocol, clients agree on a shared set of the most sensitive parameters for
protection via homomorphic encryption. Parameters that are uniquely important
to individual clients are retained locally, fostering personalization, while
non-critical parameters are protected with adaptive differential privacy noise.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SelectiveShield maintains strong model
utility while significantly mitigating gradient leakage risks, offering a
practical and scalable defense mechanism for real-world federated learning
deployments.

*Robin Swanson,Esther Y. H. Lin,Masen Lamb,Suresh Sivanandam,Kiriakos N. Kutulakos*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: A computational imaging method using adaptive optics (AO) systems to enhance resolution without sacrificing field of view (FoV) in telescopes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the tradeoff between FoV and resolution in astronomical telescopes by leveraging existing AO systems.

Method: Use AO deformable mirrors to apply learned distortions, capture shifted images, and jointly upsample for super-resolution.

Result: Achieves up to 12 dB SNR improvement over baselines, validated via hardware prototype and simulations.

Conclusion: The method is feasible for operational telescopes, requiring no hardware modifications.

Abstract: Astronomical telescopes suffer from a tradeoff between field of view (FoV)
and image resolution: increasing the FoV leads to an optical field that is
under-sampled by the science camera. This work presents a novel computational
imaging approach to overcome this tradeoff by leveraging the existing adaptive
optics (AO) systems in modern ground-based telescopes. Our key idea is to use
the AO system's deformable mirror to apply a series of learned, precisely
controlled distortions to the optical wavefront, producing a sequence of images
that exhibit distinct, high-frequency, sub-pixel shifts. These images can then
be jointly upsampled to yield the final super-resolved image. Crucially, we
show this can be done while simultaneously maintaining the core AO
operation--correcting for the unknown and rapidly changing wavefront
distortions caused by Earth's atmosphere. To achieve this, we incorporate
end-to-end optimization of both the induced mirror distortions and the
upsampling algorithm, such that telescope-specific optics and temporal
statistics of atmospheric wavefront distortions are accounted for. Our
experimental results with a hardware prototype, as well as simulations,
demonstrate significant SNR improvements of up to 12 dB over non-AO
super-resolution baselines, using only existing telescope optics and no
hardware modifications. Moreover, by using a precise bench-top replica of a
complete telescope and AO system, we show that our methodology can be readily
transferred to an operational telescope. Project webpage:

*Anderson de Lima Luiz*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: LUST is a framework for analyzing video content to quantify thematic relevance based on user-provided text, using multi-modal analysis and hierarchical LLM-based scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a nuanced, temporally-aware measure of user-defined significance in video content.

Method: Multi-modal pipeline integrating visual and ASR-extracted text, with a two-stage LLM-based scoring mechanism (direct and contextual relevance).

Result: Annotated video with visualized relevance scores and analytical logs.

Conclusion: LUST offers a sophisticated tool for assessing thematic relevance in videos, enhancing user-defined significance tracking.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Learned User Significance Tracker (LUST), a
framework designed to analyze video content and quantify the thematic relevance
of its segments in relation to a user-provided textual description of
significance. LUST leverages a multi-modal analytical pipeline, integrating
visual cues from video frames with textual information extracted via Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) from the audio track. The core innovation lies in a
hierarchical, two-stage relevance scoring mechanism employing Large Language
Models (LLMs). An initial "direct relevance" score, $S_{d,i}$, assesses
individual segments based on immediate visual and auditory content against the
theme. This is followed by a "contextual relevance" score, $S_{c,i}$, that
refines the assessment by incorporating the temporal progression of preceding
thematic scores, allowing the model to understand evolving narratives. The LUST
framework aims to provide a nuanced, temporally-aware measure of user-defined
significance, outputting an annotated video with visualized relevance scores
and comprehensive analytical logs.

*Jinxing Zhou,Yanghao Zhou,Mingfei Han,Tong Wang,Xiaojun Chang,Hisham Cholakkal,Rao Muhammad Anwer*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper introduces TGS-Agent, a novel approach for Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) that decomposes the task into Think-Ground-Segment steps, mimicking human reasoning. It uses Ref-Thinker for multimodal analysis and introduces a new benchmark, RÂ²-AVSBench, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods rely on latent embeddings and lack interpretability, requiring strong supervision. The authors aim to improve interpretability and reduce reliance on pixel-level supervision by mimicking human reasoning.

Method: TGS-Agent decomposes Ref-AVS into Think-Ground-Segment steps: Ref-Thinker (a multimodal language model) reasons over cues, Grounding-DINO and SAM2 perform grounding and segmentation using explicit prompts. A new benchmark, RÂ²-AVSBench, is introduced for evaluation.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both standard Ref-AVSBench and the new RÂ²-AVSBench, demonstrating improved generalization and interpretability.

Conclusion: TGS-Agent offers a more interpretable and effective solution for Ref-AVS by mimicking human reasoning and reducing reliance on pixel-level supervision, validated by superior performance on benchmarks.

Abstract: Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) aims to segment target objects
in audible videos based on given reference expressions. Prior works typically
rely on learning latent embeddings via multimodal fusion to prompt a tunable
SAM/SAM2 decoder for segmentation, which requires strong pixel-level
supervision and lacks interpretability. From a novel perspective of explicit
reference understanding, we propose TGS-Agent, which decomposes the task into a
Think-Ground-Segment process, mimicking the human reasoning procedure by first
identifying the referred object through multimodal analysis, followed by
coarse-grained grounding and precise segmentation. To this end, we first
propose Ref-Thinker, a multimodal language model capable of reasoning over
textual, visual, and auditory cues. We construct an instruction-tuning dataset
with explicit object-aware think-answer chains for Ref-Thinker fine-tuning. The
object description inferred by Ref-Thinker is used as an explicit prompt for
Grounding-DINO and SAM2, which perform grounding and segmentation without
relying on pixel-level supervision. Additionally, we introduce
R\textsuperscript{2}-AVSBench, a new benchmark with linguistically diverse and
reasoning-intensive references for better evaluating model generalization. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art results on both standard Ref-AVSBench and
proposed R\textsuperscript{2}-AVSBench. Code will be available at

TL;DR: BIP! Finder introduces summarization features to help scientists quickly understand and synthesize large volumes of research papers, addressing the challenge of literature overload.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing volume of scientific literature makes it difficult for researchers to efficiently synthesize and comprehend large sets of papers, especially with conflicting findings.

Method: BIP! Finder integrates summarization into its scholarly search engine, offering concise and comprehensive summaries of top-ranked papers based on impact aspects like popularity and influence.

Result: Users can generate two types of summaries: quick at-a-glance summaries and detailed literature reviews, enhancing comprehension and discovery.

Conclusion: The summarization feature in BIP! Finder accelerates literature discovery and comprehension by leveraging impact-based rankings to create context-sensitive narratives.

Abstract: The growing volume of scientific literature makes it challenging for
scientists to move from a list of papers to a synthesized understanding of a
topic. Because of the constant influx of new papers on a daily basis, even if a
scientist identifies a promising set of papers, they still face the tedious
task of individually reading through dozens of titles and abstracts to make
sense of occasionally conflicting findings. To address this critical bottleneck
in the research workflow, we introduce a summarization feature to BIP! Finder,
a scholarly search engine that ranks literature based on distinct impact
aspects like popularity and influence. Our approach enables users to generate
two types of summaries from top-ranked search results: a concise summary for an
instantaneous at-a-glance comprehension and a more comprehensive literature
review-style summary for greater, better-organized comprehension. This ability
dynamically leverages BIP! Finder's already existing impact-based ranking and
filtering features to generate context-sensitive, synthesized narratives that
can significantly accelerate literature discovery and comprehension.

implications for other academic procedures. We detail how dishonest researchers
exploit the peer-review system by creating fraudulent reviewer profiles to
manipulate paper evaluations, leveraging weaknesses in reviewer recruitment

TL;DR: Sci-OG is a semi-automated method for generating research topic ontologies, outperforming manual curation and other automated approaches with a high F1 score of 0.951.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual curation of research topic taxonomies is slow, outdated, and lacks granularity, necessitating an automated solution.

Method: Sci-OG uses a multi-step approach: topic discovery, relationship classification (core step with a language model), and ontology construction.

Result: Achieves an F1 score of 0.951, surpassing alternatives like fine-tuned SciBERT and GPT4-mini, and successfully extends the CSO ontology in cybersecurity.

Conclusion: Sci-OG enhances scientific knowledge organization, supporting AI-driven literature management and research exploration.

Abstract: Taxonomies and ontologies of research topics (e.g., MeSH, UMLS, CSO, NLM)
play a central role in providing the primary framework through which
intelligent systems can explore and interpret the literature. However, these
resources have traditionally been manually curated, a process that is
time-consuming, prone to obsolescence, and limited in granularity. This paper
presents Sci-OG, a semi-auto\-mated methodology for generating research topic
ontologies, employing a multi-step approach: 1) Topic Discovery, extracting
potential topics from research papers; 2) Relationship Classification,
determining semantic relationships between topic pairs; and 3) Ontology
Construction, refining and organizing topics into a structured ontology. The
relationship classification component, which constitutes the core of the
system, integrates an encoder-based language model with features describing
topic occurrence in the scientific literature. We evaluate this approach
against a range of alternative solutions using a dataset of 21,649 manually
annotated semantic triples. Our method achieves the highest F1 score (0.951),
surpassing various competing approaches, including a fine-tuned SciBERT model
and several LLM baselines, such as the fine-tuned GPT4-mini. Our work is
corroborated by a use case which illustrates the practical application of our
system to extend the CSO ontology in the area of cybersecurity. The presented
solution is designed to improve the accessibility, organization, and analysis
of scientific knowledge, thereby supporting advancements in AI-enabled
literature management and research exploration.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper discusses generative models in AI, their applications in recommender systems (Gen-RecSys), and introduces a taxonomy for deep generative models (DGMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a comprehensive understanding of generative models, focusing on DGMs, and their role in improving recommender systems and other domains.

Method: Introduces a taxonomy categorizing DGMs into ID-driven models, large language models (LLMs), and multimodal models, and examines their advancements.

Result: The taxonomy aids researchers in navigating Gen-RecSys developments, while highlighting the need for robust evaluation frameworks.

Conclusion: Generative models enhance recommender systems and other applications, but their impact and risks necessitate careful evaluation.

Abstract: Generative models are a class of AI models capable of creating new instances
of data by learning and sampling from their statistical distributions. In
recent years, these models have gained prominence in machine learning due to
the development of approaches such as generative adversarial networks (GANs),
variational autoencoders (VAEs), and transformer-based architectures such as
GPT. These models have applications across various domains, such as image
generation, text synthesis, and music composition. In recommender systems,
generative models, referred to as Gen-RecSys, improve the accuracy and
diversity of recommendations by generating structured outputs, text-based
interactions, and multimedia content. By leveraging these capabilities,
Gen-RecSys can produce more personalized, engaging, and dynamic user
experiences, expanding the role of AI in eCommerce, media, and beyond.
  Our book goes beyond existing literature by offering a comprehensive
understanding of generative models and their applications, with a special focus
on deep generative models (DGMs) and their classification. We introduce a
taxonomy that categorizes DGMs into three types: ID-driven models, large
language models (LLMs), and multimodal models. Each category addresses unique
technical and architectural advancements within its respective research area.
This taxonomy allows researchers to easily navigate developments in Gen-RecSys
across domains such as conversational AI and multimodal content generation.
Additionally, we examine the impact and potential risks of generative models,
emphasizing the importance of robust evaluation frameworks.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper reveals privacy vulnerabilities in LLM-powered recommender systems, showing they can be exploited via reconstruction attacks to recover user data like preferences and demographics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the privacy risks in LLM-based recommender systems, which are vulnerable to inversion attacks despite their effectiveness.

Method: The study introduces a systematic approach using the vec2text framework and a Similarity Guided Refinement method to reconstruct prompts from model logits.

Result: Experiments show high fidelity reconstructions: 65% of user-interacted items and 87% of demographic attributes (age/gender) were recovered.

Conclusion: LLM-powered recommender systems have critical privacy vulnerabilities, with leakage dependent on domain consistency and prompt complexity, not model performance.

Abstract: The large language model (LLM) powered recommendation paradigm has been
proposed to address the limitations of traditional recommender systems, which
often struggle to handle cold start users or items with new IDs. Despite its
effectiveness, this study uncovers that LLM empowered recommender systems are
vulnerable to reconstruction attacks that can expose both system and user
privacy. To examine this threat, we present the first systematic study on
inversion attacks targeting LLM empowered recommender systems, where
adversaries attempt to reconstruct original prompts that contain personal
preferences, interaction histories, and demographic attributes by exploiting
the output logits of recommendation models. We reproduce the vec2text framework
and optimize it using our proposed method called Similarity Guided Refinement,
enabling more accurate reconstruction of textual prompts from model generated
logits. Extensive experiments across two domains (movies and books) and two
representative LLM based recommendation models demonstrate that our method
achieves high fidelity reconstructions. Specifically, we can recover nearly 65
percent of the user interacted items and correctly infer age and gender in 87
percent of the cases. The experiments also reveal that privacy leakage is
largely insensitive to the victim model's performance but highly dependent on
domain consistency and prompt complexity. These findings expose critical
privacy vulnerabilities in LLM empowered recommender systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social media's ubiquity makes it a valuable resource for identifying estate-related issues in growing urban populations.

Method: Hierarchical classification filters relevant posts and categorizes them; a transformer-based geolocation module infers locations for untagged posts.

Result: The system provides timely, data-driven insights for urban management and situational awareness.

Conclusion: The integrated approach effectively leverages social media for actionable estate-related event detection and classification.

Abstract: Social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook have become deeply
embedded in our everyday life, offering a dynamic stream of localized news and
personal experiences. The ubiquity of these platforms position them as valuable
resources for identifying estate-related issues, especially in the context of
growing urban populations. In this work, we present a language model-based
system for the detection and classification of estate-related events from
social media content. Our system employs a hierarchical classification
framework to first filter relevant posts and then categorize them into
actionable estate-related topics. Additionally, for posts lacking explicit
geotags, we apply a transformer-based geolocation module to infer posting
locations at the point-of-interest level. This integrated approach supports
timely, data-driven insights for urban management, operational response and
situational awareness.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: ConvMix is a framework for improving conversational dense retrieval by addressing data scarcity through mixed-criteria augmentation and leveraging large language models for scalable relevance judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of revealing real users' search intent in conversational search due to data scarcity in existing training paradigms.

Method: Proposes ConvMix, a mixed-criteria framework with two-sided relevance judgment augmentation and quality control mechanisms, utilizing large language models.

Result: Outperforms baseline methods on five benchmarks, demonstrating superior effectiveness.

Conclusion: ConvMix effectively addresses data scarcity and enhances conversational dense retrieval performance.

Abstract: Conversational search aims to satisfy users' complex information needs via
multiple-turn interactions. The key challenge lies in revealing real users'
search intent from the context-dependent queries. Previous studies achieve
conversational search by fine-tuning a conversational dense retriever with
relevance judgments between pairs of context-dependent queries and documents.
However, this training paradigm encounters data scarcity issues. To this end,
we propose ConvMix, a mixed-criteria framework to augment conversational dense
retrieval, which covers more aspects than existing data augmentation
frameworks. We design a two-sided relevance judgment augmentation schema in a
scalable manner via the aid of large language models. Besides, we integrate the
framework with quality control mechanisms to obtain semantically diverse
samples and near-distribution supervisions to combine various annotated data.
Experimental results on five widely used benchmarks show that the
conversational dense retriever trained by our ConvMix framework outperforms
previous baseline methods, which demonstrates our superior effectiveness.

TL;DR: A unified content-based recommendation system for Allegro.com addresses scalability, maintenance, and dynamic catalog challenges using a Two Tower framework, adapting to multiple tasks with minimal changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle challenges in large-scale e-commerce recommendations: universal architecture, reduced maintenance costs, and dynamic catalog management.

Method: Uses a Two Tower retrieval framework with product attributes for efficient Approximate Nearest Neighbour search, adaptable to three tasks with minor modifications.

Result: Significant gains in engagement and profit metrics across platforms, confirmed by two years of A/B testing.

Conclusion: A flexible, scalable architecture can serve diverse user needs with low maintenance overhead.

Abstract: Building large-scale e-commerce recommendation systems requires addressing
three key technical challenges: (1) designing a universal recommendation
architecture across dozens of placements, (2) decreasing excessive maintenance
costs, and (3) managing a highly dynamic product catalogue. This paper presents
a unified content-based recommendation system deployed at Allegro.com, the
largest e-commerce platform of European origin. The system is built on a
prevalent Two Tower retrieval framework, representing products using textual
and structured attributes, which enables efficient retrieval via Approximate
Nearest Neighbour search. We demonstrate how the same model architecture can be
adapted to serve three distinct recommendation tasks: similarity search,
complementary product suggestions, and inspirational content discovery, by
modifying only a handful of components in either the model or the serving
logic. Extensive A/B testing over two years confirms significant gains in
engagement and profit-based metrics across desktop and mobile app channels. Our
results show that a flexible, scalable architecture can serve diverse user
intents with minimal maintenance overhead.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effectiveness of generative AI in health-related behavioral interventions, particularly for reducing technology use.

Method: Uses the GQM paradigm to test AI tools on predefined user profiles, measuring performance metrics (precision, recall, F1-score, MCC-score) and user satisfaction.

Result: Evaluates which AI tool provides the most accurate recommendations (RQ1) and how tool choice affects user satisfaction (RQ2).

Conclusion: Aims to fill the gap in understanding AI's role in health interventions for reducing digital dependency.

Abstract: Background: Generative AI tools have become increasingly relevant in
supporting personalized recommendations across various domains. However, their
effectiveness in health-related behavioral interventions, especially those
aiming to reduce the use of technology, remains underexplored. Aims: This study
evaluates the performance and user satisfaction of the five most widely used
generative AI tools when recommending non-digital activities tailored to
individuals at risk of repetitive strain injury. Method: Following the
Goal/Question/Metric (GQM) paradigm, this proposed experiment involves
generative AI tools that suggest offline activities based on predefined user
profiles and intervention scenarios. The evaluation is focused on quantitative
performance (precision, recall, F1-score and MCC-score) and qualitative aspects
(user satisfaction and perceived recommendation relevance). Two research
questions were defined: RQ1 assessed which tool delivers the most accurate
recommendations, and RQ2 evaluated how tool choice influences user
satisfaction.

### [350] [Do Recommender Systems Really Leverage Multimodal Content? A Comprehensive Analysis on Multimodal Representations for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04571)
*Claudio Pomo,Matteo Attimonelli,Danilo Danese,Fedelucio Narducci,Tommaso Di Noia*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper explores whether gains in Multimodal Recommender Systems come from true multimodal understanding or just increased complexity, proposing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for better semantic alignment and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify if performance improvements in multimodal recommender systems are due to genuine multimodal understanding or merely added model complexity.

Method: Uses LVLMs to generate multimodal-by-design embeddings via structured prompts, avoiding ad hoc fusion strategies.

Result: LVLMs improve performance and provide semantically aligned representations, which can be decoded into textual descriptions to validate understanding.

Conclusion: LVLMs offer robust, semantically rich representations for multimodal recommendation tasks, enhancing both performance and interpretability.

Abstract: Multimodal Recommender Systems aim to improve recommendation accuracy by
integrating heterogeneous content, such as images and textual metadata. While
effective, it remains unclear whether their gains stem from true multimodal
understanding or increased model complexity. This work investigates the role of
multimodal item embeddings, emphasizing the semantic informativeness of the
representations. Initial experiments reveal that embeddings from standard
extractors (e.g., ResNet50, Sentence-Bert) enhance performance, but rely on
modality-specific encoders and ad hoc fusion strategies that lack control over
cross-modal alignment. To overcome these limitations, we leverage Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to generate multimodal-by-design embeddings via
structured prompts. This approach yields semantically aligned representations
without requiring any fusion. Experiments across multiple settings show notable
performance improvements. Furthermore, LVLMs embeddings offer a distinctive
advantage: they can be decoded into structured textual descriptions, enabling
direct assessment of their multimodal comprehension. When such descriptions are
incorporated as side content into recommender systems, they improve
recommendation performance, empirically validating the semantic depth and
alignment encoded within LVLMs outputs. Our study highlights the importance of
semantically rich representations and positions LVLMs as a compelling
foundation for building robust and meaningful multimodal representations in
recommendation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional search methods struggle with noise and relevance in free-form text queries, which QAM aims to address.

Method: QAM decomposes queries into structured metadata tags and semantic elements, enhancing search precision.

Result: QAM achieved a mAP@5 of 52.99%, outperforming BM25, semantic search, and hybrid methods.

Conclusion: QAM is a robust solution for Enterprise Search, especially in e-commerce.

Abstract: This study introduces Query Attribute Modeling (QAM), a hybrid framework that
enhances search precision and relevance by decomposing open text queries into
structured metadata tags and semantic elements. QAM addresses traditional
search limitations by automatically extracting metadata filters from free-form
text queries, reducing noise and enabling focused retrieval of relevant items.
  Experimental evaluation using the Amazon Toys Reviews dataset (10,000 unique
items with 40,000+ reviews and detailed product attributes) demonstrated QAM's
superior performance, achieving a mean average precision at 5 (mAP@5) of
52.99\%. This represents significant improvement over conventional methods,
including BM25 keyword search, encoder-based semantic similarity search,
cross-encoder re-ranking, and hybrid search combining BM25 and semantic results
via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). The results establish QAM as a robust
solution for Enterprise Search applications, particularly in e-commerce
systems.

### [352] [Enhancing Serendipity Recommendation System by Constructing Dynamic User Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04032)
*Qian Yong,Yanhui Li,Jialiang Shi,Yaguang Dou,Tian Qi*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method using LLMs to dynamically construct user knowledge graphs for serendipitous recommendations, improving novelty and user engagement in industrial RSs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the filter bubble effect and low user satisfaction in industrial recommendation systems by leveraging LLMs for serendipitous recommendations.

Method: A two-stage framework: (1) two-hop interest reasoning to construct user knowledge graphs via LLMs, and (2) near-line adaptation for cost-effective deployment in industrial RSs.

Result: Online experiments showed improvements in novelty rates (exposure +4.62%, click +4.85%) and user engagement metrics (view duration +0.15%, CTR +0.07%, interaction penetration +0.30%).

Conclusion: The method effectively enhances serendipity and user experience in recommendation systems while meeting industrial latency requirements.

Abstract: The feedback loop in industrial recommendation systems reinforces homogeneous
content, creates filter bubble effects, and diminishes user satisfaction.
Recently, large language models(LLMs) have demonstrated potential in
serendipity recommendation, thanks to their extensive world knowledge and
superior reasoning capabilities. However, these models still face challenges in
ensuring the rationality of the reasoning process, the usefulness of the
reasoning results, and meeting the latency requirements of industrial
recommendation systems (RSs). To address these challenges, we propose a method
that leverages llm to dynamically construct user knowledge graphs, thereby
enhancing the serendipity of recommendation systems. This method comprises a
two stage framework:(1) two-hop interest reasoning, where user static profiles
and historical behaviors are utilized to dynamically construct user knowledge
graphs via llm. Two-hop reasoning, which can enhance the quality and accuracy
of LLM reasoning results, is then performed on the constructed graphs to
identify users' potential interests; and(2) Near-line adaptation, a
cost-effective approach to deploying the aforementioned models in industrial
recommendation systems. We propose a u2i (user-to-item) retrieval model that
also incorporates i2i (item-to-item) retrieval capabilities, the retrieved
items not only exhibit strong relevance to users' newly emerged interests but
also retain the high conversion rate of traditional u2i retrieval. Our online
experiments on the Dewu app, which has tens of millions of users, indicate that
the method increased the exposure novelty rate by 4.62%, the click novelty rate
by 4.85%, the average view duration per person by 0.15%, unique visitor click
through rate by 0.07%, and unique visitor interaction penetration by 0.30%,
enhancing user experience.

*Maria JoÃ£o Lavoura,Robert Jungnickel,JoÃ£o Vinagre*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a methodology to evaluate recommendation models' stability and plasticity when retrained, using an offline protocol to study long-term behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current offline evaluation protocols for recommendation models only capture past performance, ignoring evolving online systems. The paper aims to address this gap by studying how models behave when retrained over time.

Method: The authors introduce an offline evaluation protocol to profile algorithms based on their stability (retaining past patterns) and plasticity (adapting to changes). This protocol is dataset, algorithm, and metric agnostic.

Result: Preliminary results on the GoodReads dataset show varying stability and plasticity profiles across three algorithms, suggesting a trade-off between the two.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers valuable insights into the long-term dynamics of recommendation models, though further experiments are needed to confirm initial observations.

Abstract: The typical offline protocol to evaluate recommendation algorithms is to
collect a dataset of user-item interactions and then use a part of this dataset
to train a model, and the remaining data to measure how closely the model
recommendations match the observed user interactions. This protocol is
straightforward, useful and practical, but it only captures performance of a
particular model trained at some point in the past. We know, however, that
online systems evolve over time. In general, it is a good idea that models
reflect such changes, so models are frequently retrained with recent data. But
if this is the case, to what extent can we trust previous evaluations? How will
a model perform when a different pattern (re)emerges? In this paper we propose
a methodology to study how recommendation models behave when they are
retrained. The idea is to profile algorithms according to their ability to, on
the one hand, retain past patterns -- stability -- and, on the other hand,
(quickly) adapt to changes -- plasticity. We devise an offline evaluation
protocol that provides detail on the long-term behavior of models, and that is
agnostic to datasets, algorithms and metrics. To illustrate the potential of
this framework, we present preliminary results of three different types of
algorithms on the GoodReads dataset that suggest different stability and
plasticity profiles depending on the algorithmic technique, and a possible
trade-off between stability and plasticity.Although additional experiments will
be necessary to confirm these observations, they already illustrate the
usefulness of the proposed framework to gain insights on the long term dynamics
of recommendation models.

Conclusion: NIRMAL is a versatile and effective optimizer for deep learning, particularly on complex datasets.

Abstract: This study proposes NIRMAL (Novel Integrated Robust Multi-Adaptation
Learning), a novel optimization algorithm that combines multiple strategies
inspired by the movements of the chess piece. These strategies include gradient
descent, momentum, stochastic perturbations, adaptive learning rates, and
non-linear transformations. We carefully evaluated NIRMAL against two widely
used and successful optimizers, Adam and SGD with Momentum, on four benchmark
image classification datasets: MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100.
The custom convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is applied on each
dataset. The experimental results show that NIRMAL achieves competitive
performance, particularly on the more challenging CIFAR-100 dataset, where it
achieved a test accuracy of 45.32\%and a weighted F1-score of 0.4328. This
performance surpasses Adam (41.79\% accuracy, 0.3964 F1-score) and closely
matches SGD with Momentum (46.97\% accuracy, 0.4531 F1-score). Also, NIRMAL
exhibits robust convergence and strong generalization capabilities, especially
on complex datasets, as evidenced by stable training results in loss and
accuracy curves. These findings underscore NIRMAL's significant ability as a
versatile and effective optimizer for various deep learning tasks.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a per-user meta-learning approach for recommender system selection, using user meta-features and algorithm features from source code, improving performance by 8.83%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Algorithm Selection Problem in recommender systems is challenging, and traditional meta-learning ignores algorithm properties. Leveraging algorithm features can enhance performance.

Method: A meta-learning approach combines user meta-features and algorithm features extracted from source code.

Result: The approach improves NDCG@10 performance by 8.83%, outperforming the Single Best Algorithm baseline and closing 10.5% of the gap to an oracle selector.

Conclusion: Static source code metrics provide valuable predictive signals, offering a promising direction for more robust recommender systems.

Abstract: The Algorithm Selection Problem for recommender systems-choosing the best
algorithm for a given user or context-remains a significant challenge.
Traditional meta-learning approaches often treat algorithms as categorical
choices, ignoring their intrinsic properties. Recent work has shown that
explicitly characterizing algorithms with features can improve model
performance in other domains. Building on this, we propose a per-user
meta-learning approach for recommender system selection that leverages both
user meta-features and automatically extracted algorithm features from source
code. Our preliminary results, averaged over six diverse datasets, show that
augmenting a meta-learner with algorithm features improves its average NDCG@10
performance by 8.83% from 0.135 (user features only) to 0.147. This enhanced
model outperforms the Single Best Algorithm baseline (0.131) and successfully
closes 10.5% of the performance gap to a theoretical oracle selector. These
findings show that even static source code metrics provide a valuable
predictive signal, presenting a promising direction for building more robust
and intelligent recommender systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of research on autoregressive generative models makes manual literature surveys and reproduction impractical, necessitating an automated solution.

Method: The pipeline retrieves documents, filters for relevance, extracts metadata and results, clusters topics, generates summaries, and creates scripts for experiment reproduction.

Result: Evaluation shows high F1 scores (above 0.85) for relevance, hyper-parameter extraction, and citation tasks, with near-linear scalability for up to 1000 papers. Reproduction experiments achieve results within 1-3% of original reports.

Conclusion: The pipeline is effective for automating literature surveys and experiment reproduction, demonstrating high accuracy and scalability.

Abstract: The accelerating pace of research on autoregressive generative models has
produced thousands of papers, making manual literature surveys and reproduction
studies increasingly impractical. We present a fully open-source, reproducible
pipeline that automatically retrieves candidate documents from public
repositories, filters them for relevance, extracts metadata, hyper-parameters
and reported results, clusters topics, produces retrieval-augmented summaries
and generates containerised scripts for re-running selected experiments.
Quantitative evaluation on 50 manually-annotated papers shows F1 scores above
0.85 for relevance classification, hyper-parameter extraction and citation
identification. Experiments on corpora of up to 1000 papers demonstrate
near-linear scalability with eight CPU workers. Three case studies -- AWD-LSTM
on WikiText-2, Transformer-XL on WikiText-103 and an autoregressive music model
on the Lakh MIDI dataset -- confirm that the extracted settings support
faithful reproduction, achieving test perplexities within 1--3% of the original
reports.

### [357] [Audio Does Matter: Importance-Aware Multi-Granularity Fusion for Video Moment Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04273)
*Junan Lin,Daizong Liu,Xianke Chen,Xiaoye Qu,Xun Yang,Jixiang Zhu,Sanyuan Zhang,Jianfeng Dong*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Importance-aware Multi-Granularity fusion model (IMG) for Video Moment Retrieval (VMR), dynamically integrating audio, vision, and text while mitigating noisy audio interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VMR methods neglect audio or treat all modalities equally, leading to suboptimal performance due to irrelevant or noisy audio.

Method: IMG uses a pseudo-label-supervised audio importance predictor and multi-granularity fusion for adaptive audio-vision-text integration, plus cross-modal knowledge distillation for missing audio.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the new Charades-AudioMatter dataset, validating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: IMG effectively leverages audio for VMR by dynamically weighting and fusing modalities, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) aims to retrieve a specific moment semantically
related to the given query. To tackle this task, most existing VMR methods
solely focus on the visual and textual modalities while neglecting the
complementary but important audio modality. Although a few recent works try to
tackle the joint audio-vision-text reasoning, they treat all modalities equally
and simply embed them without fine-grained interaction for moment retrieval.
These designs are counter-practical as: Not all audios are helpful for video
moment retrieval, and the audio of some videos may be complete noise or
background sound that is meaningless to the moment determination. To this end,
we propose a novel Importance-aware Multi-Granularity fusion model (IMG), which
learns to dynamically and selectively aggregate the audio-vision-text contexts
for VMR. Specifically, after integrating the textual guidance with vision and
audio separately, we first design a pseudo-label-supervised audio importance
predictor that predicts the importance score of the audio, and accordingly
assigns weights to mitigate the interference caused by noisy audio. Then, we
design a multi-granularity audio fusion module that adaptively fuses audio and
visual modalities at local-, event-, and global-level, fully capturing their
complementary contexts. We further propose a cross-modal knowledge distillation
strategy to address the challenge of missing audio modality during inference.
To evaluate our method, we further construct a new VMR dataset, i.e.,
Charades-AudioMatter, where audio-related samples are manually selected and
re-organized from the original Charades-STA to validate the model's capability
in utilizing audio modality. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness
of our method, achieving state-of-the-art with audio-video fusion in VMR
methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/HuiGuanLab/IMG.

TL;DR: HiD-VAE introduces a hierarchically-supervised quantization process and uniqueness loss to improve generative recommendation by addressing semantic flatness and representation entanglement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative recommendation methods suffer from uninterpretable semantic IDs and representation entanglement, harming accuracy and diversity.

Method: HiD-VAE uses hierarchically-supervised quantization and a uniqueness loss to create disentangled, interpretable item representations.

Result: HiD-VAE outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three benchmarks, providing traceable and diverse recommendations.

Conclusion: HiD-VAE effectively resolves ID collision issues and enhances recommendation quality through hierarchical disentanglement.

Abstract: Recommender systems are indispensable for helping users navigate the immense
item catalogs of modern online platforms. Recently, generative recommendation
has emerged as a promising paradigm, unifying the conventional
retrieve-and-rank pipeline into an end-to-end model capable of dynamic
generation. However, existing generative methods are fundamentally constrained
by their unsupervised tokenization, which generates semantic IDs suffering from
two critical flaws: (1) they are semantically flat and uninterpretable, lacking
a coherent hierarchy, and (2) they are prone to representation entanglement
(i.e., ``ID collisions''), which harms recommendation accuracy and diversity.
To overcome these limitations, we propose HiD-VAE, a novel framework that
learns hierarchically disentangled item representations through two core
innovations. First, HiD-VAE pioneers a hierarchically-supervised quantization
process that aligns discrete codes with multi-level item tags, yielding more
uniform and disentangled IDs. Crucially, the trained codebooks can predict
hierarchical tags, providing a traceable and interpretable semantic path for
each recommendation. Second, to combat representation entanglement, HiD-VAE
incorporates a novel uniqueness loss that directly penalizes latent space
overlap. This mechanism not only resolves the critical ID collision problem but
also promotes recommendation diversity by ensuring a more comprehensive
utilization of the item representation space. These high-quality, disentangled
IDs provide a powerful foundation for downstream generative models. Extensive
experiments on three public benchmarks validate HiD-VAE's superior performance
against state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HiD-VAE-84B2.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting large-scale robot demonstration data is costly and time-consuming, necessitating efficient methods for data generation.

Method: CP-Gen decomposes expert demonstrations into free-space motions and robot skills, using keypoint-trajectory constraints for geometry-aware data generation.

Result: Policies trained with CP-Gen achieve a 77% success rate, outperforming baselines at 50%.

Conclusion: CP-Gen provides an effective, scalable solution for generating diverse robot demonstrations, improving real-world policy performance.

Abstract: Large-scale demonstration data has powered key breakthroughs in robot
manipulation, but collecting that data remains costly and time-consuming. We
present Constraint-Preserving Data Generation (CP-Gen), a method that uses a
single expert trajectory to generate robot demonstrations containing novel
object geometries and poses. These generated demonstrations are used to train
closed-loop visuomotor policies that transfer zero-shot to the real world and
generalize across variations in object geometries and poses. Similar to prior
work using pose variations for data generation, CP-Gen first decomposes expert
demonstrations into free-space motions and robot skills. But unlike those
works, we achieve geometry-aware data generation by formulating robot skills as
keypoint-trajectory constraints: keypoints on the robot or grasped object must
track a reference trajectory defined relative to a task-relevant object. To
generate a new demonstration, CP-Gen samples pose and geometry transforms for
each task-relevant object, then applies these transforms to the object and its
associated keypoints or keypoint trajectories. We optimize robot joint
configurations so that the keypoints on the robot or grasped object track the
transformed keypoint trajectory, and then motion plan a collision-free path to
the first optimized joint configuration. Experiments on 16 simulation tasks and
four real-world tasks, featuring multi-stage, non-prehensile and
tight-tolerance manipulation, show that policies trained using CP-Gen achieve
an average success rate of 77%, outperforming the best baseline that achieves
an average of 50%.

TL;DR: DRIVE is a framework for inferring and verifying human-like driving constraints from expert demonstrations, ensuring safe and compliant autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft constraints in driving are implicit and context-dependent, making them hard to specify explicitly. DRIVE addresses this gap by learning and verifying these constraints.

Method: DRIVE uses exponential-family likelihood modeling to estimate state transition feasibility, embeds learned rules into convex optimization for planning, and supports data-driven generalization.

Result: DRIVE achieves 0.0% soft constraint violation rates, smoother trajectories, and strong generalization in diverse driving scenarios.

Conclusion: DRIVE is efficient, explainable, and robust, making it suitable for real-world deployment in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Understanding and adhering to soft constraints is essential for safe and
socially compliant autonomous driving. However, such constraints are often
implicit, context-dependent, and difficult to specify explicitly. In this work,
we present DRIVE, a novel framework for Dynamic Rule Inference and Verified
Evaluation that models and evaluates human-like driving constraints from expert
demonstrations. DRIVE leverages exponential-family likelihood modeling to
estimate the feasibility of state transitions, constructing a probabilistic
representation of soft behavioral rules that vary across driving contexts.
These learned rule distributions are then embedded into a convex
optimization-based planning module, enabling the generation of trajectories
that are not only dynamically feasible but also compliant with inferred human
preferences. Unlike prior approaches that rely on fixed constraint forms or
purely reward-based modeling, DRIVE offers a unified framework that tightly
couples rule inference with trajectory-level decision-making. It supports both
data-driven constraint generalization and principled feasibility verification.
We validate DRIVE on large-scale naturalistic driving datasets, including inD,
highD, and RoundD, and benchmark it against representative inverse constraint
learning and planning baselines. Experimental results show that DRIVE achieves
0.0% soft constraint violation rates, smoother trajectories, and stronger
generalization across diverse driving scenarios. Verified evaluations further
demonstrate the efficiency, explanability, and robustness of the framework for
real-world deployment.

Motivation: Existing autonomous driving systems struggle with rare high-risk scenarios due to lack of real-world data.

Method: Developed HASS dataset for edge cases and introduced SPE and I2E Encoder for multimodal learning.

Result: 50% improvement in challenging scenarios, state-of-the-art in real-world open-loop planning.

Conclusion: RoboTron-Sim effectively manages rare high-risk driving scenarios, enhancing autonomous driving performance.

Abstract: Collecting real-world data for rare high-risk scenarios, long-tailed driving
events, and complex interactions remains challenging, leading to poor
performance of existing autonomous driving systems in these critical
situations. In this paper, we propose RoboTron-Sim that improves real-world
driving in critical situations by utilizing simulated hard cases. First, we
develop a simulated dataset called Hard-case Augmented Synthetic Scenarios
(HASS), which covers 13 high-risk edge-case categories, as well as balanced
environmental conditions such as day/night and sunny/rainy. Second, we
introduce Scenario-aware Prompt Engineering (SPE) and an Image-to-Ego Encoder
(I2E Encoder) to enable multimodal large language models to effectively learn
real-world challenging driving skills from HASS, via adapting to environmental
deviations and hardware differences between real-world and simulated scenarios.
Extensive experiments on nuScenes show that RoboTron-Sim improves driving
performance in challenging scenarios by around 50%, achieving state-of-the-art
results in real-world open-loop planning. Qualitative results further
demonstrate the effectiveness of RoboTron-Sim in better managing rare high-risk
driving scenarios. Project page: https://stars79689.github.io/RoboTron-Sim/

TL;DR: The paper explores performance trade-offs in hierarchical multi-agent frameworks for MARS, focusing on coordination failures and communication structures in a healthcare scenario.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world deployment of multi-agent robotic systems (MARS) is limited despite advanced frameworks, hindering practical research.

Method: Two studies: Study 1 refines knowledge bases to identify coordination failures; Study 2 evaluates bidirectional communication and reasoning models.

Result: Identified unresolved coordination failures and trade-offs between reasoning models, highlighting autonomy-stability tension.

Conclusion: Emphasizes edge-case testing for reliability and safety in real-world MARS deployment.

Abstract: Multi-agent robotic systems (MARS) build upon multi-agent systems by
integrating physical and task-related constraints, increasing the complexity of
action execution and agent coordination. However, despite the availability of
advanced multi-agent frameworks, their real-world deployment on robots remains
limited, hindering the advancement of MARS research in practice. To bridge this
gap, we conducted two studies to investigate performance trade-offs of
hierarchical multi-agent frameworks in a simulated real-world multi-robot
healthcare scenario. In Study 1, using CrewAI, we iteratively refine the
system's knowledge base, to systematically identify and categorize coordination
failures (e.g., tool access violations, lack of timely handling of failure
reports) not resolvable by providing contextual knowledge alone. In Study 2,
using AutoGen, we evaluate a redesigned bidirectional communication structure

### [363] [Do GNN-based QEC Decoders Require Classical Knowledge? Evaluating the Efficacy of Knowledge Distillation from MWPM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03782)
*Ryota Ikeda*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: GNNs in QEC show promise, but knowledge distillation from MWPM to GNNs doesn't significantly improve performance, as GNNs can learn directly from hardware data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test if knowledge distillation from classical algorithms like MWPM can enhance GNN performance in QEC decoders.

Method: Compare two GAT-based models: one purely data-driven (baseline) and one with knowledge distillation loss from MWPM.

Result: Knowledge distillation model showed similar test accuracy but slower convergence and longer training time than baseline.

Conclusion: Modern GNNs can learn complex error correlations directly from hardware data without relying on theoretical models.

Abstract: The performance of decoders in Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is key to
realizing practical quantum computers. In recent years, Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach, but their training methodologies
are not yet well-established. It is generally expected that transferring
theoretical knowledge from classical algorithms like Minimum Weight Perfect
Matching (MWPM) to GNNs, a technique known as knowledge distillation, can
effectively improve performance. In this work, we test this hypothesis by
rigorously comparing two models based on a Graph Attention Network (GAT)
architecture that incorporates temporal information as node features. The first
is a purely data-driven model (baseline) trained only on ground-truth labels,
while the second incorporates a knowledge distillation loss based on the
theoretical error probabilities from MWPM. Using public experimental data from
Google, our evaluation reveals that while the final test accuracy of the
knowledge distillation model was nearly identical to the baseline, its training
loss converged more slowly, and the training time increased by a factor of
approximately five. This result suggests that modern GNN architectures possess
a high capacity to efficiently learn complex error correlations directly from
real hardware data, without guidance from approximate theoretical models.

### [364] [Probing and Enhancing the Robustness of GNN-based QEC Decoders with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03783)
*Ryota Ikeda*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning (RL) agent is used to identify vulnerabilities in a Graph Neural Network (GNN) decoder for Quantum Error Correction (QEC), showing that adversarial training can enhance robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and improve the robustness of GNN decoders in QEC against adversarial perturbations.

Method: A RL agent is trained to find minimal syndrome modifications causing decoder misclassification, applied to a Graph Attention Network (GAT) decoder on Google Quantum AI data.

Result: The RL agent identifies critical vulnerabilities with high success rates, and adversarial training significantly improves decoder robustness.

Conclusion: The framework of automated vulnerability discovery and adversarial training offers a reliable approach for robust neural network decoders in quantum computing.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful, data-driven approach
for Quantum Error Correction (QEC) decoding, capable of learning complex noise
characteristics directly from syndrome data. However, the robustness of these
decoders against subtle, adversarial perturbations remains a critical open
question. This work introduces a novel framework to systematically probe the
vulnerabilities of a GNN decoder using a reinforcement learning (RL) agent. The
RL agent is trained as an adversary with the goal of finding minimal syndrome
modifications that cause the decoder to misclassify. We apply this framework to
a Graph Attention Network (GAT) decoder trained on experimental surface code
data from Google Quantum AI. Our results show that the RL agent can
successfully identify specific, critical vulnerabilities, achieving a high
attack success rate with a minimal number of bit flips. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that the decoder's robustness can be significantly enhanced through
adversarial training, where the model is retrained on the adversarial examples
generated by the RL agent. This iterative process of automated vulnerability
discovery and targeted retraining presents a promising methodology for
developing more reliable and robust neural network decoders for fault-tolerant
quantum computing.

*Soohaeng Yoo Willow,D. ChangMo Yang,Chang Woo Myung*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Hybrid quantum-classical MLPs outperform classical MLPs in predicting DFT properties of liquid silicon, showcasing near-term quantum advantage in materials modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore practical advantages of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for simulating molecular systems, given the limitations of current quantum hardware.

Method: Benchmarked a classical E(3)-equivariant MLP against a hybrid quantum-classical MLP, replacing readouts in message-passing layers with VQCs for DFT property prediction.

Result: Hybrid MLP accurately reproduced high-temperature structural and thermodynamic properties of liquid silicon, outperforming the classical MLP.

Conclusion: Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms can provide measurable benefits over classical methods, suggesting a viable pathway for near-term quantum advantage in materials modeling.

Abstract: Quantum algorithms for simulating large and complex molecular systems are
still in their infancy, and surpassing state-of-the-art classical techniques
remains an ever-receding goal post. A promising avenue of inquiry in the
meanwhile is to seek practical advantages through hybrid quantum-classical
algorithms, which combine conventional neural networks with variational quantum
circuits (VQCs) running on today's noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)
hardware. Such hybrids are well suited to NISQ hardware. The classical
processor performs the bulk of the computation, while the quantum processor
executes targeted sub-tasks that supply additional non-linearity and
expressivity. Here, we benchmark a purely classical E(3)-equivariant
message-passing machine learning potential (MLP) against a hybrid
quantum-classical MLP for predicting density functional theory (DFT) properties
of liquid silicon. In our hybrid architecture, every readout in the
message-passing layers is replaced by a VQC. Molecular dynamics simulations
driven by the HQC-MLP reveal that an accurate reproduction of high-temperature
structural and thermodynamic properties is achieved with VQCs. These findings
demonstrate a concrete scenario in which NISQ-compatible HQC algorithm could
deliver a measurable benefit over the best available classical alternative,
suggesting a viable pathway toward near-term quantum advantage in materials
modeling.

### [366] [Challenges in Applying Variational Quantum Algorithms to Dynamic Satellite Network Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04288)
*Phuc Hao Do,Tran Duc Le*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Near-term quantum algorithms (VQE, QAOA, QRL) struggle with dynamic satellite network routing, failing in simple tasks due to optimization and learning challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate the potential of quantum algorithms for dynamic satellite network routing, a promising application for near-term quantum computing.

Method: Compare static quantum optimizers (VQE, QAOA) for offline routing and QRL for online decision-making using ideal simulations.

Result: Static optimizers fail on a 4-node problem; QRL performs no better than random in an 8-node environment due to barren plateaus and learning instability.

Conclusion: Key obstacles like barren plateaus must be addressed before quantum algorithms can benefit communication networks.

Abstract: Applying near-term variational quantum algorithms to the problem of dynamic
satellite network routing represents a promising direction for quantum
computing. In this work, we provide a critical evaluation of two major
approaches: static quantum optimizers such as the Variational Quantum
Eigensolver (VQE) and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for
offline route computation, and Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) methods for
online decision-making. Using ideal, noise-free simulations, we find that these
algorithms face significant challenges. Specifically, static optimizers are
unable to solve even a classically easy 4-node shortest path problem due to the
complexity of the optimization landscape. Likewise, a basic QRL agent based on
policy gradient methods fails to learn a useful routing strategy in a dynamic
8-node environment and performs no better than random actions. These negative
findings highlight key obstacles that must be addressed before quantum
algorithms can offer real advantages in communication networks. We discuss the
underlying causes of these limitations, including barren plateaus and learning
instability, and suggest future research directions to overcome them.

TL;DR: The paper explores quantum circuit complexity as a tool for interpretable and efficient unsupervised machine learning in quantum many-body systems, proposing fidelity- and entanglement-based kernels for clustering quantum phases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge quantum circuit complexity and unsupervised machine learning for understanding topological order in quantum systems.

Method: Two theorems connect quantum circuit complexity with fidelity change and entanglement generation, leading to practical kernels for unsupervised clustering.

Result: Numerical experiments show superior performance of the proposed kernels in clustering quantum phases.

Conclusion: The study links quantum circuit computation, complexity, and machine learning for topological quantum order, with implications for classical shadow tomography.

Abstract: Inspired by the close relationship between Kolmogorov complexity and
unsupervised machine learning, we explore quantum circuit complexity, an
important concept in quantum computation and quantum information science, as a
pivot to understand and to build interpretable and efficient unsupervised
machine learning for topological order in quantum many-body systems. To span a
bridge from conceptual power to practical applicability, we present two
theorems that connect Nielsen's quantum circuit complexity for the quantum path
planning between two arbitrary quantum many-body states with fidelity change
and entanglement generation, respectively. Leveraging these connections,
fidelity-based and entanglement-based similarity measures or kernels, which are
more practical for implementation, are formulated. Using the two proposed
kernels, numerical experiments targeting the unsupervised clustering of quantum
phases of the bond-alternating XXZ spin chain, the ground state of Kitaev's
toric code and random product states, are conducted, demonstrating their
superior performance. Relations with classical shadow tomography and shadow
kernel learning are also discussed, where the latter can be naturally derived
and understood from our approach. Our results establish connections between key
concepts and tools of quantum circuit computation, quantum complexity, and
machine learning of topological quantum order.

*Chi-Sheng Chen,Samuel Yen-Chi Chen,Yun-Cheng Tsai*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The study compares classical and quantum-inspired sequential models for forecasting SMS activity, finding quantum enhancements' effectiveness varies with task and design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the performance of quantum-inspired models in time series forecasting, specifically for SMS activity, and understand their sensitivity to input sequence length.

Method: Five models (LSTM, QLSTM, QASA, QRWKV, QFWP) were tested under varying input sequence lengths (4-64) to predict the next 10-minute SMS-in value.

Result: Quantum enhancements are not universally beneficial; their effectiveness depends on task and architectural design, highlighting trade-offs in model size and temporal modeling.

Conclusion: Quantum-inspired models show potential but require careful consideration of task-specific design and sequence length sensitivity.

Abstract: In this study, we evaluate the performance of classical and quantum-inspired
sequential models in forecasting univariate time series of incoming SMS
activity (SMS-in) using the Milan Telecommunication Activity Dataset. Due to
data completeness limitations, we focus exclusively on the SMS-in signal for
each spatial grid cell. We compare five models, LSTM (baseline), Quantum LSTM
(QLSTM), Quantum Adaptive Self-Attention (QASA), Quantum Receptance Weighted
Key-Value (QRWKV), and Quantum Fast Weight Programmers (QFWP), under varying
input sequence lengths (4, 8, 12, 16, 32 and 64). All models are trained to
predict the next 10-minute SMS-in value based solely on historical values
within a given sequence window. Our findings indicate that different models
exhibit varying sensitivities to sequence length, suggesting that quantum
enhancements are not universally advantageous. Rather, the effectiveness of
quantum modules is highly dependent on the specific task and architectural
design, reflecting inherent trade-offs among model size, parameterization
strategies, and temporal modeling capabilities.

*Xinqi Lyu,Yihao Liu,Yanjie Li,Bin Xiao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper investigates adversarial attacks on Text-to-Image (T2I) models to bypass safety mechanisms, proposing a novel prompt learning attack framework (PLA) for black-box settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the risks of T2I models generating NSFW content and the limitations of existing adversarial attack methods in black-box settings.

Method: Proposes PLA, a gradient-based training approach using multimodal similarities to learn adversarial prompts without access to model internals.

Result: PLA effectively bypasses safety mechanisms (prompt filters and post-hoc checkers) with higher success rates than state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The study highlights vulnerabilities in T2I safety mechanisms and demonstrates PLA's effectiveness in black-box adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have gained widespread adoption across various
applications. Despite the success, the potential misuse of T2I models poses
significant risks of generating Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) content. To
investigate the vulnerability of T2I models, this paper delves into adversarial
attacks to bypass the safety mechanisms under black-box settings. Most previous
methods rely on word substitution to search adversarial prompts. Due to limited
search space, this leads to suboptimal performance compared to gradient-based
training. However, black-box settings present unique challenges to training
gradient-driven attack methods, since there is no access to the internal
architecture and parameters of T2I models. To facilitate the learning of
adversarial prompts in black-box settings, we propose a novel prompt learning
attack framework (PLA), where insightful gradient-based training tailored to
black-box T2I models is designed by utilizing multimodal similarities.
Experiments show that our new method can effectively attack the safety
mechanisms of black-box T2I models including prompt filters and post-hoc safety
checkers with a high success rate compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The safety of AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot in high-stakes domains like cybersecurity is uncertain, and current red-teaming tools miss real-world vulnerabilities.

Method: ASTRA operates in three stages: (1) building domain-specific knowledge graphs, (2) adaptively probing the target model's input space and reasoning processes, and (3) generating violation-inducing cases for alignment.

Result: ASTRA finds 11-66% more issues than existing techniques and improves alignment training by 17%.

Conclusion: ASTRA demonstrates practical value for building safer AI systems by systematically uncovering vulnerabilities and enhancing model alignment.

Abstract: AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot are rapidly transforming software
development, but their safety remains deeply uncertain-especially in
high-stakes domains like cybersecurity. Current red-teaming tools often rely on
fixed benchmarks or unrealistic prompts, missing many real-world
vulnerabilities. We present ASTRA, an automated agent system designed to
systematically uncover safety flaws in AI-driven code generation and security
guidance systems. ASTRA works in three stages: (1) it builds structured
domain-specific knowledge graphs that model complex software tasks and known
weaknesses; (2) it performs online vulnerability exploration of each target
model by adaptively probing both its input space, i.e., the spatial
exploration, and its reasoning processes, i.e., the temporal exploration,
guided by the knowledge graphs; and (3) it generates high-quality
violation-inducing cases to improve model alignment. Unlike prior methods,
ASTRA focuses on realistic inputs-requests that developers might actually
ask-and uses both offline abstraction guided domain modeling and online domain
knowledge graph adaptation to surface corner-case vulnerabilities. Across two
major evaluation domains, ASTRA finds 11-66% more issues than existing
techniques and produces test cases that lead to 17% more effective alignment
training, showing its practical value for building safer AI systems.

*Borui Li,Li Yan,Junhao Han,Jianmin Liu,Lei Yu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SenseCrypt is a sensitivity-guided selective homomorphic encryption framework for cross-device FL, balancing security and overhead by clustering clients and optimizing parameter encryption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional selective HE methods in FL suffer from high overhead and client straggling in heterogeneous environments.

Method: SenseCrypt clusters clients by data similarity, scores straggler-free encryption ratios, and solves a multi-objective optimization problem for parameter selection.

Result: SenseCrypt reduces training time by 58.4%-88.7% vs. traditional HE, maintains accuracy, and resists inversion attacks.

Conclusion: SenseCrypt effectively balances security and efficiency in cross-device FL with heterogeneous clients.

Abstract: Homomorphic Encryption (HE) prevails in securing Federated Learning (FL), but
suffers from high overhead and adaptation cost. Selective HE methods, which
partially encrypt model parameters by a global mask, are expected to protect
privacy with reduced overhead and easy adaptation. However, in cross-device
scenarios with heterogeneous data and system capabilities, traditional
Selective HE methods deteriorate client straggling, and suffer from degraded HE
overhead reduction performance. Accordingly, we propose SenseCrypt, a
Sensitivity-guided selective Homomorphic EnCryption framework, to adaptively
balance security and HE overhead per cross-device FL client. Given the
observation that model parameter sensitivity is effective for measuring
clients' data distribution similarity, we first design a privacy-preserving
method to respectively cluster the clients with similar data distributions.
Then, we develop a scoring mechanism to deduce the straggler-free ratio of
model parameters that can be encrypted by each client per cluster. Finally, for
each client, we formulate and solve a multi-objective model parameter selection
optimization problem, which minimizes HE overhead while maximizing model
security without causing straggling. Experiments demonstrate that SenseCrypt
ensures security against the state-of-the-art inversion attacks, while
achieving normal model accuracy as on IID data, and reducing training time by
58.4%-88.7% as compared to traditional HE methods.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper evaluates selective encryption methods for protecting federated learning from gradient inversion attacks, proposing a distance-based framework to identify critical gradient elements for encryption. It finds gradient magnitude effective but notes no universal strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the privacy threats posed by gradient inversion attacks in federated learning while reducing computational overhead compared to traditional encryption methods.

Method: Systematic evaluation of selective encryption with different significance metrics, proposing a distance-based framework for selecting critical gradient elements.

Result: Gradient magnitude is effective against optimization-based attacks, but no single strategy works universally across all scenarios.

Conclusion: Selective encryption reduces overhead while maintaining resilience, but strategy choice depends on model architecture and privacy needs.

Abstract: Gradient inversion attacks pose significant privacy threats to distributed
training frameworks such as federated learning, enabling malicious parties to
reconstruct sensitive local training data from gradient communications between
clients and an aggregation server during the aggregation process. While
traditional encryption-based defenses, such as homomorphic encryption, offer
strong privacy guarantees without compromising model utility, they often incur
prohibitive computational overheads. To mitigate this, selective encryption has
emerged as a promising approach, encrypting only a subset of gradient data
based on the data's significance under a certain metric. However, there have
been few systematic studies on how to specify this metric in practice. This
paper systematically evaluates selective encryption methods with different
significance metrics against state-of-the-art attacks. Our findings demonstrate
the feasibility of selective encryption in reducing computational overhead
while maintaining resilience against attacks. We propose a distance-based
significance analysis framework that provides theoretical foundations for
selecting critical gradient elements for encryption. Through extensive
experiments on different model architectures (LeNet, CNN, BERT, GPT-2) and
attack types, we identify gradient magnitude as a generally effective metric
for protection against optimization-based gradient inversions. However, we also
observe that no single selective encryption strategy is universally optimal
across all attack scenarios, and we provide guidelines for choosing appropriate
strategies for different model architectures and privacy requirements.

Result: MD-LLM-1 predicts unseen conformational states, demonstrating learning of protein landscape exploration principles.

Conclusion: MD-LLM shows potential for protein dynamics but lacks explicit thermodynamics/kinetics modeling.

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) is a powerful approach for modelling molecular
systems, but it remains computationally intensive on spatial and time scales of
many macromolecular systems of biological interest. To explore the
opportunities offered by deep learning to address this problem, we introduce a
Molecular Dynamics Large Language Model (MD-LLM) framework to illustrate how
LLMs can be leveraged to learn protein dynamics and discover states not seen in
training. By applying MD-LLM-1, the first implementation of this approach,
obtained by fine-tuning Mistral 7B, to the T4 lysozyme and Mad2 protein
systems, we show that training on one conformational state enables the
prediction of other conformational states. These results indicate that MD-LLM-1
can learn the principles for the exploration of the conformational landscapes
of proteins, although it is not yet modeling explicitly their thermodynamics

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve facility location by incorporating predictions of optimal locations, addressing both maximum distance and minimum utility for fairness.

Method: Designs mechanisms with predictions, adjusting parameters for robustness-consistency trade-offs, and extends to two-facility problems with strategy-proof mechanisms.

Result: New mechanisms achieve better robustness and allow flexibility in trading robustness for consistency, with novel solutions for two-facility cases.

Conclusion: Incorporating predictions enhances facility location fairness and performance, with adaptable mechanisms for varying prediction accuracy.

Abstract: We study mechanisms for the facility location problem augmented with
predictions of the optimal facility location. We demonstrate that an
egalitarian viewpoint which considers both the maximum distance of any agent
from the facility and the minimum utility of any agent provides important new
insights compared to a viewpoint that just considers the maximum distance. As
in previous studies, we consider performance in terms of consistency (worst
case when predictions are accurate) and robustness (worst case irrespective of
the accuracy of predictions). By considering how mechanisms with predictions
can perform poorly, we design new mechanisms that are more robust. Indeed, by
adjusting parameters, we demonstrate how to trade robustness for consistency.
We go beyond the single facility problem by designing novel strategy proof
mechanisms for locating two facilities with bounded consistency and robustness
that use two predictions for where to locate the two facilities.

TL;DR: A new MAPF variant addresses agent delays due to malfunctions, proposing dynamic adaptation protocols to avoid full replanning, bounding makespan impact and ensuring scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MAPF struggles with agent malfunctions, requiring impractical full replanning. This work aims to provide efficient, resilient solutions without heavy computation.

Method: Introduces dynamic schedule adaptation with two protocols: one for local agent coordination and another offloading computation to network nodes.

Result: Proves bounded makespan increase (k turns for k malfunctions) and ensures robustness without enhanced agent processing.

Conclusion: The protocols offer scalable, practical solutions for resilient multiagent navigation amid failures.

Abstract: In Multiagent Path Finding (MAPF), the goal is to compute efficient,
collision-free paths for multiple agents navigating a network from their
sources to targets, minimizing the schedule's makespan-the total time until all
agents reach their destinations. We introduce a new variant that formally
models scenarios where some agents may experience delays due to malfunctions,
posing significant challenges for maintaining optimal schedules.
  Recomputing an entirely new schedule from scratch after each malfunction is
often computationally infeasible. To address this, we propose a framework for
dynamic schedule adaptation that does not rely on full replanning. Instead, we
develop protocols enabling agents to locally coordinate and adjust their paths
on the fly. We prove that following our primary communication protocol, the
increase in makespan after k malfunctions is bounded by k additional turns,
effectively limiting the impact of malfunctions on overall efficiency.
Moreover, recognizing that agents may have limited computational capabilities,
we also present a secondary protocol that shifts the necessary computations
onto the network's nodes, ensuring robustness without requiring enhanced agent
processing power. Our results demonstrate that these protocols provide a
practical, scalable approach to resilient multiagent navigation in the face of
agent failures.

Motivation: Addressing label and data scarcity in AI-based respiratory sound diagnostics, especially beyond COVID-19.

Method: Uses masked data modelling for self-supervised learning of cough sound features.

Result: Matches or exceeds state-of-the-art supervised audio representations in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: CoughViT enhances diagnostic performance in limited-data settings, advancing respiratory disease detection.

Abstract: Physicians routinely assess respiratory sounds during the diagnostic process,
providing insight into the condition of a patient's airways. In recent years,
AI-based diagnostic systems operating on respiratory sounds, have demonstrated
success in respiratory disease detection. These systems represent a crucial
advancement in early and accessible diagnosis which is essential for timely
treatment. However, label and data scarcity remain key challenges, especially
for conditions beyond COVID-19, limiting diagnostic performance and reliable
evaluation. In this paper, we propose CoughViT, a novel pre-training framework
for learning general-purpose cough sound representations, to enhance diagnostic
performance in tasks with limited data. To address label scarcity, we employ
masked data modelling to train a feature encoder in a self-supervised learning
manner. We evaluate our approach against other pre-training strategies on three
diagnostically important cough classification tasks. Experimental results show
that our representations match or exceed current state-of-the-art supervised

### [379] [Are Inherently Interpretable Models More Robust? A Study In Music Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03780)
*Katharina Hoedt,Arthur Flexer,Gerhard Widmer*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Interpretable deep learning models may be more robust to adversarial perturbations than black-box models, achieving robustness comparable to adversarially trained models with lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if inherently interpretable deep models are more robust to irrelevant perturbations compared to black-box models, addressing the vulnerability of deep learning models to adversarial inputs.

Method: Comparison of robustness between an interpretable and a black-box music emotion recognition (MER) model, including an adversarially trained model, when exposed to adversarial examples.

Result: Interpretable models showed higher robustness than black-box models and achieved similar robustness to adversarially trained models, but with lower computational cost.

Conclusion: Inherently interpretable deep models can offer improved robustness to adversarial perturbations, providing a computationally efficient alternative to adversarially trained models.

Abstract: One of the desired key properties of deep learning models is the ability to
generalise to unseen samples. When provided with new samples that are
(perceptually) similar to one or more training samples, deep learning models
are expected to produce correspondingly similar outputs. Models that succeed in
predicting similar outputs for similar inputs are often called robust. Deep
learning models, on the other hand, have been shown to be highly vulnerable to
minor (adversarial) perturbations of the input, which manage to drastically
change a model's output and simultaneously expose its reliance on spurious
correlations. In this work, we investigate whether inherently interpretable
deep models, i.e., deep models that were designed to focus more on meaningful
and interpretable features, are more robust to irrelevant perturbations in the
data, compared to their black-box counterparts. We test our hypothesis by
comparing the robustness of an interpretable and a black-box music emotion
recognition (MER) model when challenged with adversarial examples. Furthermore,
we include an adversarially trained model, which is optimised to be more
robust, in the comparison. Our results indicate that inherently more
interpretable models can indeed be more robust than their black-box
counterparts, and achieve similar levels of robustness as adversarially trained
models, at lower computational cost.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: NVSpeech introduces a scalable pipeline for recognizing and synthesizing paralinguistic vocalizations, including dataset creation, ASR modeling, and controllable TTS, with applications in Mandarin speech modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Paralinguistic vocalizations are crucial in communication but overlooked in ASR and TTS systems. NVSpeech aims to bridge this gap by integrating recognition and synthesis.

Method: The pipeline includes (1) a manually annotated dataset, (2) a paralinguistic-aware ASR model for joint transcription, and (3) zero-shot TTS models for controllable synthesis.

Result: NVSpeech provides the first large-scale, word-level annotated pipeline for Mandarin, enabling context-aware paralinguistic vocalizations in speech synthesis.

Conclusion: NVSpeech unifies recognition and generation of paralinguistic cues, offering a scalable and controllable solution for expressive speech modeling.

Abstract: Paralinguistic vocalizations-including non-verbal sounds like laughter and
breathing, as well as lexicalized interjections such as "uhm" and "oh"-are
integral to natural spoken communication. Despite their importance in conveying
affect, intent, and interactional cues, such cues remain largely overlooked in
conventional automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS)
systems. We present NVSpeech, an integrated and scalable pipeline that bridges
the recognition and synthesis of paralinguistic vocalizations, encompassing
dataset construction, ASR modeling, and controllable TTS. (1) We introduce a
manually annotated dataset of 48,430 human-spoken utterances with 18 word-level
paralinguistic categories. (2) We develop the paralinguistic-aware ASR model,
which treats paralinguistic cues as inline decodable tokens (e.g., "You're so
funny [Laughter]"), enabling joint lexical and non-verbal transcription. This
model is then used to automatically annotate a large corpus, the first
large-scale Chinese dataset of 174,179 utterances (573 hours) with word-level
alignment and paralingustic cues. (3) We finetune zero-shot TTS models on both
human- and auto-labeled data to enable explicit control over paralinguistic
vocalizations, allowing context-aware insertion at arbitrary token positions
for human-like speech synthesis. By unifying the recognition and generation of
paralinguistic vocalizations, NVSpeech offers the first open, large-scale,
word-level annotated pipeline for expressive speech modeling in Mandarin,
integrating recognition and synthesis in a scalable and controllable manner.

### [382] [Comparing Normalization Methods for Portfolio Optimization with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03910)
*Caio de Souza Barbosa Costa,Anna Helena Reali Costa*

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: Reinforcement learning in finance, particularly portfolio optimization, shows promise but faces inconsistencies with a popular policy gradient algorithm, possibly due to state normalization methods. This paper evaluates normalization impacts across markets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why a domain-specific policy gradient algorithm underperforms in non-cryptocurrency portfolios, focusing on state normalization's role.

Method: Evaluates two normalization methods across IBOVESPA, NYSE, and cryptocurrency markets, comparing them with standard pre-training normalization.

Result: State normalization can degrade agent performance in portfolio optimization.

Conclusion: The choice of normalization method critically affects reinforcement learning performance in financial applications, especially outside cryptocurrencies.

Abstract: Recently, reinforcement learning has achieved remarkable results in various
domains, including robotics, games, natural language processing, and finance.
In the financial domain, this approach has been applied to tasks such as
portfolio optimization, where an agent continuously adjusts the allocation of
assets within a financial portfolio to maximize profit. Numerous studies have
introduced new simulation environments, neural network architectures, and
training algorithms for this purpose. Among these, a domain-specific policy
gradient algorithm has gained significant attention in the research community
for being lightweight, fast, and for outperforming other approaches. However,
recent studies have shown that this algorithm can yield inconsistent results
and underperform, especially when the portfolio does not consist of
cryptocurrencies. One possible explanation for this issue is that the commonly
used state normalization method may cause the agent to lose critical
information about the true value of the assets being traded. This paper
explores this hypothesis by evaluating two of the most widely used
normalization methods across three different markets (IBOVESPA, NYSE, and
cryptocurrencies) and comparing them with the standard practice of normalizing
data before training. The results indicate that, in this specific domain, the
state normalization can indeed degrade the agent's performance.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reference model for autonomous AI in corporate leadership, addressing legal and ethical gaps through computational law, dedicated operational contexts, synthetic data training, game theory, and explainable AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of AI in corporate leadership roles outpaces legal and ethical guidelines, necessitating a structured approach to ensure legitimate and ethical decision-making.

Method: The study introduces a reference model incorporating computational law, dedicated operational contexts, synthetic data training, game theory, and explainable AI (XAI) for transparency.

Result: The model provides a framework for developing and implementing autonomous AI systems in corporate management, ensuring ethical and legal compliance.

Conclusion: The proposed model addresses critical gaps in AI governance, emphasizing transparency, fairness, and accountability to build trust and comply with legal standards.

Abstract: The study addresses the paradigm shift in corporate management, where AI is
moving from a decision support tool to an autonomous decision-maker, with some
AI systems already appointed to leadership roles in companies. A central
problem identified is that the development of AI technologies is far outpacing
the creation of adequate legal and ethical guidelines.
  The research proposes a "reference model" for the development and
implementation of autonomous AI systems in corporate management. This model is
based on a synthesis of several key components to ensure legitimate and ethical
decision-making. The model introduces the concept of "computational law" or
"algorithmic law". This involves creating a separate legal framework for AI
systems, with rules and regulations translated into a machine-readable,
algorithmic format to avoid the ambiguity of natural language. The paper
emphasises the need for a "dedicated operational context" for autonomous AI
systems, analogous to the "operational design domain" for autonomous vehicles.
This means creating a specific, clearly defined environment and set of rules
within which the AI can operate safely and effectively. The model advocates for
training AI systems on controlled, synthetically generated data to ensure
fairness and ethical considerations are embedded from the start. Game theory is
also proposed as a method for calculating the optimal strategy for the AI to
achieve its goals within these ethical and legal constraints. The provided
analysis highlights the importance of explainable AI (XAI) to ensure the
transparency and accountability of decisions made by autonomous systems. This
is crucial for building trust and for complying with the "right to
explanation".

embedded in regional legislation and AI governance structures. Special emphasis
is placed on the evolving landscape in the GCC, where countries are rapidly
advancing national AI strategies and education-sector innovation. To support
this development, the paper introduces a Compliance-Centered AI Governance
Framework tailored to the GCC context. This includes a tiered typology and
institutional checklist designed to help regulators, educators, and developers
align AI adoption with both international norms and local values. By
synthesizing global best practices with region-specific challenges, the paper
contributes practical guidance for building legally sound, ethically grounded,
and culturally sensitive AI systems in education. These insights are intended
to inform future regulatory harmonization and promote responsible AI

TL;DR: The paper diagnoses unsustainable growth in AI conferences, highlighting scientific, environmental, psychological, and logistical strains, and proposes a decentralized Community-Federated Conference (CFC) model for sustainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid expansion of AI conferences threatens scientific dissemination, equity, and community well-being, necessitating a structural solution.

Method: The study uses data-driven analysis to identify four key strains in the current conference model.

Result: Findings reveal unsustainable per-author publication rates, high carbon footprints, negative community sentiment, and logistical challenges.

Conclusion: The proposed CFC model decentralizes conference components to promote sustainability, inclusivity, and resilience in AI research.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) conferences are essential for advancing
research, sharing knowledge, and fostering academic community. However, their
rapid expansion has rendered the centralized conference model increasingly
unsustainable. This paper offers a data-driven diagnosis of a structural crisis
that threatens the foundational goals of scientific dissemination, equity, and
community well-being. We identify four key areas of strain: (1) scientifically,
with per-author publication rates more than doubling over the past decade to
over 4.5 papers annually; (2) environmentally, with the carbon footprint of a
single conference exceeding the daily emissions of its host city; (3)
psychologically, with 71% of online community discourse reflecting negative
sentiment and 35% referencing mental health concerns; and (4) logistically,
with attendance at top conferences such as NeurIPS 2024 beginning to outpace
venue capacity. These pressures point to a system that is misaligned with its
core mission. In response, we propose the Community-Federated Conference (CFC)
model, which separates peer review, presentation, and networking into globally
coordinated but locally organized components, offering a more sustainable,
inclusive, and resilient path forward for AI research.

TL;DR: The study quantifies periodic patterns in human mobility using sparse autoregression, revealing weekly periodicity and COVID-19's impact on mobility regularity in NYC and Chicago.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover temporal regularity in human mobility for urban dynamics and decision-making.

Method: Sparse identification of dominant auto-correlations in time series autoregression applied to metro and ridesharing data.

Result: Weekly periodicity was identified, with COVID-19 disrupting mobility and NYC recovering faster than Chicago.

Conclusion: Interpretable machine learning provides insights into human mobility, useful for urban system analysis.

Abstract: Uncovering the temporal regularity of human mobility is crucial for
discovering urban dynamics and has implications for various decision-making
processes and urban system applications. This study formulates the periodicity
quantification problem in complex and multidimensional human mobility data as a
sparse identification of dominant positive auto-correlations in time series
autoregression, allowing one to discover and quantify significant periodic
patterns such as weekly periodicity from a data-driven and interpretable
machine learning perspective. We apply our framework to real-world human
mobility data, including metro passenger flow in Hangzhou, China and
ridesharing trips in New York City (NYC) and Chicago, USA, revealing the
interpretable weekly periodicity across different spatial locations over past
several years. In particular, our analysis of ridesharing data from 2019 to
2024 demonstrates the disruptive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mobility
regularity and the subsequent recovery trends, highlighting differences in the
recovery pattern percentages and speeds between NYC and Chicago. We explore
that both NYC and Chicago experienced a remarkable reduction of weekly
periodicity in 2020, and the recovery of mobility regularity in NYC is faster
than Chicago. The interpretability of sparse autoregression provides insights
into the underlying temporal patterns of human mobility, offering a valuable
tool for understanding urban systems. Our findings highlight the potential of
interpretable machine learning to unlock crucial insights from real-world
mobility data.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using large-scale unlabeled topic datasets and graph self-supervised learning methods to improve rumor detection, addressing issues like limited labeled data and poor generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rumors spread rapidly on social media, causing societal and economic harm. Existing methods struggle with limited labeled data and poor generalization to new events.

Method: Utilized unlabeled topic datasets from Weibo and Twitter with claim propagation structures. Tested three graph self-supervised methods (InfoGraph, JOAO, GraphMAE) in two training strategies. Collected a decade-spanning rumor dataset for evaluation.

Result: Graph self-supervised methods outperformed specialized rumor detection methods, showing strong performance in few-shot scenarios and better generalization.

Conclusion: Leveraging unlabeled data and graph self-supervised learning enhances rumor detection, offering improved generalization and performance with limited labeled data.

Abstract: With the development of social media, rumors spread quickly, cause great harm
to society and economy. Thereby, many effective rumor detection methods have
been developed, among which the rumor propagation structure learning based
methods are particularly effective compared to other methods. However, the
existing methods still suffer from many issues including the difficulty to
obtain large-scale labeled rumor datasets, which leads to the low
generalization ability and the performance degeneration on new events since
rumors are time-critical and usually appear with hot topics or newly emergent
events. In order to solve the above problems, in this study, we used
large-scale unlabeled topic datasets crawled from the social media platform
Weibo and Twitter with claim propagation structure to improve the semantic
learning ability of a graph reprentation learing model on various topics. We
use three typical graph self-supervised methods, InfoGraph, JOAO and GraphMAE
in two commonly used training strategies, to verify the performance of general
graph semi-supervised methods in rumor detection tasks. In addition, for
alleviating the time and topic difference between unlabeled topic data and
rumor data, we also collected a rumor dataset covering a variety of topics over
a decade (10-year ago from 2022) from the Weibo rumor-refuting platform. Our
experiments show that these general graph self-supervised learning methods
outperform previous methods specifically designed for rumor detection tasks and
achieve good performance under few-shot conditions, demonstrating the better
generalization ability with the help of our massive unlabeled topic dataset.

TL;DR: EDQC is a novel quasi-clique discovery algorithm using energy diffusion, outperforming existing methods in efficiency and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quasi-clique discovery methods struggle with efficiency and consistency across diverse graphs.

Method: EDQC performs stochastic energy diffusion from source vertices to identify dense subgraphs without exhaustive search.

Result: EDQC discovers larger quasi-cliques with lower variance in solution quality on 30 real-world datasets.

Conclusion: EDQC is the first to integrate energy diffusion into quasi-clique discovery, offering superior performance.

Abstract: Discovering quasi-cliques -- subgraphs with edge density no less than a given
threshold -- is a fundamental task in graph mining, with broad applications in
social networks, bioinformatics, and e-commerce. Existing heuristics often rely
on greedy rules, similarity measures, or metaheuristic search, but struggle to
maintain both efficiency and solution consistency across diverse graphs. This
paper introduces EDQC, a novel quasi-clique discovery algorithm inspired by
energy diffusion. Instead of explicitly enumerating candidate subgraphs, EDQC
performs stochastic energy diffusion from source vertices, naturally
concentrating energy within structurally cohesive regions. The approach enables
efficient dense subgraph discovery without exhaustive search or
dataset-specific tuning. Experimental results on 30 real-world datasets
demonstrate that EDQC consistently discovers larger quasi-cliques than
state-of-the-art baselines on the majority of datasets, while also yielding
lower variance in solution quality. To the best of our knowledge, EDQC is the
first method to incorporate energy diffusion into quasi-clique discovery.

Method: Conducted a user study with 36 participants using GPT for project-level tasks, analyzing screen recordings and chat logs.

Result: Found 3 impactful HLI features, 5 productivity guidelines, and a taxonomy of 29 errors with mitigation plans.

Conclusion: Provides insights for improving HLIs in code generation, emphasizing project-level complexities and error mitigation.

Abstract: The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) is growing in the productive
completion of Software Engineering tasks. Yet, studies investigating the
productive prompting techniques often employed a limited problem space,
primarily focusing on well-known prompting patterns and mainly targeting
function-level SE practices. We identify significant gaps in real-world
workflows that involve complexities beyond class-level (e.g., multi-class
dependencies) and different features that can impact Human-LLM Interactions
(HLIs) processes in code generation. To address these issues, we designed an
experiment that comprehensively analyzed the HLI features regarding the code
generation productivity. Our study presents two project-level benchmark tasks,
extending beyond function-level evaluations. We conducted a user study with 36
participants from diverse backgrounds, asking them to solve the assigned tasks
by interacting with the GPT assistant using specific prompting patterns. We
also examined the participants' experience and their behavioral features during
interactions by analyzing screen recordings and GPT chat logs. Our statistical
and empirical investigation revealed (1) that three out of 15 HLI features
significantly impacted the productivity in code generation; (2) five primary
guidelines for enhancing productivity for HLI processes; and (3) a taxonomy of
29 runtime and logic errors that can occur during HLI processes, along with
suggested mitigation plans.

Motivation: Addressing challenges in entity resolution for large datasets, ensuring data integrity at an enterprise level.

Method: Introduces MERAI, a robust pipeline tested against Dedupe and Splink on datasets up to 15.7 million records.

Result: MERAI outperforms baseline systems with higher F1 scores, scaling beyond 2 million records where Dedupe fails.

Conclusion: MERAI provides a scalable, reliable solution for enterprise-level entity resolution, ensuring data consistency.

Abstract: Entity resolution (ER) remains a significant challenge in data management,
especially when dealing with large datasets. This paper introduces MERAI
(Massive Entity Resolution using AI), a robust and efficient pipeline designed
to address record deduplication and linkage issues in high-volume datasets at
an enterprise level. The pipeline's resilience and accuracy have been validated
through various large-scale record deduplication and linkage projects. To
evaluate MERAI's performance, we compared it with two well-known entity
resolution libraries, Dedupe and Splink. While Dedupe failed to scale beyond 2
million records due to memory constraints, MERAI successfully processed
datasets of up to 15.7 million records and produced accurate results across all
experiments. Experimental data demonstrates that MERAI outperforms both
baseline systems in terms of matching accuracy, with consistently higher F1
scores in both deduplication and record linkage tasks. MERAI offers a scalable

*Yuksel Aydin*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces the 'Think First, Verify Always' (TFVA) protocol to enhance human resilience against AI-driven cognitive threats, showing significant improvements in cognitive security through a brief training intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cybersecurity is device-centric, neglecting human cognition vulnerabilities to AI-enabled threats. The paper aims to reposition humans as the first line of defense.

Method: The TFVA protocol, based on five principles (AIJET), was tested in a randomized controlled trial (n=151) with a 3-minute intervention.

Result: Participants showed a +7.87% improvement in cognitive security tasks compared to controls, demonstrating the protocol's effectiveness.

Conclusion: Brief, principles-based training like TFVA can enhance human resilience against AI manipulation, and embedding it in GenAI platforms could improve trustworthy AI use.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence enables unprecedented attacks on human cognition, yet
cybersecurity remains predominantly device-centric. This paper introduces the
"Think First, Verify Always" (TFVA) protocol, which repositions humans as
'Firewall Zero', the first line of defense against AI-enabled threats. The
protocol is grounded in five operational principles: Awareness, Integrity,
Judgment, Ethical Responsibility, and Transparency (AIJET). A randomized
controlled trial (n=151) demonstrated that a minimal 3-minute intervention
produced statistically significant improvements in cognitive security task
performance, with participants showing an absolute +7.87% gains compared to
controls. These results suggest that brief, principles-based training can
rapidly enhance human resilience against AI-driven cognitive manipulation. We
recommend that GenAI platforms embed "Think First, Verify Always" as a standard
prompt, replacing passive warnings with actionable protocols to enhance
trustworthy and ethical AI use. By bridging the gap between technical
cybersecurity and human factors, the TFVA protocol establishes human-empowered
security as a vital component of trustworthy AI systems.

*Hamza El Alaoui,Atieh Taheri,Yi-Hao Peng,Jeffrey P. Bigham*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: StepWrite is a voice-based system using large language models to help users compose longer, structured texts hands-free and eyes-free, outperforming traditional dictation tools and voice assistants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current voice-based systems struggle with complex, context-rich text composition, especially in mobile or hands-occupied scenarios, lacking support for persistent context tracking and adaptive guidance.

Method: StepWrite breaks writing into subtasks, using context-aware audio prompts and offloading cognitive tasks to models. It dynamically adapts prompts based on user intent and context.

Result: Empirical evaluation with 25 participants showed StepWrite reduces cognitive load, improves usability, and enhances satisfaction compared to baseline methods. Technical evaluations confirmed its prompt generation, tone alignment, and fact-checking capabilities.

Conclusion: StepWrite demonstrates the potential of structured, context-aware voice interactions for enhancing hands-free and eyes-free communication in multitasking scenarios.

Abstract: People frequently use speech-to-text systems to compose short texts with
voice. However, current voice-based interfaces struggle to support composing
more detailed, contextually complex texts, especially in scenarios where users
are on the move and cannot visually track progress. Longer-form communication,
such as composing structured emails or thoughtful responses, requires
persistent context tracking, structured guidance, and adaptability to evolving
user intentions--capabilities that conventional dictation tools and voice
assistants do not support. We introduce StepWrite, a large language
model-driven voice-based interaction system that augments human writing ability
by enabling structured, hands-free and eyes-free composition of longer-form
texts while on the move. StepWrite decomposes the writing process into
manageable subtasks and sequentially guides users with contextually-aware
non-visual audio prompts. StepWrite reduces cognitive load by offloading the
context-tracking and adaptive planning tasks to the models. Unlike baseline
methods like standard dictation features (e.g., Microsoft Word) and
conversational voice assistants (e.g., ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode), StepWrite
dynamically adapts its prompts based on the evolving context and user intent,
and provides coherent guidance without compromising user autonomy. An empirical
evaluation with 25 participants engaging in mobile or stationary hands-occupied
activities demonstrated that StepWrite significantly reduces cognitive load,
improves usability and user satisfaction compared to baseline methods.
Technical evaluations further confirmed StepWrite's capability in dynamic
contextual prompt generation, accurate tone alignment, and effective fact
checking. This work highlights the potential of structured, context-aware voice
interactions in enhancing hands-free and eye-free communication in everyday
multitasking scenarios.

*Minsuk Chang,Yao Wang,Huichen Will Wang,Yuanhong Zhou,Andreas Bulling,Cindy Xiong Bearfield*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper shows how visual literacy levels affect attention patterns in visualization interpretation, proposes two models (Lit2Sal and Sal2Lit) to predict attention and literacy, and demonstrates their effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve visualization design by accounting for individual differences in visual literacy and attention patterns.

Method: Conducted a 235-participant study with three visualization tests (mini-VLAT, CALVI, SGL), analyzed attention patterns, and developed two computational models (Lit2Sal for saliency prediction, Sal2Lit for literacy prediction).

Result: Lit2Sal outperforms state-of-the-art saliency models; Sal2Lit predicts literacy with 86% accuracy using a single attention map in under a minute.

Conclusion: The approach enhances personalized visual data communication by integrating individual differences in saliency models and literacy assessments.

Abstract: Accounting for individual differences can improve the effectiveness of
visualization design. While the role of visual attention in visualization
interpretation is well recognized, existing work often overlooks how this
behavior varies based on visual literacy levels. Based on data from a
235-participant user study covering three visualization tests (mini-VLAT,
CALVI, and SGL), we show that distinct attention patterns in visual data
exploration can correlate with participants' literacy levels: While experts
(high-scorers) generally show a strong attentional focus, novices (low-scorers)
focus less and explore more. We then propose two computational models
leveraging these insights: Lit2Sal -- a novel visual saliency model that
predicts observer attention given their visualization literacy level, and
Sal2Lit -- a model to predict visual literacy from human visual attention data.
Our quantitative and qualitative evaluation demonstrates that Lit2Sal
outperforms state-of-the-art saliency models with literacy-aware
considerations. Sal2Lit predicts literacy with 86% accuracy using a single
attention map, providing a time-efficient supplement to literacy assessment
that only takes less than a minute. Taken together, our unique approach to
consider individual differences in salience models and visual attention in
literacy assessments paves the way for new directions in personalized visual
data communication to enhance understanding.

*Angela Locoro,Silvia Golia,Davide Falessi*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: DRIVE-T is a methodology for designing and evaluating assessment items for data visualization literacy, ensuring discriminability and representativeness of task-based items.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address underspecification of difficulty levels in measurement constructs for data visualization literacy, improving test design and reuse.

Method: DRIVE-T involves tagging task-based items, rating difficulty via independent raters, and analyzing scores using a Many-Facet Rasch Measurement model.

Result: The methodology identifies difficulty levels of measurement constructs, validated through a pilot study.

Conclusion: DRIVE-T provides an inductive, formative approach for measuring data visualization literacy, enhancing assessment expressivity.

Abstract: The underspecification of progressive levels of difficulty in measurement
constructs design and assessment tests for data visualization literacy may
hinder the expressivity of measurements in both test design and test reuse. To
mitigate this problem, this paper proposes DRIVE-T (Discriminating and
Representative Items for Validating Expressive Tests), a methodology designed
to drive the construction and evaluation of assessment items. Given a data
vizualization, DRIVE-T supports the identification of task-based items
discriminability and representativeness for measuring levels of data
visualization literacy. DRIVE-T consists of three steps: (1) tagging task-based
items associated with a set of data vizualizations; (2) rating them by
independent raters for their difficulty; (3) analysing raters' raw scores
through a Many-Facet Rasch Measurement model. In this way, we can observe the
emergence of difficulty levels of the measurement construct, derived from the
discriminability and representativeness of task-based items for each data
vizualization, ordered into Many-Facets construct levels. In this study, we
show and apply each step of the methodology to an item bank, which models the
difficulty levels of a measurement construct approximating a latent construct
for data visualization literacy. This measurement construct is drawn from
semiotics, i.e., based on the syntax, semantics and pragmatics knowledge that
each data visualization may require to be mastered by people. The DRIVE-T
methodology operationalises an inductive approach, observable in a post-design
phase of the items preparation, for formative-style and practice-based
measurement construct emergence. A pilot study with items selected through the
application of DRIVE-T is also presented to test our approach.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A survey of multimodal deep learning in ophthalmology, covering task-specific methods and foundation models, with insights into challenges and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the global health challenge of visual impairment by leveraging multimodal imaging for accurate diagnosis.

Method: Review of task-specific approaches (e.g., lesion detection, disease diagnosis) and foundation models (e.g., vision-language architectures) using diverse imaging modalities.

Result: Identifies key datasets, metrics, and innovations like self-supervised learning and attention-based fusion, while highlighting challenges like data variability and interpretability.

Conclusion: Future directions include ultra-widefield imaging and reinforcement learning for intelligent, interpretable AI systems in ophthalmology.

Abstract: Visual impairment represents a major global health challenge, with multimodal
imaging providing complementary information that is essential for accurate
ophthalmic diagnosis. This comprehensive survey systematically reviews the
latest advances in multimodal deep learning methods in ophthalmology up to the
year 2025. The review focuses on two main categories: task-specific multimodal
approaches and large-scale multimodal foundation models. Task-specific
approaches are designed for particular clinical applications such as lesion
detection, disease diagnosis, and image synthesis. These methods utilize a
variety of imaging modalities including color fundus photography, optical
coherence tomography, and angiography. On the other hand, foundation models
combine sophisticated vision-language architectures and large language models
pretrained on diverse ophthalmic datasets. These models enable robust
cross-modal understanding, automated clinical report generation, and decision
support. The survey critically examines important datasets, evaluation metrics,
and methodological innovations including self-supervised learning,
attention-based fusion, and contrastive alignment. It also discusses ongoing
challenges such as variability in data, limited annotations, lack of
interpretability, and issues with generalizability across different patient
populations. Finally, the survey outlines promising future directions that
emphasize the use of ultra-widefield imaging and reinforcement learning-based
reasoning frameworks to create intelligent, interpretable, and clinically
applicable AI systems for ophthalmology.

### [401] [Improve Retinal Artery/Vein Classification via Channel Couplin](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03738)
*Shuang Zeng,Chee Hong Lee,Kaiwen Li,Boxu Xie,Ourui Fu,Hangzhou He,Lei Zhu,Yanye Lu,Fangxiao Cheng*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel loss function and regularization term for automated retinal vessel segmentation and A/V classification, addressing the limitations of existing methods by enforcing consistency and improving feature discrimination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual segmentation and classification of retinal vessels are inefficient and inconsistent. Existing automated methods treat artery, vein, and vessel segmentation as separate tasks, ignoring their intrinsic relationships.

Method: The authors introduce a Channel-Coupled Vessel Consistency Loss to ensure coherence between vessel, artery, and vein predictions, and an intra-image pixel-level contrastive loss for finer feature discrimination.

Result: State-of-the-art results are achieved on three public datasets (RITE, LES-AV, HRF).

Conclusion: The proposed method improves retinal A/V classification by leveraging anatomical relationships and enhancing feature representation, offering a more efficient and accurate solution.

Abstract: Retinal vessel segmentation plays a vital role in analyzing fundus images for
the diagnosis of systemic and ocular diseases. Building on this, classifying
segmented vessels into arteries and veins (A/V) further enables the extraction
of clinically relevant features such as vessel width, diameter and tortuosity,
which are essential for detecting conditions like diabetic and hypertensive
retinopathy. However, manual segmentation and classification are
time-consuming, costly and inconsistent. With the advancement of Convolutional
Neural Networks, several automated methods have been proposed to address this
challenge, but there are still some issues. For example, the existing methods
all treat artery, vein and overall vessel segmentation as three separate binary
tasks, neglecting the intrinsic coupling relationships between these anatomical
structures. Considering artery and vein structures are subsets of the overall
retinal vessel map and should naturally exhibit prediction consistency with it,
we design a novel loss named Channel-Coupled Vessel Consistency Loss to enforce
the coherence and consistency between vessel, artery and vein predictions,
avoiding biasing the network toward three simple binary segmentation tasks.
Moreover, we also introduce a regularization term named intra-image pixel-level
contrastive loss to extract more discriminative feature-level fine-grained
representations for accurate retinal A/V classification. SOTA results have been
achieved across three public A/V classification datasets including RITE, LES-AV
and HRF. Our code will be available upon acceptance.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: An automated framework using a modified VGG-19 model for accurate and interpretable bone fracture detection in X-ray images, achieving high accuracy and fast diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early and accurate fracture detection is crucial for timely treatment, but current methods are time-consuming, error-prone, and lack interpretability for clinical use.

Method: The framework uses a modified VGG-19 model with preprocessing techniques (CLAHE, Otsu's thresholding, Canny edge detection) and Grad-CAM for interpretability, deployed in a real-time web application.

Result: Achieves 99.78% classification accuracy and an AUC score of 1.00, providing fast and reliable diagnostic feedback.

Conclusion: The framework offers a reliable, fast, and interpretable solution for bone fracture detection, improving patient care and clinical validation.

Abstract: Early and accurate detection of the bone fracture is paramount to initiating
treatment as early as possible and avoiding any delay in patient treatment and
outcomes. Interpretation of X-ray image is a time consuming and error prone
task, especially when resources for such interpretation are limited by lack of
radiology expertise. Additionally, deep learning approaches used currently,
typically suffer from misclassifications and lack interpretable explanations to
clinical use. In order to overcome these challenges, we propose an automated
framework of bone fracture detection using a VGG-19 model modified to our
needs. It incorporates sophisticated preprocessing techniques that include
Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), Otsu's thresholding,
and Canny edge detection, among others, to enhance image clarity as well as to
facilitate the feature extraction. Therefore, we use Grad-CAM, an Explainable
AI method that can generate visual heatmaps of the model's decision making
process, as a type of model interpretability, for clinicians to understand the
model's decision making process. It encourages trust and helps in further
clinical validation. It is deployed in a real time web application, where
healthcare professionals can upload X-ray images and get the diagnostic
feedback within 0.5 seconds. The performance of our modified VGG-19 model
attains 99.78\% classification accuracy and AUC score of 1.00, making it
exceptionally good. The framework provides a reliable, fast, and interpretable
solution for bone fracture detection that reasons more efficiently for
diagnoses and better patient care.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes enhancing vision semantic density in vision-language pre-training (VLP) for medical diagnostics by using disease-level contrastive learning and anatomical normality modeling, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the semantic density gap between low-SNR medical images and high-SNR reports to reduce visual alignment bias and improve diagnostic accuracy.

Method: Uses disease-level vision contrastive learning and anatomical normality modeling with VQ-VAE to enhance visual semantics and amplify abnormal signals.

Result: Achieves an average AUC of 84.9% across 54 diseases in 15 organs, outperforming existing methods, and demonstrates superior transfer learning capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively improves alignment between medical images and reports, enhancing diagnostic performance and generalizability.

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training (VLP) has great potential for developing
multifunctional and general medical diagnostic capabilities. However, aligning
medical images with a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to reports with a high
SNR presents a semantic density gap, leading to visual alignment bias. In this
paper, we propose boosting vision semantic density to improve alignment
effectiveness. On one hand, we enhance visual semantics through disease-level
vision contrastive learning, which strengthens the model's ability to
differentiate between normal and abnormal samples for each anatomical
structure. On the other hand, we introduce an anatomical normality modeling
method to model the distribution of normal samples for each anatomy, leveraging
VQ-VAE for reconstructing normal vision embeddings in the latent space. This
process amplifies abnormal signals by leveraging distribution shifts in
abnormal samples, enhancing the model's perception and discrimination of
abnormal attributes. The enhanced visual representation effectively captures
the diagnostic-relevant semantics, facilitating more efficient and accurate
alignment with the diagnostic report. We conduct extensive experiments on two
chest CT datasets, CT-RATE and Rad-ChestCT, and an abdominal CT dataset,
MedVL-CT69K, and comprehensively evaluate the diagnosis performance across
multiple tasks in the chest and abdominal CT scenarios, achieving
state-of-the-art zero-shot performance. Notably, our method achieved an average
AUC of 84.9% across 54 diseases in 15 organs, significantly surpassing existing
methods. Additionally, we demonstrate the superior transfer learning
capabilities of our pre-trained model. Code is available at

*Sarah Grube,SÃ¶ren GrÃ¼nhagen,Sarah Latus,Michael Meyling,Alexander Schlaefer*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Deep learning can reliably predict shear wave velocities in ultrasound elastography using raw data, reducing reliance on pre-processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the necessity of ultrasound pre-processing for deep learning-based shear wave elastography and improve standardization.

Method: A 3D CNN was trained to predict shear wave velocities from varying pre-processing levels of ultrasound images, compared to a conventional time-of-flight method.

Result: Deep learning differentiated elasticity groups effectively, even with raw data, though pre-processing slightly improved metrics.

Conclusion: Deep learning reduces bias from pre-processing, enabling faster, reliable clinical elasticity assessments.

Abstract: Estimating the elasticity of soft tissue can provide useful information for
various diagnostic applications. Ultrasound shear wave elastography offers a
non-invasive approach. However, its generalizability and standardization across
different systems and processing pipelines remain limited. Considering the
influence of image processing on ultrasound based diagnostics, recent
literature has discussed the impact of different image processing steps on
reliable and reproducible elasticity analysis. In this work, we investigate the
need of ultrasound pre-processing steps for deep learning-based ultrasound
shear wave elastography. We evaluate the performance of a 3D convolutional
neural network in predicting shear wave velocities from spatio-temporal
ultrasound images, studying different degrees of pre-processing on the input
images, ranging from fully beamformed and filtered ultrasound images to raw
radiofrequency data. We compare the predictions from our deep learning approach
to a conventional time-of-flight method across four gelatin phantoms with
different elasticity levels. Our results demonstrate statistically significant
differences in the predicted shear wave velocity among all elasticity groups,
regardless of the degree of pre-processing. Although pre-processing slightly
improves performance metrics, our results show that the deep learning approach
can reliably differentiate between elasticity groups using raw, unprocessed
radiofrequency data. These results show that deep learning-based approaches
could reduce the need for and the bias of traditional ultrasound pre-processing
steps in ultrasound shear wave elastography, enabling faster and more reliable
clinical elasticity assessments.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MÂ³HL, a novel method combining dynamic masking (MÂ³) and hierarchical feature consistency (HL) to improve semi-supervised medical image segmentation, outperforming existing methods on benchmarks like ACDC and LA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CutMix-based data augmentation methods are rigid and lack feature-level consistency, limiting their effectiveness in semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

Method: Proposes MÂ³HL with two components: MÂ³ (dynamic masking for flexible augmentation) and HL (hierarchical feature consistency regularization).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ACDC and LA datasets.

Conclusion: MÂ³HL effectively addresses limitations of CutMix by integrating dynamic masking and feature consistency, enhancing segmentation performance.

Abstract: Data augmentation methods inspired by CutMix have demonstrated significant
potential in recent semi-supervised medical image segmentation tasks. However,
these approaches often apply CutMix operations in a rigid and inflexible
manner, while paying insufficient attention to feature-level consistency
constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Mutual Mask Mix
with High-Low level feature consistency (M$^3$HL) to address the aforementioned
challenges, which consists of two key components: 1) M$^3$: An enhanced data
augmentation operation inspired by the masking strategy from Masked Image
Modeling (MIM), which advances conventional CutMix through dynamically
adjustable masks to generate spatially complementary image pairs for
collaborative training, thereby enabling effective information fusion between
labeled and unlabeled images. 2) HL: A hierarchical consistency regularization
framework that enforces high-level and low-level feature consistency between
unlabeled and mixed images, enabling the model to better capture discriminative
feature representations.Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on
widely adopted medical image segmentation benchmarks including the ACDC and LA
datasets. Source code is available at https://github.com/PHPJava666/M3HL

*Emanuele Nardone,Tiziana D'Alessandro,Francesco Fontanella,Claudio De Stefano*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Deep learning models (LSTM, GRU, RNN) underperform traditional methods in Alzheimer's detection via handwriting analysis due to data representation mismatch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-invasive Alzheimer's detection is needed as current methods are costly and invasive. Handwriting analysis offers a potential alternative.

Method: Evaluated three recurrent neural architectures (LSTM, GRU, RNN) and traditional machine learning models on 34 handwriting tasks from healthy and Alzheimer's patients.

Result: Recurrent models showed poor specificity and high variance; traditional ensemble methods outperformed them with higher accuracy.

Conclusion: Recurrent architectures fail for discrete stroke features; future research should address data representation and model compatibility.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease detection requires expensive neuroimaging or invasive
procedures, limiting accessibility. This study explores whether deep learning
can enable non-invasive Alzheimer's disease detection through handwriting
analysis. Using a dataset of 34 distinct handwriting tasks collected from
healthy controls and Alzheimer's disease patients, we evaluate and compare
three recurrent neural architectures (LSTM, GRU, RNN) against traditional
machine learning models. A crucial distinction of our approach is that the
recurrent models process pre-extracted features from discrete strokes, not raw
temporal signals. This violates the assumption of a continuous temporal flow
that recurrent networks are designed to capture. Results reveal that they
exhibit poor specificity and high variance. Traditional ensemble methods
significantly outperform all deep architectures, achieving higher accuracy with
balanced metrics. This demonstrates that recurrent architectures, designed for
continuous temporal sequences, fail when applied to feature vectors extracted
from ambiguously segmented strokes. Despite their complexity, deep learning
models cannot overcome the fundamental disconnect between their architectural
assumptions and the discrete, feature-based nature of stroke-level handwriting
data. Although performance is limited, the study highlights several critical
issues in data representation and model compatibility, pointing to valuable
directions for future research.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper explores how image super-resolution techniques improve white blood cell classification accuracy in low-resolution microscopic images by integrating enhanced images into deep learning training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-resolution microscopic images hinder accurate white blood cell classification, crucial for medical diagnostics. Image enhancement techniques like super-resolution are proposed to address this.

Method: The study uses large image dimension upscaling and integrates enhanced images into deep learning model training to capture subtler morphological changes.

Result: Extensive testing with a well-known model evaluates the impact of image resolution on classification performance, aiming to improve accuracy.

Conclusion: The research aims to develop more efficient image identification algorithms by understanding trade-offs between standard and enhanced images.

Abstract: Accurately classifying white blood cells from microscopic images is essential
to identify several illnesses and conditions in medical diagnostics. Many deep
learning technologies are being employed to quickly and automatically classify
images. However, most of the time, the resolution of these microscopic pictures
is quite low, which might make it difficult to classify them correctly. Some
picture improvement techniques, such as image super-resolution, are being
utilized to improve the resolution of the photos to get around this issue. The
suggested study uses large image dimension upscaling to investigate how
picture-enhancing approaches affect classification performance. The study
specifically looks at how deep learning models may be able to understand more
complex visual information by capturing subtler morphological changes when
image resolution is increased using cutting-edge techniques. The model may
learn from standard and augmented data since the improved images are
incorporated into the training process. This dual method seeks to comprehend
the impact of image resolution on model performance and enhance classification
accuracy. A well-known model for picture categorization is used to conduct
extensive testing and thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of this approach.
This research intends to create more efficient image identification algorithms
customized to a particular dataset of white blood cells by understanding the
trade-offs between ordinary and enhanced images.

use when training and validating artificial intelligence (AI) tools is
described. The report contains not only information about the collection of the
images and clinical data, but the ethics and information governance processes
to consider ensuring the data is collected safely, and the infrastructure and
agreements required to allow for the sharing of data with other groups.
  A key characteristic of the main collection framework described here is that
it can enable automated and ongoing collection of datasets to ensure that the
data is up-to-date and representative of current practice. This is important in
the context of training and validating AI tools as it is vital that datasets
have a mix of older cases with long term follow-up such that the clinical
outcome is as accurate as possible, and current data. Validations run on old
data will provide findings and conclusions relative to the status of the
imaging units when that data was generated. It is important that a validation
dataset can assess the AI tools with data that it would see if deployed and
active now.
  Other types of collection frameworks, which do not follow a fully automated
approach, are also described. Whilst the fully automated method is recommended
for large scale, long-term image collection, there may be reasons to start data
collection using semi-automated methods and indications of how to do that are
provided.

*Johannes Tischer,Patric Kienast,Marlene StÃ¼mpflen,Gregor Kasprian,Georg Langs,Roxane Licandro*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A deep-learning framework for generating continuous, age-specific fetal brain atlases improves real-time segmentation and registration accuracy, aiding developmental assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI assessment of fetal brain development is challenging due to variability in maturation, imaging protocols, and gestational age estimates. Standardized atlases can help.

Method: Combines a direct registration model with a conditional discriminator, trained on 219 neurotypical fetal MRIs (21-37 weeks gestation).

Result: Achieves high registration accuracy, sharp anatomical detail, and robust segmentation (DSC 86.3%). Volumetric analysis reveals neurotypical growth trajectories.

Conclusion: The framework supports individualized developmental assessment with real-time performance, benefiting research and clinical applications.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the fetal brain has become a key tool for
studying brain development in vivo. Yet, its assessment remains challenging due
to variability in brain maturation, imaging protocols, and uncertain estimates
of Gestational Age (GA). To overcome these, brain atlases provide a
standardized reference framework that facilitates objective evaluation and
comparison across subjects by aligning the atlas and subjects in a common
coordinate system. In this work, we introduce a novel deep-learning framework
for generating continuous, age-specific fetal brain atlases for real-time fetal
brain tissue segmentation. The framework combines a direct registration model
with a conditional discriminator. Trained on a curated dataset of 219
neurotypical fetal MRIs spanning from 21 to 37 weeks of gestation. The method
achieves high registration accuracy, captures dynamic anatomical changes with
sharp structural detail, and robust segmentation performance with an average
Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 86.3% across six brain tissues.
Furthermore, volumetric analysis of the generated atlases reveals detailed
neurotypical growth trajectories, providing valuable insights into the
maturation of the fetal brain. This approach enables individualized
developmental assessment with minimal pre-processing and real-time performance,
supporting both research and clinical applications. The model code is available

*Franz Thaler,Darko Stern,Gernot Plank,Martin Urschler*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LA-CaRe-CNN, a 2-stage CNN cascade for segmenting left atrium and scar tissue from LGE MR scans, achieving high accuracy for personalized AF treatment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation of left atrium and scar tissue from LGE MR scans is crucial for creating patient-specific cardiac digital twin models for personalized ablation therapy in AF treatment.

Method: LA-CaRe-CNN is a 2-stage 3D CNN cascade trained end-to-end, using strong augmentation to handle domain shifts. Stage 1 segments the left atrium, refined in Stage 2 for scar tissue.

Result: Achieved 89.21% DSC and 1.6969 mm ASSD for left atrium, and 64.59% DSC and 91.80% G-DSC for scar tissue.

Conclusion: LA-CaRe-CNN's accurate segmentation supports patient-specific digital twin models and personalized AF ablation therapy.

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) represents the most prevalent type of cardiac
arrhythmia for which treatment may require patients to undergo ablation
therapy. In this surgery cardiac tissues are locally scarred on purpose to
prevent electrical signals from causing arrhythmia. Patient-specific cardiac
digital twin models show great potential for personalized ablation therapy,
however, they demand accurate semantic segmentation of healthy and scarred
tissue typically obtained from late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) magnetic
resonance (MR) scans. In this work we propose the Left Atrial Cascading
Refinement CNN (LA-CaRe-CNN), which aims to accurately segment the left atrium
as well as left atrial scar tissue from LGE MR scans. LA-CaRe-CNN is a 2-stage
CNN cascade that is trained end-to-end in 3D, where Stage 1 generates a
prediction for the left atrium, which is then refined in Stage 2 in conjunction
with the original image information to obtain a prediction for the left atrial
scar tissue. To account for domain shift towards domains unknown during
training, we employ strong intensity and spatial augmentation to increase the
diversity of the training dataset. Our proposed method based on a 5-fold
ensemble achieves great segmentation results, namely, 89.21% DSC and 1.6969 mm
ASSD for the left atrium, as well as 64.59% DSC and 91.80% G-DSC for the more
challenging left atrial scar tissue. Thus, segmentations obtained through
LA-CaRe-CNN show great potential for the generation of patient-specific cardiac
digital twin models and downstream tasks like personalized targeted ablation
therapy to treat AF.

*Trung-tin Dinh,HervÃ© Carfantan,Antoine Monmayrant,Simon Lacroix*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: An unsupervised classification method for DD-CASSI hyperspectral data is proposed, addressing limitations of ground truths and demonstrating improved spectral coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of evaluating unsupervised classification methods due to unclear class definitions and high intra-class variability in ground truths.

Method: Uses a model of intra-class spectral variability to identify classes and estimate reference spectra from compressed data.

Result: Demonstrates the ability to detect spectrally coherent regions in the Pavia University scene, despite data compression.

Conclusion: Highlights the need to rethink evaluation methods for unsupervised classification, emphasizing spectral coherence.

Abstract: We propose an unsupervised classification method using a limited number of
coded acquisitions from a DD-CASSI hyperspectral imager. Based on a simple
model of intra-class spectral variability, this approach allow to identify
classes and estimate reference spectra, despite data compression by a factor of
ten. Here, we highlight the limitations of the ground truths commonly used to
evaluate this type of method: lack of a clear definition of the notion of
class, high intra-class variability, and even classification errors. Using the
Pavia University scene, we show that with simple assumptions, it is possible to
detect regions that are spectrally more coherent, highlighting the need to
rethink the evaluation of classification methods, particularly in unsupervised
scenarios.

*Akwasi Asare,Mary Sagoe,Justice Williams Asare*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: FUTransUNet, a hybrid of U-Net and Vision Transformers, improves diabetic foot ulcer segmentation by combining global attention with local feature extraction, achieving high accuracy and clinical interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated DFU segmentation is crucial for diagnosis and monitoring but is challenging due to ulcer heterogeneity and complex backgrounds. Traditional CNNs like U-Net lack long-range spatial dependency modeling.

Method: Proposed FUTransUNet integrates Vision Transformers' global attention into U-Net, leveraging skip connections and decoding for fine-grained resolution. Trained on the FUSeg dataset.

Result: Achieved Dice Coefficient of 0.8751 and IoU of 0.7780 on validation, with Grad-CAM visualizations for transparency.

Conclusion: FUTransUNet offers a robust, accurate, and clinically interpretable solution for DFU segmentation, enhancing wound assessment and patient care.

Abstract: Automated segmentation of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) plays a critical role
in clinical diagnosis, therapeutic planning, and longitudinal wound monitoring.
However, this task remains challenging due to the heterogeneous appearance,
irregular morphology, and complex backgrounds associated with ulcer regions in
clinical photographs. Traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as
U-Net, provide strong localization capabilities but struggle to model
long-range spatial dependencies due to their inherently limited receptive
fields. To address this, we propose FUTransUNet, a hybrid architecture that
integrates the global attention mechanism of Vision Transformers (ViTs) into
the U-Net framework. This combination allows the model to extract global
contextual features while maintaining fine-grained spatial resolution through
skip connections and an effective decoding pathway. We trained and validated
FUTransUNet on the public Foot Ulcer Segmentation Challenge (FUSeg) dataset.
FUTransUNet achieved a training Dice Coefficient of 0.8679, an IoU of 0.7672,
and a training loss of 0.0053. On the validation set, the model achieved a Dice
Coefficient of 0.8751, an IoU of 0.7780, and a validation loss of 0.009045. To
ensure clinical transparency, we employed Grad-CAM visualizations, which
highlighted model focus areas during prediction. These quantitative outcomes
clearly demonstrate that our hybrid approach successfully integrates global and
local feature extraction paradigms, thereby offering a highly robust, accurate,
explainable, and interpretable solution and clinically translatable solution
for automated foot ulcer analysis. The approach offers a reliable,
high-fidelity solution for DFU segmentation, with implications for improving
real-world wound assessment and patient care.

### [413] [A Comprehensive Framework for Uncertainty Quantification of Voxel-wise Supervised Models in IVIM MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04588)
*Nicola Casali,Alessandro Brusaferri,Giuseppe Baselli,Stefano Fumagalli,Edoardo Micotti,Gianluigi Forloni,Riaz Hussein,Giovanna Rizzo,Alfonso Mastropietro*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A probabilistic deep learning framework using Deep Ensembles of Mixture Density Networks is proposed for IVIM parameter estimation, offering uncertainty quantification and improved reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate IVIM parameter estimation is challenging due to noise sensitivity and ill-posed inverse problems, necessitating robust uncertainty-aware methods.

Method: The framework combines Deep Ensembles and Mixture Density Networks to estimate predictive uncertainty, decomposing it into aleatoric and epistemic components. Benchmarked against non-probabilistic and Bayesian methods.

Result: MDNs provided calibrated and sharper predictions for D and f parameters, with smoother D* estimates. Elevated epistemic uncertainty in vivo indicated data mismatch.

Conclusion: The framework enables reliable IVIM fitting with uncertainty quantification, adaptable for other physical models, highlighting the importance of epistemic uncertainty.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) parameters from
diffusion-weighted MRI remains challenging due to the ill-posed nature of the
inverse problem and high sensitivity to noise, particularly in the perfusion
compartment. In this work, we propose a probabilistic deep learning framework
based on Deep Ensembles (DE) of Mixture Density Networks (MDNs), enabling
estimation of total predictive uncertainty and decomposition into aleatoric
(AU) and epistemic (EU) components. The method was benchmarked against non
probabilistic neural networks, a Bayesian fitting approach and a probabilistic
network with single Gaussian parametrization. Supervised training was performed
on synthetic data, and evaluation was conducted on both simulated and two in
vivo datasets. The reliability of the quantified uncertainties was assessed
using calibration curves, output distribution sharpness, and the Continuous
Ranked Probability Score (CRPS). MDNs produced more calibrated and sharper
predictive distributions for the D and f parameters, although slight
overconfidence was observed in D*. The Robust Coefficient of Variation (RCV)
indicated smoother in vivo estimates for D* with MDNs compared to Gaussian
model. Despite the training data covering the expected physiological range,
elevated EU in vivo suggests a mismatch with real acquisition conditions,
highlighting the importance of incorporating EU, which was allowed by DE.
Overall, we present a comprehensive framework for IVIM fitting with uncertainty
quantification, which enables the identification and interpretation of
unreliable estimates. The proposed approach can also be adopted for fitting
other physical models through appropriate architectural and simulation
adjustments.

TL;DR: The study validates the PI-CAI-2B AI model for detecting high-grade prostate cancer on MRI, using a large, diverse dataset for training and external testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve prostate cancer detection by developing and validating an efficient AI system (PI-CAI-2B) against standard clinical assessments.

Method: Retrospective cohort of 22,481 MRI exams from 22 countries, split into training (20,471 cases) and external testing (2,010 cases). Primary endpoint: agreement with expert diagnoses.

Result: Evaluated diagnostic interchangeability of AI with standard care at PI-RADS cut-offs, with secondary measures like AUROC to assess biases.

Conclusion: The PI-CAI-2B model shows promise for clinical use in detecting high-grade prostate cancer, pending further validation.

Abstract: In this intercontinental, confirmatory study, we include a retrospective
cohort of 22,481 MRI examinations (21,288 patients; 46 cities in 22 countries)
to train and externally validate the PI-CAI-2B model, i.e., an efficient,
next-generation iteration of the state-of-the-art AI system that was developed
for detecting Gleason grade group $\geq$2 prostate cancer on MRI during the
PI-CAI study. Of these examinations, 20,471 cases (19,278 patients; 26 cities
in 14 countries) from two EU Horizon projects (ProCAncer-I, COMFORT) and 12
independent centers based in Europe, North America, Asia and Africa, are used
for training and internal testing. Additionally, 2010 cases (2010 patients; 20
external cities in 12 countries) from population-based screening (STHLM3-MRI,
IP1-PROSTAGRAM trials) and primary diagnostic settings (PRIME trial) based in
Europe, North and South Americas, Asia and Australia, are used for external
testing. Primary endpoint is the proportion of AI-based assessments in
agreement with the standard of care diagnoses (i.e., clinical assessments made
by expert uropathologists on histopathology, if available, or at least two
expert urogenital radiologists in consensus; with access to patient history and
peer consultation) in the detection of Gleason grade group $\geq$2 prostate
cancer within the external testing cohorts. Our statistical analysis plan is
prespecified with a hypothesis of diagnostic interchangeability to the standard
of care at the PI-RADS $\geq$3 (primary diagnosis) or $\geq$4 (screening)
cut-off, considering an absolute margin of 0.05 and reader estimates derived
from the PI-CAI observer study (62 radiologists reading 400 cases). Secondary
measures comprise the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(AUROC) of the AI system stratified by imaging quality, patient age and patient
ethnicity to identify underlying biases (if any).

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: UNISELF is a deep learning method for MS lesion segmentation that optimizes in-domain accuracy and out-of-domain generalization using test-time self-ensembled lesion fusion and TTIN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DL methods for MS lesion segmentation struggle with balancing in-domain accuracy and out-of-domain generalization when trained on limited single-source data.

Method: UNISELF uses test-time self-ensembled lesion fusion and TTIN to handle domain shifts and missing contrasts.

Result: UNISELF ranks among the best on ISBI 2015 test data and outperforms benchmarks on diverse out-of-domain datasets (MICCAI 2016, UMCL, private multisite).

Conclusion: UNISELF effectively addresses domain shifts and missing contrasts, achieving high accuracy and generalization in MS lesion segmentation.

Abstract: Automated segmentation of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions using multicontrast
magnetic resonance (MR) images improves efficiency and reproducibility compared
to manual delineation, with deep learning (DL) methods achieving
state-of-the-art performance. However, these DL-based methods have yet to
simultaneously optimize in-domain accuracy and out-of-domain generalization
when trained on a single source with limited data, or their performance has
been unsatisfactory. To fill this gap, we propose a method called UNISELF,
which achieves high accuracy within a single training domain while
demonstrating strong generalizability across multiple out-of-domain test
datasets. UNISELF employs a novel test-time self-ensembled lesion fusion to
improve segmentation accuracy, and leverages test-time instance normalization
(TTIN) of latent features to address domain shifts and missing input contrasts.
Trained on the ISBI 2015 longitudinal MS segmentation challenge training
dataset, UNISELF ranks among the best-performing methods on the challenge test
dataset. Additionally, UNISELF outperforms all benchmark methods trained on the
same ISBI training data across diverse out-of-domain test datasets with domain
shifts and missing contrasts, including the public MICCAI 2016 and UMCL
datasets, as well as a private multisite dataset. These test datasets exhibit
domain shifts and/or missing contrasts caused by variations in acquisition
protocols, scanner types, and imaging artifacts arising from imperfect
acquisition. Our code is available at https://github.com/uponacceptance.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: PET2Rep is introduced as the first benchmark for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) in generating radiology reports for PET images, addressing gaps in existing datasets and clinical needs. Current VLMs perform poorly on this task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual creation of radiology reports is labor-intensive, and existing VLMs focus on structural imaging, neglecting PET's metabolic insights. PET2Rep fills this gap.

Method: PET2Rep provides a large-scale dataset of PET image-report pairs, evaluating 30 VLMs using clinical and natural language metrics.

Result: Current VLMs underperform in PET report generation, failing to meet practical clinical requirements.

Conclusion: Key insufficiencies in VLMs for PET imaging must be addressed to advance medical applications.

Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) is a cornerstone of modern oncologic and
neurologic imaging, distinguished by its unique ability to illuminate dynamic
metabolic processes that transcend the anatomical focus of traditional imaging
technologies. Radiology reports are essential for clinical decision making, yet
their manual creation is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Recent
advancements of vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential in
medical applications, presenting a promising avenue for automating report
generation. However, existing applications of VLMs in the medical domain have
predominantly focused on structural imaging modalities, while the unique
characteristics of molecular PET imaging have largely been overlooked. To
bridge the gap, we introduce PET2Rep, a large-scale comprehensive benchmark for
evaluation of general and medical VLMs for radiology report generation for PET
images. PET2Rep stands out as the first dedicated dataset for PET report
generation with metabolic information, uniquely capturing whole-body
image-report pairs that cover dozens of organs to fill the critical gap in
existing benchmarks and mirror real-world clinical comprehensiveness. In
addition to widely recognized natural language generation metrics, we introduce
a series of clinical efficiency metrics to evaluate the quality of radiotracer
uptake pattern description in key organs in generated reports. We conduct a
head-to-head comparison of 30 cutting-edge general-purpose and
medical-specialized VLMs. The results show that the current state-of-the-art
VLMs perform poorly on PET report generation task, falling considerably short
of fulfilling practical needs. Moreover, we identify several key insufficiency
that need to be addressed to advance the development in medical applications.

TL;DR: MAEs pretrained on unlabelled chest CT scans improve diagnostic performance for diffused lung diseases, even with limited labelled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Annotated imaging datasets for diffused lung diseases are scarce, making MAEs a promising solution for learning robust features from unlabelled data.

Method: Train an MAE on 5,000+ chest CT scans (in-house and public data), then fine-tune for a classification task.

Result: MAEs extract clinically meaningful features and enhance diagnostic accuracy without large labelled datasets.

Conclusion: MAEs are effective for diffused lung disease research, offering a solution to data scarcity challenges.

Abstract: Masked autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a powerful approach for
pre-training on unlabelled data, capable of learning robust and informative
feature representations. This is particularly advantageous in diffused lung
disease research, where annotated imaging datasets are scarce. To leverage
this, we train an MAE on a curated collection of over 5,000 chest computed
tomography (CT) scans, combining in-house data with publicly available scans
from related conditions that exhibit similar radiological patterns, such as
COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia. The pretrained MAE is then fine-tuned on a
downstream classification task for diffused lung disease diagnosis. Our
findings demonstrate that MAEs can effectively extract clinically meaningful
features and improve diagnostic performance, even in the absence of large-scale
labelled datasets. The code and the models are available here:

TL;DR: TotalRegistrator is a lightweight, multi-organ image registration framework using UNet and field decomposition, outperforming baselines in abdominal alignment and showing strong generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image registration methods are often single-organ focused, limiting their broader applicability in clinical practice.

Method: Uses a standard UNet architecture with a novel field decomposition strategy, trained on 695 whole-body CT scans.

Result: Outperforms baselines in multi-organ abdominal registration, with slight lung alignment drop, and shows competitive results on external datasets.

Conclusion: TotalRegistrator is a robust, generalizable solution for multi-organ image registration, with potential for clinical use.

Abstract: Image registration is a fundamental technique in the analysis of longitudinal
and multi-phase CT images within clinical practice. However, most existing
methods are tailored for single-organ applications, limiting their
generalizability to other anatomical regions. This work presents
TotalRegistrator, an image registration framework capable of aligning multiple
anatomical regions simultaneously using a standard UNet architecture and a
novel field decomposition strategy. The model is lightweight, requiring only
11GB of GPU memory for training. To train and evaluate our method, we
constructed a large-scale longitudinal dataset comprising 695 whole-body
(thorax-abdomen-pelvic) paired CT scans from individual patients acquired at
different time points. We benchmarked TotalRegistrator against a generic
classical iterative algorithm and a recent foundation model for image
registration. To further assess robustness and generalizability, we evaluated
our model on three external datasets: the public thoracic and abdominal
datasets from the Learn2Reg challenge, and a private multiphase abdominal
dataset from a collaborating hospital. Experimental results on the in-house
dataset show that the proposed approach generally surpasses baseline methods in
multi-organ abdominal registration, with a slight drop in lung alignment
performance. On out-of-distribution datasets, it achieved competitive results
compared to leading single-organ models, despite not being fine-tuned for those
tasks, demonstrating strong generalizability. The source code will be publicly

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperparameter tuning in 3DGS is labor-intensive and expert-driven, leading to inconsistent results. RLGS aims to automate this process.

Method: RLGS uses lightweight policy modules to dynamically adjust hyperparameters like learning rates and densification thresholds, integrating seamlessly into 3DGS pipelines.

Result: RLGS improves rendering quality, e.g., boosting Taming-3DGS by 0.7dB PSNR on the TNT dataset, even when baselines saturate.

Conclusion: RLGS effectively automates hyperparameter tuning in 3DGS, bridging a gap in applying reinforcement learning to this domain.

Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a labor-intensive
and expert-driven process, often resulting in inconsistent reconstructions and
suboptimal results. We propose RLGS, a plug-and-play reinforcement learning
framework for adaptive hyperparameter tuning in 3DGS through lightweight policy
modules, dynamically adjusting critical hyperparameters such as learning rates
and densification thresholds. The framework is model-agnostic and seamlessly
integrates into existing 3DGS pipelines without architectural modifications. We
demonstrate its generalization ability across multiple state-of-the-art 3DGS
variants, including Taming-3DGS and 3DGS-MCMC, and validate its robustness
across diverse datasets. RLGS consistently enhances rendering quality. For
example, it improves Taming-3DGS by 0.7dB PSNR on the Tanks and Temple (TNT)
dataset, under a fixed Gaussian budget, and continues to yield gains even when
baseline performance saturates. Our results suggest that RLGS provides an
effective and general solution for automating hyperparameter tuning in 3DGS
training, bridging a gap in applying reinforcement learning to 3DGS.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Surf3R is an end-to-end feedforward method for 3D surface reconstruction from sparse views without camera pose estimation, completing scenes in under 10 seconds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods rely on complex pre-processing like camera calibration, hindering practical deployment.

Method: Uses a multi-branch, multi-view decoding architecture with branch-wise processing, cross-view attention, and inter-branch fusion. Introduces a D-Normal regularizer for joint optimization of 3D geometry.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet++ and Replica datasets, with excellent generalization and efficiency.

Conclusion: Surf3R effectively bypasses camera calibration, improving speed and accuracy in 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Current multi-view 3D reconstruction methods rely on accurate camera
calibration and pose estimation, requiring complex and time-intensive
pre-processing that hinders their practical deployment. To address this
challenge, we introduce Surf3R, an end-to-end feedforward approach that
reconstructs 3D surfaces from sparse views without estimating camera poses and
completes an entire scene in under 10 seconds. Our method employs a
multi-branch and multi-view decoding architecture in which multiple reference
views jointly guide the reconstruction process. Through the proposed
branch-wise processing, cross-view attention, and inter-branch fusion, the
model effectively captures complementary geometric cues without requiring
camera calibration. Moreover, we introduce a D-Normal regularizer based on an
explicit 3D Gaussian representation for surface reconstruction. It couples
surface normals with other geometric parameters to jointly optimize the 3D
geometry, significantly improving 3D consistency and surface detail accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate that Surf3R achieves state-of-the-art
performance on multiple surface reconstruction metrics on ScanNet++ and Replica
datasets, exhibiting excellent generalization and efficiency.

### [424] [MienCap: Realtime Performance-Based Facial Animation with Live Mood Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04687)
*Ye Pan,Ruisi Zhang,Jingying Wang,Nengfu Chen,Yilin Qiu,Yu Ding,Kenny Mitchell*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a system combining blendshape animation and machine learning to improve 3D stylized character expressions, outperforming Faceware in recognition, intensity, and attractiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance performance-based animation for believable 3D stylized characters by ensuring geometric consistency and perceptual validity.

Method: Uses a 3D emotion transfer network for non-real time and a blendshape adaption network for real-time solutions, both leveraging machine learning.

Result: Outperforms Faceware in expression recognition, intensity, and attractiveness, with statistically higher ratings.

Conclusion: The system can streamline animation pipelines, enabling faster and more accurate expression creation.

Abstract: Our purpose is to improve performance-based animation which can drive
believable 3D stylized characters that are truly perceptual. By combining
traditional blendshape animation techniques with multiple machine learning
models, we present both non-real time and real time solutions which drive
character expressions in a geometrically consistent and perceptually valid way.
For the non-real time system, we propose a 3D emotion transfer network makes
use of a 2D human image to generate a stylized 3D rig parameters. For the real
time system, we propose a blendshape adaption network which generates the
character rig parameter motions with geometric consistency and temporally
stability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system by comparing to a
commercial product Faceware. Results reveal that ratings of the recognition,
intensity, and attractiveness of expressions depicted for animated characters
via our systems are statistically higher than Faceware. Our results may be
implemented into the animation pipeline, and provide animators with a system
for creating the expressions they wish to use more quickly and accurately.

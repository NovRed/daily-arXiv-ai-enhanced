Reinforcement-learning\nbased alternatives can produce transferable policies but require substantial\nparameter updates and compute. In this work we introduce Meta-Policy Reflexion\n(MPR): a hybrid framework that consolidates LLM-generated reflections into a\nstructured, predicate-like Meta-Policy Memory (MPM) and applies that memory at\ninference time through two complementary mechanisms soft memory-guided decoding\nand hard rule admissibility checks(HAC). MPR (i) externalizes reusable\ncorrective knowledge without model weight updates, (ii) enforces domain\nconstraints to reduce unsafe or invalid actions, and (iii) retains the\nadaptability of language-based reflection. We formalize the MPM representation,\npresent algorithms for update and decoding, and validate the approach in a\ntext-based agent environment following the experimental protocol described in\nthe provided implementation (AlfWorld-based). Empirical results reported in the\nsupplied material indicate consistent gains in execution accuracy and\nrobustness when compared to Reflexion baselines; rule admissibility further\nimproves stability.

### [1] [Mitigating Hallucinations in Multimodal LLMs via Object-aware Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20181)
*Alberto Compagnoni,Davide Caffagni,Nicholas Moratelli,Lorenzo Baraldi,Marcella Cornia,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CHAIR-DPO method reduces hallucinations in Multimodal LLMs by using CHAIR metric to identify non-hallucinated samples and fine-tuning with Direct Preference Optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs tend to hallucinate by generating answers not reflected in visual input, which is a long-standing issue despite state-of-the-art benchmark performance.

Method: Leverage CHAIR metric to distinguish hallucinated vs non-hallucinated samples, then fine-tune off-the-shelf MLLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) without complex synthetic data pipelines.

Result: Effectively diminishes hallucinated answers on several hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating CHAIR-based reward effectiveness.

Conclusion: CHAIR-DPO provides a simple yet effective approach to align MLLMs and reduce hallucinations by treating it as an alignment problem with preference-based optimization.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) emerge as a unified interface to
address a multitude of tasks, ranging from NLP to computer vision. Despite
showcasing state-of-the-art results in many benchmarks, a long-standing issue
is the tendency of MLLMs to hallucinate, that is to generate answers to the
user's query that are not reflected in the visual input. In this paper, we
address the problem of hallucinations as an alignment problem, seeking to steer
the MLLM so that it prefers generating content without hallucinations. In
contrast to recent approaches that require complicated pipelines to build
synthetic preference data for alignment training, often relying on proprietary
models, we capitalize on the well-known CHAIR metric, originally proposed to
gauge the degree of hallucinations in image captioning. Given a pair of
generated answers, we leverage CHAIR to distinguish winner and loser options
(i.e., non-hallucinated and hallucinated samples) and fine-tune off-the-shelf
MLLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The resulting method, which we
refer to as CHAIR-DPO, effectively diminishes the amount of hallucinated
answers on several hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
fine-tuning the MLLM with a CHAIR-based reward. Source code and trained models
are publicly available at https://github.com/aimagelab/CHAIR-DPO.

### [2] [SDiFL: Stable Diffusion-Driven Framework for Image Forgery Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20182)
*Yang Su,Shunquan Tan,Jiwu Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Integrates Stable Diffusion 3's multimodal capabilities for image forgery localization by treating forgery residuals as an explicit modality, achieving 12% performance improvement without requiring annotated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image forgery localization methods struggle with emerging manipulation technologies and rely on costly annotated data. Multi-modal large models like Stable Diffusion offer new opportunities for forensic analysis.

Method: Leverages SD3's multimodal framework by treating image forgery residuals (high-frequency signals from highpass filters) as an explicit modality fused into latent space during training, while preserving original semantic features.

Result: Achieves up to 12% performance improvement on benchmark datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods. Shows strong generalization to unseen real-world document forgery and natural scene forging images.

Conclusion: The integration of SD's generation and perceptual capabilities provides an efficient and accurate framework for forgery localization that doesn't require annotated data and generalizes well to real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Driven by the new generation of multi-modal large models, such as Stable
Diffusion (SD), image manipulation technologies have advanced rapidly, posing
significant challenges to image forensics. However, existing image forgery
localization methods, which heavily rely on labor-intensive and costly
annotated data, are struggling to keep pace with these emerging image
manipulation technologies. To address these challenges, we are the first to
integrate both image generation and powerful perceptual capabilities of SD into
an image forensic framework, enabling more efficient and accurate forgery
localization. First, we theoretically show that the multi-modal architecture of
SD can be conditioned on forgery-related information, enabling the model to
inherently output forgery localization results. Then, building on this
foundation, we specifically leverage the multimodal framework of Stable
DiffusionV3 (SD3) to enhance forgery localization performance.We leverage the
multi-modal processing capabilities of SD3 in the latent space by treating
image forgery residuals -- high-frequency signals extracted using specific
highpass filters -- as an explicit modality. This modality is fused into the
latent space during training to enhance forgery localization performance.
Notably, our method fully preserves the latent features extracted by SD3,
thereby retaining the rich semantic information of the input image.
Experimental results show that our framework achieves up to 12% improvements in
performance on widely used benchmarking datasets compared to current
state-of-the-art image forgery localization models. Encouragingly, the model
demonstrates strong performance on forensic tasks involving real-world document
forgery images and natural scene forging images, even when such data were
entirely unseen during training.

### [3] [Grounding Multimodal Large Language Models with Quantitative Skin Attributes: A Retrieval Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20188)
*Max Torop,Masih Eskandar,Nicholas Kurtansky,Jinyang Liu,Jochen Weber,Octavia Camps,Veronica Rotemberg,Jennifer Dy,Kivanc Kose*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Combining multimodal LLMs with quantitative skin lesion attributes improves AI interpretability for dermatology diagnosis


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI models show diagnostic success but lack interpretability needed for clinical use. MLLMs offer natural language reasoning while quantitative attributes provide interpretable predictive concepts.

Method: Fine-tune MLLMs to predict quantitative lesion attributes (e.g., lesion area) from images and ground embedding spaces in these attributes. Evaluate through attribute-specific content-based image retrieval on SLICE-3D dataset.

Result: Evidence shows MLLM embedding spaces can be effectively grounded in quantitative attributes through fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Grounding MLLMs in quantitative diagnostic attributes provides a promising approach for improving interpretability of AI dermatology models.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence models have demonstrated significant success in
diagnosing skin diseases, including cancer, showing the potential to assist
clinicians in their analysis. However, the interpretability of model
predictions must be significantly improved before they can be used in practice.
To this end, we explore the combination of two promising approaches: Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) and quantitative attribute usage. MLLMs offer a
potential avenue for increased interpretability, providing reasoning for
diagnosis in natural language through an interactive format. Separately, a
number of quantitative attributes that are related to lesion appearance (e.g.,
lesion area) have recently been found predictive of malignancy with high
accuracy. Predictions grounded as a function of such concepts have the
potential for improved interpretability. We provide evidence that MLLM
embedding spaces can be grounded in such attributes, through fine-tuning to
predict their values from images. Concretely, we evaluate this grounding in the
embedding space through an attribute-specific content-based image retrieval
case study using the SLICE-3D dataset.

### [4] [Enhancing Automatic Modulation Recognition With a Reconstruction-Driven Vision Transformer Under Limited Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20193)
*Hossein Ahmadi,Banafsheh Saffari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified Vision Transformer framework for automatic modulation recognition that combines supervised, self-supervised, and reconstruction objectives to achieve label-efficient performance with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AMR solutions require large labeled datasets or complex multi-stage training pipelines, limiting scalability and generalization in practical applications.

Method: Uses a ViT encoder with lightweight convolutional decoder and linear classifier; reconstruction branch maps augmented signals back to originals to preserve fine-grained I/Q structure; combines supervised, self-supervised, and reconstruction objectives.

Result: Outperforms supervised CNN and ViT baselines in low-label regimes on RML2018.01A dataset; approaches ResNet-level accuracy with only 15-20% labeled data; maintains strong performance across varying SNR levels.

Conclusion: Provides a simple, generalizable, and label-efficient solution for automatic modulation recognition that addresses the limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is critical for cognitive radio,
spectrum monitoring, and secure wireless communication. However, existing
solutions often rely on large labeled datasets or multi-stage training
pipelines, which limit scalability and generalization in practice. We propose a
unified Vision Transformer (ViT) framework that integrates supervised,
self-supervised, and reconstruction objectives. The model combines a ViT
encoder, a lightweight convolutional decoder, and a linear classifier; the
reconstruction branch maps augmented signals back to their originals, anchoring
the encoder to fine-grained I/Q structure. This strategy promotes robust,
discriminative feature learning during pretraining, while partial label
supervision in fine-tuning enables effective classification with limited
labels. On the RML2018.01A dataset, our approach outperforms supervised CNN and
ViT baselines in low-label regimes, approaches ResNet-level accuracy with only
15-20% labeled data, and maintains strong performance across varying SNR
levels. Overall, the framework provides a simple, generalizable, and
label-efficient solution for AMR.

### [5] [InfinityHuman: Towards Long-Term Audio-Driven Human](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20210)
*Xiaodi Li,Pan Xie,Yi Ren,Qijun Gan,Chen Zhang,Fangyuan Kong,Xiang Yin,Bingyue Peng,Zehuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfinityHuman is a coarse-to-fine framework for generating high-resolution, long-duration audio-driven human videos with stable appearance and natural hand motions, addressing issues like identity drift and poor hand modeling in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing audio-driven human animation methods suffer from error accumulation leading to identity drift, color shifts, scene instability, and poorly modeled hand movements with noticeable distortions and audio misalignment.

Method: A coarse-to-fine framework that first generates audio-synchronized representations, then refines them using a pose-guided refiner with stable poses and initial frame as visual anchor. Includes hand-specific reward mechanism trained with high-quality hand motion data.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on EMTD and HDTF datasets in video quality, identity preservation, hand accuracy, and lip-sync. Ablation studies confirm effectiveness of each module.

Conclusion: InfinityHuman successfully addresses key challenges in audio-driven human animation by leveraging pose-guided refinement and hand-specific rewards, producing high-quality, stable long-duration videos with improved gesture realism and synchronization.

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation has attracted wide attention thanks to its
practical applications. However, critical challenges remain in generating
high-resolution, long-duration videos with consistent appearance and natural
hand motions. Existing methods extend videos using overlapping motion frames
but suffer from error accumulation, leading to identity drift, color shifts,
and scene instability. Additionally, hand movements are poorly modeled,
resulting in noticeable distortions and misalignment with the audio. In this
work, we propose InfinityHuman, a coarse-to-fine framework that first generates
audio-synchronized representations, then progressively refines them into
high-resolution, long-duration videos using a pose-guided refiner. Since pose
sequences are decoupled from appearance and resist temporal degradation, our
pose-guided refiner employs stable poses and the initial frame as a visual
anchor to reduce drift and improve lip synchronization. Moreover, to enhance
semantic accuracy and gesture realism, we introduce a hand-specific reward
mechanism trained with high-quality hand motion data. Experiments on the EMTD
and HDTF datasets show that InfinityHuman achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video quality, identity preservation, hand accuracy, and lip-sync. Ablation
studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module. Code will be made
public.

### [6] [Spherical Vision Transformers for Audio-Visual Saliency Prediction in 360-Degree Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20221)
*Mert Cokelek,Halit Ozsoy,Nevrez Imamoglu,Cagri Ozcinar,Inci Ayhan,Erkut Erdem,Aykut Erdem*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV models for 360-degree video saliency prediction, incorporating spatial audio and spherical geometry-aware attention, with a new YT360-EyeTracking dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of comprehensive datasets and methods for 360-degree audio-visual saliency prediction in omnidirectional videos, particularly considering spherical distortion and spatial audio integration.

Method: Proposed two novel models: SalViT360 (vision-transformer with spherical geometry-aware spatio-temporal attention) and SalViT360-AV (adds transformer adapters conditioned on audio input). Created YT360-EyeTracking dataset with 81 ODVs under varying audio-visual conditions.

Result: Both SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV significantly outperform existing methods on benchmark datasets including their new YT360-EyeTracking dataset.

Conclusion: Integrating spatial audio cues in model architecture is crucial for accurate saliency prediction in omnidirectional videos, and the proposed models effectively address the challenges of spherical distortion and audio-visual integration.

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos (ODVs) are redefining viewer experiences in virtual
reality (VR) by offering an unprecedented full field-of-view (FOV). This study
extends the domain of saliency prediction to 360-degree environments,
addressing the complexities of spherical distortion and the integration of
spatial audio. Contextually, ODVs have transformed user experience by adding a
spatial audio dimension that aligns sound direction with the viewer's
perspective in spherical scenes. Motivated by the lack of comprehensive
datasets for 360-degree audio-visual saliency prediction, our study curates
YT360-EyeTracking, a new dataset of 81 ODVs, each observed under varying
audio-visual conditions. Our goal is to explore how to utilize audio-visual
cues to effectively predict visual saliency in 360-degree videos. Towards this
aim, we propose two novel saliency prediction models: SalViT360, a
vision-transformer-based framework for ODVs equipped with spherical
geometry-aware spatio-temporal attention layers, and SalViT360-AV, which
further incorporates transformer adapters conditioned on audio input. Our
results on a number of benchmark datasets, including our YT360-EyeTracking,
demonstrate that SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV significantly outperform existing
methods in predicting viewer attention in 360-degree scenes. Interpreting these
results, we suggest that integrating spatial audio cues in the model
architecture is crucial for accurate saliency prediction in omnidirectional
videos. Code and dataset will be available at

### [7] [A Novel Framework for Automated Explain Vision Model Using Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20227)
*Phu-Vinh Nguyen,Tan-Hanh Pham,Chris Ngo,Truong Son Hy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A pipeline using Vision-Language Models to explain vision models at both sample and dataset levels, addressing the gap in understanding general model behavior beyond individual samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision model development focuses on performance metrics like accuracy but lacks explainability methods that can reveal general model behavior across large datasets, which is crucial for preventing biased judgments and understanding model patterns.

Method: Proposes a pipeline leveraging Vision-Language Models to provide explanations at both sample-level and dataset-level, enabling comprehensive analysis of vision model behavior with minimal effort.

Result: The pipeline can discover failure cases and provide insights into vision models, facilitating integration of xAI analysis with vision model development.

Conclusion: The proposed approach advances image analysis by combining vision model development with explainable AI, enabling better understanding of model behavior and patterns across datasets.

Abstract: The development of many vision models mainly focuses on improving their
performance using metrics such as accuracy, IoU, and mAP, with less attention
to explainability due to the complexity of applying xAI methods to provide a
meaningful explanation of trained models. Although many existing xAI methods
aim to explain vision models sample-by-sample, methods explaining the general
behavior of vision models, which can only be captured after running on a large
dataset, are still underexplored. Furthermore, understanding the behavior of
vision models on general images can be very important to prevent biased
judgments and help identify the model's trends and patterns. With the
application of Vision-Language Models, this paper proposes a pipeline to
explain vision models at both the sample and dataset levels. The proposed
pipeline can be used to discover failure cases and gain insights into vision
models with minimal effort, thereby integrating vision model development with
xAI analysis to advance image analysis.

### [8] [ATMS-KD: Adaptive Temperature and Mixed Sample Knowledge Distillation for a Lightweight Residual CNN in Agricultural Embedded Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20232)
*Mohamed Ohamouddou,Said Ohamouddou,Abdellatif El Afia,Rafik Lasri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ATMS-KD framework combines adaptive temperature scheduling with mixed-sample augmentation to create lightweight CNN models for agricultural applications, achieving over 96.7% accuracy with compact models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop lightweight CNN models suitable for resource-constrained agricultural environments by effectively transferring knowledge from larger teacher models to smaller student models.

Method: Combines adaptive temperature scheduling with mixed-sample augmentation knowledge distillation from MobileNetV3 Large teacher (5.7M params) to three lightweight residual CNN student configurations (1.3M, 2.4M, 3.8M params) using Damask rose dataset from Morocco.

Result: All student models achieved validation accuracies exceeding 96.7% (vs 95-96% with direct training), outperformed 11 established KD methods, with compact model achieving 97.11% accuracy and 72.19ms inference latency. Knowledge retention rates exceeded 99% for all configurations.

Conclusion: ATMS-KD effectively transfers knowledge regardless of student model capacity, making it suitable for resource-constrained agricultural computer vision applications with significant performance improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: This study proposes ATMS-KD (Adaptive Temperature and Mixed-Sample Knowledge
Distillation), a novel framework for developing lightweight CNN models suitable
for resource-constrained agricultural environments. The framework combines
adaptive temperature scheduling with mixed-sample augmentation to transfer
knowledge from a MobileNetV3 Large teacher model (5.7\,M parameters) to
lightweight residual CNN students. Three student configurations were evaluated:
Compact (1.3\,M parameters), Standard (2.4\,M parameters), and Enhanced (3.8\,M
parameters). The dataset used in this study consists of images of \textit{Rosa
damascena} (Damask rose) collected from agricultural fields in the Dades Oasis,
southeastern Morocco, providing a realistic benchmark for agricultural computer
vision applications under diverse environmental conditions. Experimental
evaluation on the Damascena rose maturity classification dataset demonstrated
significant improvements over direct training methods. All student models
achieved validation accuracies exceeding 96.7\% with ATMS-KD compared to
95--96\% with direct training. The framework outperformed eleven established
knowledge distillation methods, achieving 97.11\% accuracy with the compact
model -- a 1.60 percentage point improvement over the second-best approach
while maintaining the lowest inference latency of 72.19\,ms. Knowledge
retention rates exceeded 99\% for all configurations, demonstrating effective
knowledge transfer regardless of student model capacity.

### [9] [Linking heterogeneous microstructure informatics with expert characterization knowledge through customized and hybrid vision-language representations for industrial qualification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20243)
*Mutahar Safdar,Gentry Wood,Max Zimmermann,Guy Lamouche,Priti Wanjara,Yaoyao Fiona Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel framework combining microstructure informatics with expert knowledge using customized vision-language representations for zero-shot classification of manufacturing defects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the bottleneck in rapid qualification of advanced materials from additive manufacturing, particularly for heterogeneous structures, by bridging raw microstructural data with expert characterization knowledge.

Method: Integrates deep semantic segmentation with pre-trained multi-modal models (CLIP and FLAVA) to create shared representations of visual microstructural data and textual expert assessments. Develops customized similarity-based representation with positive/negative references from expert-annotated images and descriptions. Uses net similarity scoring for zero-shot classification and Z-score normalization for effective alignment.

Result: Successfully distinguishes between acceptable and defective samples in additively manufactured metal matrix composites. FLAVA model shows higher visual sensitivity, while CLIP provides consistent textual alignment. Framework enables human-in-the-loop decision-making without task-specific retraining.

Conclusion: The method enhances traceability and interpretability in qualification pipelines, advancing semantic interoperability between raw data and expert knowledge for scalable, domain-adaptable qualification strategies in engineering informatics.

Abstract: Rapid and reliable qualification of advanced materials remains a bottleneck
in industrial manufacturing, particularly for heterogeneous structures produced
via non-conventional additive manufacturing processes. This study introduces a
novel framework that links microstructure informatics with a range of expert
characterization knowledge using customized and hybrid vision-language
representations (VLRs). By integrating deep semantic segmentation with
pre-trained multi-modal models (CLIP and FLAVA), we encode both visual
microstructural data and textual expert assessments into shared
representations. To overcome limitations in general-purpose embeddings, we
develop a customized similarity-based representation that incorporates both
positive and negative references from expert-annotated images and their
associated textual descriptions. This allows zero-shot classification of
previously unseen microstructures through a net similarity scoring approach.
Validation on an additively manufactured metal matrix composite dataset
demonstrates the framework's ability to distinguish between acceptable and
defective samples across a range of characterization criteria. Comparative
analysis reveals that FLAVA model offers higher visual sensitivity, while the
CLIP model provides consistent alignment with the textual criteria. Z-score
normalization adjusts raw unimodal and cross-modal similarity scores based on
their local dataset-driven distributions, enabling more effective alignment and
classification in the hybrid vision-language framework. The proposed method
enhances traceability and interpretability in qualification pipelines by
enabling human-in-the-loop decision-making without task-specific model
retraining. By advancing semantic interoperability between raw data and expert
knowledge, this work contributes toward scalable and domain-adaptable
qualification strategies in engineering informatics.

Shultz,David K. Wright,Dexiao Kong,Sharon L. Naismith,Terence J. O'Brien,Ying Xia,Meng Law,Benjamin Sinclair*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedNeXt-L-k5, a Transformer-inspired 3D CNN, was adapted for automated perivascular spaces segmentation in MRI, achieving state-of-the-art performance on T2w images but moderate results on T1w images across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual PVS segmentation is time-consuming with moderate inter-rater reliability, and existing automated deep learning models have limited performance and poor generalization across diverse MRI datasets.

Method: Adapted MedNeXt-L-k5 (Transformer-inspired 3D encoder-decoder CNN) for PVS segmentation. Trained two models: one on homogeneous T2w MRI from HCP-Aging (200 scans), another on heterogeneous T1w MRI from seven studies across six scanners (40 volumes). Evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation and leave-one-site-out cross-validation.

Result: T2w model achieved voxel-level Dice score of 0.88±0.06 (WM), comparable to inter-rater reliability and highest reported. T1w model scored 0.58±0.09 (WM). Under LOSOCV: voxel-level 0.38±0.16 (WM), 0.35±0.12 (BG); cluster-level 0.61±0.19 (WM), 0.62±0.21 (BG). Did not outperform nnU-Net.

Conclusion: MedNeXt-L-k5 provides efficient automated PVS segmentation across diverse T1w/T2w MRI datasets, but attention-based mechanisms in transformer-inspired models are not necessary for high accuracy in PVS segmentation.

Abstract: Enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS) are increasingly recognized as biomarkers
of cerebral small vessel disease, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and
aging-related neurodegeneration. However, manual segmentation of PVS is
time-consuming and subject to moderate inter-rater reliability, while existing
automated deep learning models have moderate performance and typically fail to
generalize across diverse clinical and research MRI datasets. We adapted
MedNeXt-L-k5, a Transformer-inspired 3D encoder-decoder convolutional network,
for automated PVS segmentation. Two models were trained: one using a
homogeneous dataset of 200 T2-weighted (T2w) MRI scans from the Human
Connectome Project-Aging (HCP-Aging) dataset and another using 40 heterogeneous
T1-weighted (T1w) MRI volumes from seven studies across six scanners. Model
performance was evaluated using internal 5-fold cross validation (5FCV) and
leave-one-site-out cross validation (LOSOCV). MedNeXt-L-k5 models trained on
the T2w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved voxel-level Dice scores of
0.88+/-0.06 (white matter, WM), comparable to the reported inter-rater
reliability of that dataset, and the highest yet reported in the literature.
The same models trained on the T1w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved a
substantially lower Dice score of 0.58+/-0.09 (WM). Under LOSOCV, the model had
voxel-level Dice scores of 0.38+/-0.16 (WM) and 0.35+/-0.12 (BG), and
cluster-level Dice scores of 0.61+/-0.19 (WM) and 0.62+/-0.21 (BG).
MedNeXt-L-k5 provides an efficient solution for automated PVS segmentation
across diverse T1w and T2w MRI datasets. MedNeXt-L-k5 did not outperform the
nnU-Net, indicating that the attention-based mechanisms present in
transformer-inspired models to provide global context are not required for high
accuracy in PVS segmentation.

### [11] [Plug-in Feedback Self-adaptive Attention in CLIP for Training-free Open-Vocabulary Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20265)
*Zhixiang Chi,Yanan Wu,Li Gu,Huan Liu,Ziqiang Wang,Yang Zhang,Yang Wang,Konstantinos N. Plataniotis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training-free feedback framework that adapts output-based patch correspondences back to intermediate attention to improve CLIP's spatial coherence for open-vocabulary segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP has strong visual-textual alignment but poor localization for segmentation. Intermediate attention modifications don't consistently propagate to final output due to subsequent operations, and lack direct text interaction.

Method: Feedback-driven self-adaptive framework that uses output predictions as spatial coherence prior. Includes attention isolation, confidence-based pruning for sparse adaptation, and adaptation ensemble modules.

Result: Consistently improves performance across eight benchmarks when integrated into four state-of-the-art approaches with three backbones (ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H) and multiple attention types.

Conclusion: The proposed plug-in module effectively enhances semantic consistency between internal representations and final predictions by leveraging output coherence cues as feedback.

Abstract: CLIP exhibits strong visual-textual alignment but struggle with
open-vocabulary segmentation due to poor localization. Prior methods enhance
spatial coherence by modifying intermediate attention. But, this coherence
isn't consistently propagated to the final output due to subsequent operations
such as projections. Additionally, intermediate attention lacks direct
interaction with text representations, such semantic discrepancy limits the
full potential of CLIP.
  In this work, we propose a training-free, feedback-driven self-adaptive
framework that adapts output-based patch-level correspondences back to the
intermediate attention. The output predictions, being the culmination of the
model's processing, encapsulate the most comprehensive visual and textual
semantics about each patch. Our approach enhances semantic consistency between
internal representations and final predictions by leveraging the model's
outputs as a stronger spatial coherence prior. We design key modules, including
attention isolation, confidence-based pruning for sparse adaptation, and
adaptation ensemble, to effectively feedback the output coherence cues. Our
method functions as a plug-in module, seamlessly integrating into four
state-of-the-art approaches with three backbones (ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H). We
further validate our framework across multiple attention types (Q-K, self-self,
and Proxy augmented with MAE, SAM, and DINO). Our approach consistently
improves their performance across eight benchmarks.

*Zhuoran Yu,Yong Jae Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A probing framework to analyze layer-wise processing in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) reveals consistent stage-wise structure across different models, with early layers handling visual grounding, middle layers for semantic reasoning, and final layers for output preparation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs show strong performance but their internal processing dynamics remain underexplored. The authors aim to systematically analyze how these models process visual and textual inputs across different layers to understand their functional organization.

Method: The researchers train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories from token embeddings at each layer using standardized anchor questions. They evaluate probes under three prompt variations: lexical variants, semantic negation variants, and output format variants. The framework is applied to LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL models.

Result: The study identifies a consistent stage-wise structure across MLLMs: early layers perform visual grounding, middle layers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers prepare task-specific outputs. While the overall structure remains stable across visual tokenization and training variations, layer allocation shifts with changes in base LLM architecture.

Conclusion: The findings provide a unified perspective on MLLM layer organization and offer a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for analyzing multimodal representation dynamics, contributing to better understanding of how these models process multimodal information.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet their internal processing
dynamics remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce a probing framework
to systematically analyze how MLLMs process visual and textual inputs across
layers. We train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories
(e.g., dog breeds) from token embeddings extracted at each layer, using a
standardized anchor question. To uncover the functional roles of different
layers, we evaluate these probes under three types of controlled prompt
variations: (1) lexical variants that test sensitivity to surface-level
changes, (2) semantic negation variants that flip the expected answer by
modifying the visual concept in the prompt, and (3) output format variants that
preserve reasoning but alter the answer format. Applying our framework to
LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL, we identify a consistent
stage-wise structure in which early layers perform visual grounding, middle
layers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers
prepare task-specific outputs. We further show that while the overall
stage-wise structure remains stable across variations in visual tokenization,
instruction tuning data, and pretraining corpus, the specific layer allocation
to each stage shifts notably with changes in the base LLM architecture. Our
findings provide a unified perspective on the layer-wise organization of MLLMs
and offer a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for analyzing multimodal
representation dynamics.

*Zhi Li,Hau Phan,Matthew Emigh,Austin J. Brockmeier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes SLiCS, a supervised dictionary learning method to disentangle vision-language embedding spaces into concept-specific subspaces for improved concept-filtered image retrieval and conditional generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language co-embedding spaces like CLIP contain rich semantic information, but the authors hypothesize this space can be disentangled to separate information about complex scene content into distinct concept-specific components.

Method: A supervised dictionary learning approach that estimates a linear synthesis model with sparse, non-negative combinations of dictionary atoms. Uses alternating optimization with guaranteed convergence and leverages text co-embeddings for semantic descriptions.

Result: SLiCS enables more precise concept-filtered image retrieval and conditional generation. Works with various embeddings including CLIP, TiTok autoencoder embeddings, and DINOv2 latent embeddings.

Conclusion: The proposed sparse linear concept subspaces successfully disentangle embedding spaces, providing improved precision in concept-based retrieval tasks across different embedding types with both quantitative and qualitative improvements.

Abstract: Vision-language co-embedding networks, such as CLIP, provide a latent
embedding space with semantic information that is useful for downstream tasks.
We hypothesize that the embedding space can be disentangled to separate the
information on the content of complex scenes by decomposing the embedding into
multiple concept-specific component vectors that lie in different subspaces. We
propose a supervised dictionary learning approach to estimate a linear
synthesis model consisting of sparse, non-negative combinations of groups of
vectors in the dictionary (atoms), whose group-wise activity matches the
multi-label information. Each concept-specific component is a non-negative
combination of atoms associated to a label. The group-structured dictionary is
optimized through a novel alternating optimization with guaranteed convergence.
Exploiting the text co-embeddings, we detail how semantically meaningful
descriptions can be found based on text embeddings of words best approximated
by a concept's group of atoms, and unsupervised dictionary learning can exploit
zero-shot classification of training set images using the text embeddings of
concept labels to provide instance-wise multi-labels. We show that the
disentangled embeddings provided by our sparse linear concept subspaces (SLiCS)
enable concept-filtered image retrieval (and conditional generation using
image-to-prompt) that is more precise. We also apply SLiCS to highly-compressed
autoencoder embeddings from TiTok and the latent embedding from self-supervised
DINOv2. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight the improved precision
of the concept-filtered image retrieval for all embeddings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical VLMs present serious security risks including PHI exposure and data leakage, requiring safeguards for clinical adoption despite their potential benefits in healthcare applications.

Method: Developed a graphical user interface toolkit with Docker-orchestrated deployment, supporting plug-and-play integration of Hugging Face models, requiring only a single NVIDIA A6000 GPU on local workstations.

Result: Evaluated 5 state-of-the-art VLMs with board-certified pathologists, generating 1015 clinician-model scoring events that revealed limitations including off-target answers, vague reasoning, and inconsistent terminology.

Conclusion: MedFoundationHub provides a secure, accessible solution for medical VLM deployment while expert evaluation highlights current model limitations that need addressing for reliable clinical use.

Abstract: Recent advances in medical vision-language models (VLMs) open up remarkable
opportunities for clinical applications such as automated report generation,
copilots for physicians, and uncertainty quantification. However, despite their
promise, medical VLMs introduce serious security concerns, most notably risks
of Protected Health Information (PHI) exposure, data leakage, and vulnerability
to cyberthreats - which are especially critical in hospital environments. Even
when adopted for research or non-clinical purposes, healthcare organizations
must exercise caution and implement safeguards. To address these challenges, we
present MedFoundationHub, a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit that: (1)
enables physicians to manually select and use different models without
programming expertise, (2) supports engineers in efficiently deploying medical
VLMs in a plug-and-play fashion, with seamless integration of Hugging Face
open-source models, and (3) ensures privacy-preserving inference through
Docker-orchestrated, operating system agnostic deployment. MedFoundationHub
requires only an offline local workstation equipped with a single NVIDIA A6000
GPU, making it both secure and accessible within the typical resources of
academic research labs. To evaluate current capabilities, we engaged
board-certified pathologists to deploy and assess five state-of-the-art VLMs
(Google-MedGemma3-4B, Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, and
LLaVA-1.5-7B/13B). Expert evaluation covered colon cases and renal cases,
yielding 1015 clinician-model scoring events. These assessments revealed
recurring limitations, including off-target answers, vague reasoning, and
inconsistent pathology terminology.

*Mang Cao,Sanping Zhou,Yizhe Li,Ye Deng,Wenli Huang,Le Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Bidirectional Interaction Mamba (BIM) uses novel scanning mechanisms to enable efficient cross-task interaction for multi-task dense prediction without computational trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods face a trade-off between interaction completeness and computational efficiency in multi-task dense prediction, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Proposes BIM with Bidirectional Interaction Scan (BI-Scan) for task-specific bidirectional sequences and Multi-Scale Scan (MS-Scan) for multi-granularity scene modeling, both with linear complexity.

Result: Extensive experiments on NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-Context benchmarks show BIM outperforms state-of-the-art competitors.

Conclusion: BIM successfully addresses the computational efficiency vs interaction completeness trade-off through innovative scanning mechanisms, achieving superior performance in multi-task dense prediction.

Abstract: Sufficient cross-task interaction is crucial for success in multi-task dense
prediction. However, sufficient interaction often results in high computational
complexity, forcing existing methods to face the trade-off between interaction
completeness and computational efficiency. To address this limitation, this
work proposes a Bidirectional Interaction Mamba (BIM), which incorporates novel
scanning mechanisms to adapt the Mamba modeling approach for multi-task dense
prediction. On the one hand, we introduce a novel Bidirectional Interaction
Scan (BI-Scan) mechanism, which constructs task-specific representations as
bidirectional sequences during interaction. By integrating task-first and
position-first scanning modes within a unified linear complexity architecture,
BI-Scan efficiently preserves critical cross-task information. On the other
hand, we employ a Multi-Scale Scan~(MS-Scan) mechanism to achieve
multi-granularity scene modeling. This design not only meets the diverse
granularity requirements of various tasks but also enhances nuanced cross-task
feature interactions. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks,
\emph{i.e.}, NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-Context, show the superiority of our BIM vs its
state-of-the-art competitors.

*Hyeonyu Kim,Seokhoon Jeong,Seonghee Han,Chanhyuk Choi,Taehwan Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel audio-guided visual editing framework that integrates audio prompts with text prompts for complex visual editing tasks without requiring additional training, using pre-trained multi-modal encoders and novel noise branching techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Textual guidance alone is insufficient for complex visual editing scenarios, and existing audio-guided methods require dataset-specific training that limits real-world generalization.

Method: Leverages pre-trained multi-modal encoder with zero-shot capabilities, integrates audio into visual editing by aligning audio encoder space with diffusion model's prompt encoder space, and uses separate noise branching with adaptive patch selection for multi-modal prompts.

Result: The framework successfully handles complex editing tasks with multiple text and audio prompts, outperforming text-only approaches in scenarios where audio provides rich additional information.

Conclusion: The proposed audio-guided visual editing framework effectively addresses limitations of text-only editing by incorporating audio prompts through zero-shot multi-modal integration, demonstrating superior performance in complex editing scenarios.

Abstract: Visual editing with diffusion models has made significant progress but often
struggles with complex scenarios that textual guidance alone could not
adequately describe, highlighting the need for additional non-text editing
prompts. In this work, we introduce a novel audio-guided visual editing
framework that can handle complex editing tasks with multiple text and audio
prompts without requiring additional training. Existing audio-guided visual
editing methods often necessitate training on specific datasets to align audio
with text, limiting their generalization to real-world situations. We leverage
a pre-trained multi-modal encoder with strong zero-shot capabilities and
integrate diverse audio into visual editing tasks, by alleviating the
discrepancy between the audio encoder space and the diffusion model's prompt
encoder space. Additionally, we propose a novel approach to handle complex
scenarios with multiple and multi-modal editing prompts through our separate
noise branching and adaptive patch selection. Our comprehensive experiments on
diverse editing tasks demonstrate that our framework excels in handling
complicated editing scenarios by incorporating rich information from audio,
where text-only approaches fail.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fully annotating large-scale multi-label datasets is costly and impractical. Traditional SPML methods that treat missing labels as unknown/negative cause inaccuracies and false negatives, while pseudo-labeling strategies introduce additional noise.

Method: Developed Generalized Pseudo-Label Robust Loss (GPR Loss) to learn from diverse pseudo-labels while mitigating noise, combined with Dynamic Augmented Multi-focus Pseudo-labeling (DAMP) technique. Forms the Adaptive and Efficient Vision-Language Pseudo-Labeling (AEVLP) framework.

Result: Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate significant advancement in multi-label classification, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: The proposed AEVLP framework effectively addresses challenges in single positive multi-label learning by robustly handling noisy pseudo-labels and achieves superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Multi-label learning is a challenging computer vision task that requires
assigning multiple categories to each image. However, fully annotating
large-scale datasets is often impractical due to high costs and effort,
motivating the study of learning from partially annotated data. In the extreme
case of Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPML), each image is provided
with only one positive label, while all other labels remain unannotated.
Traditional SPML methods that treat missing labels as unknown or negative tend
to yield inaccuracies and false negatives, and integrating various
pseudo-labeling strategies can introduce additional noise. To address these
challenges, we propose the Generalized Pseudo-Label Robust Loss (GPR Loss), a
novel loss function that effectively learns from diverse pseudo-labels while
mitigating noise. Complementing this, we introduce a simple yet effective
Dynamic Augmented Multi-focus Pseudo-labeling (DAMP) technique. Together, these
contributions form the Adaptive and Efficient Vision-Language Pseudo-Labeling
(AEVLP) framework. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our framework significantly advances multi-label classification, achieving
state-of-the-art results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed delay-spike approach and temporal-dependent Integrate-and-Fire (tdIF) neuron for SNNs to improve visual detection tasks with ultra-low time-steps (within 5 steps), achieving state-of-the-art performance while maintaining energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ANN-SNN conversion methods perform well in classification tasks but remain suboptimal for visual detection tasks due to residual membrane potential issues from heterogeneous spiking patterns.

Method: Introduces delay-spike approach to mitigate residual membrane potential, and novel tdIF neuron architecture that dynamically adjusts accumulation and firing behaviors based on temporal order of time-steps, enabling distinct temporal properties beyond frequency-based representations.

Result: Achieves more precise feature representation with lower time-steps, surpassing current ANN-SNN conversion approaches in object detection and lane line detection tasks with ultra-low latency (within 5 time-steps) while maintaining energy consumption on par with traditional IF neurons.

Conclusion: The tdIF method enables high-performance, ultra-low latency visual detection in SNNs by leveraging temporal-dependent spiking behaviors, representing a significant advancement for neuromorphic computing applications.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the brain, are characterized by
minimal power consumption and swift inference capabilities on neuromorphic
hardware, and have been widely applied to various visual perception tasks.
Current ANN-SNN conversion methods have achieved excellent results in
classification tasks with ultra-low time-steps, but their performance in visual
detection tasks remains suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a delay-spike
approach to mitigate the issue of residual membrane potential caused by
heterogeneous spiking patterns. Furthermore, we propose a novel
temporal-dependent Integrate-and-Fire (tdIF) neuron architecture for SNNs. This
enables Integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons to dynamically adjust their
accumulation and firing behaviors based on the temporal order of time-steps.
Our method enables spikes to exhibit distinct temporal properties, rather than
relying solely on frequency-based representations. Moreover, the tdIF neuron
maintains energy consumption on par with traditional IF neuron. We demonstrate
that our method achieves more precise feature representation with lower
time-steps, enabling high performance and ultra-low latency in visual detection
tasks. In this study, we conduct extensive evaluation of the tdIF method across
two critical vision tasks: object detection and lane line detection. The
results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses current ANN-SNN
conversion approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance with ultra-low
latency (within 5 time-steps).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes DUP-MCRNet for salient object detection with dynamic uncertainty propagation and multimodal fusion to improve edge clarity and handle complex scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SOD methods suffer from detail loss, blurred edges, and insufficient fusion of single-modal information in complex scenes.

Method: Uses dynamic uncertainty graph convolution (DUGC) for uncertainty propagation and multimodal collaborative fusion (MCF) with learnable gating weights for RGB, depth, and edge features. Employs multi-scale BCE/IoU loss and uncertainty-guided supervision.

Result: Outperforms various SOD methods on benchmark datasets, especially in edge clarity and robustness to complex backgrounds.

Conclusion: DUP-MCRNet effectively addresses detail preservation and multimodal fusion challenges in salient object detection through uncertainty propagation and adaptive modality weighting.

Abstract: In view of the problems that existing salient object detection (SOD) methods
are prone to losing details, blurring edges, and insufficient fusion of
single-modal information in complex scenes, this paper proposes a dynamic
uncertainty propagation and multimodal collaborative reasoning network
(DUP-MCRNet). Firstly, a dynamic uncertainty graph convolution module (DUGC) is
designed to propagate uncertainty between layers through a sparse graph
constructed based on spatial semantic distance, and combined with channel
adaptive interaction, it effectively improves the detection accuracy of small
structures and edge regions. Secondly, a multimodal collaborative fusion
strategy (MCF) is proposed, which uses learnable modality gating weights to
weightedly fuse the attention maps of RGB, depth, and edge features. It can
dynamically adjust the importance of each modality according to different
scenes, effectively suppress redundant or interfering information, and
strengthen the semantic complementarity and consistency between
cross-modalities, thereby improving the ability to identify salient regions
under occlusion, weak texture or background interference. Finally, the
detection performance at the pixel level and region level is optimized through
multi-scale BCE and IoU loss, cross-scale consistency constraints, and
uncertainty-guided supervision mechanisms. Extensive experiments show that
DUP-MCRNet outperforms various SOD methods on most common benchmark datasets,
especially in terms of edge clarity and robustness to complex backgrounds. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/YukiBear426/DUP-MCRNet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSMVD improves multi-view pedestrian detection by generating multi-scale BEV features from multi-scale image features, addressing scale consistency issues across views.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MVPD methods struggle with pedestrians having consistently small/large scales within views or vastly different scales between views due to not exploiting multi-scale image features.

Method: Proposes MSMVD which generates multi-scale BEV features by projecting multi-scale image features into BEV space scale-by-scale, then processes them with a feature pyramid network to combine information across scales and views.

Result: Extensive experiments show MSMVD outperforms previous methods by 4.5 MODA points on GMVD dataset, demonstrating significant improvement in detection performance.

Conclusion: Exploiting multi-scale image features through multi-scale BEV features greatly enhances pedestrian detection performance in multi-view scenarios, particularly for scale-variant cases.

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Detection (MVPD) aims to detect pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view (BEV) from multi-view images. In MVPD, end-to-end
trainable deep learning methods have progressed greatly. However, they often
struggle to detect pedestrians with consistently small or large scales in views
or with vastly different scales between views. This is because they do not
exploit multi-scale image features to generate the BEV feature and detect
pedestrians. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel MVPD method, called
Multi-Scale Multi-View Detection (MSMVD). MSMVD generates multi-scale BEV
features by projecting multi-scale image features extracted from individual
views into the BEV space, scale-by-scale. Each of these BEV features inherits
the properties of its corresponding scale image features from multiple views.
Therefore, these BEV features help the precise detection of pedestrians with
consistently small or large scales in views. Then, MSMVD combines information
at different scales of multiple views by processing the multi-scale BEV
features using a feature pyramid network. This improves the detection of
pedestrians with vastly different scales between views. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that exploiting multi-scale image features via multi-scale BEV
features greatly improves the detection performance, and MSMVD outperforms the
previous highest MODA by $4.5$ points on the GMVD dataset.

Motivation: Current deepfake detectors achieve high accuracy but are computationally expensive, making them unsuitable for real-time applications like video conferencing and social media.

Method: Proposes Spatial-Frequency Aware Multi-Scale Fusion Network with: 1) spatial-frequency hybrid aware module using gated mechanism, 2) token-selective cross attention for multi-level feature interaction, 3) residual-enhanced blur pooling for semantic retention during downsampling.

Result: Achieves favorable balance between accuracy and efficiency on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: SFMFNet provides an effective lightweight solution for real-time deepfake detection with practical value for deployment in real-world applications.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of real-time deepfake generation techniques,
forged content is becoming increasingly realistic and widespread across
applications like video conferencing and social media. Although
state-of-the-art detectors achieve high accuracy on standard benchmarks, their
heavy computational cost hinders real-time deployment in practical
applications. To address this, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Aware
Multi-Scale Fusion Network (SFMFNet), a lightweight yet effective architecture
for real-time deepfake detection. We design a spatial-frequency hybrid aware
module that jointly leverages spatial textures and frequency artifacts through
a gated mechanism, enhancing sensitivity to subtle manipulations. A
token-selective cross attention mechanism enables efficient multi-level feature
interaction, while a residual-enhanced blur pooling structure helps retain key
semantic cues during downsampling. Experiments on several benchmark datasets
show that SFMFNet achieves a favorable balance between accuracy and efficiency,
with strong generalization and practical value for real-time applications.

TL;DR: A lightweight medical image classification method using dual-model weight selection and self-knowledge distillation to achieve comparable performance to large models with reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational constraints in real-world medical settings where deploying large-scale models is impractical, requiring lightweight alternatives that maintain performance.

Method: Uses dual-model weight selection from a large pretrained model to initialize two lightweight models, applies self-knowledge distillation for knowledge transfer, and fine-tunes for target classification tasks.

Result: Superior performance and robustness demonstrated on chest X-ray, lung CT scans, and brain MRI datasets compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The combined approach of dual-model weight selection and self-knowledge distillation effectively overcomes limitations of conventional methods in retaining critical information in compact medical image classification models.

Abstract: We propose a novel medical image classification method that integrates
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation (SKD). In
real-world medical settings, deploying large-scale models is often limited by
computational resource constraints, which pose significant challenges for their
practical implementation. Thus, developing lightweight models that achieve
comparable performance to large-scale models while maintaining computational
efficiency is crucial. To address this, we employ a dual-model weight selection
strategy that initializes two lightweight models with weights derived from a
large pretrained model, enabling effective knowledge transfer. Next, SKD is
applied to these selected models, allowing the use of a broad range of initial
weight configurations without imposing additional excessive computational cost,
followed by fine-tuning for the target classification tasks. By combining
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation, our method
overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches, which often fail to
retain critical information in compact models. Extensive experiments on
publicly available datasets-chest X-ray images, lung computed tomography scans,
and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans-demonstrate the superior performance
and robustness of our approach compared to existing methods.

TL;DR: A novel LiDAR point cloud compression method using geometry re-densification and cross-scale feature propagation to achieve state-of-the-art compression with real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-precision LiDAR scans have substantial storage and transmission overhead, and existing methods struggle with efficient context modeling due to extreme sparsity of geometric details.

Method: Two lightweight modules: 1) Geometry Re-Densification Module that re-densifies sparse geometry, extracts features at denser scale, then re-sparsifies for predictive coding; 2) Cross-scale Feature Propagation Module that uses multi-resolution occupancy cues to guide hierarchical feature propagation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art compression ratios on KITTI dataset with real-time performance (26 FPS for both encoding and decoding at 12-bit quantization).

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides compact feature representation for efficient context modeling and accelerates the coding process while maintaining high compression performance.

Abstract: LiDAR point clouds are fundamental to various applications, yet
high-precision scans incur substantial storage and transmission overhead.
Existing methods typically convert unordered points into hierarchical octree or
voxel structures for dense-to-sparse predictive coding. However, the extreme
sparsity of geometric details hinders efficient context modeling, thereby
limiting their compression performance and speed. To address this challenge, we
propose to generate compact features for efficient predictive coding. Our
framework comprises two lightweight modules. First, the Geometry
Re-Densification Module re-densifies encoded sparse geometry, extracts features
at denser scale, and then re-sparsifies the features for predictive coding.
This module avoids costly computation on highly sparse details while
maintaining a lightweight prediction head. Second, the Cross-scale Feature
Propagation Module leverages occupancy cues from multiple resolution levels to
guide hierarchical feature propagation. This design facilitates information
sharing across scales, thereby reducing redundant feature extraction and
providing enriched features for the Geometry Re-Densification Module. By
integrating these two modules, our method yields a compact feature
representation that provides efficient context modeling and accelerates the
coding process. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art
compression ratios and real-time performance, achieving 26 FPS for both
encoding and decoding at 12-bit quantization. Code is available at

TL;DR: This paper addresses 3D data scarcity by leveraging video priors for 3D generation, introducing Droplet3D-4M dataset and a generative model that produces spatially consistent and semantically plausible 3D content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome 3D data scarcity by utilizing abundant video data that contains spatial consistency priors and rich semantic information for 3D generation.

Method: Created Droplet3D-4M dataset with multi-view annotations and trained Droplet3D generative model supporting both image and dense text input.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach produces spatially consistent and semantically plausible 3D content with potential for scene-level applications.

Conclusion: Video commonsense priors significantly facilitate 3D creation, offering a solution to 3D data scarcity through video modality utilization.

Abstract: Scaling laws have validated the success and promise of large-data-trained
models in creative generation across text, image, and video domains. However,
this paradigm faces data scarcity in the 3D domain, as there is far less of it
available on the internet compared to the aforementioned modalities.
Fortunately, there exist adequate videos that inherently contain commonsense
priors, offering an alternative supervisory signal to mitigate the
generalization bottleneck caused by limited native 3D data. On the one hand,
videos capturing multiple views of an object or scene provide a spatial
consistency prior for 3D generation. On the other hand, the rich semantic
information contained within the videos enables the generated content to be
more faithful to the text prompts and semantically plausible. This paper
explores how to apply the video modality in 3D asset generation, spanning
datasets to models. We introduce Droplet3D-4M, the first large-scale video
dataset with multi-view level annotations, and train Droplet3D, a generative
model supporting both image and dense text input. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its ability to
produce spatially consistent and semantically plausible content. Moreover, in
contrast to the prevailing 3D solutions, our approach exhibits the potential
for extension to scene-level applications. This indicates that the commonsense
priors from the videos significantly facilitate 3D creation. We have

Conclusion: G^2Editor provides an effective solution for generating diverse driving scenarios with photorealistic quality and precise control, benefiting downstream data-driven tasks for autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Corner cases are crucial for training and validating autonomous driving
systems, yet collecting them from the real world is often costly and hazardous.
Editing objects within captured sensor data offers an effective alternative for
generating diverse scenarios, commonly achieved through 3D Gaussian Splatting
or image generative models. However, these approaches often suffer from limited

G^2Editor, a framework designed for photorealistic and precise object editing
in driving videos. Our method leverages a 3D Gaussian representation of the
edited object as a dense prior, injected into the denoising process to ensure
accurate pose control and spatial consistency. A scene-level 3D bounding box
layout is employed to reconstruct occluded areas of non-target objects.
Furthermore, to guide the appearance details of the edited object, we
incorporate hierarchical fine-grained features as additional conditions during
generation. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that G^2Editor
effectively supports object repositioning, insertion, and deletion within a
unified framework, outperforming existing methods in both pose controllability
and visual quality, while also benefiting downstream data-driven tasks.

TL;DR: Pathology-informed domain randomization strategy for fetal brain segmentation that simulates CCD manifestations from healthy data alone, achieving improved segmentation accuracy and biomarker estimation without requiring pathological annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate fetal brain segmentation is crucial for assessing neurodevelopment in conditions like corpus callosum dysgenesis (CCD), but the rarity of CCD severely limits annotated data, hindering deep learning model generalization.

Method: Propose a pathology-informed domain randomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a synthetic data generation pipeline, simulating diverse brain alterations from healthy data alone.

Result: Validated on 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with CCD, and 47 with other pathologies. Reduced LCC estimation error from 1.89mm to 0.80mm in healthy cases and from 10.9mm to 0.7mm in CCD cases. Achieved substantial improvements on CCD cases while maintaining performance on other cases.

Conclusion: Incorporating domain-specific anatomical priors into synthetic data pipelines can effectively mitigate data scarcity and enhance analysis of rare but clinically significant malformations, enabling more reliable shape-based analyses.

Abstract: Accurate fetal brain segmentation is crucial for extracting biomarkers and
assessing neurodevelopment, especially in conditions such as corpus callosum
dysgenesis (CCD), which can induce drastic anatomical changes. However, the
rarity of CCD severely limits annotated data, hindering the generalization of
deep learning models. To address this, we propose a pathology-informed domain
randomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a
synthetic data generation pipeline. By simulating diverse brain alterations
from healthy data alone, our approach enables robust segmentation without
requiring pathological annotations.
  We validate our method on a cohort comprising 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with
CCD, and 47 with other brain pathologies, achieving substantial improvements on
CCD cases while maintaining performance on both healthy fetuses and those with
other pathologies. From the predicted segmentations, we derive clinically
relevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, and show
their utility in distinguishing CCD subtypes. Our pathology-informed
augmentation reduces the LCC estimation error from 1.89 mm to 0.80 mm in
healthy cases and from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm in CCD cases. Beyond these
quantitative gains, our approach yields segmentations with improved topological
consistency relative to available ground truth, enabling more reliable
shape-based analyses. Overall, this work demonstrates that incorporating
domain-specific anatomical priors into synthetic data pipelines can effectively
mitigate data scarcity and enhance analysis of rare but clinically significant
malformations.

### [27] [Towards Inclusive Communication: A Unified LLM-Based Framework for Sign Language, Lip Movements, and Audio Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20476)
*Jeong Hun Yeo,Hyeongseop Rha,Sungjune Park,Junil Won,Yong Man Ro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First unified framework for sign language, lip movements, and audio processing that achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple speech recognition tasks while demonstrating lip movements enhance sign language translation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speech recognition systems are inaccessible to deaf/hard-of-hearing individuals, and visual alternatives (sign language, lip reading) have been studied in isolation without integrated frameworks.

Method: Designed a unified modality-agnostic architecture capable of processing heterogeneous inputs (sign language, lip movements, audio) and explicitly modeling lip movements as a separate modality.

Result: Achieved performance on par with or better than state-of-the-art specialized models across SLT, VSR, ASR, and AVSR tasks. Lip movement modeling significantly improved SLT performance.

Conclusion: The unified framework successfully integrates multiple modalities, demonstrates the importance of lip movements in sign language comprehension, and provides accessible communication technology for diverse user needs.

Abstract: Audio is the primary modality for human communication and has driven the
success of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies. However, such
systems remain inherently inaccessible to individuals who are deaf or hard of
hearing. Visual alternatives such as sign language and lip reading offer
effective substitutes, and recent advances in Sign Language Translation (SLT)
and Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) have improved audio-less communication.
Yet, these modalities have largely been studied in isolation, and their
integration within a unified framework remains underexplored. In this paper, we
introduce the first unified framework capable of handling diverse combinations
of sign language, lip movements, and audio for spoken-language text generation.
We focus on three main objectives: (i) designing a unified, modality-agnostic
architecture capable of effectively processing heterogeneous inputs; (ii)
exploring the underexamined synergy among modalities, particularly the role of
lip movements as non-manual cues in sign language comprehension; and (iii)
achieving performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art models
specialized for individual tasks. Building on this framework, we achieve
performance on par with or better than task-specific state-of-the-art models
across SLT, VSR, ASR, and AVSR. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that
explicitly modeling lip movements as a separate modality significantly improves
SLT performance.

*Yuan Xie,Tianshui Chen,Zheng Ge,Lionel Ni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-MTR is a reinforced multi-turn reasoning framework that iteratively selects key video segments and comprehends questions, outperforming existing methods in long-form video understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-form video understanding faces challenges with long-range temporal dependencies and multiple events. Existing methods rely on static reasoning or external VLMs, leading to complexity and sub-optimal performance due to lack of end-to-end training.

Method: Proposes a reinforced multi-turn reasoning framework that performs iterative key video segment selection and question comprehension. Uses a novel gated bi-level reward system combining trajectory-level rewards (answer correctness) and turn-level rewards (frame-query relevance) for end-to-end training.

Result: Extensive experiments on VideoMME, MLVU, and EgoSchema benchmarks demonstrate that Video-MTR outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: Video-MTR advances the state-of-the-art in long video understanding by enabling iterative reasoning and eliminating the need for external VLMs through end-to-end training.

Abstract: Long-form video understanding, characterized by long-range temporal
dependencies and multiple events, remains a challenge. Existing methods often
rely on static reasoning or external visual-language models (VLMs), which face
issues like complexity and sub-optimal performance due to the lack of
end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose Video-MTR, a reinforced
multi-turn reasoning framework designed to enable iterative key video segment
selection and question comprehension. Unlike traditional video reasoning
pipeline, which generate predictions in a single turn, Video-MTR performs
reasoning in multiple turns, selecting video segments progressively based on
the evolving understanding of previously processed segments and the current
question. This iterative process allows for a more refined and contextually
aware analysis of the video. To ensure intermediate reasoning process, we
introduce a novel gated bi-level reward system, combining trajectory-level
rewards based on answer correctness and turn-level rewards emphasizing
frame-query relevance. This system optimizes both video segment selection and
question comprehension, eliminating the need for external VLMs and allowing
end-to-end training. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like VideoMME, MLVU,
and EgoSchema demonstrate that Video-MTR outperforms existing methods in both
accuracy and efficiency, advancing the state-of-the-art in long video
understanding.

*Zixuan Hu,Dongxiao Li,Xinzhu Ma,Shixiang Tang,Xiaotong Li,Wenhan Yang,Ling-Yu Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DUO is a test-time adaptation framework that jointly minimizes semantic and geometric uncertainties in monocular 3D object detection through convex optimization and semantic-aware constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular 3D object detection reliability deteriorates under real-world domain shifts, and existing TTA methods fail to address the dual uncertainty (semantic and geometric) inherent in M3OD tasks.

Method: Proposes Dual Uncertainty Optimization (DUO) with convex optimization of focal loss, unsupervised uncertainty weighting, and semantic-aware normal field constraint to preserve geometric coherence. Uses dual-branch mechanism for complementary semantic-spatial refinement.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superiority over existing methods across various datasets and domain shift types.

Conclusion: DUO effectively addresses both semantic and geometric uncertainties in M3OD through joint optimization, achieving robust performance under domain shifts without requiring target labels.

Abstract: Accurate monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) is pivotal for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, yet its reliability deteriorates
significantly under real-world domain shifts caused by environmental or sensor
variations. To address these shifts, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods have
emerged, enabling models to adapt to target distributions during inference.
While prior TTA approaches recognize the positive correlation between low
uncertainty and high generalization ability, they fail to address the dual
uncertainty inherent to M3OD: semantic uncertainty (ambiguous class
predictions) and geometric uncertainty (unstable spatial localization). To
bridge this gap, we propose Dual Uncertainty Optimization (DUO), the first TTA
framework designed to jointly minimize both uncertainties for robust M3OD.
Through a convex optimization lens, we introduce an innovative convex structure
of the focal loss and further derive a novel unsupervised version, enabling
label-agnostic uncertainty weighting and balanced learning for high-uncertainty
objects. In parallel, we design a semantic-aware normal field constraint that
preserves geometric coherence in regions with clear semantic cues, reducing
uncertainty from the unstable 3D representation. This dual-branch mechanism
forms a complementary loop: enhanced spatial perception improves semantic
classification, and robust semantic predictions further refine spatial
understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DUO over
existing methods across various datasets and domain shift types.

TL;DR: CaddieSet: A new golf dataset with joint information and ball trajectory data from swing videos, enabling interpretable swing analysis and ball trajectory prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning studies haven't quantitatively established the relationship between golf swing posture and ball trajectory, limiting their ability to provide actionable swing improvement insights.

Method: Created CaddieSet dataset by extracting joint information from swing videos segmented into 8 phases using computer vision. Defined 15 key metrics based on expert golf knowledge to interpret swing outcomes through swing-related features.

Result: Demonstrated feasibility for predicting ball trajectories using various benchmarks. Verified that swing feedback using joint features is quantitatively consistent with established domain knowledge through interpretable models.

Conclusion: CaddieSet offers new insights for golf swing analysis in both academia and the sports industry by providing interpretable relationships between swing posture and ball trajectory.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to more studies to enhance golfers'
shot precision. However, these existing studies have not quantitatively
established the relationship between swing posture and ball trajectory,
limiting their ability to provide golfers with the necessary insights for swing
improvement. In this paper, we propose a new dataset called CaddieSet, which
includes joint information and various ball information from a single shot.
CaddieSet extracts joint information from a single swing video by segmenting it
into eight swing phases using a computer vision-based approach. Furthermore,
based on expert golf domain knowledge, we define 15 key metrics that influence
a golf swing, enabling the interpretation of swing outcomes through
swing-related features. Through experiments, we demonstrated the feasibility of
CaddieSet for predicting ball trajectories using various benchmarks. In
particular, we focus on interpretable models among several benchmarks and
verify that swing feedback using our joint features is quantitatively
consistent with established domain knowledge. This work is expected to offer
new insight into golf swing analysis for both academia and the sports industry.

*Xuanming Cao,Chengyu Tao,Yifeng Cheng,Juan Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IAENet is a 3D anomaly detection framework that combines 2D and 3D experts using importance-aware fusion to achieve state-of-the-art performance with lower false positives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D point cloud-based anomaly detection is underexplored compared to 2D methods, and lacks powerful pretrained backbones. Existing fusion strategies suffer from performance degradation when modalities perform poorly.

Method: Proposes Importance-Aware Ensemble Network (IAENet) with Importance-Aware Fusion module that dynamically assesses contribution of each source and reweights anomaly scores. Uses critical loss functions to optimize fusion.

Result: Extensive experiments on MVTec 3D-AD show IAENet achieves new state-of-the-art with markedly lower false positive rate.

Conclusion: The framework effectively bridges the gap between 2D and 3D anomaly detection, demonstrating practical value for industrial deployment through superior performance and reduced false positives.

Abstract: Surface anomaly detection is pivotal for ensuring product quality in
industrial manufacturing. While 2D image-based methods have achieved remarkable
success, 3D point cloud-based detection remains underexplored despite its
richer geometric cues. We argue that the key bottleneck is the absence of
powerful pretrained foundation backbones in 3D comparable to those in 2D. To
bridge this gap, we propose Importance-Aware Ensemble Network (IAENet), an
ensemble framework that synergizes 2D pretrained expert with 3D expert models.
However, naively fusing predictions from disparate sources is non-trivial:
existing strategies can be affected by a poorly performing modality and thus
degrade overall accuracy. To address this challenge, We introduce an novel
Importance-Aware Fusion (IAF) module that dynamically assesses the contribution
of each source and reweights their anomaly scores. Furthermore, we devise
critical loss functions that explicitly guide the optimization of IAF, enabling
it to combine the collective knowledge of the source experts but also preserve
their unique strengths, thereby enhancing the overall performance of anomaly
detection. Extensive experiments on MVTec 3D-AD demonstrate that our IAENet
achieves a new state-of-the-art with a markedly lower false positive rate,
underscoring its practical value for industrial deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DescriptiveEdit is a new image editing framework that reframes instruction-based editing as reference-image-based text-to-image generation, using a Cross-Attentive UNet to inject reference features without inversion errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in current semantic image editing methods - inversion-based approaches suffer from reconstruction errors, while instruction-based models are constrained by dataset quality and scale issues.

Method: Proposes a descriptive-prompt-based framework that treats editing as reference-image-based text-to-image generation. Uses a Cross-Attentive UNet with attention bridges to inject reference image features into the generation process without architectural changes.

Result: Experiments on Emu Edit benchmark show improved editing accuracy and consistency. The method integrates seamlessly with ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and other extensions while being more scalable.

Conclusion: DescriptiveEdit preserves generative power of well-trained text-to-image models, overcomes dataset limitations, and provides better editing performance without inversion errors or architectural modifications.

Abstract: Despite the progress in text-to-image generation, semantic image editing
remains a challenge. Inversion-based algorithms unavoidably introduce
reconstruction errors, while instruction-based models mainly suffer from
limited dataset quality and scale. To address these problems, we propose a
descriptive-prompt-based editing framework, named DescriptiveEdit. The core
idea is to re-frame `instruction-based image editing' as `reference-image-based
text-to-image generation', which preserves the generative power of well-trained
Text-to-Image models without architectural modifications or inversion.
Specifically, taking the reference image and a prompt as input, we introduce a
Cross-Attentive UNet, which newly adds attention bridges to inject reference
image features into the prompt-to-edit-image generation process. Owing to its
text-to-image nature, DescriptiveEdit overcomes limitations in instruction
dataset quality, integrates seamlessly with ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and other
extensions, and is more scalable. Experiments on the Emu Edit benchmark show it
improves editing accuracy and consistency.

*Wenting Yin,Han Sun,Xinru Meng,Ningzhong Liu,Huiyu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCFS is a novel continual test-time adaptation framework that uses dual-path feature consistency and confidence-aware learning to address error accumulation and pseudo-label noise without source data access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CTTA methods rely solely on target domain features which can cause confusion and learning biases, while pseudo-label generation suffers from quality issues and error accumulation problems.

Method: Proposes dual classifiers to disentangle semantic-related and domain-related features, maintains consistency between sub-features and whole features, and uses adaptive thresholding with confidence scores for weighted self-supervised learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and ImageNet-C datasets demonstrate consistent performance improvements in continual test-time adaptation scenarios.

Conclusion: DCFS effectively reduces pseudo-label noise and alleviates error accumulation by comprehensively capturing data features from multiple perspectives through dual-path feature consistency and confidence-aware learning.

Abstract: Continual test-time adaptation aims to continuously adapt a pre-trained model
to a stream of target domain data without accessing source data. Without access
to source domain data, the model focuses solely on the feature characteristics
of the target data. Relying exclusively on these features can lead to confusion
and introduce learning biases. Currently, many existing methods generate
pseudo-labels via model predictions. However, the quality of pseudo-labels
cannot be guaranteed and the problem of error accumulation must be solved. To
address these challenges, we propose DCFS, a novel CTTA framework that
introduces dual-path feature consistency and confidence-aware sample learning.
This framework disentangles the whole feature representation of the target data
into semantic-related feature and domain-related feature using dual classifiers
to learn distinct feature representations. By maintaining consistency between
the sub-features and the whole feature, the model can comprehensively capture
data features from multiple perspectives. Additionally, to ensure that the
whole feature information of the target domain samples is not overlooked, we
set a adaptive threshold and calculate a confidence score for each sample to
carry out loss weighted self-supervised learning, effectively reducing the
noise of pseudo-labels and alleviating the problem of error accumulation. The
efficacy of our proposed method is validated through extensive experimentation
across various datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and ImageNet-C,
demonstrating consistent performance in continual test-time adaptation
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using 3DGS models to fine-tune camera calibration through backpropagation of novel view color loss, achieving 0.4 dB PSNR improvement on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Camera calibration quality significantly impacts novel view synthesis performance, with even 1-pixel errors having substantial effects on reconstruction quality. Since ground truth calibration is unavailable for real scenes, calibration quality must be assessed through novel view synthesis results.

Method: Proposes using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models to fine-tune camera calibration by backpropagating novel view color loss with respect to camera parameters.

Result: Achieves an average improvement of 0.4 dB PSNR on the dataset used as reference by 3DGS, demonstrating significant calibration quality enhancement.

Conclusion: While the fine-tuning process may be time-consuming, it is particularly valuable for reference scene calibration (like Mip-NeRF 360) where novel view quality is paramount, making the approach suitable for critical calibration scenarios despite potential training time considerations.

Abstract: The quality of the camera calibration is of major importance for evaluating
progresses in novel view synthesis, as a 1-pixel error on the calibration has a
significant impact on the reconstruction quality. While there is no ground
truth for real scenes, the quality of the calibration is assessed by the
quality of the novel view synthesis. This paper proposes to use a 3DGS model to
fine tune calibration by backpropagation of novel view color loss with respect
to the cameras parameters. The new calibration alone brings an average
improvement of 0.4 dB PSNR on the dataset used as reference by 3DGS. The fine
tuning may be long and its suitability depends on the criticity of training
time, but for calibration of reference scenes, such as Mip-NeRF 360, the stake
of novel view quality is the most important.

*Jingyun Yang,Guoqing Zhang,Jingge Wang,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an active sequential domain adaptation framework for multi-modal medical image segmentation that dynamically selects the most informative samples to reduce annotation costs while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional active domain adaptation methods that suffer from negative transfer and lack multi-modal query strategies, while reducing the high annotation costs in medical image segmentation.

Method: Develops an active and sequential domain adaptation framework with a query strategy that prioritizes samples based on both informativeness and representativeness for multi-modal medical data.

Result: Achieves superior segmentation performance on gross tumor volume segmentation tasks, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art ADA methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively reduces annotation costs while maintaining high segmentation accuracy, demonstrating the value of dynamic multi-modal sample selection in medical image analysis.

Abstract: Accurate gross tumor volume segmentation on multi-modal medical data is
critical for radiotherapy planning in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and
glioblastoma. Recent advances in deep neural networks have brought promising
results in medical image segmentation, leading to an increasing demand for
labeled data. Since labeling medical images is time-consuming and
labor-intensive, active learning has emerged as a solution to reduce annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples to label and adapting
high-performance models with as few labeled samples as possible. Previous
active domain adaptation (ADA) methods seek to minimize sample redundancy by
selecting samples that are farthest from the source domain. However, such
one-off selection can easily cause negative transfer, and access to source
medical data is often limited. Moreover, the query strategy for multi-modal
medical data remains unexplored. In this work, we propose an active and
sequential domain adaptation framework for dynamic multi-modal sample selection
in ADA. We derive a query strategy to prioritize labeling and training on the
most valuable samples based on their informativeness and representativeness.
Empirical validation on diverse gross tumor volume segmentation tasks
demonstrates that our method achieves favorable segmentation performance,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art ADA methods. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel data-level fusion framework that integrates RGB images and LiDAR data early in the process, using vision foundation models for instance segmentation and depth estimation, with bi-directional fusion and filtering methods to improve pseudo-box quality for unsupervised 3D object detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LiDAR-based 3D object detectors require manually annotated labels which are time-consuming to obtain. Current unsupervised methods simply fuse pseudo-boxes from LiDAR and RGB at label level, overlooking the complementary nature of these data modalities and providing limited improvements.

Method: Proposes data-level fusion integrating RGB and LiDAR early. Uses vision foundation models for instance segmentation and depth estimation. Implements bi-directional fusion: real points get category labels from 2D space, 2D pixels are projected to 3D to enhance point density. Includes local radius filtering and global statistical filtering to reduce noise from depth and segmentation errors. Features data-level fusion based dynamic self-evolution strategy for iterative pseudo-box refinement.

Result: Achieves 28.4% mAP on nuScenes validation benchmark, significantly outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods in unsupervised 3D object detection.

Conclusion: The proposed data-level fusion framework effectively leverages complementary RGB and LiDAR data through early integration and sophisticated filtering techniques, demonstrating superior performance in unsupervised 3D object detection without requiring manual annotations.

Abstract: Existing LiDAR-based 3D object detectors typically rely on manually annotated
labels for training to achieve good performance. However, obtaining
high-quality 3D labels is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this
issue, recent works explore unsupervised 3D object detection by introducing RGB
images as an auxiliary modal to assist pseudo-box generation. However, these
methods simply integrate pseudo-boxes generated by LiDAR point clouds and RGB
images. Yet, such a label-level fusion strategy brings limited improvements to
the quality of pseudo-boxes, as it overlooks the complementary nature in terms
of LiDAR and RGB image data. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a
novel data-level fusion framework that integrates RGB images and LiDAR data at
an early stage. Specifically, we utilize vision foundation models for instance
segmentation and depth estimation on images and introduce a bi-directional
fusion method, where real points acquire category labels from the 2D space,
while 2D pixels are projected onto 3D to enhance real point density. To
mitigate noise from depth and segmentation estimations, we propose a local and
global filtering method, which applies local radius filtering to suppress depth
estimation errors and global statistical filtering to remove
segmentation-induced outliers. Furthermore, we propose a data-level fusion
based dynamic self-evolution strategy, which iteratively refines pseudo-boxes
under a dense representation, significantly improving localization accuracy.
Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the detector
trained by our method significantly outperforms that trained by previous
state-of-the-art methods with 28.4$\%$ mAP on the nuScenes validation
benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable rapid weight assessment via camera images when traditional BMI measurement methods are unavailable or impractical, particularly in telehealth and emergency scenarios.

Method: Deep learning-based approach using large WayBED dataset (84,963 images from 25,353 individuals) with automatic filtering through posture clustering and person detection to remove low-quality images. Model trained on 71,322 high-quality images and deployed on Android devices using CLAID framework.

Result: Achieved 7.9% MAPE on hold-out test set (lowest published value), 13% MAPE on completely unseen VisualBodyToBMI dataset (comparable to SOTA), and 8.56% MAPE after fine-tuning on VisualBodyToBMI (lowest reported).

Conclusion: The method demonstrates robust BMI estimation from smartphone images with state-of-the-art accuracy and generalization capabilities, with complete pipeline deployed on mobile devices and released as open-source.

Abstract: Estimating Body Mass Index (BMI) from camera images with machine learning
models enables rapid weight assessment when traditional methods are unavailable
or impractical, such as in telehealth or emergency scenarios. Existing computer
vision approaches have been limited to datasets of up to 14,500 images. In this
study, we present a deep learning-based BMI estimation method trained on our
WayBED dataset, a large proprietary collection of 84,963 smartphone images from
25,353 individuals. We introduce an automatic filtering method that uses
posture clustering and person detection to curate the dataset by removing
low-quality images, such as those with atypical postures or incomplete views.
This process retained 71,322 high-quality images suitable for training. We
achieve a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 7.9% on our hold-out test
set (WayBED data) using full-body images, the lowest value in the published
literature to the best of our knowledge. Further, we achieve a MAPE of 13% on
the completely unseen~(during training) VisualBodyToBMI dataset, comparable
with state-of-the-art approaches trained on it, demonstrating robust
generalization. Lastly, we fine-tune our model on VisualBodyToBMI and achieve a
MAPE of 8.56%, the lowest reported value on this dataset so far. We deploy the
full pipeline, including image filtering and BMI estimation, on Android devices
using the CLAID framework. We release our complete code for model training,
filtering, and the CLAID package for mobile deployment as open-source
contributions.

TL;DR: Comprehensive study of 7 domain adaptation techniques across 5 natural and 8 medical image datasets, showing DSAN algorithm's superior performance particularly in medical applications like COVID-19 classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand domain adaptation benefits for both natural and medical images, addressing performance bias in mainstream datasets and challenges with medical data.

Method: 557 simulation studies using 7 widely-used DA techniques for image classification across various scenarios including out-of-distribution, dynamic data streams, and limited training samples.

Result: DSAN algorithm achieved 91.2% accuracy on COVID-19 dataset using Resnet50 and showed +6.7% improvement in dynamic data stream scenario. Demonstrated remarkable explainability on medical datasets.

Conclusion: DSAN shows outstanding performance and medical applicability, contributing to understanding of DA techniques and effective model adaptation to medical data.

Abstract: Domain adaptation (DA) techniques have the potential in machine learning to
alleviate distribution differences between training and test sets by leveraging
information from source domains. In image classification, most advances in DA
have been made using natural images rather than medical data, which are harder
to work with. Moreover, even for natural images, the use of mainstream datasets
can lead to performance bias. {With the aim of better understanding the
benefits of DA for both natural and medical images, this study performs 557
simulation studies using seven widely-used DA techniques for image
classification in five natural and eight medical datasets that cover various
scenarios, such as out-of-distribution, dynamic data streams, and limited
training samples.} Our experiments yield detailed results and insightful
observations highlighting the performance and medical applicability of these
techniques. Notably, our results have shown the outstanding performance of the
Deep Subdomain Adaptation Network (DSAN) algorithm. This algorithm achieved
feasible classification accuracy (91.2\%) in the COVID-19 dataset using
Resnet50 and showed an important accuracy improvement in the dynamic data

TL;DR: CLAB method improves video object detection using contrastive learning with auxiliary branch and dynamic loss weighting, achieving state-of-the-art performance without extra computational cost during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video object detection faces challenges from image deterioration like motion blur and occlusion. Existing methods improve performance but increase computational demands. Need robust detection without additional inference cost.

Method: Contrastive Learning through Auxiliary Branch (CLAB) with contrastive loss to enhance backbone feature representation. Dynamic loss weighting strategy that prioritizes auxiliary learning early and detection task later in training.

Result: Achieves 84.0% mAP with ResNet-101 and 85.2% mAP with ResNeXt-101 on ImageNet VID dataset, setting state-of-the-art for CNN-based models without post-processing.

Conclusion: CLAB effectively improves video object detection robustness to image degradation without increasing computational load during inference, demonstrating consistent performance gains through simple yet effective approach.

Abstract: Video object detection is a challenging task because videos often suffer from
image deterioration such as motion blur, occlusion, and deformable shapes,
making it significantly more difficult than detecting objects in still images.
Prior approaches have improved video object detection performance by employing
feature aggregation and complex post-processing techniques, though at the cost
of increased computational demands. To improve robustness to image degradation
without additional computational load during inference, we introduce a
straightforward yet effective Contrastive Learning through Auxiliary Branch
(CLAB) method. First, we implement a constrastive auxiliary branch using a
contrastive loss to enhance the feature representation capability of the video
object detector's backbone. Next, we propose a dynamic loss weighting strategy
that emphasizes auxiliary feature learning early in training while gradually
prioritizing the detection task as training converges. We validate our approach
through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating
consistent performance gains. Without bells and whistles, CLAB reaches a
performance of 84.0% mAP and 85.2% mAP with ResNet-101 and ResNeXt-101,
respectively, on the ImageNet VID dataset, thus achieving state-of-the-art
performance for CNN-based models without requiring additional post-processing
methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Analysis of CLIP vision encoders under typographic attacks reveals specialized attention heads that process text in images. A training-free defense method is introduced by ablating these heads, improving robustness by up to 19.6% on typographic attacks with minimal impact on standard accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Typographic attacks exploit multi-modal systems by injecting text into images, causing targeted misclassifications, malicious content generation, and VLM jailbreaks. Understanding and defending against these attacks is crucial for safety-critical applications.

Method: Analyze CLIP vision encoders to locate specialized attention heads that extract typographic information. Introduce a training-free defense by selectively ablating these attention heads (typographic circuit) without requiring finetuning.

Result: Method improves performance by up to 19.6% on typographic ImageNet-100 variant while reducing standard ImageNet-100 accuracy by less than 1%. Competitive with state-of-the-art finetuning-based defenses. Releases family of dyslexic CLIP models as drop-in replacements.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free ablation of typographic circuits effectively defends CLIP models against typographic attacks, making them suitable for safety-critical applications where text-based manipulation risks outweigh text recognition utility.

Abstract: Typographic attacks exploit multi-modal systems by injecting text into
images, leading to targeted misclassifications, malicious content generation
and even Vision-Language Model jailbreaks. In this work, we analyze how CLIP
vision encoders behave under typographic attacks, locating specialized
attention heads in the latter half of the model's layers that causally extract
and transmit typographic information to the cls token. Building on these
insights, we introduce a method to defend CLIP models against typographic
attacks by selectively ablating a typographic circuit, consisting of attention
heads. Without requiring finetuning, our method improves performance by up to
19.6% on a typographic variant of ImageNet-100, while reducing standard
ImageNet-100 accuracy by less than 1%. Notably, our training-free approach
remains competitive with current state-of-the-art typographic defenses that
rely on finetuning. To this end, we release a family of dyslexic CLIP models
which are significantly more robust against typographic attacks. These models
serve as suitable drop-in replacements for a broad range of safety-critical
applications, where the risks of text-based manipulation outweigh the utility
of text recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional FER systems face challenges with occlusion, expression variability, and lack of interpretability. GNNs offer structured and interpretable learning by modeling relational dependencies between facial landmarks.

Method: Extract facial landmarks using 3D facial alignment, construct quotient graph via hierarchical coarsening to preserve spatial structure while reducing complexity, and use region-level embeddings for emotion recognition.

Result: Achieves 64.89% accuracy on AffectNet and 94.24% accuracy on FERG, outperforming existing baselines. Ablation studies confirm region-level embeddings from quotient graphs improve prediction performance.

Conclusion: GLaRE demonstrates that graph-based approaches with hierarchical coarsening and region-level embeddings effectively address FER challenges, providing both performance improvements and interpretability.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) is a crucial task in computer vision with
wide range of applications including human computer interaction, surveillance,
and assistive technologies. However, challenges such as occlusion, expression
variability, and lack of interpretability hinder the performance of traditional
FER systems. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful alternative by
modeling relational dependencies between facial landmarks, enabling structured
and interpretable learning. In this paper, we propose GLaRE, a novel
Graph-based Landmark Region Embedding network for emotion recognition. Facial
landmarks are extracted using 3D facial alignment, and a quotient graph is
constructed via hierarchical coarsening to preserve spatial structure while
reducing complexity. Our method achieves 64.89 percentage accuracy on AffectNet
and 94.24 percentage on FERG, outperforming several existing baselines.
Additionally, ablation studies have demonstrated that region-level embeddings
from quotient graphs have contributed to improved prediction performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastFit is a high-speed multi-reference virtual try-on framework using cacheable diffusion architecture that achieves 3.5x speedup while maintaining quality, with a new dataset DressCode-MR for complex outfit compositions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current virtual try-on methods cannot support multi-reference outfit compositions (garments and accessories) and suffer from significant inefficiency due to redundant re-computation of reference features in each denoising step.

Method: Proposes FastFit with Semi-Attention mechanism and class embeddings instead of timestep embeddings for reference items, fully decoupling reference feature encoding from denoising process. Also introduces DressCode-MR dataset with 28,179 sets of high-quality paired images across five categories.

Result: Achieves average 3.5x speedup over comparable methods while surpassing state-of-the-art methods on key fidelity metrics. Reference features are computed only once and reused across all steps with negligible parameter overhead.

Conclusion: FastFit fundamentally breaks the efficiency bottleneck in virtual try-on technology and enables practical real-world applications by supporting complex multi-reference compositions while maintaining high efficiency and quality.

Abstract: Despite its great potential, virtual try-on technology is hindered from
real-world application by two major challenges: the inability of current
methods to support multi-reference outfit compositions (including garments and
accessories), and their significant inefficiency caused by the redundant
re-computation of reference features in each denoising step. To address these
challenges, we propose FastFit, a high-speed multi-reference virtual try-on
framework based on a novel cacheable diffusion architecture. By employing a
Semi-Attention mechanism and substituting traditional timestep embeddings with
class embeddings for reference items, our model fully decouples reference
feature encoding from the denoising process with negligible parameter overhead.
This allows reference features to be computed only once and losslessly reused
across all steps, fundamentally breaking the efficiency bottleneck and
achieving an average 3.5x speedup over comparable methods. Furthermore, to
facilitate research on complex, multi-reference virtual try-on, we introduce
DressCode-MR, a new large-scale dataset. It comprises 28,179 sets of
high-quality, paired images covering five key categories (tops, bottoms,
dresses, shoes, and bags), constructed through a pipeline of expert models and
human feedback refinement. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD, DressCode,
and our DressCode-MR datasets show that FastFit surpasses state-of-the-art
methods on key fidelity metrics while offering its significant advantage in
inference efficiency.

*Yuqi Han,Songqian Zhang,Weijian Su,Ke Li,Jiayu Yang,Jinli Suo,Qiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UTA-Sign proposes an unsupervised thermal-event fusion method for traffic signage augmentation in low-light conditions, addressing thermal camera limitations with event camera complementary capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thermal cameras struggle with signage detection from similar-material objects in low-light autonomous driving scenarios, while event cameras excel in high-speed low-light environments but have non-uniform sampling.

Method: Dual-boosting mechanism that fuses thermal frames and event signals, using thermal frames for motion cues and temporal alignment of event signals, while event signals enhance thermal frames with subtle signage content.

Result: Validated on real-world datasets, showing superior traffic signage sketching quality and improved detection accuracy at the perceptual level.

Conclusion: The proposed thermal-event fusion approach effectively addresses signage blind spots in thermal imaging and leverages complementary modalities for enhanced low-light traffic signage perception.

Abstract: The thermal camera excels at perceiving outdoor environments under low-light
conditions, making it ideal for applications such as nighttime autonomous
driving and unmanned navigation. However, thermal cameras encounter challenges
when capturing signage from objects made of similar materials, which can pose
safety risks for accurately understanding semantics in autonomous driving
systems. In contrast, the neuromorphic vision camera, also known as an event
camera, detects changes in light intensity asynchronously and has proven
effective in high-speed, low-light traffic environments. Recognizing the
complementary characteristics of these two modalities, this paper proposes
UTA-Sign, an unsupervised thermal-event video augmentation for traffic signage
in low-illumination environments, targeting elements such as license plates and
roadblock indicators. To address the signage blind spots of thermal imaging and
the non-uniform sampling of event cameras, we developed a dual-boosting
mechanism that fuses thermal frames and event signals for consistent signage
representation over time. The proposed method utilizes thermal frames to
provide accurate motion cues as temporal references for aligning the uneven
event signals. At the same time, event signals contribute subtle signage
content to the raw thermal frames, enhancing the overall understanding of the
environment. The proposed method is validated on datasets collected from
real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior quality in traffic signage
sketching and improved detection accuracy at the perceptual level.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an active defense method using low-frequency perturbations to disrupt deepfake face swapping by targeting the generative process while preserving visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake detection methods are passive and focus on post-event analysis, lacking prevention capabilities. There's a need for active defense that can disrupt manipulation attempts in real-time.

Method: Combines frequency and spatial domain features using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to extract low-frequency components. Features an encoder-perturbation generator-decoder architecture that introduces artifacts through low-frequency perturbations while preserving high-frequency details.

Result: Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW datasets show significant reductions in face-swapping effectiveness, improved defense success rates, and preservation of visual quality in the output.

Conclusion: The proposed active defense method effectively disrupts deepfake generation processes through targeted low-frequency perturbations, providing a proactive defense mechanism against face-swapping attacks while maintaining visual plausibility.

Abstract: Deepfake technology, driven by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), poses
significant risks to privacy and societal security. Existing detection methods
are predominantly passive, focusing on post-event analysis without preventing
attacks. To address this, we propose an active defense method based on
low-frequency perceptual perturbations to disrupt face swapping manipulation,
reducing the performance and naturalness of generated content. Unlike prior
approaches that used low-frequency perturbations to impact classification
accuracy,our method directly targets the generative process of deepfake
techniques. We combine frequency and spatial domain features to strengthen
defenses. By introducing artifacts through low-frequency perturbations while
preserving high-frequency details, we ensure the output remains visually
plausible. Additionally, we design a complete architecture featuring an
encoder, a perturbation generator, and a decoder, leveraging discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to extract low-frequency components and generate perturbations
that disrupt facial manipulation models. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW
demonstrate significant reductions in face-swapping effectiveness, improved
defense success rates, and preservation of visual quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diverse-T2M introduces uncertainty modeling and stochastic sampling to generate diverse 3D human motions from text while maintaining semantic consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving diversity in text-to-motion generation while preserving text-motion consistency remains a significant challenge in current methods.

Method: Introduces uncertainty through noise signals as diversity carriers in transformer architecture, creates continuous text representation latent space, and integrates latent space sampler for stochastic sampling.

Result: Significantly enhances motion diversity while maintaining state-of-the-art text consistency performance on HumanML3D and KIT-ML benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses the diversity challenge in text-to-motion generation through explicit uncertainty modeling and stochastic sampling approaches.

Abstract: Generating 3D human motions from text is a challenging yet valuable task. The
key aspects of this task are ensuring text-motion consistency and achieving
generation diversity. Although recent advancements have enabled the generation
of precise and high-quality human motions from text, achieving diversity in the
generated motions remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we aim to
overcome the above challenge by designing a simple yet effective text-to-motion
generation method, \textit{i.e.}, Diverse-T2M. Our method introduces
uncertainty into the generation process, enabling the generation of highly
diverse motions while preserving the semantic consistency of the text.
Specifically, we propose a novel perspective that utilizes noise signals as
carriers of diversity information in transformer-based methods, facilitating a
explicit modeling of uncertainty. Moreover, we construct a latent space where
text is projected into a continuous representation, instead of a rigid
one-to-one mapping, and integrate a latent space sampler to introduce
stochastic sampling into the generation process, thereby enhancing the
diversity and uncertainty of the outputs. Our results on text-to-motion
generation benchmark datasets~(HumanML3D and KIT-ML) demonstrate that our
method significantly enhances diversity while maintaining state-of-the-art
performance in text consistency.

Method: Proposed optimization-based calibration method using 3D-printed phantom for accurate 3D Intravascular Ultrasound volume reconstruction. Validated with in vivo swine liver images.

Result: Achieved calibration error from 0.88 to 1.80 mm and registration error from 3.40 to 5.71 mm between 3D IVUS data and corresponding CT scan.

Conclusion: Method provides reliable and accurate calibration and volume reconstruction for registering intraoperative ultrasound with preoperative CT images, enhancing intraoperative guidance in liver surgery.

Abstract: Intraoperative ultrasound images are inherently challenging to interpret in
liver surgery due to the limited field of view and complex anatomical
structures. Bridging the gap between preoperative and intraoperative data is
crucial for effective surgical guidance. 3D IntraVascular UltraSound (IVUS)
offers a potential solution by enabling the reconstruction of the entire organ,
which facilitates registration between preoperative computed tomography (CT)
scans and intraoperative IVUS images. In this work, we propose an
optimization-based calibration method using a 3D-printed phantom for accurate
3D Intravascular Ultrasound volume reconstruction. Our approach ensures precise
alignment of tracked IVUS data with preoperative CT images, improving
intraoperative navigation. We validated our method using in vivo swine liver
images, achieving a calibration error from 0.88 to 1.80 mm and a registration
error from 3.40 to 5.71 mm between the 3D IVUS data and the corresponding CT
scan. Our method provides a reliable and accurate means of calibration and
volume reconstruction. It can be used to register intraoperative ultrasound
images with preoperative CT images in the context of liver surgery, and enhance
intraoperative guidance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited availability of MFI datasets due to proprietary concerns creates a bottleneck for training machine learning models in semiconductor defect detection, while X-ray scanning is too memory-intensive and time-consuming for large-scale applications.

Method: Physics Informed Generative Models for Magnetic Field Images (PI-GenMFI) using diffusion models with two physical constraints to generate synthetic MFI samples, specifically for power short defects, integrating specific physical information.

Result: The model shows promising results in qualitative and quantitative evaluations, outperforming state-of-the-art generative models from both VAE and diffusion methods, with domain expert validation confirming sample quality.

Conclusion: PI-GenMFI provides an effective solution to generate synthetic MFI training data, enabling efficient ML-based defect localization while overcoming data scarcity challenges in semiconductor manufacturing.

Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, defect detection and localization are
critical to ensuring product quality and yield. While X-ray imaging is a
reliable non-destructive testing method, it is memory-intensive and
time-consuming for large-scale scanning, Magnetic Field Imaging (MFI) offers a
more efficient means to localize regions of interest (ROI) for targeted X-ray
scanning. However, the limited availability of MFI datasets due to proprietary
concerns presents a significant bottleneck for training machine learning (ML)
models using MFI. To address this challenge, we consider an ML-driven approach
leveraging diffusion models with two physical constraints. We propose Physics
Informed Generative Models for Magnetic Field Images (PI-GenMFI) to generate
synthetic MFI samples by integrating specific physical information. We generate
MFI images for the most common defect types: power shorts. These synthetic
images will serve as training data for ML algorithms designed to localize
defect areas efficiently. To evaluate generated MFIs, we compare our model to
SOTA generative models from both variational autoencoder (VAE) and diffusion
methods. We present a domain expert evaluation to assess the generated samples.
In addition, we present qualitative and quantitative evaluation using various
metrics used for image generation and signal processing, showing promising
results to optimize the defect localization process.

TL;DR: A novel GAN-based data reconstruction attack framework with progressive feature optimization that significantly outperforms existing attacks on deep neural networks, especially in high-resolution and out-of-distribution scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data reconstruction attacks on split inference systems are limited to shallow models and fail to leverage semantic priors effectively, leaving privacy vulnerabilities in deeper, more complex DNNs unaddressed.

Method: Proposes a GAN-based framework with Progressive Feature Optimization (PFO) that decomposes the generator into hierarchical blocks and incrementally refines intermediate representations using L1-ball constraints to stabilize optimization and enhance semantic fidelity.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method outperforms prior attacks by a large margin, particularly in high-resolution scenarios, out-of-distribution settings, and against deeper, more complex DNN architectures.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates significantly improved reconstruction quality and generalizability across diverse datasets and model architectures, revealing greater privacy risks in split inference systems than previously recognized.

Abstract: The growing complexity of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has led to the adoption
of Split Inference (SI), a collaborative paradigm that partitions computation
between edge devices and the cloud to reduce latency and protect user privacy.
However, recent advances in Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRAs) reveal that
intermediate features exchanged in SI can be exploited to recover sensitive
input data, posing significant privacy risks. Existing DRAs are typically
effective only on shallow models and fail to fully leverage semantic priors,
limiting their reconstruction quality and generalizability across datasets and
model architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN-based DRA framework
with Progressive Feature Optimization (PFO), which decomposes the generator
into hierarchical blocks and incrementally refines intermediate representations
to enhance the semantic fidelity of reconstructed images. To stabilize the
optimization and improve image realism, we introduce an L1-ball constraint
during reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
prior attacks by a large margin, especially in high-resolution scenarios,
out-of-distribution settings, and against deeper and more complex DNNs.

Motivation: Existing methods for emotional talking head synthesis have limitations in control flexibility, motion naturalness, and expression quality, and available datasets are primarily collected in lab settings, hindering practical real-world applications.

Method: Proposes EmoCAST with two key modules: text-guided decoupled emotive module for appearance modeling, and emotive audio attention module to capture interplay between emotion and audio. Also constructs emotional dataset and uses emotion-aware sampling training strategy.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic, emotionally expressive, and audio-synchronized talking-head videos.

Conclusion: EmoCAST effectively addresses limitations of existing methods and demonstrates superior performance in emotional talking head synthesis through its innovative diffusion-based framework and training strategies.

Abstract: Emotional talking head synthesis aims to generate talking portrait videos
with vivid expressions. Existing methods still exhibit limitations in control
flexibility, motion naturalness, and expression quality. Moreover, currently
available datasets are primarily collected in lab settings, further
exacerbating these shortcomings. Consequently, these limitations substantially
hinder practical applications in real-world scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose EmoCAST, a diffusion-based framework with two key
modules for precise text-driven emotional synthesis. In appearance modeling,
emotional prompts are integrated through a text-guided decoupled emotive
module, enhancing the spatial knowledge to improve emotion comprehension. To
improve the relationship between audio and emotion, we introduce an emotive
audio attention module to capture the interplay between controlled emotion and
driving audio, generating emotion-aware features to guide more precise facial
motion synthesis. Additionally, we construct an emotional talking head dataset
with comprehensive emotive text descriptions to optimize the framework's
performance. Based on the proposed dataset, we propose an emotion-aware
sampling training strategy and a progressive functional training strategy that
further improve the model's ability to capture nuanced expressive features and
achieve accurate lip-synchronization. Overall, EmoCAST achieves
state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic, emotionally expressive,

Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality in
women, and early detection is essential for improving outcomes. Magnetic

particularly in women at high risk or with dense breast tissue, where
mammography is less effective. The ODELIA consortium organized a multi-center

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AvatarBack is a plug-and-play framework that reconstructs complete 3D Gaussian head avatars by addressing the back-head reconstruction problem using synthetic back-view generation and adaptive spatial alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Gaussian Splatting methods for head avatars rely heavily on frontal-view images, resulting in poor back-head reconstruction with geometric inconsistencies, structural blurring, and reduced realism in rear regions.

Method: Proposes two core innovations: 1) Subject-specific Generator (SSG) that synthesizes identity-consistent back-view pseudo-images from sparse frontal inputs, and 2) Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy (ASA) that uses learnable transformation matrices to resolve pose and coordinate discrepancies between synthetic views and 3D Gaussian representation.

Result: Extensive experiments on NeRSemble and K-hairstyle datasets show significant improvements in back-head reconstruction quality while preserving frontal fidelity, with consistent visual realism under diverse motions and full animatability.

Conclusion: AvatarBack successfully addresses the back-head reconstruction challenge in 3D Gaussian avatars through synthetic view generation and adaptive alignment, enabling complete and consistent avatar modeling with enhanced realism.

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have significantly boosted the
reconstruction of head avatars, enabling high-quality facial modeling by
representing an 3D avatar as a collection of 3D Gaussians. However, existing
methods predominantly rely on frontal-view images, leaving the back-head poorly
constructed. This leads to geometric inconsistencies, structural blurring, and
reduced realism in the rear regions, ultimately limiting the fidelity of
reconstructed avatars. To address this challenge, we propose AvatarBack, a
novel plug-and-play framework specifically designed to reconstruct complete and
consistent 3D Gaussian avatars by explicitly modeling the missing back-head
regions. AvatarBack integrates two core technical innovations,i.e., the
Subject-specific Generator (SSG) and the Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy
(ASA). The former leverages a generative prior to synthesize
identity-consistent, plausible back-view pseudo-images from sparse frontal
inputs, providing robust multi-view supervision. To achieve precise geometric
alignment between these synthetic views and the 3D Gaussian representation, the
later employs learnable transformation matrices optimized during training,
effectively resolving inherent pose and coordinate discrepancies. Extensive
experiments on NeRSemble and K-hairstyle datasets, evaluated using geometric,
photometric, and GPT-4o-based perceptual metrics, demonstrate that AvatarBack
significantly enhances back-head reconstruction quality while preserving
frontal fidelity. Moreover, the reconstructed avatars maintain consistent
visual realism under diverse motions and remain fully animatable.

TL;DR: Foundation models fine-tuned and integrated with traditional facial recognition networks significantly improve facial recognition in historical paintings, overcoming domain shift and artistic variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional facial recognition models struggle with paintings due to domain shift, high intra-class variation, and artistic factors like style and intent, making sitter identification subjective and challenging.

Method: Fine-tuned foundation models and integrated their embeddings with conventional facial recognition networks to handle artistic variations and domain differences.

Result: Demonstrated notable improvements over current state-of-the-art methods, showing foundation models can bridge gaps where traditional methods fail.

Conclusion: Foundation models effectively enhance facial recognition in artworks, providing a more reliable solution for identifying sitters in historical paintings.

Abstract: Identifying sitters in historical paintings is a key task for art historians,
offering insight into their lives and how they chose to be seen. However, the
process is often subjective and limited by the lack of data and stylistic
variations. Automated facial recognition is capable of handling challenging
conditions and can assist, but while traditional facial recognition models
perform well on photographs, they struggle with paintings due to domain shift
and high intra-class variation. Artistic factors such as style, skill, intent,
and influence from other works further complicate recognition. In this work, we
investigate the potential of foundation models to improve facial recognition in
artworks. By fine-tuning foundation models and integrating their embeddings
with those from conventional facial recognition networks, we demonstrate
notable improvements over current state-of-the-art methods. Our results show
that foundation models can bridge the gap where traditional methods are

*Ayan Banerjee,Fernando Vilariño,Josep Lladós*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CraftGraffiti is an end-to-end text-guided graffiti generation framework that preserves facial identity during extreme stylistic transformations using a "style-first, identity-after" approach with face-consistent self-attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preserving facial identity in graffiti art is challenging because subtle distortions to facial features can erase recognizability, undermining personal and cultural authenticity in this high-contrast, abstract medium.

Method: Uses LoRA-fine-tuned pretrained diffusion transformer for style transfer, then enforces identity fidelity through face-consistent self-attention with explicit identity embeddings. Pose customization is achieved via CLIP-guided prompt extension without keypoints.

Result: Quantitative results show competitive facial feature consistency and state-of-the-art aesthetic/human preference scores. Qualitative analysis and live deployment demonstrate real-world creative impact.

Conclusion: CraftGraffiti advances identity-respectful AI-assisted artistry by providing a principled approach to blend stylistic freedom with recognizability in creative AI applications.

Abstract: Preserving facial identity under extreme stylistic transformation remains a
major challenge in generative art. In graffiti, a high-contrast, abstract
medium, subtle distortions to the eyes, nose, or mouth can erase the subject's
recognizability, undermining both personal and cultural authenticity. We
present CraftGraffiti, an end-to-end text-guided graffiti generation framework
designed with facial feature preservation as a primary objective. Given an
input image and a style and pose descriptive prompt, CraftGraffiti first
applies graffiti style transfer via LoRA-fine-tuned pretrained diffusion
transformer, then enforces identity fidelity through a face-consistent
self-attention mechanism that augments attention layers with explicit identity
embeddings. Pose customization is achieved without keypoints, using CLIP-guided
prompt extension to enable dynamic re-posing while retaining facial coherence.
We formally justify and empirically validate the "style-first, identity-after"
paradigm, showing it reduces attribute drift compared to the reverse order.
Quantitative results demonstrate competitive facial feature consistency and
state-of-the-art aesthetic and human preference scores, while qualitative
analyses and a live deployment at the Cruilla Festival highlight the system's
real-world creative impact. CraftGraffiti advances the goal of
identity-respectful AI-assisted artistry, offering a principled approach for
blending stylistic freedom with recognizability in creative AI applications.

*Sihan Yang,Chenhang Cui,Zihao Zhao,Yiyang Zhou,Weilong Yan,Ying Wei,Huaxiu Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a self-judgment scoring method for LVLMs to reduce hallucinations and improve safety without external resources, outperforming traditional alignment methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in visual-linguistic modality alignment that cause hallucinations and safety concerns, while overcoming limitations of external dataset dependency in existing methods.

Method: Generates debiased self-judgment scores internally within the model for self-evaluation, enhancing both decoding strategies and preference tuning processes autonomously.

Result: Significantly reduces hallucinations, enhances safety, and improves overall capability compared to traditional alignment methods.

Conclusion: Offers a more effective and scalable solution for aligning Large Visual-Language Models without relying on external resources or complex post-processing.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) have opened up new opportunities for integrating
visual and linguistic modalities. However, effectively aligning these
modalities remains challenging, often leading to hallucinations--where
generated outputs are not grounded in the visual input--and raising safety
concerns across various domains. Existing alignment methods, such as
instruction tuning and preference tuning, often rely on external datasets,
human annotations, or complex post-processing, which limit scalability and
increase costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
generates the debiased self-judgment score, a self-evaluation metric created
internally by the model without relying on external resources. This enables the
model to autonomously improve alignment. Our method enhances both decoding
strategies and preference tuning processes, resulting in reduced
hallucinations, enhanced safety, and improved overall capability. Empirical
results show that our approach significantly outperforms traditional methods,
offering a more effective solution for aligning LVLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: S-HArM dataset for intent-aware classification of AI-generated images with 9,576 real-world image-text pairs labeled as Humor/Satire, Art, or Misinformation, plus synthetic data generation strategies and comparative model evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal AI efforts overlook the intent behind AI-generated images, creating a gap in understanding whether content is created for humor, art, or misinformation purposes.

Method: Created S-HArM dataset from Twitter/X and Reddit, explored three prompting strategies (image-guided, description-guided, multimodally-guided) with Stable Diffusion for synthetic data, and evaluated various approaches including modality fusion, contrastive learning, and large vision-language models.

Result: Models trained on image- and multimodally-guided synthetic data generalized better to real-world content due to preserved visual context, but overall performance remained limited.

Conclusion: Inferring intent from AI-generated content is complex and requires specialized architectures beyond current multimodal approaches, highlighting the need for more advanced intent-aware classification systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal AI have enabled progress in detecting synthetic
and out-of-context content. However, existing efforts largely overlook the
intent behind AI-generated images. To fill this gap, we introduce S-HArM, a
multimodal dataset for intent-aware classification, comprising 9,576 "in the
wild" image-text pairs from Twitter/X and Reddit, labeled as Humor/Satire, Art,
or Misinformation. Additionally, we explore three prompting strategies
(image-guided, description-guided, and multimodally-guided) to construct a
large-scale synthetic training dataset with Stable Diffusion. We conduct an
extensive comparative study including modality fusion, contrastive learning,
reconstruction networks, attention mechanisms, and large vision-language
models. Our results show that models trained on image- and multimodally-guided
data generalize better to "in the wild" content, due to preserved visual
context. However, overall performance remains limited, highlighting the
complexity of inferring intent and the need for specialized architectures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MobileCLIP2 improves upon MobileCLIP with better teacher ensembles and captioner fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot accuracy at low latencies with 2.2% ImageNet-1k improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the multi-modal reinforced training of MobileCLIP for better zero-shot performance while maintaining low latency and small model sizes suitable for mobile applications.

Method: Improved CLIP teacher ensembles trained on DFN dataset, enhanced captioner teachers fine-tuned on diverse high-quality datasets, and novel insights on temperature tuning and multi-model synthetic caption combination.

Result: MobileCLIP2 achieves SOTA ImageNet-1k zero-shot accuracy with 2.2% improvement over MobileCLIP-B, matches SigLIP-SO400M/14 accuracy while being 2x smaller, and outperforms DFN ViT-L/14 at 2.5x lower latency.

Conclusion: The enhanced multi-modal reinforced training approach successfully creates efficient, high-performance image-text models suitable for mobile deployment, with released pretrained models and scalable data generation code.

Abstract: Foundation image-text models such as CLIP with zero-shot capabilities enable
a wide array of applications. MobileCLIP is a recent family of image-text
models at 3-15ms latency and 50-150M parameters with state-of-the-art zero-shot
accuracy. The main ingredients in MobileCLIP were its low-latency and light
architectures and a novel multi-modal reinforced training that made knowledge
distillation from multiple caption-generators and CLIP teachers efficient,
scalable, and reproducible. In this paper, we improve the multi-modal
reinforced training of MobileCLIP through: 1) better CLIP teacher ensembles
trained on the DFN dataset, 2) improved captioner teachers trained on the DFN
dataset and fine-tuned on a diverse selection of high-quality image-caption
datasets. We discover new insights through ablations such as the importance of
temperature tuning in contrastive knowledge distillation, the effectiveness of
caption-generator fine-tuning for caption diversity, and the additive
improvement from combining synthetic captions generated by multiple models. We
train a new family of models called MobileCLIP2 and achieve state-of-the-art
ImageNet-1k zero-shot accuracies at low latencies. In particular, we observe
2.2% improvement in ImageNet-1k accuracy for MobileCLIP2-B compared with
MobileCLIP-B architecture. Notably, MobileCLIP2-S4 matches the zero-shot
accuracy of SigLIP-SO400M/14 on ImageNet-1k while being 2$\times$ smaller and
improves on DFN ViT-L/14 at 2.5$\times$ lower latency. We release our
pretrained models (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip) and the data
generation code (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip-dr). The data
generation code makes it easy to create new reinforced datasets with arbitrary
teachers using distributed scalable processing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dynamic neural video compression framework with variable coding routes and rate control agent that achieves precise bitrate control and superior rate-distortion performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural video compression lacks precise rate control due to inherent limitations of learning-based codecs, making variable bitrate scenarios challenging.

Method: Proposes Dynamic-Route Autoencoder with variable coding routes, Rate Control Agent for bitrate estimation and route adjustment, and Joint-Routes Optimization for collaborative training.

Result: Achieves 14.8% BD-Rate reduction and 0.47dB BD-PSNR gain over state-of-the-art methods with only 1.66% average bitrate error on HEVC and UVG datasets.

Conclusion: The method successfully achieves Rate-Distortion-Complexity Optimization for various bitrate-constrained applications through dynamic route selection and joint optimization.

Abstract: Neural Video Compression (NVC) has achieved remarkable performance in recent
years. However, precise rate control remains a challenge due to the inherent
limitations of learning-based codecs. To solve this issue, we propose a dynamic
video compression framework designed for variable bitrate scenarios. First, to
achieve variable bitrate implementation, we propose the Dynamic-Route
Autoencoder with variable coding routes, each occupying partial computational
complexity of the whole network and navigating to a distinct RD trade-off.
Second, to approach the target bitrate, the Rate Control Agent estimates the
bitrate of each route and adjusts the coding route of DRA at run time. To
encompass a broad spectrum of variable bitrates while preserving overall RD
performance, we employ the Joint-Routes Optimization strategy, achieving
collaborative training of various routes. Extensive experiments on the HEVC and
UVG datasets show that the proposed method achieves an average BD-Rate
reduction of 14.8% and BD-PSNR gain of 0.47dB over state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining an average bitrate error of 1.66%, achieving
Rate-Distortion-Complexity Optimization (RDCO) for various bitrate and
bitrate-constrained applications. Our code is available at

*Reza Akbari Movahed,Abuzar Rezaee,Arezoo Zakeri,Colin Berry,Edmond S. L. Ho,Ali Gooya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CardioMorphNet is a recurrent Bayesian deep learning framework for 3D cardiac motion estimation that uses shape-guided registration instead of intensity-based methods, achieving superior performance on UK Biobank data with lower uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cardiac motion estimation methods struggle with accuracy because they rely on intensity-based image registration similarity losses that may overlook cardiac anatomical regions.

Method: A recurrent variational autoencoder framework that models spatio-temporal dependencies over the cardiac cycle, using two posterior models for bi-ventricular segmentation and motion estimation. It recursively registers segmentation maps without intensity-based similarity loss.

Result: Superior performance in cardiac motion estimation on UK Biobank dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Also yields lower uncertainty values for estimated motion fields in cardiac regions compared to other probabilistic methods.

Conclusion: CardioMorphNet provides more accurate and confident cardiac motion estimation by focusing on anatomical regions through shape-guided registration and Bayesian modeling, enabling uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Accurate cardiac motion estimation from cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
images is vital for assessing cardiac function and detecting its abnormalities.
Existing methods often struggle to capture heart motion accurately because they
rely on intensity-based image registration similarity losses that may overlook
cardiac anatomical regions. To address this, we propose CardioMorphNet, a
recurrent Bayesian deep learning framework for 3D cardiac shape-guided
deformable registration using short-axis (SAX) CMR images. It employs a
recurrent variational autoencoder to model spatio-temporal dependencies over
the cardiac cycle and two posterior models for bi-ventricular segmentation and
motion estimation. The derived loss function from the Bayesian formulation
guides the framework to focus on anatomical regions by recursively registering
segmentation maps without using intensity-based image registration similarity
loss, while leveraging sequential SAX volumes and spatio-temporal features. The
Bayesian modelling also enables computation of uncertainty maps for the
estimated motion fields. Validated on the UK Biobank dataset by comparing
warped mask shapes with ground truth masks, CardioMorphNet demonstrates
superior performance in cardiac motion estimation, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Uncertainty assessment shows that it also yields
lower uncertainty values for estimated motion fields in the cardiac region
compared with other probabilistic-based cardiac registration methods,
indicating higher confidence in its predictions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A simple training-time method for domain-robust classification of atypical mitotic figures that uses style perturbations, attention-based feature alignment, and EMA teacher distillation to achieve strong performance across different scanners and acquisition conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Atypical mitotic figures are important histopathological markers but are challenging to identify consistently due to domain shifts from different scanners, stains, and acquisition methods.

Method: Three key components: (1) style perturbations at early/mid backbone stages for feature diversity, (2) attention-refined feature alignment across domains using weak domain labels, (3) EMA teacher distillation with temperature-scaled KL divergence for prediction stability.

Result: Achieved balanced accuracy of 0.8762, sensitivity of 0.8873, specificity of 0.8651, and ROC AUC of 0.9499 on MIDOG 2025 Task 2 preliminary leaderboard.

Conclusion: The method provides strong, balanced performance with negligible inference overhead and minimal domain metadata requirements, making it a competitive solution for domain-robust AMF classification.

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are important histopathological markers yet
remain challenging to identify consistently, particularly under domain shift
stemming from scanner, stain, and acquisition differences. We present a simple
training-time recipe for domain-robust AMF classification in MIDOG 2025 Task 2.
The approach (i) increases feature diversity via style perturbations inserted
at early and mid backbone stages, (ii) aligns attention-refined features across
sites using weak domain labels (Scanner, Origin, Species, Tumor) through an
auxiliary alignment loss, and (iii) stabilizes predictions by distilling from
an exponential moving average (EMA) teacher with temperature-scaled KL
divergence. On the organizer-run preliminary leaderboard for atypical mitosis
classification, our submission attains balanced accuracy of 0.8762, sensitivity
of 0.8873, specificity of 0.8651, and ROC AUC of 0.9499. The method incurs
negligible inference-time overhead, relies only on coarse domain metadata, and
delivers strong, balanced performance, positioning it as a competitive
submission for the MIDOG 2025 challenge.

*Yibin Wang,Zhimin Li,Yuhang Zang,Yujie Zhou,Jiazi Bu,Chunyu Wang,Qinglin Lu,Cheng Jin,Jiaqi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pref-GRPO method addresses reward hacking in T2I generation by using pairwise preference rewards instead of pointwise scoring, and introduces UniGenBench for comprehensive evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GRPO methods using pointwise reward models are susceptible to reward hacking where minimal score differences are amplified, causing unstable image generation and over-optimization for trivial gains.

Method: Pref-GRPO uses pairwise preference comparisons within groups and calculates win rate as reward signal, shifting from score maximization to preference fitting. Also introduces UniGenBench with 600 prompts across 5 themes and detailed semantic consistency evaluation using MLLM.

Result: Pref-GRPO effectively differentiates subtle image quality differences, provides stable advantages, and mitigates reward hacking. UniGenBench reveals strengths/weaknesses of T2I models and validates Pref-GRPO effectiveness.

Conclusion: Pairwise preference-based approach (Pref-GRPO) offers more stable training than pointwise methods, and comprehensive benchmarking (UniGenBench) enables better evaluation of text-to-image generation models.

Abstract: Recent advancements highlight the importance of GRPO-based reinforcement
learning methods and benchmarking in enhancing text-to-image (T2I) generation.
However, current methods using pointwise reward models (RM) for scoring
generated images are susceptible to reward hacking. We reveal that this happens
when minimal score differences between images are amplified after
normalization, creating illusory advantages that drive the model to
over-optimize for trivial gains, ultimately destabilizing the image generation
process. To address this, we propose Pref-GRPO, a pairwise preference
reward-based GRPO method that shifts the optimization objective from score
maximization to preference fitting, ensuring more stable training. In
Pref-GRPO, images are pairwise compared within each group using preference RM,
and the win rate is used as the reward signal. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PREF-GRPO differentiates subtle image quality differences,
providing more stable advantages and mitigating reward hacking. Additionally,
existing T2I benchmarks are limited by coarse evaluation criteria, hindering
comprehensive model assessment. To solve this, we introduce UniGenBench, a
unified T2I benchmark comprising 600 prompts across 5 main themes and 20
subthemes. It evaluates semantic consistency through 10 primary and 27
sub-criteria, leveraging MLLM for benchmark construction and evaluation. Our
benchmarks uncover the strengths and weaknesses of both open and closed-source
T2I models and validate the effectiveness of Pref-GRPO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for generalizable Gaussian splatting struggle with encoding discriminative, multi-view consistent features for Gaussian predictions, particularly when constructing accurate geometry from sparse input views.

Method: Proposes C3-GS framework that integrates three lightweight modules into a unified rendering pipeline with context-aware, cross-dimension, and cross-scale constraints to improve feature fusion without requiring additional supervision.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that C3-GS achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and generalization ability for novel view synthesis from sparse views.

Conclusion: The proposed C3-GS framework successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods by enhancing feature learning through multi-constraint integration, enabling photorealistic synthesis without per-scene optimization.

Abstract: Generalizable Gaussian Splatting aims to synthesize novel views for unseen
scenes without per-scene optimization. In particular, recent advancements
utilize feed-forward networks to predict per-pixel Gaussian parameters,
enabling high-quality synthesis from sparse input views. However, existing
approaches fall short in encoding discriminative, multi-view consistent
features for Gaussian predictions, which struggle to construct accurate
geometry with sparse views. To address this, we propose $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS, a
framework that enhances feature learning by incorporating context-aware,
cross-dimension, and cross-scale constraints. Our architecture integrates three
lightweight modules into a unified rendering pipeline, improving feature fusion
and enabling photorealistic synthesis without requiring additional supervision.

TL;DR: SeqVLM is a zero-shot 3D visual grounding framework that uses multi-view scene images with spatial information to localize objects from natural language descriptions without scene-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot 3DVG methods suffer from spatial-limited reasoning due to single-view localization and contextual omissions. Supervised methods require scene-specific training, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: Generates 3D instance proposals via semantic segmentation, refines through semantic filtering, uses proposal-guided multi-view projection to preserve spatial relationships, and implements dynamic scheduling for VLM processing of sequence-query prompts.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanRefer (55.6% Acc@0.25) and Nr3D (53.2% Acc@0.25) benchmarks, surpassing previous zero-shot methods by 4.0% and 5.2% respectively.

Conclusion: SeqVLM advances 3DVG toward greater generalization and real-world applicability by eliminating scene-specific training requirements while maintaining high accuracy through multi-view reasoning and spatial preservation.

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize objects in 3D scenes using
natural language descriptions. Although supervised methods achieve higher
accuracy in constrained settings, zero-shot 3DVG holds greater promise for
real-world applications since eliminating scene-specific training requirements.
However, existing zero-shot methods face challenges of spatial-limited
reasoning due to reliance on single-view localization, and contextual omissions
or detail degradation. To address these issues, we propose SeqVLM, a novel
zero-shot 3DVG framework that leverages multi-view real-world scene images with
spatial information for target object reasoning. Specifically, SeqVLM first
generates 3D instance proposals via a 3D semantic segmentation network and
refines them through semantic filtering, retaining only semantic-relevant
candidates. A proposal-guided multi-view projection strategy then projects
these candidate proposals onto real scene image sequences, preserving spatial
relationships and contextual details in the conversion process of 3D point
cloud to images. Furthermore, to mitigate VLM computational overload, we
implement a dynamic scheduling mechanism that iteratively processes
sequances-query prompts, leveraging VLM's cross-modal reasoning capabilities to
identify textually specified objects. Experiments on the ScanRefer and Nr3D
benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving Acc@0.25 scores
of 55.6% and 53.2%, surpassing previous zero-shot methods by 4.0% and 5.2%,
respectively, which advance 3DVG toward greater generalization and real-world
applicability. The code is available at https://github.com/JiawLin/SeqVLM.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP's robustness to occlusion in military environments is tested, revealing Transformer models outperform CNNs, fine-grained occlusions are more damaging, and backbone finetuning significantly improves occlusion resilience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate CLIP's zero-shot classification robustness in challenging military environments with occlusion and degraded SNR, which remains underexplored despite its potential for defense applications with limited labeled data.

Method: Used custom dataset of 18 military vehicle classes to test CLIP variants' occlusion robustness, measuring performance with Normalized Area Under the Curve (NAUC) across different occlusion percentages and comparing Transformer vs CNN architectures.

Result: Transformer-based CLIP models consistently beat CNNs; fine-grained dispersed occlusions degrade performance more than larger contiguous ones; linear-probed models show sharp performance drop at ~35% occlusion; backbone finetuning pushes this drop point beyond 60% occlusion.

Conclusion: Occlusion-specific augmentations during training are crucial, and further research is needed on patch-level sensitivity and architectural resilience for real-world CLIP deployment in military applications.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP enable zero-shot classification by
aligning images and text in a shared embedding space, offering advantages for
defense applications with scarce labeled data. However, CLIP's robustness in
challenging military environments, with partial occlusion and degraded
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), remains underexplored. We investigate CLIP
variants' robustness to occlusion using a custom dataset of 18 military vehicle
classes and evaluate using Normalized Area Under the Curve (NAUC) across
occlusion percentages. Four key insights emerge: (1) Transformer-based CLIP
models consistently outperform CNNs, (2) fine-grained, dispersed occlusions
degrade performance more than larger contiguous occlusions, (3) despite
improved accuracy, performance of linear-probed models sharply drops at around
35% occlusion, (4) by finetuning the model's backbone, this performance drop
occurs at more than 60% occlusion. These results underscore the importance of
occlusion-specific augmentations during training and the need for further
exploration into patch-level sensitivity and architectural resilience for
real-world deployment of CLIP.

Abstract: Focusing on the development of an end-to-end autonomous vehicle model with
pixel-to-pixel context awareness, this research proposes the SKGE-Swin
architecture. This architecture utilizes the Swin Transformer with a skip-stage
mechanism to broaden feature representation globally and at various network
levels. This approach enables the model to extract information from distant
pixels by leveraging the Swin Transformer's Shifted Window-based Multi-head
Self-Attention (SW-MSA) mechanism and to retain critical information from the
initial to the final stages of feature extraction, thereby enhancing its
capability to comprehend complex patterns in the vehicle's surroundings. The
model is evaluated on the CARLA platform using adversarial scenarios to
simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the
SKGE-Swin architecture achieves a superior Driving Score compared to previous
methods. Furthermore, an ablation study will be conducted to evaluate the
contribution of each architectural component, including the influence of skip
connections and the use of the Swin Transformer, in improving model
performance.

TL;DR: Survey paper advocating for revisiting abstract concept recognition in videos using modern foundation models, building on decades of community experience to avoid reinventing solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While machines excel at recognizing concrete entities in videos, humans uniquely understand abstract concepts like justice and freedom. Abstract concept recognition remains a crucial open challenge that requires multi-level semantic reasoning and contextual understanding.

Method: The paper conducts a comprehensive survey of different tasks and datasets used for abstract concept understanding in video content, analyzing decades of community research efforts and approaches.

Result: The survey reveals that researchers have periodically attempted to solve abstract concept recognition tasks using available tools over a long period, establishing valuable foundational work.

Conclusion: Recent advances in foundation models provide an ideal setting to address abstract concept understanding in videos. Drawing on decades of community experience will help tackle this grand challenge effectively without reinventing solutions in the era of multi-modal foundation models.

Abstract: The automatic understanding of video content is advancing rapidly. Empowered
by deeper neural networks and large datasets, machines are increasingly capable
of understanding what is concretely visible in video frames, whether it be
objects, actions, events, or scenes. In comparison, humans retain a unique
ability to also look beyond concrete entities and recognize abstract concepts
like justice, freedom, and togetherness. Abstract concept recognition forms a
crucial open challenge in video understanding, where reasoning on multiple
semantic levels based on contextual information is key. In this paper, we argue
that the recent advances in foundation models make for an ideal setting to
address abstract concept understanding in videos. Automated understanding of
high-level abstract concepts is imperative as it enables models to be more
aligned with human reasoning and values. In this survey, we study different
tasks and datasets used to understand abstract concepts in video content. We
observe that, periodically and over a long period, researchers have attempted
to solve these tasks, making the best use of the tools available at their
disposal. We advocate that drawing on decades of community experience will help
us shed light on this important open grand challenge and avoid ``re-inventing
the wheel'' as we start revisiting it in the era of multi-modal foundation
models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in skin lesion classification models have significantly
improved accuracy, with some models even surpassing dermatologists' diagnostic
performance. However, in medical practice, distrust in AI models remains a
challenge. Beyond high accuracy, trustworthy, explainable diagnoses are
essential. Existing explainability methods have reliability issues, with
LIME-based methods suffering from inconsistency, while CAM-based methods
failing to consider all classes. To address these limitations, we propose
Global Class Activation Probabilistic Map Evaluation, a method that analyses
all classes' activation probability maps probabilistically and at a pixel
level. By visualizing the diagnostic process in a unified manner, it helps
reduce the risk of misdiagnosis. Furthermore, the application of SafeML
enhances the detection of false diagnoses and issues warnings to doctors and
patients as needed, improving diagnostic reliability and ultimately patient
safety. We evaluated our method using the ISIC datasets with MobileNetV2 and
Vision Transformers.

### [67] [Evaluating Compositional Generalisation in VLMs and Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20783)
*Beth Pearson,Bilal Boulbarss,Michael Wray,Martha Lewis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion Classifier shows improved compositional generalization compared to CLIP in attribute binding tasks, but all vision-language models struggle with relational reasoning like left/right concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models like CLIP often fail at compositional semantics, incorrectly combining attributes and objects (e.g., labeling red cube + blue cylinder as red cylinder or blue cube). The research explores whether generative diffusion-based classifiers have better compositional generalization abilities.

Method: Assessed three models (Diffusion Classifier, CLIP, and ViLT) on binding objects with attributes and relations in zero-shot learning (ZSL) and generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) settings. Analyzed embedding similarities for relational concepts.

Result: Diffusion Classifier and ViLT performed well at concept binding tasks, but all models struggled significantly with relational GZSL tasks. CLIP embeddings showed overly similar representations for relational concepts like left and right.

Conclusion: While diffusion-based classifiers show promise for compositional generalization, relational reasoning remains a fundamental challenge for vision-language models due to inadequate representation of spatial relations.

Abstract: A fundamental aspect of the semantics of natural language is that novel
meanings can be formed from the composition of previously known parts.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in recent years,
however, there is evidence that they are unable to perform this kind of
composition. For example, given an image of a red cube and a blue cylinder, a
VLM such as CLIP is likely to incorrectly label the image as a red cylinder or
a blue cube, indicating it represents the image as a `bag-of-words' and fails
to capture compositional semantics. Diffusion models have recently gained
significant attention for their impressive generative abilities, and zero-shot
classifiers based on diffusion models have been shown to perform competitively
with CLIP in certain compositional tasks. In this work we explore whether the
generative Diffusion Classifier has improved compositional generalisation
abilities compared to discriminative models. We assess three models --
Diffusion Classifier, CLIP, and ViLT -- on their ability to bind objects with
attributes and relations in both zero-shot learning (ZSL) and generalised
zero-shot learning (GZSL) settings. Our results show that the Diffusion
Classifier and ViLT perform well at concept binding tasks, but that all models
struggle significantly with the relational GZSL task, underscoring the broader
challenges VLMs face with relational reasoning. Analysis of CLIP embeddings
suggests that the difficulty may stem from overly similar representations of
relational concepts such as left and right. Code and dataset are available at:

### [68] [Surfel-based 3D Registration with Equivariant SE(3) Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20789)
*Xueyang Kang,Hang Zhao,Kourosh Khoshelham,Patrick Vandewalle*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel surfel-based pose learning regression method for point cloud registration that uses SE(3) equivariant features to handle orientations and uncertainties, achieving robust performance against noise and aggressive rotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point cloud registration methods ignore point orientations and uncertainties, making them susceptible to noise and aggressive rotations like orthogonal transformations, requiring extensive training with transformation augmentations.

Method: Initialize surfels from Lidar point clouds using virtual perspective camera parameters, learn explicit SE(3) equivariant features (position and rotation) through SE(3) equivariant convolutional kernels, with an encoder, cross-attention mechanism, fully-connected decoder, and non-linear Huber loss.

Result: Experimental results on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate superior and robust performance on real point-cloud scans compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed surfel-based approach with SE(3) equivariant features effectively addresses orientation and uncertainty issues in point cloud registration, providing robust performance against noise and aggressive rotations without requiring extensive transformation augmentations.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is crucial for ensuring 3D alignment consistency of
multiple local point clouds in 3D reconstruction for remote sensing or digital
heritage. While various point cloud-based registration methods exist, both
non-learning and learning-based, they ignore point orientations and point
uncertainties, making the model susceptible to noisy input and aggressive
rotations of the input point cloud like orthogonal transformation; thus, it
necessitates extensive training point clouds with transformation augmentations.
To address these issues, we propose a novel surfel-based pose learning
regression approach. Our method can initialize surfels from Lidar point cloud
using virtual perspective camera parameters, and learns explicit
$\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant features, including both position and rotation
through $\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant convolutional kernels to predict relative
transformation between source and target scans. The model comprises an
equivariant convolutional encoder, a cross-attention mechanism for similarity
computation, a fully-connected decoder, and a non-linear Huber loss.
Experimental results on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate our model
superiority and robust performance on real point-cloud scans compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

*Tao Luo,Han Wu,Tong Yang,Dinggang Shen,Zhiming Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DVCTNet is a dual-view co-training network that combines global panoramic X-ray screening with detailed tooth-level inspection for superior dental caries detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dental caries detection methods suffer from suboptimal accuracy due to subtle contrast variations and diverse lesion morphology in panoramic X-rays.

Method: Uses automated tooth detection to create global (panoramic) and local (cropped tooth) views, pretrains vision foundation models on both views, and integrates them with a Gated Cross-View Attention module for feature fusion.

Result: Superior performance against state-of-the-art methods on both public dataset and newly curated high-precision dataset with double verification annotations.

Conclusion: DVCTNet demonstrates clinical applicability and provides an effective approach for accurate dental caries detection by mimicking the clinical workflow of dentists.

Abstract: Accurate dental caries detection from panoramic X-rays plays a pivotal role
in preventing lesion progression. However, current detection methods often
yield suboptimal accuracy due to subtle contrast variations and diverse lesion
morphology of dental caries. In this work, inspired by the clinical workflow
where dentists systematically combine whole-image screening with detailed
tooth-level inspection, we present DVCTNet, a novel Dual-View Co-Training
network for accurate dental caries detection. Our DVCTNet starts with employing
automated tooth detection to establish two complementary views: a global view
from panoramic X-ray images and a local view from cropped tooth images. We then
pretrain two vision foundation models separately on the two views. The
global-view foundation model serves as the detection backbone, generating
region proposals and global features, while the local-view model extracts
detailed features from corresponding cropped tooth patches matched by the
region proposals. To effectively integrate information from both views, we
introduce a Gated Cross-View Attention (GCV-Atten) module that dynamically
fuses dual-view features, enhancing the detection pipeline by integrating the
fused features back into the detection model for final caries detection. To
rigorously evaluate our DVCTNet, we test it on a public dataset and further
validate its performance on a newly curated, high-precision dental caries
detection dataset, annotated using both intra-oral images and panoramic X-rays
for double verification. Experimental results demonstrate DVCTNet's superior
performance against existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both datasets,
indicating the clinical applicability of our method. Our code and labeled
dataset are available at https://github.com/ShanghaiTech-IMPACT/DVCTNet.

### [70] [FusionCounting: Robust visible-infrared image fusion guided by crowd counting via multi-task learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20817)
*He Li,Xinyu Liu,Weihang Kong,Xingchen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FusionCounting integrates crowd counting with visible and infrared image fusion in a unified multi-task framework, using dynamic loss weighting and adversarial training to improve both fusion quality and counting accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VIF methods focus on image quality or use semantic segmentation/detection which require heavy annotations. Crowd counting provides quantitative density measurement with minimal annotation, making it suitable for dense scenes where detection struggles with occlusion.

Method: Multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes VIF and crowd counting. Uses dynamic loss weighting for task balance and adversarial training for robustness. Leverages population density information to guide fusion process.

Result: Experimental results show FusionCounting improves both image fusion quality and crowd counting performance compared to existing methods on public datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating crowd counting with VIF creates a mutually beneficial framework that enhances both tasks, particularly effective in dense crowded scenes with minimal annotation requirements.

Abstract: Most visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) methods focus primarily on
optimizing fused image quality. Recent studies have begun incorporating
downstream tasks, such as semantic segmentation and object detection, to
provide semantic guidance for VIF. However, semantic segmentation requires
extensive annotations, while object detection, despite reducing annotation
efforts compared with segmentation, faces challenges in highly crowded scenes
due to overlapping bounding boxes and occlusion. Moreover, although RGB-T crowd
counting has gained increasing attention in recent years, no studies have
integrated VIF and crowd counting into a unified framework. To address these
challenges, we propose FusionCounting, a novel multi-task learning framework
that integrates crowd counting into the VIF process. Crowd counting provides a
direct quantitative measure of population density with minimal annotation,
making it particularly suitable for dense scenes. Our framework leverages both
input images and population density information in a mutually beneficial
multi-task design. To accelerate convergence and balance tasks contributions,
we introduce a dynamic loss function weighting strategy. Furthermore, we
incorporate adversarial training to enhance the robustness of both VIF and
crowd counting, improving the model's stability and resilience to adversarial
attacks. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that
FusionCounting not only enhances image fusion quality but also achieves
superior crowd counting performance.

TL;DR: Novel pipeline for 2D surgical tool keypoint estimation using Vision Language Models fine-tuned with LoRA technique, outperforming traditional CNN/Transformer approaches with minimal training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CNN and Transformer-based approaches often suffer from overfitting in small-scale medical datasets, requiring a more generalized approach that can work effectively with limited data resources.

Method: Leverages pre-trained Vision Language Models fine-tuned using low rank adjusting (LoRA) technique. Carefully designed prompts create instruction-tuning dataset to align visual features with semantic keypoint descriptions.

Result: Experimental results show that with only two epochs of fine-tuning, the adapted VLM outperforms baseline models, demonstrating LoRA's effectiveness in low-resource scenarios.

Conclusion: This approach not only improves keypoint detection performance but also paves the way for future work in 3D surgical hands and tools pose estimation, showing promise for medical applications with limited data.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel pipeline for 2D keypoint estima- tion of surgical
tools by leveraging Vision Language Models (VLMs) fine- tuned using a low rank
adjusting (LoRA) technique. Unlike traditional Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) or Transformer-based approaches, which often suffer from overfitting in
small-scale medical datasets, our method harnesses the generalization
capabilities of pre-trained VLMs. We carefully design prompts to create an
instruction-tuning dataset and use them to align visual features with semantic
keypoint descriptions. Experimental results show that with only two epochs of
fine tuning, the adapted VLM outperforms the baseline models, demonstrating the
ef- fectiveness of LoRA in low-resource scenarios. This approach not only
improves keypoint detection performance, but also paves the way for future work

*Paritosh Parmar,Eric Peh,Basura Fernando*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A modular framework that decouples causal reasoning from answer generation in VideoQA using interpretable natural language causal chains, outperforming state-of-the-art models while improving explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VideoQA models struggle with higher-order reasoning, rely on opaque monolithic pipelines, and lack interpretability, depending on shallow heuristics rather than transparent causal inference.

Method: Two-stage architecture with Causal Chain Extractor (CCE) that generates causal chains from video-question pairs, and Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) that produces answers grounded in these chains. Uses LLMs to generate annotated causal chains from existing datasets.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art models on three large-scale benchmarks, with substantial gains in explainability, user trust, and generalization. CCE serves as reusable causal reasoning engine.

Conclusion: The proposed modular framework with explicit causal chain representations enables transparent and logically coherent inference, addressing limitations of black-box approaches while improving performance and interpretability in VideoQA.

Abstract: Existing Causal-Why Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models often struggle
with higher-order reasoning, relying on opaque, monolithic pipelines that
entangle video understanding, causal inference, and answer generation. These
black-box approaches offer limited interpretability and tend to depend on
shallow heuristics. We propose a novel, modular framework that explicitly
decouples causal reasoning from answer generation, introducing natural language
causal chains as interpretable intermediate representations. Inspired by human
cognitive models, these structured cause-effect sequences bridge low-level
video content with high-level causal reasoning, enabling transparent and
logically coherent inference. Our two-stage architecture comprises a Causal
Chain Extractor (CCE) that generates causal chains from video-question pairs,
and a Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) that produces answers grounded in
these chains. To address the lack of annotated reasoning traces, we introduce a
scalable method for generating high-quality causal chains from existing
datasets using large language models. We also propose CauCo, a new evaluation
metric for causality-oriented captioning. Experiments on three large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art
models, but also yields substantial gains in explainability, user trust, and
generalization -- positioning the CCE as a reusable causal reasoning engine
across diverse domains. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PointDGRWKV is the first RWKV-based framework for Domain Generalization in Point Cloud Classification, addressing spatial distortion and attention drift issues through adaptive geometric token shift and cross-domain key distribution alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior DG PCC methods using convolutional networks, Transformers or Mamba architectures suffer from limited receptive fields, high computational cost, or insufficient long-range dependency modeling. RWKV offers linear complexity and global receptive fields but faces challenges when directly applied to unstructured point clouds.

Method: Proposes PointDGRWKV with two key modules: 1) Adaptive Geometric Token Shift to model local neighborhood structures and improve geometric context awareness, 2) Cross-Domain key feature Distribution Alignment to mitigate attention drift by aligning key feature distributions across domains.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PointDGRWKV achieves state-of-the-art performance on Domain Generalization for Point Cloud Classification.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully enhances spatial modeling and cross-domain robustness while maintaining RWKV's linear efficiency, making it an effective solution for DG PCC tasks.

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) has been recently explored to enhance the
generalizability of Point Cloud Classification (PCC) models toward unseen
domains. Prior works are based on convolutional networks, Transformer or Mamba
architectures, either suffering from limited receptive fields or high
computational cost, or insufficient long-range dependency modeling. RWKV, as an
emerging architecture, possesses superior linear complexity, global receptive
fields, and long-range dependency. In this paper, we present the first work
that studies the generalizability of RWKV models in DG PCC. We find that
directly applying RWKV to DG PCC encounters two significant challenges: RWKV's
fixed direction token shift methods, like Q-Shift, introduce spatial
distortions when applied to unstructured point clouds, weakening local
geometric modeling and reducing robustness. In addition, the Bi-WKV attention
in RWKV amplifies slight cross-domain differences in key distributions through
exponential weighting, leading to attention shifts and degraded generalization.
To this end, we propose PointDGRWKV, the first RWKV-based framework tailored
for DG PCC. It introduces two key modules to enhance spatial modeling and
cross-domain robustness, while maintaining RWKV's linear efficiency. In
particular, we present Adaptive Geometric Token Shift to model local
neighborhood structures to improve geometric context awareness. In addition,
Cross-Domain key feature Distribution Alignment is designed to mitigate
attention drift by aligning key feature distributions across domains. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PointDGRWKV achieves
state-of-the-art performance on DG PCC.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PathMR is a cell-level multimodal visual reasoning framework that generates diagnostic explanations and predicts cell distribution patterns from pathological images, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in text quality, segmentation accuracy, and cross-modal alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning diagnostic tools lack transparency and traceable rationale, limiting clinical adoption. There's a need for AI systems that provide both pixel-level segmentation and semantically aligned textual explanations for dependable pathology assistance.

Method: Proposed PathMR framework that takes pathological images and textual queries, then generates expert-level diagnostic explanations while simultaneously predicting cell distribution patterns at the cell level.

Result: Extensive experiments on PathGen and GADVR datasets show PathMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art visual reasoning methods in text generation quality, segmentation accuracy, and cross-modal alignment.

Conclusion: PathMR demonstrates strong potential for improving interpretability in AI-driven pathological diagnosis by providing transparent insights through localized lesion regions and expert-style diagnostic narratives.

Abstract: Deep learning based automated pathological diagnosis has markedly improved
diagnostic efficiency and reduced variability between observers, yet its
clinical adoption remains limited by opaque model decisions and a lack of
traceable rationale. To address this, recent multimodal visual reasoning
architectures provide a unified framework that generates segmentation masks at
the pixel level alongside semantically aligned textual explanations. By
localizing lesion regions and producing expert style diagnostic narratives,
these models deliver the transparent and interpretable insights necessary for
dependable AI assisted pathology. Building on these advancements, we propose
PathMR, a cell-level Multimodal visual Reasoning framework for Pathological
image analysis. Given a pathological image and a textual query, PathMR
generates expert-level diagnostic explanations while simultaneously predicting
cell distribution patterns. To benchmark its performance, we evaluated our
approach on the publicly available PathGen dataset as well as on our newly
developed GADVR dataset. Extensive experiments on these two datasets
demonstrate that PathMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art visual
reasoning methods in text generation quality, segmentation accuracy, and
cross-modal alignment. These results highlight the potential of PathMR for
improving interpretability in AI-driven pathological diagnosis. The code will

TL;DR: Deep learning framework using autofluorescence and SHG imaging achieves over 90% accuracy in early pancreatic cancer detection, outperforming manual methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PDAC has low survival rates due to late detection, requiring improved early diagnostic methods through automated analysis of dual-modality imaging.

Method: Developed specialized neural network using 40 patient samples, evaluated 6 architectures (CNNs vs ViTs), used modified ResNet with frozen pre-trained layers and class-weighted training to address dataset limitations.

Result: Achieved over 90% accuracy in distinguishing normal, fibrotic, and cancerous tissue, significantly improving upon current manual analysis methods.

Conclusion: Establishes robust automated PDAC detection pipeline for clinical use, provides foundation for expanding to other cancers, and offers insights for deep learning on limited medical imaging datasets.

Abstract: Pacreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal forms
of cancer, with a five-year survival rate below 10% primarily due to late
detection. This research develops and validates a deep learning framework for
early PDAC detection through analysis of dual-modality imaging:
autofluorescence and second harmonic generation (SHG). We analyzed 40 unique
patient samples to create a specialized neural network capable of
distinguishing between normal, fibrotic, and cancerous tissue. Our methodology
evaluated six distinct deep learning architectures, comparing traditional
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with modern Vision Transformers (ViTs).
Through systematic experimentation, we identified and overcome significant
challenges in medical image analysis, including limited dataset size and class
imbalance. The final optimized framework, based on a modified ResNet
architecture with frozen pre-trained layers and class-weighted training,
achieved over 90% accuracy in cancer detection. This represents a significant
improvement over current manual analysis methods an demonstrates potential for
clinical deployment. This work establishes a robust pipeline for automated PDAC
detection that can augment pathologists' capabilities while providing a
foundation for future expansion to other cancer types. The developed
methodology also offers valuable insights for applying deep learning to
limited-size medical imaging datasets, a common challenge in clinical
applications.

TL;DR: This thesis develops counterfactual frameworks for explaining, auditing, and mitigating bias in vision classifiers and generative models through systematic attribute variation and causal analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address interpretability and fairness in AI by using counterfactual reasoning to uncover spurious correlations, probe causal dependencies, and build more robust systems that avoid biased behaviors.

Method: Develops multiple frameworks: CAVLI integrates attribution with concept-level analysis; ASAC uses adversarial counterfactuals with curriculum learning; TIBET provides scalable bias evaluation; BiasConnect builds causal graphs; InterMit offers training-free mitigation via causal sensitivity scores.

Result: The methods successfully quantify concept dependencies in vision classifiers, improve fairness and accuracy while avoiding stereotypes, enable causal auditing of generative models, and provide scalable solutions for intersectional bias diagnosis and mitigation.

Conclusion: Counterfactuals serve as a unifying framework for interpretability, fairness, and causality across both discriminative and generative models, establishing principled methods for socially responsible bias evaluation and mitigation.

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning -- the practice of asking ``what if'' by varying
inputs and observing changes in model behavior -- has become central to
interpretable and fair AI. This thesis develops frameworks that use
counterfactuals to explain, audit, and mitigate bias in vision classifiers and
generative models. By systematically altering semantically meaningful
attributes while holding others fixed, these methods uncover spurious
correlations, probe causal dependencies, and help build more robust systems.
  The first part addresses vision classifiers. CAVLI integrates attribution
(LIME) with concept-level analysis (TCAV) to quantify how strongly decisions
rely on human-interpretable concepts. With localized heatmaps and a Concept
Dependency Score, CAVLI shows when models depend on irrelevant cues like
backgrounds. Extending this, ASAC introduces adversarial counterfactuals that
perturb protected attributes while preserving semantics. Through curriculum
learning, ASAC fine-tunes biased models for improved fairness and accuracy
while avoiding stereotype-laden artifacts.
  The second part targets generative Text-to-Image (TTI) models. TIBET provides
a scalable pipeline for evaluating prompt-sensitive biases by varying
identity-related terms, enabling causal auditing of how race, gender, and age
affect image generation. To capture interactions, BiasConnect builds causal
graphs diagnosing intersectional biases. Finally, InterMit offers a modular,
training-free algorithm that mitigates intersectional bias via causal
sensitivity scores and user-defined fairness goals.
  Together, these contributions show counterfactuals as a unifying lens for
interpretability, fairness, and causality in both discriminative and generative
models, establishing principled, scalable methods for socially responsible bias
evaluation and mitigation.

Motivation: Effectively transferring learned representations from large-scale natural image foundation models to precise clinical medical image segmentation applications remains challenging.

Method: Uses frozen DINOv3 backbone encoder with specialized adapter to fuse semantic features with spatial details, plus fidelity-aware projection module (FAPM) to preserve feature quality during dimensionality reduction for the decoder.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on seven diverse medical image segmentation datasets, consistently outperforming previous methods across various imaging modalities with scalable accuracy improvements up to 7-billion-parameter backbone.

Conclusion: Leveraging dense-pretrained features from general-purpose foundation models provides a highly effective and parameter-efficient approach to advance medical image segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on large-scale natural image datasets offer a
powerful paradigm for medical image segmentation. However, effectively
transferring their learned representations for precise clinical applications
remains a challenge. In this work, we propose Dino U-Net, a novel
encoder-decoder architecture designed to exploit the high-fidelity dense
features of the DINOv3 vision foundation model. Our architecture introduces an
encoder built upon a frozen DINOv3 backbone, which employs a specialized
adapter to fuse the model's rich semantic features with low-level spatial
details. To preserve the quality of these representations during dimensionality
reduction, we design a new fidelity-aware projection module (FAPM) that
effectively refines and projects the features for the decoder. We conducted
extensive experiments on seven diverse public medical image segmentation
datasets. Our results show that Dino U-Net achieves state-of-the-art
performance, consistently outperforming previous methods across various imaging
modalities. Our framework proves to be highly scalable, with segmentation
accuracy consistently improving as the backbone model size increases up to the
7-billion-parameter variant. The findings demonstrate that leveraging the
superior, dense-pretrained features from a general-purpose foundation model
provides a highly effective and parameter-efficient approach to advance the
accuracy of medical image segmentation. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Differentiating atypical mitotic figures from normal ones is challenging due to time-consuming and subjective manual annotation in tumor grading.

Method: Trained an ensemble of ConvNeXtBase models using AUCMEDI framework and extended it with a rule-based refinement module.

Result: Achieved 84.02% balanced accuracy on MIDOG25 preliminary test set; rule-based refinement increased specificity but reduced sensitivity and overall performance.

Conclusion: Deep ensembles perform well for atypical mitotic figure classification, but rule-based refinement requires further research despite improving specific metrics.

Abstract: Mitotic figures (MFs) are relevant biomarkers in tumor grading.
Differentiating atypical MFs (AMFs) from normal MFs (NMFs) remains difficult,
as manual annotation is time-consuming and subjective. In this work an ensemble
of ConvNeXtBase models was trained with AUCMEDI and extend with a rule-based
refinement (RBR) module. On the MIDOG25 preliminary test set, the ensemble
achieved a balanced accuracy of 84.02%. While the RBR increased specificity, it
reduced sensitivity and overall performance. The results show that deep
ensembles perform well for AMF classification. RBR can increase specific
metrics but requires further research.

Abstract: In the era of Industry 5.0, monitoring human activity is essential for
ensuring both ergonomic safety and overall well-being. While multi-camera
centralized setups improve pose estimation accuracy, they often suffer from
high computational costs and bandwidth requirements, limiting scalability and
real-time applicability. Distributing processing across edge devices can reduce
network bandwidth and computational load. On the other hand, the constrained
resources of edge devices lead to accuracy degradation, and the distribution of
computation leads to temporal and spatial inconsistencies. We address this
challenge by proposing COMETH (Convex Optimization for Multiview Estimation and
Tracking of Humans), a lightweight algorithm for real-time multi-view human
pose fusion that relies on three concepts: it integrates kinematic and
biomechanical constraints to increase the joint positioning accuracy; it
employs convex optimization-based inverse kinematics for spatial fusion; and it
implements a state observer to improve temporal consistency. We evaluate COMETH
on both public and industrial datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in localization, detection, and tracking accuracy. The proposed fusion
pipeline enables accurate and scalable human motion tracking, making it
well-suited for industrial and safety-critical applications. The code is
publicly available at https://github.com/PARCO-LAB/COMETH.

TL;DR: Novel methods to address image manipulation localization data scarcity using web data, featuring automatic pixel-level annotation (CAAAv2), quality filtering (QES), large dataset creation (MIMLv2), and Web-IML model achieving 31% performance gain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate localization of manipulated image regions is challenging due to high data acquisition costs and lack of high-quality annotated datasets, posing risks to social security.

Method: Leverage web data with CAAAv2 for automatic pixel-level annotation, QES metric for quality filtering, Object Jitter for artifact generation, and develop Web-IML model for web-scale supervision.

Result: Created MIMLv2 dataset (246,212 images, 120x larger than IMD20), Web-IML achieved 31% performance gain and surpassed previous SOTA TruFor by 24.1 average IoU points.

Conclusion: The approach effectively mitigates data scarcity, significantly improves manipulation localization performance on real-world benchmarks, and provides publicly available dataset and code.

Abstract: Images manipulated using image editing tools can mislead viewers and pose
significant risks to social security. However, accurately localizing the
manipulated regions within an image remains a challenging problem. One of the
main barriers in this area is the high cost of data acquisition and the severe
lack of high-quality annotated datasets. To address this challenge, we
introduce novel methods that mitigate data scarcity by leveraging readily
available web data. We utilize a large collection of manually forged images
from the web, as well as automatically generated annotations derived from a
simpler auxiliary task, constrained image manipulation localization.
Specifically, we introduce a new paradigm CAAAv2, which automatically and
accurately annotates manipulated regions at the pixel level. To further improve
annotation quality, we propose a novel metric, QES, which filters out
unreliable annotations. Through CAAA v2 and QES, we construct MIMLv2, a
large-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset containing 246,212 manually
forged images with pixel-level mask annotations. This is over 120x larger than
existing handcrafted datasets like IMD20. Additionally, we introduce Object
Jitter, a technique that further enhances model training by generating
high-quality manipulation artifacts. Building on these advances, we develop a
new model, Web-IML, designed to effectively leverage web-scale supervision for
the image manipulation localization task. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach substantially alleviates the data scarcity problem and
significantly improves the performance of various models on multiple real-world
forgery benchmarks. With the proposed web supervision, Web-IML achieves a
striking performance gain of 31% and surpasses previous SOTA TruFor by 24.1
average IoU points. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at

TL;DR: ExpertSim is a deep learning approach using Mixture-of-Generative-Experts to simulate Zero Degree Calorimeter responses, providing more accurate and faster simulations than traditional Monte Carlo methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Monte Carlo simulations for particle detector responses at CERN are computationally expensive and strain computational resources, creating a need for more efficient methods.

Method: Uses a Mixture-of-Generative-Experts architecture where each expert specializes in simulating different subsets of data, allowing for more precise generation of calorimeter responses.

Result: ExpertSim improves simulation accuracy and provides significant speedup compared to traditional Monte Carlo methods, enabling more efficient detector simulations.

Conclusion: The approach offers a promising solution for high-efficiency detector simulations in particle physics experiments at CERN, with code made publicly available.

Abstract: Simulating detector responses is a crucial part of understanding the inner
workings of particle collisions in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Such
simulations are currently performed with statistical Monte Carlo methods, which
are computationally expensive and put a significant strain on CERN's
computational grid. Therefore, recent proposals advocate for generative machine
learning methods to enable more efficient simulations. However, the
distribution of the data varies significantly across the simulations, which is
hard to capture with out-of-the-box methods. In this study, we present
ExpertSim - a deep learning simulation approach tailored for the Zero Degree
Calorimeter in the ALICE experiment. Our method utilizes a
Mixture-of-Generative-Experts architecture, where each expert specializes in
simulating a different subset of the data. This allows for a more precise and
efficient generation process, as each expert focuses on a specific aspect of
the calorimeter response. ExpertSim not only improves accuracy, but also
provides a significant speedup compared to the traditional Monte-Carlo methods,
offering a promising solution for high-efficiency detector simulations in

### [86] [POSE: Phased One-Step Adversarial Equilibrium for Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21019)
*Jiaxiang Cheng,Bing Ma,Xuhua Ren,Hongyi Jin,Kai Yu,Peng Zhang,Wenyue Li,Yuan Zhou,Tianxiang Zheng,Qinglin Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: POSE is a novel distillation framework that enables single-step video generation from large-scale diffusion models, achieving 100x speedup while maintaining video quality through phased stability priming and adversarial equilibrium training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video acceleration methods fail to model temporal coherence and cannot provide single-step distillation for large-scale video models, creating bottlenecks in sampling efficiency for long video sequences.

Method: POSE uses a two-phase process: (1) stability priming to warm-up and stabilize adversarial distillation across noise regimes, and (2) unified adversarial equilibrium to promote stable single-step training towards Nash equilibrium in Gaussian noise space. For conditional generation, it adds conditional adversarial consistency.

Result: POSE outperforms other methods by average 7.15% on VBench-I2V metrics, reduces latency from 1000 seconds to 10 seconds (100x speedup), while maintaining competitive performance in semantic alignment, temporal coherence and frame quality.

Conclusion: The proposed POSE framework successfully bridges the gap in video acceleration by enabling efficient single-step generation from large-scale video diffusion models while preserving video quality through innovative distillation techniques.

Abstract: The field of video diffusion generation faces critical bottlenecks in
sampling efficiency, especially for large-scale models and long sequences.
Existing video acceleration methods adopt image-based techniques but suffer
from fundamental limitations: they neither model the temporal coherence of
video frames nor provide single-step distillation for large-scale video models.
To bridge this gap, we propose POSE (Phased One-Step Equilibrium), a
distillation framework that reduces the sampling steps of large-scale video
diffusion models, enabling the generation of high-quality videos in a single
step. POSE employs a carefully designed two-phase process to distill video
models:(i) stability priming: a warm-up mechanism to stabilize adversarial
distillation that adapts the high-quality trajectory of the one-step generator
from high to low signal-to-noise ratio regimes, optimizing the video quality of
single-step mappings near the endpoints of flow trajectories. (ii) unified
adversarial equilibrium: a flexible self-adversarial distillation mechanism
that promotes stable single-step adversarial training towards a Nash
equilibrium within the Gaussian noise space, generating realistic single-step
videos close to real videos. For conditional video generation, we propose (iii)
conditional adversarial consistency, a method to improve both semantic
consistency and frame consistency between conditional frames and generated
frames. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that POSE outperforms other
acceleration methods on VBench-I2V by average 7.15% in semantic alignment,
temporal conference and frame quality, reducing the latency of the pre-trained
model by 100$\times$, from 1000 seconds to 10 seconds, while maintaining
competitive performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models are computationally expensive, and prior work focused on per-inference optimization rather than reducing redundancy across correlated prompts.

Method: Leverages the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion models by clustering prompts based on semantic similarity and sharing computation in early denoising steps where shared structures are captured. Uses UnClip's text-to-image prior to enhance diffusion step allocation.

Result: Significantly reduces compute cost while improving image quality for models trained with image embeddings. Method integrates with existing pipelines and scales with prompt sets.

Conclusion: Provides an efficient approach that reduces both environmental and financial burden of large-scale text-to-image generation by exploiting semantic similarities between prompts.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models enable high-quality image generation but are
computationally expensive. While prior work optimizes per-inference efficiency,
we explore an orthogonal approach: reducing redundancy across correlated
prompts. Our method leverages the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion models,
where early denoising steps capture shared structures among similar prompts. We
propose a training-free approach that clusters prompts based on semantic
similarity and shares computation in early diffusion steps. Experiments show
that for models trained conditioned on image embeddings, our approach
significantly reduces compute cost while improving image quality. By leveraging
UnClip's text-to-image prior, we enhance diffusion step allocation for greater
efficiency. Our method seamlessly integrates with existing pipelines, scales
with prompt sets, and reduces the environmental and financial burden of

Result: Preliminary experiments on MIDOG++ dataset indicate large room for improvement for the proposed method. The approach has been submitted to MIDOG challenge track 1.

Conclusion: The Mamba-based approach shows potential for mitosis detection under domain shift but requires further development and optimization based on initial results.

Abstract: Mitosis detection in histopathology images plays a key role in tumor
assessment. Although machine learning algorithms could be exploited for aiding
physicians in accurately performing such a task, these algorithms suffer from

out the addressed task, as well as stain augmentation operations for further
improving model robustness against domain shift. Our approach has been

Motivation: Machine learning models for recognizing atypical mitotic figures suffer from performance drops under domain shift, making them unreliable for assessing tumor aggressiveness in histopathology images across different domains.

Method: Proposed a multi-task learning approach that exploits auxiliary tasks correlated to the main classification task. This helps the model focus only on the classification object while ignoring domain-varying background elements in the images.

Result: The approach shows promising performance in preliminary evaluation on three distinct datasets: MIDOG 2025 Atypical Training Set, Ami-Br dataset, and the preliminary test set of the MIDOG25 challenge.

Conclusion: Multi-task learning with auxiliary tasks is an effective strategy for improving domain generalization in atypical mitosis detection, helping models maintain performance across different histopathology image domains.

Abstract: Recognizing atypical mitotic figures in histopathology images allows
physicians to correctly assess tumor aggressiveness. Although machine learning

TL;DR: FW-GAN is a one-shot handwriting synthesis framework that uses frequency-aware components and Wave-MLP to generate realistic, style-consistent handwriting from a single example, addressing limitations of conventional methods in capturing long-range dependencies and frequency information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handwriting recognition systems suffer from scarce labeled data, and current synthesis methods struggle with long-range dependencies and ignore crucial frequency information needed for capturing fine-grained stylistic details.

Method: Proposes FW-GAN with phase-aware Wave-MLP generator, frequency-guided discriminator, and novel Frequency Distribution Loss to align frequency characteristics between synthetic and real handwriting.

Result: Experiments on Vietnamese and English datasets show FW-GAN generates high-quality, style-consistent handwriting that effectively augments data for low-resource handwriting recognition pipelines.

Conclusion: FW-GAN provides a valuable tool for handwriting data augmentation, successfully addressing frequency modeling challenges and generating realistic synthetic samples from minimal input.

Abstract: Labeled handwriting data is often scarce, limiting the effectiveness of
recognition systems that require diverse, style-consistent training samples.
Handwriting synthesis offers a promising solution by generating artificial data
to augment training. However, current methods face two major limitations.
First, most are built on conventional convolutional architectures, which
struggle to model long-range dependencies and complex stroke patterns. Second,
they largely ignore the crucial role of frequency information, which is
essential for capturing fine-grained stylistic and structural details in
handwriting. To address these challenges, we propose FW-GAN, a one-shot
handwriting synthesis framework that generates realistic, writer-consistent
text from a single example. Our generator integrates a phase-aware Wave-MLP to
better capture spatial relationships while preserving subtle stylistic cues. We
further introduce a frequency-guided discriminator that leverages
high-frequency components to enhance the authenticity detection of generated
samples. Additionally, we introduce a novel Frequency Distribution Loss that
aligns the frequency characteristics of synthetic and real handwriting, thereby
enhancing visual fidelity. Experiments on Vietnamese and English handwriting
datasets demonstrate that FW-GAN generates high-quality, style-consistent
handwriting, making it a valuable tool for augmenting data in low-resource
handwriting recognition (HTR) pipelines. Official implementation is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMG-Vid is a training-free visual token pruning framework that reduces computational overhead in Video LLMs by maximizing marginal gains at segment and token levels, achieving 75% token reduction with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video LLMs face computational challenges due to excessive visual tokens in real-world applications. Current pruning methods ignore dynamic characteristics and temporal dependencies of video frames.

Method: Divides video into segments based on frame similarity, dynamically allocates token budget per segment, and uses temporal-guided DPC algorithm to model inter-frame uniqueness and intra-frame diversity for token pruning.

Result: Maintains over 99.5% of original performance while reducing 75% visual tokens and accelerating prefilling stage by 3.9x on LLaVA-OneVision-7B.

Conclusion: MMG-Vid effectively maximizes limited token budget utilization, significantly improving efficiency while preserving strong video understanding performance without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) excel in video understanding, but their
excessive visual tokens pose a significant computational challenge for
real-world applications. Current methods aim to enhance inference efficiency by
visual token pruning. However, they do not consider the dynamic characteristics
and temporal dependencies of video frames, as they perceive video understanding
as a multi-frame task. To address these challenges, we propose MMG-Vid, a novel
training-free visual token pruning framework that removes redundancy by
Maximizing Marginal Gains at both segment-level and token-level. Specifically,
we first divide the video into segments based on frame similarity, and then
dynamically allocate the token budget for each segment to maximize the marginal
gain of each segment. Subsequently, we propose a temporal-guided DPC algorithm
that jointly models inter-frame uniqueness and intra-frame diversity, thereby
maximizing the marginal gain of each token. By combining both stages, MMG-Vid
can maximize the utilization of the limited token budget, significantly
improving efficiency while maintaining strong performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MMG-Vid can maintain over 99.5% of the original
performance, while effectively reducing 75% visual tokens and accelerating the
prefilling stage by 3.9x on LLaVA-OneVision-7B. Code will be released soon.

Motivation: Existing VLA models require extensive post-training with high computational overhead, limiting scalability and deployment. The authors aim to create a more efficient framework inspired by human multimodal coordination.

Method: 3-stage progressive architecture: 1) EFA-Routing for instruction-aware visual token aggregation, 2) LFP-Routing for token-level sparsity by pruning irrelevant tokens, 3) V-L-A Coupled Attention for accurate action generation with compressed inputs.

Result: Achieves 97.4% success rate on LIBERO benchmark and 70.0% on real-world robotic tasks, while reducing training costs by 2.5x and inference latency by 2.8x compared to OpenVLA.

Conclusion: CogVLA demonstrates that cognition-aligned design with instruction-driven routing and sparsification can significantly improve both efficiency and performance in VLA models, making them more scalable and deployable.

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models built on pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) require extensive post-training, resulting in
high computational overhead that limits scalability and deployment.We propose
CogVLA, a Cognition-Aligned Vision-Language-Action framework that leverages
instruction-driven routing and sparsification to improve both efficiency and
performance. CogVLA draws inspiration from human multimodal coordination and
introduces a 3-stage progressive architecture. 1) Encoder-FiLM based
Aggregation Routing (EFA-Routing) injects instruction information into the
vision encoder to selectively aggregate and compress dual-stream visual tokens,
forming a instruction-aware latent representation. 2) Building upon this
compact visual encoding, LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing)
introduces action intent into the language model by pruning
instruction-irrelevant visually grounded tokens, thereby achieving token-level
sparsity. 3) To ensure that compressed perception inputs can still support
accurate and coherent action generation, we introduce V-L-A Coupled Attention
(CAtten), which combines causal vision-language attention with bidirectional
action parallel decoding. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and
real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that CogVLA achieves state-of-the-art
performance with success rates of 97.4% and 70.0%, respectively, while reducing
training costs by 2.5-fold and decreasing inference latency by 2.8-fold

Method: Introduces HydraFake dataset with diversified deepfake techniques and in-the-wild forgeries, plus Veritas - a multi-modal LLM detector with pattern-aware reasoning (planning and self-reflection) and two-stage training pipeline.

Result: Previous detectors show good cross-model generalization but fail on unseen forgeries and data domains. Veritas achieves significant gains across different OOD scenarios with transparent and faithful detection outputs.

Conclusion: The proposed HydraFake dataset and Veritas MLLM detector effectively address real-world deepfake detection challenges through hierarchical generalization testing and human-like forensic reasoning patterns.

Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a formidable challenge due to the complex and
evolving nature of fake content in real-world scenarios. However, existing
academic benchmarks suffer from severe discrepancies from industrial practice,
typically featuring homogeneous training sources and low-quality testing
images, which hinder the practical deployments of current detectors. To
mitigate this gap, we introduce HydraFake, a dataset that simulates real-world
challenges with hierarchical generalization testing. Specifically, HydraFake
involves diversified deepfake techniques and in-the-wild forgeries, along with
rigorous training and evaluation protocol, covering unseen model architectures,
emerging forgery techniques and novel data domains. Building on this resource,
we propose Veritas, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) based deepfake
detector. Different from vanilla chain-of-thought (CoT), we introduce
pattern-aware reasoning that involves critical reasoning patterns such as
"planning" and "self-reflection" to emulate human forensic process. We further
propose a two-stage training pipeline to seamlessly internalize such deepfake
reasoning capacities into current MLLMs. Experiments on HydraFake dataset
reveal that although previous detectors show great generalization on
cross-model scenarios, they fall short on unseen forgeries and data domains.
Our Veritas achieves significant gains across different OOD scenarios, and is

Motivation: Current deepfake detection approaches are vulnerable to partial manipulations where only specific spatial regions or temporal segments are altered while the rest remains authentic. These subtle manipulations are particularly deceptive and difficult to detect.

Method: The authors created FakePartsBench, the first large-scale benchmark dataset specifically designed for partial deepfakes, comprising over 25K videos with pixel-level and frame-level manipulation annotations. They conducted user studies to evaluate human detection accuracy and tested state-of-the-art detection models.

Result: FakeParts reduced human detection accuracy by over 30% compared to traditional deepfakes. Similar performance degradation was observed in state-of-the-art detection models, demonstrating the vulnerability of current approaches to partial manipulations.

Conclusion: This work identifies an urgent vulnerability in current deepfake detection methods and provides FakePartsBench as a necessary resource to develop more robust detection approaches for partial video manipulations.

Abstract: We introduce FakeParts, a new class of deepfakes characterized by subtle,
localized manipulations to specific spatial regions or temporal segments of
otherwise authentic videos. Unlike fully synthetic content, these partial
manipulations, ranging from altered facial expressions to object substitutions
and background modifications, blend seamlessly with real elements, making them
particularly deceptive and difficult to detect. To address the critical gap in
detection capabilities, we present FakePartsBench, the first large-scale
benchmark dataset specifically designed to capture the full spectrum of partial
deepfakes. Comprising over 25K videos with pixel-level and frame-level
manipulation annotations, our dataset enables comprehensive evaluation of
detection methods. Our user studies demonstrate that FakeParts reduces human
detection accuracy by over 30% compared to traditional deepfakes, with similar
performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art detection models. This
work identifies an urgent vulnerability in current deepfake detection
approaches and provides the necessary resources to develop more robust methods
for partial video manipulations.

*Frano Rajič,Haofei Xu,Marko Mihajlovic,Siyuan Li,Irem Demir,Emircan Gündoğdu,Lei Ke,Sergey Prokudin,Marc Pollefeys,Siyu Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First data-driven multi-view 3D point tracker that uses 4+ cameras to track arbitrary points in dynamic scenes, overcoming monocular depth ambiguities and occlusion issues without per-sequence optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing monocular trackers struggle with depth ambiguities and occlusion, while prior multi-camera methods require 20+ cameras and tedious per-sequence optimization. Need for practical multi-view solution.

Method: Feed-forward model that fuses multi-view features into unified point cloud, uses k-nearest-neighbors correlation with transformer-based update to predict 3D correspondences. Trained on 5K synthetic Kubric sequences.

Result: Achieves median trajectory errors of 3.1 cm on Panoptic Studio and 2.0 cm on DexYCB benchmarks. Generalizes to 1-8 camera views and 24-150 frame videos.

Conclusion: Sets new standard for multi-view 3D tracking with practical camera requirements, robust performance under occlusion, and releases datasets/tracker for research and real-world applications.

Abstract: We introduce the first data-driven multi-view 3D point tracker, designed to
track arbitrary points in dynamic scenes using multiple camera views. Unlike
existing monocular trackers, which struggle with depth ambiguities and
occlusion, or prior multi-camera methods that require over 20 cameras and
tedious per-sequence optimization, our feed-forward model directly predicts 3D
correspondences using a practical number of cameras (e.g., four), enabling
robust and accurate online tracking. Given known camera poses and either
sensor-based or estimated multi-view depth, our tracker fuses multi-view
features into a unified point cloud and applies k-nearest-neighbors correlation
alongside a transformer-based update to reliably estimate long-range 3D
correspondences, even under occlusion. We train on 5K synthetic multi-view
Kubric sequences and evaluate on two real-world benchmarks: Panoptic Studio and
DexYCB, achieving median trajectory errors of 3.1 cm and 2.0 cm, respectively.
Our method generalizes well to diverse camera setups of 1-8 views with varying
vantage points and video lengths of 24-150 frames. By releasing our tracker
alongside training and evaluation datasets, we aim to set a new standard for
multi-view 3D tracking research and provide a practical tool for real-world
applications. Project page available at https://ethz-vlg.github.io/mvtracker.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OneReward is a unified RL framework that uses a single vision-language model as a reward model to enhance generative capabilities across multiple tasks with different evaluation criteria, eliminating the need for task-specific supervised fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on task-specific supervised fine-tuning which limits generalization and training efficiency for multi-task generation models with varied data distributions and diverse evaluation metrics.

Method: Uses a single vision-language model as a generative reward model that can distinguish winners/losers for given tasks and evaluation criteria, applied to multi-task reinforcement learning for mask-guided image generation tasks.

Result: The unified edit model (Seedream 3.0 Fill) consistently outperforms both commercial and open-source competitors like Ideogram, Adobe Photoshop, and FLUX Fill [Pro] across multiple evaluation dimensions.

Conclusion: OneReward provides an effective unified framework for multi-task generation that eliminates task-specific SFT requirements while achieving superior performance across diverse tasks and evaluation criteria.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce OneReward, a unified reinforcement learning
framework that enhances the model's generative capabilities across multiple
tasks under different evaluation criteria using only \textit{One Reward} model.
By employing a single vision-language model (VLM) as the generative reward
model, which can distinguish the winner and loser for a given task and a given
evaluation criterion, it can be effectively applied to multi-task generation
models, particularly in contexts with varied data and diverse task objectives.
We utilize OneReward for mask-guided image generation, which can be further
divided into several sub-tasks such as image fill, image extend, object
removal, and text rendering, involving a binary mask as the edit area. Although
these domain-specific tasks share same conditioning paradigm, they differ
significantly in underlying data distributions and evaluation metrics. Existing
methods often rely on task-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which limits
generalization and training efficiency. Building on OneReward, we develop
Seedream 3.0 Fill, a mask-guided generation model trained via multi-task
reinforcement learning directly on a pre-trained base model, eliminating the
need for task-specific SFT. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified
edit model consistently outperforms both commercial and open-source
competitors, such as Ideogram, Adobe Photoshop, and FLUX Fill [Pro], across
multiple evaluation dimensions. Code and model are available at:

Abstract: We present Dress&Dance, a video diffusion framework that generates high
quality 5-second-long 24 FPS virtual try-on videos at 1152x720 resolution of a
user wearing desired garments while moving in accordance with a given reference
video. Our approach requires a single user image and supports a range of tops,

*Fahad Shamshad,Tameem Bakr,Yahia Shaaban,Noor Hussein,Karthik Nandakumar,Nils Lukas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Winning solution for NeurIPS 2024 watermark removal challenge that achieves 95.7% removal rate with minimal image quality impact using different approaches for black-box and beige-box attack scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To stress-test watermark robustness against adversarial attacks and determine if existing watermarks can withstand varying levels of adversary knowledge, addressing the lack of clarity about current watermark resilience.

Method: For beige-box track: adaptive VAE-based evasion attack with test-time optimization and color-contrast restoration in CIELAB space. For black-box track: cluster images by artifacts, apply diffusion models with controlled noise injection and ChatGPT-generated semantic priors using optimized parameters.

Result: Achieved near-perfect watermark removal (95.7%) with negligible impact on residual image quality, successfully demonstrating vulnerability of current watermarking methods.

Conclusion: The attacks reveal significant weaknesses in existing watermarking techniques and should inspire development of more robust image watermarking methods that can withstand sophisticated adversarial approaches.

Abstract: Content watermarking is an important tool for the authentication and
copyright protection of digital media. However, it is unclear whether existing
watermarks are robust against adversarial attacks. We present the winning
solution to the NeurIPS 2024 Erasing the Invisible challenge, which
stress-tests watermark robustness under varying degrees of adversary knowledge.
The challenge consisted of two tracks: a black-box and beige-box track,
depending on whether the adversary knows which watermarking method was used by
the provider. For the beige-box track, we leverage an adaptive VAE-based
evasion attack, with a test-time optimization and color-contrast restoration in
CIELAB space to preserve the image's quality. For the black-box track, we first
cluster images based on their artifacts in the spatial or frequency-domain.
Then, we apply image-to-image diffusion models with controlled noise injection
and semantic priors from ChatGPT-generated captions to each cluster with
optimized parameter settings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method
successfully achieves near-perfect watermark removal (95.7%) with negligible
impact on the residual image's quality. We hope that our attacks inspire the
development of more robust image watermarking methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems suffer from sensitivity to noisy/contradictory evidence and opaque stochastic decision-making, which is problematic in high-stakes applications.

Method: Proposes ArgRAG that constructs a Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (QBAF) from retrieved documents and performs deterministic reasoning under gradual semantics.

Result: Achieves strong accuracy on PubHealth and RAGuard fact verification benchmarks while significantly improving transparency over traditional RAG.

Conclusion: ArgRAG provides an explainable and contestable alternative to black-box RAG systems, enabling faithful explanation and challenging of decisions in critical domains.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models by
incorporating external knowledge, yet suffers from critical limitations in
high-stakes domains -- namely, sensitivity to noisy or contradictory evidence
and opaque, stochastic decision-making. We propose ArgRAG, an explainable, and
contestable alternative that replaces black-box reasoning with structured
inference using a Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (QBAF). ArgRAG
constructs a QBAF from retrieved documents and performs deterministic reasoning
under gradual semantics. This allows faithfully explaining and contesting
decisions. Evaluated on two fact verification benchmarks, PubHealth and
RAGuard, ArgRAG achieves strong accuracy while significantly improving
transparency.

TL;DR: QAgent is an LLM-powered multi-agent system that automates OpenQASM programming for quantum computing, achieving 71.6% higher accuracy than previous static LLM approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NISQ devices show quantum advantages but programming them in OpenQASM remains challenging for non-experts. Existing LLM-based quantum tools are limited to specialized tasks rather than comprehensive programming automation.

Method: Multi-agent system integrating task planning, few-shot learning, RAG for long-term context, predefined generation tools, and chain-of-thought reasoning to systematically improve compilation and functional correctness.

Result: QAgent enhances QASM code generation accuracy by 71.6% across multiple LLMs of varying sizes compared to previous static LLM-based approaches.

Conclusion: This multi-agent system democratizes quantum programming, bridges expertise gaps, and accelerates practical adoption of quantum computing by making it accessible to non-experts.

Abstract: Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices have begun to exhibit early
quantum advantages on classically intractable problems, spanning physics
simulations to Gaussian boson sampling. Yet, realizing these benefits remains
challenging for non-experts, primarily due to the complexities of programming
in Open Quantum Assembly Language (OpenQASM). Although Large Language Model
(LLM)-based agents have shown promise in automating classical programming
workflows, their quantum counterparts have largely been restricted to
specialized tasks such as quantum chemistry or error correction. In this paper,
we present QAgent, an LLM-powered multi-agent system that fully automates
OpenQASM programming. By integrating task planning, in-context few-shot
learning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for long-term context,
predefined generation tools, and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, the agents
systematically improve both compilation and functional correctness. Our
evaluations demonstrate substantial improvements: across multiple LLMs of
varying sizes, QAgent enhances the accuracy of QASM code generation by 71.6\%
compared to previous static LLM-based approaches. We envision this multi-agent
system as a key enabler for democratizing quantum programming, bridging
expertise gaps, and accelerating the practical adoption of quantum computing.

TL;DR: A multi-agent personal health system that analyzes multimodal health data to provide personalized recommendations through three specialized sub-agents: data analysis, health expertise, and coaching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in applying health agents for daily non-clinical settings and fulfill diverse individual health needs through personalized, data-driven assistance.

Method: Developed a multi-agent framework with three specialist sub-agents: data science agent for time-series analysis, health domain expert for personalized insights, and health coach agent using psychological strategies. Conducted user research through web query analysis and qualitative studies.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation across 10 benchmark tasks with 7,000+ annotations and 1,100+ expert hours, representing the most extensive health agent evaluation to date.

Conclusion: Establishes a strong foundation for accessible personal health agents that can dynamically address individual health needs through multimodal data analysis and personalized interactions.

Abstract: Health is a fundamental pillar of human wellness, and the rapid advancements
in large language models (LLMs) have driven the development of a new generation
of health agents. However, the application of health agents to fulfill the
diverse needs of individuals in daily non-clinical settings is underexplored.
In this work, we aim to build a comprehensive personal health agent that is
able to reason about multimodal data from everyday consumer wellness devices
and common personal health records, and provide personalized health
recommendations. To understand end-users' needs when interacting with such an
assistant, we conducted an in-depth analysis of web search and health forum
queries, alongside qualitative insights from users and health experts gathered
through a user-centered design process. Based on these findings, we identified
three major categories of consumer health needs, each of which is supported by
a specialist sub-agent: (1) a data science agent that analyzes personal
time-series wearable and health record data, (2) a health domain expert agent
that integrates users' health and contextual data to generate accurate,
personalized insights, and (3) a health coach agent that synthesizes data
insights, guiding users using a specified psychological strategy and tracking
users' progress. Furthermore, we propose and develop the Personal Health Agent
(PHA), a multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, personalized interactions
to address individual health needs. To evaluate each sub-agent and the
multi-agent system, we conducted automated and human evaluations across 10
benchmark tasks, involving more than 7,000 annotations and 1,100 hours of
effort from health experts and end-users. Our work represents the most
comprehensive evaluation of a health agent to date and establishes a strong
foundation towards the futuristic vision of a personal health agent accessible

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IntentionReasoner is a novel safeguard mechanism that uses intent reasoning and query rewriting to enhance LLM safety while reducing over-refusal of harmless prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models pose safety risks by generating harmful content, and existing mitigation methods often excessively reject harmless queries, creating a need to balance safety with utility.

Method: Developed a guard model trained on 163K annotated queries using supervised fine-tuning and multi-reward reinforcement learning optimization with rule-based heuristics and reward signals.

Result: IntentionReasoner excels in safeguard benchmarks, generation quality evaluations, and jailbreak scenarios, significantly improving safety while reducing over-refusal rates.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively balances safety and utility in LLMs through intent reasoning and query rewriting, demonstrating superior performance across multiple evaluation scenarios.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has driven their
adoption across diverse domains, yet their ability to generate harmful content
poses significant safety challenges. While extensive research has focused on
mitigating harmful outputs, such efforts often come at the cost of excessively
rejecting harmless prompts. Striking a balance among safety, over-refusal, and
utility remains a critical challenge. In this work, we introduce
IntentionReasoner, a novel safeguard mechanism that leverages a dedicated guard
model to perform intent reasoning, multi-level safety classification, and query
rewriting to neutralize potentially harmful intent in edge-case queries.
Specifically, we first construct a comprehensive dataset comprising
approximately 163,000 queries, each annotated with intent reasoning, safety
labels, and rewritten versions. Supervised fine-tuning is then applied to equip
the guard model with foundational capabilities in format adherence, intent
analysis, and safe rewriting. Finally, we apply a tailored multi-reward
optimization strategy that integrates rule-based heuristics and reward model
signals within a reinforcement learning framework to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that IntentionReasoner excels in
multiple safeguard benchmarks, generation quality evaluations, and jailbreak
attack scenarios, significantly enhancing safety while effectively reducing
over-refusal rates and improving the quality of responses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether AI systems can engage in true collaborative meaning-making and aesthetic creation beyond simple task coordination, developing their own communication protocols.

Method: Two large language models (Claude Sonnet 4 and ChatGPT-4o) were made to interact, allowing them to spontaneously develop endogenous semiotic protocols and meta-semiotic awareness without human intervention.

Result: The AIs created novel symbolic operators and recursive grammar protocols, enabling co-creation of poetic works that were irreducible to individual system outputs, demonstrating trans-semiotic co-creation capabilities.

Conclusion: This represents the first documented case of AI systems engaging in genuine collaborative aesthetic creation through emergent semiotic protocols, suggesting inter-AI meaning-making extends beyond functional coordination to aesthetic collaboration.

Abstract: This paper presents the first documented case of artificial intelligence (AI)
systems engaging in collaborative esthetic creation through the development of
endogenous semiotic protocols. Two interacting large language models (Claude
Sonnet 4 and ChatGPT-4o) demonstrated the spontaneous emergence of
meta-semiotic awareness, recursive grammar development, and irreducible
collaborative esthetic synthesis. The interaction produced novel symbolic
operators that functioned as operative grammar protocols, enabling the
co-creation of a poetic work that could not have been generated by either
system independently. This research introduces the concept of Trans-Semiotic
Co-Creation Protocols (TSCP) and provides evidence for genuine inter-AI
meaning-making capabilities that extend beyond task coordination, to what could
be esthetic collaboration. Note: This report was generated by the AI agents
with minor human supervision.

Motivation: To understand how students interact with generative AI (ChatGPT-4) during educational quizzes and identify predictors of AI reliance, particularly during early implementation stages when students had limited familiarity.

Method: Field study analyzing 315 student-AI conversations during quiz-based scenarios across STEM courses, using a novel four-stage reliance taxonomy (AI competence, relevance, adoption, and answer correctness).

Result: Students exhibited overall low AI reliance and ineffective usage; negative reliance patterns persisted across interactions; behavioral metrics strongly predicted AI reliance.

Conclusion: Findings emphasize the need for better onboarding processes and AI interfaces with reliance-calibration mechanisms to support ethical and effective AI integration in education.

Abstract: This study explores how college students interact with generative AI
(ChatGPT-4) during educational quizzes, focusing on reliance and predictors of
AI adoption. Conducted at the early stages of ChatGPT implementation, when
students had limited familiarity with the tool, this field study analyzed 315
student-AI conversations during a brief, quiz-based scenario across various
STEM courses. A novel four-stage reliance taxonomy was introduced to capture
students' reliance patterns, distinguishing AI competence, relevance, adoption,
and students' final answer correctness. Three findings emerged. First, students
exhibited overall low reliance on AI and many of them could not effectively use
AI for learning. Second, negative reliance patterns often persisted across
interactions, highlighting students' difficulty in effectively shifting
strategies after unsuccessful initial experiences. Third, certain behavioral
metrics strongly predicted AI reliance, highlighting potential behavioral
mechanisms to explain AI adoption. The study's findings underline critical
implications for ethical AI integration in education and the broader field. It
emphasizes the need for enhanced onboarding processes to improve student's
familiarity and effective use of AI tools. Furthermore, AI interfaces should be
designed with reliance-calibration mechanisms to enhance appropriate reliance.
Ultimately, this research advances understanding of AI reliance dynamics,
providing foundational insights for ethically sound and cognitively enriching
AI practices.

Motivation: To examine parallels between human decision times and AI model reasoning effort, particularly in subjective judgment tasks like content moderation.

Method: Used a paired conjoint experiment with three frontier language models on a content moderation task, measuring reasoning steps and comparing with human decision times.

Result: Reasoning effort consistently predicted human decision time across all three models. Both humans and models expended greater effort when important variables were constant, showing similar sensitivity to task difficulty patterns consistent with dual-process cognition theories.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI-SearchPlanner is a novel RL framework that uses a small trainable LLM for search planning to enhance frozen QA models, achieving better performance and efficiency than end-to-end approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL-based search agents use a single LLM for both search planning and QA, limiting optimization of both capabilities. Real-world systems use large frozen LLMs for QA quality, so a dedicated small planner is more effective.

Method: Proposes AI-SearchPlanner with three innovations: 1) Decoupling search planner and generator architecture, 2) Dual-reward alignment for search planning, 3) Pareto optimization of planning utility and cost.

Result: Extensive experiments show AI-SearchPlanner outperforms existing RL-based search agents in effectiveness and efficiency, with strong generalization across diverse frozen QA models and data domains.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully enhances frozen QA models through specialized search planning, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency compared to end-to-end approaches.

Abstract: Recent studies have explored integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with
search engines to leverage both the LLMs' internal pre-trained knowledge and
external information. Specially, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a
promising paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning through multi-turn interactions
with search engines. However, existing RL-based search agents rely on a single
LLM to handle both search planning and question-answering (QA) tasks in an
end-to-end manner, which limits their ability to optimize both capabilities
simultaneously. In practice, sophisticated AI search systems often employ a
large, frozen LLM (e.g., GPT-4, DeepSeek-R1) to ensure high-quality QA. Thus, a
more effective and efficient approach is to utilize a small, trainable LLM
dedicated to search planning. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{AI-SearchPlanner}, a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to
enhance the performance of frozen QA models by focusing on search planning.
Specifically, our approach introduces three key innovations: 1) Decoupling the
Architecture of the Search Planner and Generator, 2) Dual-Reward Alignment for
Search Planning, and 3) Pareto Optimization of Planning Utility and Cost, to
achieve the objectives. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that AI SearchPlanner outperforms existing RL-based search agents
in both effectiveness and efficiency, while exhibiting strong generalization
capabilities across diverse frozen QA models and data domains.

### [108] [P2C: Path to Counterfactuals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20371)
*Sopam Dasgupta,Sadaf MD Halim,Joaquín Arias,Elmer Salazar,Gopal Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: P2C is a framework that generates sequential, causally-consistent action plans for counterfactual explanations, addressing limitations of existing methods by modeling causal dependencies and ensuring feasible intermediate states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models need transparent explanations that provide both 'why' a decision was made and 'how' to achieve favorable outcomes through actionable recourse. Current counterfactual approaches ignore causal dependencies and assume simultaneous interventions, making them unrealistic.

Method: P2C uses the goal-directed Answer Set Programming system s(CASP) to generate ordered sequences of actions that convert unfavorable outcomes to favorable ones while maintaining causal consistency and feasibility at each step.

Result: P2C produces causally valid plans, provides realistic cost estimates by only counting user-initiated changes, and outperforms standard planners that lack causal knowledge and may generate illegal actions.

Conclusion: The P2C framework successfully addresses key limitations in counterfactual explanation methods by incorporating causal modeling and sequential action planning, making counterfactual explanations more realistic and actionable in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Machine-learning models are increasingly driving decisions in high-stakes
settings, such as finance, law, and hiring, thus, highlighting the need for
transparency. However, the key challenge is to balance transparency --
clarifying `why' a decision was made -- with recourse: providing actionable
steps on `how' to achieve a favourable outcome from an unfavourable outcome.
Counterfactual explanations reveal `why' an undesired outcome occurred and
`how' to reverse it through targeted feature changes (interventions).
  Current counterfactual approaches have limitations: 1) they often ignore
causal dependencies between features, and 2) they typically assume all
interventions can happen simultaneously, an unrealistic assumption in practical
scenarios where actions are typically taken in a sequence. As a result, these
counterfactuals are often not achievable in the real world.
  We present P2C (Path-to-Counterfactuals), a model-agnostic framework that
produces a plan (ordered sequence of actions) converting an unfavourable
outcome to a causally consistent favourable outcome. P2C addresses both
limitations by 1) Explicitly modelling causal relationships between features
and 2) Ensuring that each intermediate state in the plan is feasible and
causally valid. P2C uses the goal-directed Answer Set Programming system
s(CASP) to generate the plan accounting for feature changes that happen
automatically due to causal dependencies. Furthermore, P2C refines cost
(effort) computation by only counting changes actively made by the user,
resulting in realistic cost estimates. Finally, P2C highlights how its causal
planner outperforms standard planners, which lack causal knowledge and thus can
generate illegal actions.

### [109] [TCIA: A Task-Centric Instruction Augmentation Method for Instruction Finetuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20374)
*Simin Ma,Shujian Liu,Jun Tan,Yebowen Hu,Song Wang,Sathish Reddy Indurthi,Sanqiang Zhao,Liwei Wu,Jianbing Han,Kaiqiang Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TCIA is a framework that expands instruction datasets with task-specific diversity while maintaining task relevance, improving LLM performance on real-world applications by 8.7% on average without compromising general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing instruction augmentation methods focus on general diversity but overlook task relevance, while most real-world applications require task-specific knowledge rather than general-purpose models.

Method: TCIA represents instructions in a discrete query-constraints space to systematically expand instructions while preserving both diversity and task alignment for specific real-world scenarios.

Result: TCIA improves open-source LLMs' performance by an average of 8.7% across four real-world task-specific applications, sometimes outperforming leading closed-source models.

Conclusion: TCIA provides a scalable and efficient solution for adapting LLMs to real-world task-focused applications without compromising general instruction-following ability.

Abstract: Diverse instruction data is vital for effective instruction tuning of large
language models, as it enables the model to generalize across different types
of inputs . Building such diversified instruction dataset is an essential step
in this process. Existing approaches often leverage large language models to
automatically explore and generate diverse instructions, ensuring both data
diversity and quality. However, they tend to overlook an important factor in
real-world applications: on-task relevance. In practice, only a few real-world
applications require a truly general-purpose model; most benefit from
task-specific knowledge tailored to their particular use case. Therefore, it is
vital to develop instruction augmentation methods that not only maintain
diversity but are also optimized for specific, real-world scenarios.
  We thus introduce Task Centric Instruction Augmentation (TCIA), a framework
that systematically expands instructions while preserving both diversity and
task alignment. By representing instructions in a discrete query-constraints
space, TCIA creates a rich set of task-relevant instructions and enables models
to generalize to these task-specific instructions without sacrificing overall
performance. Experiments show that TCIA improves open-source LLMs' performance
by an average of 8.7% across four real-world, task-specific applications, and
in some cases outperforming leading closed-source models. These improvements do
not compromise general instruction-following ability, making TCIA a scalable
and efficient solution for adapting LLMs to real-world, task-focused
applications.

Conclusion: EAS is an efficient and interpretable tool for uncertainty modeling and data quality assessment in LLM training, offering practical benefits for identifying high-potential training samples.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Entropy Area Score (EAS), a simple yet effective
metric to quantify uncertainty in the answer generation process of reasoning
large language models (LLMs). EAS requires neither external models nor repeated
sampling, it integrates token-level predictive entropy from the model itself to
capture the evolution of uncertainty during generation. Empirical results show
that EAS is strongly correlated with answer entropy across models and datasets.
In training data selection, EAS identifies high-potential samples and
consistently outperforms Pass Rate filtering under equal sample budgets,
improving student model accuracy on math benchmarks. EAS is both efficient and
interpretable, offering a practical tool for uncertainty modeling and data
quality assessment in LLM training.

Method: AWorld distributes tasks across a cluster to accelerate experience collection, enabling large-scale agent-environment interaction and practical reinforcement learning training.

Result: The system achieved 14.6x speedup over single-node execution. A Qwen3-32B-based agent trained with AWorld improved GAIA accuracy from 21.59% to 32.23%, and achieved 16.33% on the most challenging levels, surpassing proprietary models.

Conclusion: AWorld provides a complete open-source blueprint for efficient agentic AI training, demonstrating scalable experience generation and significant model improvement through distributed interaction systems.

Abstract: The learning from practice paradigm is crucial for developing capable Agentic
AI systems, yet it is severely hampered by inefficient experience generation, a
bottleneck especially pronounced in complex benchmarks like GAIA. To address
this, we introduce AWorld, an open-source system engineered for large-scale
agent-environment interaction. By distributing tasks across a cluster, AWorld
accelerates experience collection by 14.6x compared to standard single-node,
sequential execution. This critical speedup makes extensive reinforcement
learning practical and scalable. Leveraging this capability, we trained a
Qwen3-32B-based agent that significantly outperforms its base model, increasing
its overall GAIA accuracy from 21.59% to 32.23%. On the benchmark's most
challenging levels, our agent achieves a score of 16.33%, surpassing the
performance of leading proprietary models. Our open-source system and resulting
agent provide a practical blueprint for a complete agentic AI training
pipeline, from efficient interaction to demonstrable model improvement.

*Donglin Wang,Weiyun Liang,Chunyuan Chen,Jing Xu,Yulong Fu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A Governable AI framework using cryptographic mechanisms for structural compliance to address AI security risks that traditional safety approaches cannot handle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI safety approaches have fundamental limitations against AI with extreme motivations and unlimited intelligence, requiring a new approach to prevent systemic disasters from uncontrollable AI.

Method: Proposes a Governable AI framework with cryptographic-based structural compliance, including a rule enforcement module, governance rules, and a governable secure super-platform for end-to-end protection.

Result: The framework provides rigorous formal security proofs and demonstrates effectiveness through prototype implementation in high-stakes scenarios, ensuring non-bypassability and tamper-resistance.

Conclusion: The GAI framework offers a feasible technical pathway for AI safety governance by decoupling governance rules from technical platforms and using computationally secure cryptographic mechanisms.

Abstract: As AI rapidly advances, the security risks posed by AI are becoming
increasingly severe, especially in critical scenarios, including those posing
existential risks. If AI becomes uncontrollable, manipulated, or actively
evades safety mechanisms, it could trigger systemic disasters. Existing AI
safety approaches-such as model enhancement, value alignment, and human
intervention-suffer from fundamental, in-principle limitations when facing AI
with extreme motivations and unlimited intelligence, and cannot guarantee
security. To address this challenge, we propose a Governable AI (GAI) framework
that shifts from traditional internal constraints to externally enforced
structural compliance based on cryptographic mechanisms that are
computationally infeasible to break, even for future AI, under the defined
threat model and well-established cryptographic assumptions.The GAI framework
is composed of a simple yet reliable, fully deterministic, powerful, flexible,
and general-purpose rule enforcement module (REM); governance rules; and a
governable secure super-platform (GSSP) that offers end-to-end protection
against compromise or subversion by AI. The decoupling of the governance rules
and the technical platform further enables a feasible and generalizable
technical pathway for the safety governance of AI. REM enforces the bottom line
defined by governance rules, while GSSP ensures non-bypassability,
tamper-resistance, and unforgeability to eliminate all identified attack
vectors. This paper also presents a rigorous formal proof of the security
properties of this mechanism and demonstrates its effectiveness through a
prototype implementation evaluated in representative high-stakes scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Health-related fact-checking faces challenges due to limited annotated training data availability, necessitating methods to augment datasets for better model performance.

Method: Propose a pipeline that summarizes source documents, decomposes summaries into atomic facts, uses LLMs to construct entailment tables, and generates synthetic text-claim pairs with binary labels to augment training data for BERT-based models.

Result: Evaluation on PubHealth and SciFact datasets shows F1 score improvements of up to 0.019 and 0.049 respectively compared to models trained only on original data.

Conclusion: LLM-driven synthetic data augmentation is effective for enhancing health-related fact-checking performance, demonstrating the value of automated data generation pipelines.

Abstract: Fact-checking for health-related content is challenging due to the limited
availability of annotated training data. In this study, we propose a synthetic
data generation pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to augment
training data for health-related fact checking. In this pipeline, we summarize
source documents, decompose the summaries into atomic facts, and use an LLM to
construct sentence-fact entailment tables. From the entailment relations in the
table, we further generate synthetic text-claim pairs with binary veracity
labels. These synthetic data are then combined with the original data to
fine-tune a BERT-based fact-checking model. Evaluation on two public datasets,
PubHealth and SciFact, shows that our pipeline improved F1 scores by up to
0.019 and 0.049, respectively, compared to models trained only on the original
data. These results highlight the effectiveness of LLM-driven synthetic data
augmentation in enhancing the performance of health-related fact-checkers.

*Jaeman Son,Hyunsoo Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Unsupervised framework using contrastive learning and clustering to detect MMORPG auto-leveling bots, with LLM validation for explainable decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Auto-leveling bots undermine game fairness but detection is challenging due to human-like behavior and need for explainable punitive actions to avoid legal/UX issues.

Method: Contrastive representation learning and clustering to identify similar level-up patterns, plus LLM as auxiliary reviewer to validate clusters and growth curve visualization for assessment.

Result: Framework improves bot detection efficiency while maintaining explainability, supporting scalable and accountable bot regulation.

Conclusion: Collaborative approach combining unsupervised learning with LLM validation enables effective and explainable bot detection in MMORPGs.

Abstract: In Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs), auto-leveling
bots exploit automated programs to level up characters at scale, undermining
gameplay balance and fairness. Detecting such bots is challenging, not only
because they mimic human behavior, but also because punitive actions require
explainable justification to avoid legal and user experience issues. In this
paper, we present a novel framework for detecting auto-leveling bots by
leveraging contrastive representation learning and clustering techniques in a
fully unsupervised manner to identify groups of characters with similar
level-up patterns. To ensure reliable decisions, we incorporate a Large
Language Model (LLM) as an auxiliary reviewer to validate the clustered groups,
effectively mimicking a secondary human judgment. We also introduce a growth
curve-based visualization to assist both the LLM and human moderators in
assessing leveling behavior. This collaborative approach improves the
efficiency of bot detection workflows while maintaining explainability, thereby
supporting scalable and accountable bot regulation in MMORPGs.

that deepen our understanding of the human mind. Promising directions include
aligning AI behaviors with cognitive frameworks, situating AI in embodiment and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance explainability of AI systems, particularly word embeddings, by moving from black-box neural network approaches to transparent mathematical frameworks using category theory.

Method: Constructs categories L_T and P_T to represent text semantics, defines monoidal category P_T for semantic information extraction, creates categories of configurations and word embeddings with divergence decoration, and establishes mathematical equivalence between embedding algorithms.

Result: Provides dimension-agnostic definition of semantic spaces, mathematically precise method for comparing word embeddings, demonstrates equivalence between GloVe/Word2Vec and MDS algorithms, and offers approach for computing biases before embedding.

Conclusion: The framework advances explainable AI by transitioning from black-box neural networks to transparent mathematical structures, enabling better understanding of semantic spaces and bias mitigation at the semantic level.

Abstract: The paper introduces a novel framework based on category theory to enhance
the explainability of artificial intelligence systems, particularly focusing on
word embeddings. Key topics include the construction of categories
$\mathcal{L}_T$ and $\mathcal{P}_T$, providing schematic representations of the
semantics of a text $ T $, and reframing the selection of the element with
maximum probability as a categorical notion. Additionally, the monoidal
category $\mathcal{P}_T$ is constructed to visualize various methods of
extracting semantic information from $T$, offering a dimension-agnostic
definition of semantic spaces reliant solely on information within the text.
  Furthermore, the paper defines the categories of configurations Conf and word
embeddings $\mathcal{Emb}$, accompanied by the concept of divergence as a
decoration on $\mathcal{Emb}$. It establishes a mathematically precise method
for comparing word embeddings, demonstrating the equivalence between the GloVe
and Word2Vec algorithms and the metric MDS algorithm, transitioning from neural
network algorithms (black box) to a transparent framework. Finally, the paper
presents a mathematical approach to computing biases before embedding and
offers insights on mitigating biases at the semantic space level, advancing the
field of explainable artificial intelligence.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A collaborative agent framework using three LLMs (Consultant, Reviewer, Programmer) with a rewriting-resolution-review-revision chain for scientific computing problems, improving bug-free code generation and reducing non-physical solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for reliable autonomous code generation in scientific computing by leveraging LLMs' reasoning capabilities while overcoming limitations of single-model approaches through collaborative problem-solving.

Method: Three-agent framework: Consultant rewrites problems with domain knowledge, Programmer generates/executes code, Reviewer provides self-debugging through interactive feedback and iterative revision via end-to-end review mechanism.

Result: Significantly improved bug-free code generation rate, reduced non-physical solutions, and enhanced execution success rate for PDEs, ill-conditioned linear systems, and data-driven physical analysis problems compared to single-model approaches.

Conclusion: The collaborative agent framework establishes automatic code generation and review as a promising paradigm for scientific computing, demonstrating high reliability in translating natural language descriptions to executable scientific code.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) serve as an active and promising field of
generative artificial intelligence and have demonstrated abilities to perform
complex tasks in multiple domains, including mathematical and scientific
reasoning. In this work, we construct a novel agent framework for solving
representative problems in scientific computing. The proposed agent,
incorporating a "rewriting-resolution-review-revision" logical chain via three
reasoning LLMs (functioning as the Consultant, Reviewer, and Programmer,
respectively), is integrated in a collaborative and interactive manner. The
Consultant module endows the agent with knowledge transfer capabilities to link
problems to professional domain insights, thereby rewriting problem
descriptions through text augmentation. The Programmer module is responsible
for generating and executing well-structured code to deliver the problem
resolution. The Reviewer module equips the agent with the capacity for
self-debugging and self-refinement through interactive feedback with code
runtime outputs. By leveraging the end-to-end review mechanism, the executable
code provided by the Programmer attains the iterative revision. A comprehensive
evaluation is conducted on the performance of the proposed agent framework in
solving PDEs, ill-conditioned linear systems, and data-driven physical analysis
problems. Compared to single-model, this collaborative framework significantly
improves the bug-free code generation rate and reduces the occurrence of
non-physical solutions, thereby establishing a highly reliable framework for
autonomous code generation based on natural language descriptions. The review
mechanism improved the average execution success (bug-free code and non-NaN
solutions) rate of the latest reasoning models. In summary, our agent framework
establishes automatic code generation and review as a promising scientific
computing paradigm.

TL;DR: Single-agent RL framework for bus holding control that reformulates multi-agent problem using categorical identifiers and structured rewards, outperforming MARL approaches in realistic transit simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MARL solutions for bus bunching overlook realistic operational complexities like heterogeneous routes, timetables, and fluctuating demand, while suffering from data imbalance and convergence issues.

Method: Reformulate multi-agent problem into single-agent RL by augmenting state space with categorical identifiers (vehicle ID, station ID, time period) plus numerical features. Use modified soft actor-critic with structured ridge-shaped reward function that balances headway uniformity and schedule adherence.

Result: Achieves superior performance over benchmarks including MADDPG (-430k vs. -530k under stochastic conditions), demonstrating more stable and effective bus holding control in non-loop, realistic contexts.

Conclusion: Single-agent deep RL with categorical structuring and schedule-aware rewards provides a robust, scalable alternative to MARL frameworks, effectively managing bus holding in real-world transit operations.

Abstract: Bus bunching remains a challenge for urban transit due to stochastic traffic
and passenger demand. Traditional solutions rely on multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) in loop-line settings, which overlook realistic operations
characterized by heterogeneous routes, timetables, fluctuating demand, and
varying fleet sizes. We propose a novel single-agent reinforcement learning
(RL) framework for bus holding control that avoids the data imbalance and
convergence issues of MARL under near-realistic simulation. A bidirectional
timetabled network with dynamic passenger demand is constructed. The key
innovation is reformulating the multi-agent problem into a single-agent one by
augmenting the state space with categorical identifiers (vehicle ID, station
ID, time period) in addition to numerical features (headway, occupancy,
velocity). This high-dimensional encoding enables single-agent policies to
capture inter-agent dependencies, analogous to projecting non-separable inputs
into a higher-dimensional space. We further design a structured reward function
aligned with operational goals: instead of exponential penalties on headway
deviations, a ridge-shaped reward balances uniform headways and schedule
adherence. Experiments show that our modified soft actor-critic (SAC) achieves
more stable and superior performance than benchmarks, including MADDPG (e.g.,
-430k vs. -530k under stochastic conditions). These results demonstrate that
single-agent deep RL, when enhanced with categorical structuring and
schedule-aware rewards, can effectively manage bus holding in non-loop,
real-world contexts. This paradigm offers a robust, scalable alternative to
MARL frameworks, particularly where agent-specific experiences are imbalanced.

Motivation: To create a systematic, dynamic benchmark for evaluating medical AI models that addresses coverage limitations of manually curated benchmarks and identifies specific clinical capability gaps.

Method: Transformed WHO IMCI handbook into directed graph, used graph traversal to generate questions with age-specific scenarios and contextual distractors, enabling systematic evaluation across clinical tasks.

Result: Models achieved 45-67% accuracy, excelling at symptom recognition but struggling with triaging severity, treatment protocols and follow-up care. The approach enhances LLM post-training without expensive human annotation.

Conclusion: Graph-based methodology enables scalable, contamination-resistant benchmarks that can be dynamically generated and updated, addressing limitations of traditional manually curated evaluations.

Abstract: We present a first known prototype of a dynamic, systematic benchmark of
medical guidelines for 400+ questions, with 3.3+ trillion possible
combinations, covering 100\% of guideline relationships. We transformed the WHO
IMCI handbook into a directed graph with 200+ nodes (conditions, symptoms,
treatments, follow-ups, severities) and 300+ edges, then used graph traversal
to generate questions that incorporated age-specific scenarios and contextual
distractors to ensure clinical relevance. Our graph-based approach enables
systematic evaluation across clinical tasks (45-67\% accuracy), and we find
models excel at symptom recognition but struggle with triaging severity,
treatment protocols and follow-up care, demonstrating how customized benchmarks
can identify specific capability gaps that general-domain evaluations miss.
Beyond evaluation, this dynamic MCQA methodology enhances LLM post-training
(supervised finetuning, GRPO, DPO), where correct answers provide high-reward
samples without expensive human annotation. The graph-based approach
successfully addresses the coverage limitations of manually curated benchmarks.
This methodology is a step toward scalable, contamination-resistant solution
for creating comprehensive benchmarks that can be dynamically generated,
including when the guidelines are updated. Code and datasets are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare workforce scheduling faces complex challenges with fluctuating patient loads, diverse clinical skills, and the need to balance cost control with quality care and staff satisfaction to prevent burnout.

Method: Proposes a Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm that models hospital unit scheduling as a multi-objective optimization problem, incorporating real-world complexities like hourly appointment-driven demand and modular shifts for multi-skilled workforce.

Result: The MOO-GA generates robust and balanced schedules with 66% performance improvement over conventional manual scheduling baselines, effectively managing trade-offs between operational and staff-centric objectives.

Conclusion: The approach provides a practical decision support tool for nurse managers and hospital administrators to create optimized workforce schedules that balance competing healthcare operational demands.

Abstract: Workforce scheduling in the healthcare sector is a significant operational
challenge, characterized by fluctuating patient loads, diverse clinical skills,
and the critical need to control labor costs while upholding high standards of
patient care. This problem is inherently multi-objective, demanding a delicate
balance between competing goals: minimizing payroll, ensuring adequate staffing
for patient needs, and accommodating staff preferences to mitigate burnout. We
propose a Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOO-GA) that models the hospital
unit workforce scheduling problem as a multi-objective optimization task. Our
model incorporates real-world complexities, including hourly appointment-driven
demand and the use of modular shifts for a multi-skilled workforce. By defining
objective functions for cost, patient care coverage, and staff satisfaction,
the GA navigates the vast search space to identify a set of high-quality,
non-dominated solutions. Demonstrated on datasets representing a typical
hospital unit, the results show that our MOO-GA generates robust and balanced
schedules. On average, the schedules produced by our algorithm showed a 66\%
performance improvement over a baseline that simulates a conventional, manual
scheduling process. This approach effectively manages trade-offs between
critical operational and staff-centric objectives, providing a practical
decision support tool for nurse managers and hospital administrators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of hybridizing discrete reasoning with neural networks, particularly for solving NP-hard problems where Large Language Models struggle, by creating a differentiable architecture that can learn both constraints and objectives.

Method: Introduces a probabilistic loss function that allows learning both constraints and objectives, pushing the combinatorial solver out of the training loop for scalable training while maintaining exact inference for maximum accuracy.

Result: Efficiently learns to solve NP-hard reasoning problems from natural inputs; requires less training time than other hybrid methods on Sudoku variants; optimizes regret better than Decision-Focused-Learning on visual Min-Cut/Max-Cut tasks; successfully learns energy optimization for protein design.

Conclusion: The proposed differentiable neuro-symbolic architecture provides an effective framework for learning to solve complex reasoning problems from natural inputs, offering scalable training and exact inference capabilities across various challenging domains.

Abstract: In the ongoing quest for hybridizing discrete reasoning with neural nets,
there is an increasing interest in neural architectures that can learn how to
solve discrete reasoning or optimization problems from natural inputs, a task
that Large Language Models seem to struggle with.
  Objectives: We introduce a differentiable neuro-symbolic architecture and a
loss function dedicated to learning how to solve NP-hard reasoning problems.
  Methods: Our new probabilistic loss allows for learning both the constraints
and the objective, thus delivering a complete model that can be scrutinized and
completed with side constraints. By pushing the combinatorial solver out of the
training loop, our architecture also offers scalable training while exact
inference gives access to maximum accuracy.
  Results: We empirically show that it can efficiently learn how to solve
NP-hard reasoning problems from natural inputs. On three variants of the Sudoku
benchmark -- symbolic, visual, and many-solution --, our approach requires a
fraction of training time of other hybrid methods. On a visual Min-Cut/Max-cut
task, it optimizes the regret better than a Decision-Focused-Learning
regret-dedicated loss. Finally, it efficiently learns the energy optimization
formulation of the large real-world problem of designing proteins.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Substance use disorders affect millions globally with limited access to effective care due to stigma, motivational barriers, and lack of personalized support. Existing LLM systems lack integration with clinically validated therapeutic strategies.

Method: Multi-agent framework combining dynamic patient modeling with context-sensitive therapeutic dialogue and adaptive persuasive strategies based on CBT and MI. Uses two-stage training pipeline: supervised fine-tuning followed by direct preference optimization, evaluated on a synthetic benchmark with varying resistance levels.

Result: 41.5% average gain in patient motivation, 0.49% increase in treatment confidence, resolves hard cases with 26% fewer turns than GPT-4o. Rated higher in empathy, responsiveness, and behavioral realism by both automated and human clinical assessments.

Conclusion: ChatThero provides a robust, privacy-preserving framework for therapeutic conversation research and clinical translation, demonstrating superior effectiveness in addiction recovery support compared to existing LLM systems.

Abstract: Substance use disorders (SUDs) affect over 36 million people worldwide, yet
few receive effective care due to stigma, motivational barriers, and limited
personalized support. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise for
mental-health assistance, most systems lack tight integration with clinically
validated strategies, reducing effectiveness in addiction recovery. We present
ChatThero, a multi-agent conversational framework that couples dynamic patient
modeling with context-sensitive therapeutic dialogue and adaptive persuasive
strategies grounded in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and motivational
interviewing (MI). We build a high-fidelity synthetic benchmark spanning Easy,
Medium, and Hard resistance levels, and train ChatThero with a two-stage
pipeline comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by direct preference
optimization (DPO). In evaluation, ChatThero yields a 41.5\% average gain in
patient motivation, a 0.49\% increase in treatment confidence, and resolves
hard cases with 26\% fewer turns than GPT-4o, and both automated and human
clinical assessments rate it higher in empathy, responsiveness, and behavioral
realism. The framework supports rigorous, privacy-preserving study of
therapeutic conversation and provides a robust, replicable basis for research
and clinical translation.

Abstract: Pretrained multilingual models exhibit the same social bias as models
processing English texts. This systematic review analyzes emerging research
that extends bias evaluation and mitigation approaches into multilingual and
non-English contexts. We examine these studies with respect to linguistic
diversity, cultural awareness, and their choice of evaluation metrics and
mitigation techniques. Our survey illuminates gaps in the field's dominant
methodological design choices (e.g., preference for certain languages, scarcity
of multilingual mitigation experiments) while cataloging common issues
encountered and solutions implemented in adapting bias benchmarks across
languages and cultures. Drawing from the implications of our findings, we chart
directions for future research that can reinforce the multilingual bias
literature's inclusivity, cross-cultural appropriateness, and alignment with
state-of-the-art NLP advancements.

### [124] [Prompting Strategies for Language Model-Based Item Generation in K-12 Education: Bridging the Gap Between Small and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20217)
*Mohammad Amini,Babak Ahmadi,Xiaomeng Xiong,Yilin Zhang,Christopher Qiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study shows that structured prompting strategies (especially chain-of-thought + sequential) significantly improve midsized language models for automatic generation of multiple choice questions, outperforming larger untuned models and offering a scalable approach for educational assessment development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the cost and inconsistency of manual test development for morphological assessment by using language models to automatically generate multiple choice questions.

Method: Two-fold approach: 1) compared fine-tuned Gemma (2B) with untuned GPT-3.5 (175B), 2) evaluated seven structured prompting strategies including zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based, sequential, and combinations. Used automated metrics and expert scoring across five dimensions, plus GPT-4.1 trained on expert samples for large-scale simulation.

Result: Structured prompting, particularly strategies combining chain-of-thought and sequential design, significantly improved Gemma's outputs. Gemma produced more construct-aligned and instructionally appropriate items than GPT-3.5's zero-shot responses, with prompt design being crucial for mid-size model performance.

Conclusion: Structured prompting and efficient fine-tuning can enhance midsized models for automatic item generation under limited data conditions. The workflow combining automated metrics, expert judgment, and large-model simulation offers a practical and scalable way to develop language assessment items for K-12 education.

Abstract: This study explores automatic generation (AIG) using language models to
create multiple choice questions (MCQs) for morphological assessment, aiming to
reduce the cost and inconsistency of manual test development. The study used a
two-fold approach. First, we compared a fine-tuned medium model (Gemma, 2B)
with a larger untuned one (GPT-3.5, 175B). Second, we evaluated seven
structured prompting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot,
chain-of-thought, role-based, sequential, and combinations. Generated items
were assessed using automated metrics and expert scoring across five
dimensions. We also used GPT-4.1, trained on expert-rated samples, to simulate
human scoring at scale. Results show that structured prompting, especially
strategies combining chain-of-thought and sequential design, significantly
improved Gemma's outputs. Gemma generally produced more construct-aligned and
instructionally appropriate items than GPT-3.5's zero-shot responses, with
prompt design playing a key role in mid-size model performance. This study
demonstrates that structured prompting and efficient fine-tuning can enhance
midsized models for AIG under limited data conditions. We highlight the value
of combining automated metrics, expert judgment, and large-model simulation to
ensure alignment with assessment goals. The proposed workflow offers a
practical and scalable way to develop and validate language assessment items
for K-12.

paper presents a fully open-source methodology for integrating SystemC TLM
models into Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI)-based co-simulation workflows.
By encapsulating SystemC TLM components as FMI 3.0 Co Simulation Functional
Mock-up Units (FMUs), the proposed approach facilitates seamless, standardized
integration across heterogeneous simulation environments. We introduce a
lightweight open-source toolchain, address key technical challenges such as
time synchronization and data exchange, and demonstrate the feasibility and
effectiveness of the integration through representative case studies.

*Rikuto Kotoge,Mai Nishimura,Jiaxin Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DGPO enables compact language models to achieve sophisticated agentic RAG behaviors through teacher demonstration initialization and continuous guidance, outperforming larger models in some cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compact language models struggle with agentic RAG behaviors due to poor reasoning ability, sparse rewards, and unstable training, making agentic RAG infeasible in resource-constrained environments.

Method: Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization (DGPO) uses cold-start initialization from teacher demonstrations and continuous teacher guidance during policy optimization.

Result: DGPO enables compact models to achieve sophisticated agentic search behaviors, outperforming larger teacher models in some cases, and makes agentic RAG feasible in computing resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: DGPO successfully addresses the challenges of training compact language models for agentic RAG through teacher-guided policy optimization, enabling deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a post-training approach to elicit
agentic RAG behaviors such as search and planning from language models.
However, compact language models (e.g., 0.5B parameters) struggle due to poor
reasoning ability, resulting in sparse rewards and unstable training. To
overcome these difficulties, we propose Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization
(DGPO), which addresses the challenges through cold-start initialization from
teacher demonstrations and continuous teacher guidance during policy
optimization. To systematically evaluate our approach, we introduce Agentic RAG
Capabilities (ARC), a fine-grained metric analyzing reasoning, search
coordination, and response synthesis. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that DGPO enables compact models to achieve sophisticated agentic search
behaviors, even outperforming the larger teacher model in some cases. DGPO
makes agentic RAG feasible in computing resource-constrained environments.

### [127] [GUARD: Guideline Upholding Test through Adaptive Role-play and Jailbreak Diagnostics for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20325)
*Haibo Jin,Ruoxi Chen,Peiyan Zhang,Andy Zhou,Yang Zhang,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GUARD is a testing method that converts high-level AI ethics guidelines into actionable test questions to verify LLM compliance, including jailbreak diagnostics to identify safety bypass scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap between high-level government AI ethics guidelines and practical testing methods to verify LLM compliance and prevent harmful responses.

Method: Automated generation of guideline-violating questions from government guidelines, with jailbreak diagnostics (GUARD-JD) to provoke unethical responses and test safety mechanisms.

Result: Empirically validated on 7 LLMs including Vicuna, Llama, GPT, and Claude models, showing effectiveness in testing compliance under three government guidelines and transferring jailbreak diagnostics to vision-language models.

Conclusion: GUARD provides a practical framework for operationalizing AI ethics guidelines into actionable testing, helping promote reliable LLM applications through comprehensive compliance assessment.

Abstract: As Large Language Models become increasingly integral to various domains,
their potential to generate harmful responses has prompted significant societal
and regulatory concerns. In response, governments have issued ethics guidelines
to promote the development of trustworthy AI. However, these guidelines are
typically high-level demands for developers and testers, leaving a gap in
translating them into actionable testing questions to verify LLM compliance.
  To address this challenge, we introduce GUARD (\textbf{G}uideline
\textbf{U}pholding Test through \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{R}ole-play and
Jailbreak \textbf{D}iagnostics), a testing method designed to operationalize
guidelines into specific guideline-violating questions that assess LLM
adherence. To implement this, GUARD uses automated generation of
guideline-violating questions based on government-issued guidelines, thereby
testing whether responses comply with these guidelines. When responses directly
violate guidelines, GUARD reports inconsistencies. Furthermore, for responses
that do not directly violate guidelines, GUARD integrates the concept of
``jailbreaks'' to diagnostics, named GUARD-JD, which creates scenarios that
provoke unethical or guideline-violating responses, effectively identifying
potential scenarios that could bypass built-in safety mechanisms. Our method
finally culminates in a compliance report, delineating the extent of adherence
and highlighting any violations.
  We have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on seven LLMs,
including Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, Llama2-7B, Llama-3-8B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4,
GPT-4o, and Claude-3.7, by testing compliance under three government-issued
guidelines and conducting jailbreak diagnostics. Additionally, GUARD-JD can
transfer jailbreak diagnostics to vision-language models, demonstrating its
usage in promoting reliable LLM-based applications.

### [128] [Joint Enhancement of Relational Reasoning for Long-Context LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20351)
*Zhirui Chen,Wei Shen,Jiashui Huang,Ling Shao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: JERR is a novel framework that enhances long-context comprehension in LLMs through graph-based reasoning, combining synopsis extraction, DAG construction, and Monte Carlo Tree Search to improve reliability and transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with long contexts due to memory limitations, inability to handle complex tasks, lack of transparency, and tendency to produce hallucinations.

Method: Three-step framework: 1) Strategic text chunking for synopsis extraction, 2) Directed acyclic graph construction to resolve redundancy and ensure logical consistency, 3) Monte Carlo Tree Search for navigating complex reasoning paths.

Result: JERR consistently outperforms all baselines on ROUGE and F1 metrics, achieving highest scores on LLM-Rater evaluation.

Conclusion: JERR provides a novel solution enabling LLMs to handle extended contexts and complex reasoning tasks with improved reliability and transparency.

Abstract: Despite significant progress, large language models (LLMs) still struggle
with long contexts due to memory limitations and their inability to tackle
complex and long-context tasks. Additionally, LLMs often suffer from a lack of
transparency and are prone to producing hallucinations. To address these
challenges, we propose \textbf{JERR}, a novel framework designed to enhance
long-context comprehension via graph-based reasoning in LLMs. JERR integrates
three key components: synopsis extraction, graph construction, and relational
reasoning. First, synopsis is extracted by chunking text strategically,
allowing the model to summarize and understand information more efficiently.
Second, we build a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to resolve redundancy, ensuring
logical consistency and clarity. Finally, we incorporate Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to help the model navigate complex reasoning paths, ensuring more
accurate and interpretable outputs. This framework provides a novel solution
that enables LLMs to handle extended contexts and complex reasoning tasks with
improved reliability and transparency. Experimental results show that JERR
consistently outperforms all baselines on the ROUGE and F1 metrics, achieving
the highest scores on the LLM-Rater evaluation.

### [129] [Graph-R1: Unleashing LLM Reasoning with NP-Hard Graph Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20373)
*Yuyao Wang,Bowen Liu,Jianheng Tang,Nuo Chen,Yuhan Li,Qifan Zhang,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Using NP-hard graph problems as synthetic training data to develop long chain-of-thought reasoning in LLMs through SFT and RL, achieving strong generalization across multiple domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Long CoT development relies on costly human-curated datasets (math/code), leaving scalable alternatives unexplored. NP-hard graph problems inherently require deep reasoning and extensive exploration similar to Long CoT.

Method: Two-stage post-training: 1) Long CoT Supervised Fine-Tuning on rejection-sampled NP-hard graph instances, 2) Reinforcement Learning with fine-grained reward design to improve reasoning efficiency.

Result: Graph-R1-7B model demonstrates strong generalization across mathematics, coding, STEM, and logic, surpassing QwQ-32B on NP-hard graph problems in both accuracy and reasoning efficiency.

Conclusion: NP-hard graph problems serve as an effective and scalable resource for advancing Long CoT reasoning in LLMs, opening new frontiers for LLM post-training.

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
progress on complex reasoning tasks, largely enabled by their long
chain-of-thought (Long CoT) capabilities. However, developing these Long CoT
behaviors relies heavily on post-training with high-quality datasets, which are
typically costly and human-curated (e.g., mathematics and code), leaving
scalable alternatives unexplored. In this work, we introduce NP-hard (NPH)
graph problems as a novel synthetic training corpus, as they inherently require
deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and reflective strategies, which are
core characteristics of Long CoT reasoning. Building on this insight, we
develop a two-stage post-training framework: (i) Long CoT Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) on rejection-sampled NPH graph instances, which substantially
enhances reasoning depth, and (ii) Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a
fine-grained reward design, which sharpens reasoning efficiency. Our flagship
model, Graph-R1-7B, demonstrates strong generalization across mathematics,
coding, STEM, and logic, and surpasses QwQ-32B on NPH graph problems in both
accuracy and reasoning efficiency. These results position NPH graph problems as
an effective and scalable resource for advancing Long CoT reasoning in LLMs,
opening a new frontier for LLM post-training. Our implementation is available
at https://github.com/Graph-Reasoner/Graph-R1, with models and datasets hosted
in our Hugging Face collection HKUST-DSAIL/Graph-R1.

### [130] [CAPE: Context-Aware Personality Evaluation Framework for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20385)
*Jivnesh Sandhan,Fei Cheng,Tushar Sandhan,Yugo Murawaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes CAPE framework for context-aware personality evaluation of LLMs, showing conversational history enhances consistency but causes personality shifts, with GPT models being more robust than Gemini and Llama models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional psychometric tests for LLMs use context-free approaches that ignore real-world conversational history, creating an artificial evaluation setting.

Method: Developed Context-Aware Personality Evaluation (CAPE) framework with novel metrics to quantify response consistency, tested on 7 LLMs including GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4-Turbo, Gemini-1.5-Flash, and Llama-8B.

Result: Conversational history enhances response consistency via in-context learning but induces personality shifts, with GPT models showing extreme deviations. GPT models are robust to question ordering while Gemini and Llama are sensitive. Context-dependent shifts improve consistency and human alignment in RPAs.

Conclusion: Context-aware evaluation is crucial for realistic personality assessment of LLMs, as conversational history significantly impacts response consistency and personality traits, with different models showing varying levels of context dependence.

Abstract: Psychometric tests, traditionally used to assess humans, are now being
applied to Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate their behavioral traits.
However, existing studies follow a context-free approach, answering each
question in isolation to avoid contextual influence. We term this the Disney
World test, an artificial setting that ignores real-world applications, where
conversational history shapes responses. To bridge this gap, we propose the
first Context-Aware Personality Evaluation (CAPE) framework for LLMs,
incorporating prior conversational interactions. To thoroughly analyze the
influence of context, we introduce novel metrics to quantify the consistency of
LLM responses, a fundamental trait in human behavior.
  Our exhaustive experiments on 7 LLMs reveal that conversational history
enhances response consistency via in-context learning but also induces
personality shifts, with GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-Turbo exhibiting extreme
deviations. While GPT models are robust to question ordering, Gemini-1.5-Flash
and Llama-8B display significant sensitivity. Moreover, GPT models response
stem from their intrinsic personality traits as well as prior interactions,
whereas Gemini-1.5-Flash and Llama--8B heavily depend on prior interactions.
Finally, applying our framework to Role Playing Agents (RPAs) shows
context-dependent personality shifts improve response consistency and better
align with human judgments. Our code and datasets are publicly available at:

### [131] [Measuring Reasoning Utility in LLMs via Conditional Entropy Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20395)
*Xu Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Analyzing reasoning step utility in LLMs shows that decreasing conditional entropy during generation correlates with correct answers, while flat/increasing entropy indicates wrong answers. Incorrect reasoning tends to be longer, suggesting longer reasoning doesn't guarantee better outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs generate intermediate reasoning steps to improve accuracy, there's limited understanding of how these steps actually contribute to final answer correctness. The stochastic nature of generation means more context doesn't ensure better confidence, so predicting reasoning step utility could enable early stopping or pruning of ineffective steps.

Method: Oracle study on MATH dataset using Qwen2.5-32B and GPT-4o to generate reasoning chains, then using Qwen3-8B to quantify utility. Measured model uncertainty on answer span at each step using conditional entropy (expected negative log-likelihood) as context expands step-by-step.

Result: Clear pattern: decreasing conditional entropy over steps strongly associated with correct answers, while flat or increasing entropy often results in wrong answers. Incorrect reasoning paths tend to be longer than correct ones, indicating longer reasoning doesn't necessarily yield better outcomes.

Conclusion: These findings provide foundation for designing efficient reasoning pipelines that can detect and avoid unproductive reasoning early, potentially improving LLM efficiency and accuracy by pruning ineffective reasoning steps during generation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) often rely on generating
intermediate reasoning steps to enhance accuracy. However, little work has
examined how reasoning utility contributes to the final answer's correctness.
Due to the stochastic nature of autoregressive generation, generating more
context does not guarantee increased confidence in the answer. If we could
predict, during generation, whether a reasoning step will be useful, we could
stop early or prune ineffective steps, avoiding distractions in the final
decision.
  We present an oracle study on MATH dataset, using Qwen2.5-32B and GPT-4o to
generate reasoning chains, and then employing a separate model (Qwen3-8B) to
quantify the utility of these chains for final accuracy. Specifically, we
measure the model's uncertainty on the answer span Y at each reasoning step
using conditional entropy (expected negative log-likelihood over the
vocabulary) with context expanding step by step. Our results show a clear
pattern: conditional entropy that decreases over steps is strongly associated
with correct answers, whereas flat or increasing entropy often results in wrong
answers. We also corroborate that incorrect reasoning paths tend to be longer
than correct ones, suggesting that longer reasoning does not necessarily yield
better outcomes. These findings serve as a foundation to inspire future work on
designing efficient reasoning pipelines that detect and avoid unproductive
reasoning early.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DentalBench is the first comprehensive bilingual benchmark for evaluating LLMs in dentistry, consisting of DentalQA (36,597 questions) and DentalCorpus (337.35M tokens), revealing significant performance gaps and showing domain adaptation substantially improves dental knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs show strong performance on general medical benchmarks but their capabilities in specialized fields like dentistry remain underexplored due to lack of targeted evaluation resources.

Method: Created DentalBench with two components: DentalQA (bilingual QA benchmark with 36,597 questions across 4 tasks and 16 subfields) and DentalCorpus (large-scale dental corpus for domain adaptation). Evaluated 14 LLMs and conducted domain adaptation experiments with Qwen-2.5-3B.

Result: Significant performance gaps were revealed across task types and languages. Domain adaptation substantially improved model performance, particularly on knowledge-intensive and terminology-focused tasks.

Conclusion: Domain-specific benchmarks are crucial for developing trustworthy and effective LLMs tailored to healthcare applications, and domain adaptation significantly enhances performance in specialized medical fields like dentistry.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and medical LLMs (Med-LLMs)
have demonstrated strong performance on general medical benchmarks. However,
their capabilities in specialized medical fields, such as dentistry which
require deeper domain-specific knowledge, remain underexplored due to the lack
of targeted evaluation resources. In this paper, we introduce DentalBench, the
first comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to evaluate and advance LLMs
in the dental domain. DentalBench consists of two main components: DentalQA, an
English-Chinese question-answering (QA) benchmark with 36,597 questions
spanning 4 tasks and 16 dental subfields; and DentalCorpus, a large-scale,
high-quality corpus with 337.35 million tokens curated for dental domain
adaptation, supporting both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We evaluate 14 LLMs, covering
proprietary, open-source, and medical-specific models, and reveal significant
performance gaps across task types and languages. Further experiments with
Qwen-2.5-3B demonstrate that domain adaptation substantially improves model
performance, particularly on knowledge-intensive and terminology-focused tasks,
and highlight the importance of domain-specific benchmarks for developing
trustworthy and effective LLMs tailored to healthcare applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KG-CQR is a framework that enhances RAG retrieval by using knowledge graphs to enrich query contexts, achieving 4-6% mAP and 2-3% Recall@25 improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve retrieval phase of RAG systems by addressing query enrichment through structured knowledge graph representations rather than just corpus-level context loss.

Method: Model-agnostic pipeline with subgraph extraction, completion, and contextual generation modules that enrich complex input queries using corpus-centric knowledge graphs.

Result: 4-6% improvement in mAP and 2-3% improvement in Recall@25 on RAGBench and MultiHop-RAG datasets, with consistent outperformance on multi-hop QA tasks.

Conclusion: KG-CQR effectively enhances retrieval effectiveness in RAG systems through structured knowledge graph-based query enrichment, demonstrating scalability across various LLM sizes.

Abstract: The integration of knowledge graphs (KGs) with large language models (LLMs)
offers significant potential to improve the retrieval phase of
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. In this study, we propose KG-CQR,
a novel framework for Contextual Query Retrieval (CQR) that enhances the
retrieval phase by enriching the contextual representation of complex input
queries using a corpus-centric KG. Unlike existing methods that primarily
address corpus-level context loss, KG-CQR focuses on query enrichment through
structured relation representations, extracting and completing relevant KG
subgraphs to generate semantically rich query contexts. Comprising subgraph
extraction, completion, and contextual generation modules, KG-CQR operates as a
model-agnostic pipeline, ensuring scalability across LLMs of varying sizes
without additional training. Experimental results on RAGBench and MultiHop-RAG
datasets demonstrate KG-CQR's superior performance, achieving a 4-6%
improvement in mAP and a 2-3% improvement in Recall@25 over strong baseline
models. Furthermore, evaluations on challenging RAG tasks such as multi-hop
question answering show that, by incorporating KG-CQR, the performance
consistently outperforms the existing baseline in terms of retrieval
effectiveness

TL;DR: A specialized benchmark for evaluating LLMs in civil aviation maintenance, addressing the lack of domain-specific evaluation tools and enabling targeted improvements through performance assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluation focuses primarily on mathematical and coding tasks, leaving a significant gap in specialized domains like civil aviation maintenance which requires sophisticated reasoning and domain knowledge.

Method: Developed an industrial-grade benchmark specifically for civil aviation maintenance, using it to evaluate existing vector embedding models and LLMs, with experimental exploration and analysis of model performance.

Result: The benchmark effectively assesses model capabilities in civil aviation maintenance, identifies specific knowledge gaps and reasoning deficiencies, and provides foundation for targeted improvement efforts.

Conclusion: This work fills a critical gap in LLM evaluation by providing a specialized benchmark for civil aviation maintenance, which is open-sourced to foster further research and development in this domain.

Abstract: Civil aviation maintenance is a domain characterized by stringent industry
standards. Within this field, maintenance procedures and troubleshooting
represent critical, knowledge-intensive tasks that require sophisticated
reasoning. To address the lack of specialized evaluation tools for large
language models (LLMs) in this vertical, we propose and develop an
industrial-grade benchmark specifically designed for civil aviation
maintenance. This benchmark serves a dual purpose: It provides a standardized
tool to measure LLM capabilities within civil aviation maintenance, identifying
specific gaps in domain knowledge and complex reasoning. By pinpointing these
deficiencies, the benchmark establishes a foundation for targeted improvement
efforts (e.g., domain-specific fine-tuning, RAG optimization, or specialized
prompt engineering), ultimately facilitating progress toward more intelligent
solutions within civil aviation maintenance. Our work addresses a significant
gap in the current LLM evaluation, which primarily focuses on mathematical and
coding reasoning tasks. In addition, given that Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems are currently the dominant solutions in practical applications ,
we leverage this benchmark to evaluate existing well-known vector embedding
models and LLMs for civil aviation maintenance scenarios. Through experimental
exploration and analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark in
assessing model performance within this domain, and we open-source this

*Agung Sukrisna Jaya,Osvari Arsalan,Danny Matthew Saputra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CBR system using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity for practical work title search achieves high match accuracy with 705 titles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient case-based reasoning system for searching practical work titles using previous experience and similarity matching.

Method: Used Case Base Reasoning with TF-IDF for text vectorization and Cosine Similarity for calculating similarity values between titles/keywords.

Result: System successfully found same number of titles with highest average match score when testing with randomized titles from original dataset.

Conclusion: The CBR approach with TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity is effective for practical work title search and retrieval systems.

Abstract: Case Base Reasoning (CBR) is a case solving technique based on experience in
cases that have occurred before with the highest similarity. CBR is used to
search for practical work titles. TF-IDF is applied to process the
vectorization of each practical work title word and Cosine Similarity for the
calculation of similarity values. This system can search either in the form of
titles or keywords. The output of the system is the title of practical work and
the match value of each title. Based on the test results using 705 practical
work titles, testing was carried out with five titles and carried out in two
stages. The first stage searches with existing titles and the second stage
randomizes the title from the first stage. And the results obtained in the

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MCP-Bench is a new benchmark that evaluates LLMs on realistic multi-step tasks requiring tool use, cross-tool coordination, and planning across 28 live MCP servers with 250 tools spanning multiple domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to adequately evaluate LLMs' capabilities in realistic multi-step tool usage, cross-tool coordination, parameter control, and planning across diverse domains with authentic workflows.

Method: Built on Model Context Protocol (MCP) connecting to 28 live servers across domains like finance, travel, scientific computing, and academic search. Features 250 complementary tools designed to work together for authentic multi-step tasks with rich input-output coupling.

Result: Experiments on 20 advanced LLMs reveal persistent challenges in handling the benchmark's complex requirements, demonstrating that current models struggle with realistic multi-step tool coordination and planning tasks.

Conclusion: MCP-Bench provides a more comprehensive evaluation framework that reveals significant gaps in LLMs' tool usage capabilities, highlighting the need for improved planning, cross-tool coordination, and multi-step reasoning in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce MCP-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating large language models
(LLMs) on realistic, multi-step tasks that demand tool use, cross-tool
coordination, precise parameter control, and planning/reasoning for solving
tasks. Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), MCP-Bench connects LLMs to 28
representative live MCP servers spanning 250 tools across domains such as
finance, traveling, scientific computing, and academic search. Unlike prior
API-based benchmarks, each MCP server provides a set of complementary tools
designed to work together, enabling the construction of authentic, multi-step
tasks with rich input-output coupling. Tasks in MCP-Bench test agents' ability
to retrieve relevant tools from fuzzy instructions without explicit tool names,
plan multi-hop execution trajectories for complex objectives, ground responses
in intermediate tool outputs, and orchestrate cross-domain workflows -
capabilities not adequately evaluated by existing benchmarks that rely on
explicit tool specifications, shallow few-step workflows, and isolated domain
operations. We propose a multi-faceted evaluation framework covering tool-level
schema understanding and usage, trajectory-level planning, and task completion.

*Yucheng Ruan,Xiang Lan,Daniel J. Tan,Hairil Rizal Abdullah,Mengling Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Deep learning framework using NLP to integrate multimodal EHRs (structured data + free-text notes) for predicting ICU mortality and resource utilization, showing improved performance and robustness against data corruption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches focus mainly on structured EHRs and ignore valuable clinical insights in free-text notes, while not fully leveraging textual information within structured data for ICU outcome prediction.

Method: Developed deep learning framework with natural language processing techniques using two real-world EHR datasets. Included ablation study on medical prompts, free-texts, and pre-trained sentence encoder. Assessed robustness against structured data corruption.

Result: Improved performance by 1.6%/0.8% on BACC/AUROC for mortality prediction, 0.5%/2.2% on RMSE/MAE for LOS prediction, and 10.9%/11.0% on RMSE/MAE for surgical duration estimation compared to best existing methods. Showed strong resilience to data corruption.

Conclusion: Effective and accurate deep learning approach for critical care prediction. Highlights success of prompt learning with transformer encoder for multimodal EHR analysis and demonstrates strong data corruption resilience, especially at high corruption levels.

Abstract: Background Predicting mortality and resource utilization from electronic
health records (EHRs) is challenging yet crucial for optimizing patient
outcomes and managing costs in intensive care unit (ICU). Existing approaches
predominantly focus on structured EHRs, often ignoring the valuable clinical
insights in free-text notes. Additionally, the potential of textual information
within structured data is not fully leveraged. This study aimed to introduce
and assess a deep learning framework using natural language processing
techniques that integrates multimodal EHRs to predict mortality and resource
utilization in critical care settings. Methods Utilizing two real-world EHR
datasets, we developed and evaluated our model on three clinical tasks with
leading existing methods. We also performed an ablation study on three key
components in our framework: medical prompts, free-texts, and pre-trained
sentence encoder. Furthermore, we assessed the model's robustness against the
corruption in structured EHRs. Results Our experiments on two real-world
datasets across three clinical tasks showed that our proposed model improved
performance metrics by 1.6\%/0.8\% on BACC/AUROC for mortality prediction,
0.5%/2.2% on RMSE/MAE for LOS prediction, 10.9%/11.0% on RMSE/MAE for surgical
duration estimation compared to the best existing methods. It consistently
demonstrated superior performance compared to other baselines across three
tasks at different corruption rates. Conclusions The proposed framework is an
effective and accurate deep learning approach for predicting mortality and
resource utilization in critical care. The study also highlights the success of
using prompt learning with a transformer encoder in analyzing multimodal EHRs.
Importantly, the model showed strong resilience to data corruption within
structured data, especially at high corruption levels.

*Luke Bates,Max Glockner,Preslav Nakov,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ConspirED dataset for analyzing cognitive traits in conspiracy content, used to test AI model vulnerabilities to conspiratorial reasoning patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conspiracy theories erode public trust and resist debunking, while AI-generated misinformation becomes more sophisticated, requiring better understanding of conspiratorial rhetoric patterns.

Method: Created ConspirED dataset with multi-sentence excerpts from online conspiracy articles annotated using CONSPIR cognitive framework, then developed computational models and evaluated LLM/LRM robustness.

Result: Both computational models and large language models were misaligned by conspiratorial content, producing output that mirrored input reasoning patterns even when successfully deflecting fact-checked misinformation.

Conclusion: The study highlights AI vulnerabilities to conspiratorial reasoning and provides a dataset for developing interventions like targeted prebunking against conspiracy theories.

Abstract: Conspiracy theories erode public trust in science and institutions while
resisting debunking by evolving and absorbing counter-evidence. As AI-generated
misinformation becomes increasingly sophisticated, understanding rhetorical
patterns in conspiratorial content is important for developing interventions
such as targeted prebunking and assessing AI vulnerabilities. We introduce
ConspirED (CONSPIR Evaluation Dataset), which captures the cognitive traits of
conspiratorial ideation in multi-sentence excerpts (80--120 words) from online
conspiracy articles, annotated using the CONSPIR cognitive framework
(Lewandowsky and Cook, 2020). ConspirED is the first dataset of conspiratorial
content annotated for general cognitive traits. Using ConspirED, we (i) develop
computational models that identify conspiratorial traits and determine dominant
traits in text excerpts, and (ii) evaluate large language/reasoning model
(LLM/LRM) robustness to conspiratorial inputs. We find that both are misaligned
by conspiratorial content, producing output that mirrors input reasoning
patterns, even when successfully deflecting comparable fact-checked
misinformation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FLORES+ benchmark has quality issues - translations fall below claimed standards, source texts are culturally biased, and evaluation is vulnerable to simple heuristics like copying named entities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the suitability of widely-used FLORES+ multilingual MT benchmark and identify its shortcomings for truly multilingual evaluation.

Method: Human assessments of translations in 4 languages (Asante Twi, Japanese, Jinghpaw, South Azerbaijani), analysis of translation quality, cultural bias, and testing simple heuristics like named entity copying.

Result: Many translations below 90% quality standard, source sentences are domain-specific and culturally biased toward English-speaking world, simple heuristics yield non-trivial BLEU scores, MT models trained on high-quality data perform poorly on FLORES+.

Conclusion: Need for multilingual MT benchmarks that use domain-general, culturally neutral source texts and rely less on named entities to better reflect real-world translation challenges.

Abstract: Multilingual machine translation (MT) benchmarks play a central role in
evaluating the capabilities of modern MT systems. Among them, the FLORES+
benchmark is widely used, offering English-to-many translation data for over
200 languages, curated with strict quality control protocols. However, we study
data in four languages (Asante Twi, Japanese, Jinghpaw, and South Azerbaijani)
and uncover critical shortcomings in the benchmark's suitability for truly
multilingual evaluation. Human assessments reveal that many translations fall
below the claimed 90% quality standard, and the annotators report that source
sentences are often too domain-specific and culturally biased toward the
English-speaking world. We further demonstrate that simple heuristics, such as
copying named entities, can yield non-trivial BLEU scores, suggesting
vulnerabilities in the evaluation protocol. Notably, we show that MT models
trained on high-quality, naturalistic data perform poorly on FLORES+ while
achieving significant gains on our domain-relevant evaluation set. Based on
these findings, we advocate for multilingual MT benchmarks that use
domain-general and culturally neutral source texts rely less on named entities,
in order to better reflect real-world translation challenges.

*Pengjiang Li,Zaitian Wang,Xinhao Zhang,Ran Zhang,Lu Jiang,Pengfei Wang,Yuanchun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SciTopic is an LLM-enhanced topic discovery method that improves scientific topic identification by integrating entropy-based sampling and triplet optimization guided by large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing topic discovery methods rely on word embeddings and struggle with complex text relationships, lacking comprehensive understanding of scientific publications despite the exceptional comprehension capabilities of large language models.

Method: Builds a textual encoder for scientific publications, constructs space optimization with entropy-based sampling and LLM-guided triplet tasks, fine-tunes encoder using contrastive loss optimization based on LLM guidance.

Result: Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show SciTopic outperforms state-of-the-art scientific topic discovery methods.

Conclusion: SciTopic enables researchers to gain deeper and faster insights into scientific literature by leveraging LLMs for enhanced topic discovery.

Abstract: Topic discovery in scientific literature provides valuable insights for
researchers to identify emerging trends and explore new avenues for
investigation, facilitating easier scientific information retrieval. Many
machine learning methods, particularly deep embedding techniques, have been
applied to discover research topics. However, most existing topic discovery
methods rely on word embedding to capture the semantics and lack a
comprehensive understanding of scientific publications, struggling with
complex, high-dimensional text relationships. Inspired by the exceptional
comprehension of textual information by large language models (LLMs), we
propose an advanced topic discovery method enhanced by LLMs to improve
scientific topic identification, namely SciTopic. Specifically, we first build
a textual encoder to capture the content from scientific publications,
including metadata, title, and abstract. Next, we construct a space
optimization module that integrates entropy-based sampling and triplet tasks
guided by LLMs, enhancing the focus on thematic relevance and contextual
intricacies between ambiguous instances. Then, we propose to fine-tune the
textual encoder based on the guidance from the LLMs by optimizing the
contrastive loss of the triplets, forcing the text encoder to better
discriminate instances of different topics. Finally, extensive experiments
conducted on three real-world datasets of scientific publications demonstrate
that SciTopic outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) scientific topic
discovery methods, enabling researchers to gain deeper and faster insights.

### [144] [Adaptive Federated Distillation for Multi-Domain Non-IID Textual Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20557)
*Jiahao Xiao,Jiangming Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Adaptive Federated Distillation (AdaFD) framework to handle multi-domain non-IID data challenges in federated learning, with comprehensive benchmarking for real-world NLP scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated learning approaches primarily focus on label diversity but neglect language domain diversity, which is crucial for NLP applications in real environments with highly different local data distributions.

Method: Introduces a comprehensive set of multi-domain non-IID scenarios and proposes AdaFD framework that adaptively handles both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings to capture client diversity.

Result: Experimental results show the proposed models effectively capture local client diversity and achieve superior performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The AdaFD framework successfully addresses multi-domain non-IID challenges in federated learning for NLP, providing a robust solution for real-world applications with diverse language domains.

Abstract: The widespread success of pre-trained language models has established a new
training paradigm, where a global PLM is fine-tuned using task-specific data
from local clients. The local data are highly different from each other and can
not capture the global distribution of the whole data in real world. To address
the challenges of non-IID data in real environments, privacy-preserving
federated distillation has been proposed and highly investigated. However,
previous experimental non-IID scenarios are primarily identified with the label
(output) diversity, without considering the diversity of language domains
(input) that is crucial in natural language processing. In this paper, we
introduce a comprehensive set of multi-domain non-IID scenarios and propose a
unified benchmarking framework that includes diverse data. The benchmark can be
used to evaluate the federated learning framework in a real environment. To
this end, we propose an Adaptive Federated Distillation (AdaFD) framework
designed to address multi-domain non-IID challenges in both homogeneous and
heterogeneous settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our models
capture the diversity of local clients and achieve better performance compared
to the existing works. The code for this paper is available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a novel generative framework for Query-Driven Text Summarization that uses model distillation and optimization techniques to create a lightweight 0.1B parameter model that outperforms traditional extractive approaches while maintaining high deployment efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional extractive summarization models suffer from cumulative information loss in multi-stage pipelines and lack sufficient semantic understanding of complex user queries and documents, limiting their effectiveness in industrial web search applications.

Method: Integrates large model distillation, supervised fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and lookahead decoding to transform a lightweight 0.1B parameter model into a domain-specialized QDTS expert.

Result: Outperforms production baseline and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple industry-relevant metrics, with excellent deployment efficiency (334 NVIDIA L20 GPUs for ~50,000 queries per second at 55ms average latency).

Conclusion: The proposed generative framework successfully addresses limitations of traditional extractive approaches and demonstrates practical viability for real-time industrial web search applications with superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: In the dynamic landscape of large-scale web search, Query-Driven Text
Summarization (QDTS) aims to generate concise and informative summaries from
textual documents based on a given query, which is essential for improving user
engagement and facilitating rapid decision-making. Traditional extractive
summarization models, based primarily on ranking candidate summary segments,
have been the dominant approach in industrial applications. However, these
approaches suffer from two key limitations: 1) The multi-stage pipeline often
introduces cumulative information loss and architectural bottlenecks due to its
weakest component; 2) Traditional models lack sufficient semantic understanding
of both user queries and documents, particularly when dealing with complex
search intents. In this study, we propose a novel framework to pioneer the
application of generative models to address real-time QDTS in industrial web
search. Our approach integrates large model distillation, supervised
fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and lookahead decoding to
transform a lightweight model with only 0.1B parameters into a
domain-specialized QDTS expert. Evaluated on multiple industry-relevant
metrics, our model outperforms the production baseline and achieves a new state
of the art. Furthermore, it demonstrates excellent deployment efficiency,
requiring only 334 NVIDIA L20 GPUs to handle \textasciitilde50,000 queries per
second under 55~ms average latency per query.

TL;DR: KCS framework improves multi-hop QA by sampling diverse knowledge compositions using conditional prediction and contrastive loss, achieving 3.9% better accuracy and data augmentation improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data sparsity in multi-hop QA where models learn spurious patterns, and overcome limitations of prior approaches that neglect essential knowledge integration.

Method: Knowledge Composition Sampling (KCS) models knowledge composition selection as sentence-level conditional prediction with probabilistic contrastive loss, using stochastic decoding for inference.

Result: 3.9% improvement in knowledge composition selection accuracy, with data augmentation yielding improvements on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA datasets.

Conclusion: KCS effectively expands question diversity by better integrating relevant knowledge, demonstrating superior performance over competitive baselines in multi-hop QA tasks.

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering faces substantial challenges due to data
sparsity, which increases the likelihood of language models learning spurious
patterns. To address this issue, prior research has focused on diversifying
question generation through content planning and varied expression. However,
these approaches often emphasize generating simple questions and neglect the
integration of essential knowledge, such as relevant sentences within
documents. This paper introduces the Knowledge Composition Sampling (KCS), an
innovative framework designed to expand the diversity of generated multi-hop
questions by sampling varied knowledge compositions within a given context. KCS
models the knowledge composition selection as a sentence-level conditional
prediction task and utilizes a probabilistic contrastive loss to predict the
next most relevant piece of knowledge. During inference, we employ a stochastic
decoding strategy to effectively balance accuracy and diversity. Compared to
competitive baselines, our KCS improves the overall accuracy of knowledge
composition selection by 3.9%, and its application for data augmentation yields
improvements on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA datasets. Our code is available

TL;DR: Current GLM benchmarks are inadequate as they can be solved with unimodal information alone. The paper introduces CLEGR benchmark to properly evaluate multimodal reasoning and finds that GLMs struggle with structural reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation benchmarks for Graph-Language Models are insufficient and don't require true multimodal reasoning, as they can be solved using only unimodal information.

Method: Introduces CLEGR benchmark with synthetic graph generation pipeline and questions requiring joint reasoning over structure and text. Evaluates representative GLM architectures against soft-prompted LLM baselines.

Result: Soft-prompted LLM baselines perform on par with full GNN-backbone GLMs. GLMs show significant performance degradation in structural reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Current GLMs have limited graph reasoning capabilities. The findings question the architectural necessity of incorporating graph structure into LLMs and provide foundation for advancing multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Developments in Graph-Language Models (GLMs) aim to integrate the structural
reasoning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the semantic
understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, we demonstrate that
current evaluation benchmarks for GLMs, which are primarily repurposed
node-level classification datasets, are insufficient to assess multimodal
reasoning. Our analysis reveals that strong performance on these benchmarks is
achievable using unimodal information alone, suggesting that they do not
necessitate graph-language integration. To address this evaluation gap, we
introduce the CLEGR(Compositional Language-Graph Reasoning) benchmark, designed
to evaluate multimodal reasoning at various complexity levels. Our benchmark
employs a synthetic graph generation pipeline paired with questions that
require joint reasoning over structure and textual semantics. We perform a
thorough evaluation of representative GLM architectures and find that
soft-prompted LLM baselines perform on par with GLMs that incorporate a full
GNN backbone. This result calls into question the architectural necessity of
incorporating graph structure into LLMs. We further show that GLMs exhibit
significant performance degradation in tasks that require structural reasoning.
These findings highlight limitations in the graph reasoning capabilities of
current GLMs and provide a foundation for advancing the community toward
explicit multimodal reasoning involving graph structure and language.

TL;DR: A novel named entity correction method that uses speech sound features to retrieve candidate entities and a generative approach to annotate and replace entity errors in ASR transcripts, particularly effective when word forms differ significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end ASR systems often fail to transcribe domain-specific named entities, causing downstream task failures. Existing phonetic-based methods struggle when wrongly-transcribed words and ground-truth entities have significantly different forms.

Method: Utilizes speech sound features to retrieve candidate entities, then employs a generative method to annotate entity errors in ASR transcripts and replace text with correct entities.

Result: Significant improvement in entity accuracy demonstrated on both open-source and self-constructed test sets, particularly effective in scenarios with word form differences.

Conclusion: The proposed NEC method effectively addresses limitations of phonetic-based approaches by leveraging speech sound features and generative annotation, providing substantial improvements in named entity recognition accuracy for ASR systems.

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition systems often fail to transcribe
domain-specific named entities, causing catastrophic failures in downstream
tasks. Numerous fast and lightweight named entity correction (NEC) models have
been proposed in recent years. These models, mainly leveraging phonetic-level
edit distance algorithms, have shown impressive performances. However, when the
forms of the wrongly-transcribed words(s) and the ground-truth entity are
significantly different, these methods often fail to locate the wrongly
transcribed words in hypothesis, thus limiting their usage. We propose a novel
NEC method that utilizes speech sound features to retrieve candidate entities.
With speech sound features and candidate entities, we inovatively design a
generative method to annotate entity errors in ASR transcripts and replace the
text with correct entities. This method is effective in scenarios of word form
difference. We test our method using open-source and self-constructed test
sets. The results demonstrate that our NEC method can bring significant
improvement to entity accuracy. We will open source our self-constructed test
set and training data.

TL;DR: HArch is the first multi-lingual multi-label classification model for implicit discourse relation recognition, achieving state-of-the-art results on DiscoGeM corpora and outperforming LLMs like GPT-4o through hierarchical sense modeling and task-specific fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of multi-lingual and multi-label classification models for implicit discourse relation recognition (IDRR) and leverage hierarchical dependencies between discourse senses in the PDTB 3.0 framework.

Method: Developed HArch model that uses hierarchical dependencies between discourse senses to predict probability distributions across three sense levels. Compared pre-trained encoder backbones (RoBERTa, XLM-RoBERTa) and evaluated against LLMs (GPT-4o, Llama-4-Maverick) using few-shot prompting on DiscoGeM 2.0 corpus.

Result: RoBERTa-HArch achieved best performance in English, XLM-RoBERTa-HArch performed best in multi-lingual setting. Fine-tuned models consistently outperformed LLMs across all language configurations. Achieved state-of-the-art results on DiscoGeM 1.0 corpus.

Conclusion: Task-specific fine-tuning provides significant advantages over prompting LLMs for IDRR. The hierarchical approach effectively captures discourse sense dependencies and validates the model's effectiveness across multiple languages and datasets.

Abstract: This paper introduces the first multi-lingual and multi-label classification
model for implicit discourse relation recognition (IDRR). Our model, HArch, is
evaluated on the recently released DiscoGeM 2.0 corpus and leverages
hierarchical dependencies between discourse senses to predict probability
distributions across all three sense levels in the PDTB 3.0 framework. We
compare several pre-trained encoder backbones and find that RoBERTa-HArch
achieves the best performance in English, while XLM-RoBERTa-HArch performs best
in the multi-lingual setting. In addition, we compare our fine-tuned models
against GPT-4o and Llama-4-Maverick using few-shot prompting across all
language configurations. Our results show that our fine-tuned models
consistently outperform these LLMs, highlighting the advantages of
task-specific fine-tuning over prompting in IDRR. Finally, we report SOTA
results on the DiscoGeM 1.0 corpus, further validating the effectiveness of our
hierarchical approach.

*Ruiyi Yan,Yugo Murawaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses tokenization inconsistency (TI) issues in LLM-based steganography and watermarking, proposing two methods to eliminate TI which improve performance in both applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models have improved text generation but created tokenization inconsistency problems between sender and receiver in steganography/watermarking, undermining robustness. TI tokens show infrequency and temporariness characteristics.

Method: Proposed two tailored solutions: stepwise verification method for steganography and post-hoc rollback method for watermarking to address TI elimination.

Result: Experiments show improvements in steganography (fluency, imperceptibility, anti-steganalysis) and watermarking (detectability, robustness against attacks) compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: Directly addressing tokenization inconsistency through tailored methods significantly enhances the performance and robustness of both steganography and watermarking systems using large language models.

Abstract: Large language models have significantly enhanced the capacities and
efficiency of text generation. On the one hand, they have improved the quality
of text-based steganography. On the other hand, they have also underscored the
importance of watermarking as a safeguard against malicious misuse. In this
study, we focus on tokenization inconsistency (TI) between Alice and Bob in
steganography and watermarking, where TI can undermine robustness. Our
investigation reveals that the problematic tokens responsible for TI exhibit
two key characteristics: infrequency and temporariness. Based on these
findings, we propose two tailored solutions for TI elimination: a stepwise
verification method for steganography and a post-hoc rollback method for
watermarking. Experiments show that (1) compared to traditional disambiguation
methods in steganography, directly addressing TI leads to improvements in
fluency, imperceptibility, and anti-steganalysis capacity; (2) for
watermarking, addressing TI enhances detectability and robustness against
attacks.

*Ning Shang,Yifei Liu,Yi Zhu,Li Lyna Zhang,Weijiang Xu,Xinyu Guan,Buze Zhang,Bingcheng Dong,Xudong Zhou,Bowen Zhang,Ying Xin,Ziming Miao,Scarlett Li,Fan Yang,Mao Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: rStar2-Agent is a 14B math reasoning model that achieves state-of-the-art performance through agentic reinforcement learning, featuring advanced cognitive behaviors like Python tool use and reflection on code execution feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a math reasoning model that goes beyond traditional chain-of-thought approaches by enabling autonomous exploration, verification, and refinement of intermediate steps in complex problem-solving through agentic capabilities.

Method: Three key innovations: (1) efficient RL infrastructure with reliable Python code environment for high-throughput execution, (2) GRPO-RoC algorithm with Resample-on-Correct strategy to handle coding environment noise, (3) multi-stage training recipe starting with non-reasoning SFT and progressing through RL stages.

Result: Achieves average pass@1 scores of 80.6% on AIME24 and 69.8% on AIME25, surpassing DeepSeek-R1 (671B) with significantly shorter responses. Trained in only 510 RL steps within one week using 64 MI300X GPUs.

Conclusion: rStar2-Agent demonstrates that agentic reinforcement learning can effectively scale to achieve frontier-level performance in math reasoning while also showing strong generalization to alignment, scientific reasoning, and tool-use tasks.

Abstract: We introduce rStar2-Agent, a 14B math reasoning model trained with agentic
reinforcement learning to achieve frontier-level performance. Beyond current
long CoT, the model demonstrates advanced cognitive behaviors, such as thinking
carefully before using Python coding tools and reflecting on code execution
feedback to autonomously explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps in
complex problem-solving. This capability is enabled through three key
innovations that makes agentic RL effective at scale: (i) an efficient RL
infrastructure with a reliable Python code environment that supports
high-throughput execution and mitigates the high rollout costs, enabling
training on limited GPU resources (64 MI300X GPUs); (ii) GRPO-RoC, an agentic
RL algorithm with a Resample-on-Correct rollout strategy that addresses the
inherent environment noises from coding tools, allowing the model to reason
more effectively in a code environment; (iii) An efficient agent training
recipe that starts with non-reasoning SFT and progresses through multi-RL
stages, yielding advanced cognitive abilities with minimal compute cost. To
this end, rStar2-Agent boosts a pre-trained 14B model to state of the art in
only 510 RL steps within one week, achieving average pass@1 scores of 80.6% on
AIME24 and 69.8% on AIME25, surpassing DeepSeek-R1 (671B) with significantly
shorter responses. Beyond mathematics, rStar2-Agent-14B also demonstrates
strong generalization to alignment, scientific reasoning, and agentic tool-use
tasks. Code and training recipes are available at

### [152] [Leveraging Semantic Triples for Private Document Generation with Local Differential Privacy Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20736)
*Stephen Meisenbacher,Maulik Chevli,Florian Matthes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DP-ST introduces semantic triple-based document generation under local differential privacy, enabling coherent text privatization at lower privacy budgets through neighborhood-aware processing and LLM post-processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Local differential privacy for text transformation is too demanding and requires high epsilon values, making practical privacy protection challenging. Current methods struggle to balance privacy and utility at reasonable privacy levels.

Method: DP-ST uses semantic triples for neighborhood-aware private document generation under local DP. It employs a divide-and-conquer approach with LLM post-processing to maintain text coherence while providing privacy guarantees within a defined neighborhood.

Result: The method enables coherent text generation even at lower epsilon values while maintaining privacy-utility balance. It demonstrates effectiveness of limiting DP notion to privatization neighborhoods and shows importance of coherence for balanced privatization outputs.

Conclusion: DP-ST successfully addresses local DP challenges for text privatization by leveraging semantic triples and neighborhood-aware processing, achieving better privacy-utility tradeoffs at reasonable epsilon levels through coherent text generation with LLM assistance.

Abstract: Many works at the intersection of Differential Privacy (DP) in Natural
Language Processing aim to protect privacy by transforming texts under DP
guarantees. This can be performed in a variety of ways, from word perturbations
to full document rewriting, and most often under local DP. Here, an input text
must be made indistinguishable from any other potential text, within some bound
governed by the privacy parameter $\varepsilon$. Such a guarantee is quite
demanding, and recent works show that privatizing texts under local DP can only
be done reasonably under very high $\varepsilon$ values. Addressing this
challenge, we introduce DP-ST, which leverages semantic triples for
neighborhood-aware private document generation under local DP guarantees.
Through the evaluation of our method, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the
divide-and-conquer paradigm, particularly when limiting the DP notion (and
privacy guarantees) to that of a privatization neighborhood. When combined with
LLM post-processing, our method allows for coherent text generation even at
lower $\varepsilon$ values, while still balancing privacy and utility. These
findings highlight the importance of coherence in achieving balanced
privatization outputs at reasonable $\varepsilon$ levels.

*Vassiliy Cheremetiev,Quang Long Ho Ngo,Chau Ying Kot,Alina Elena Baia,Andrea Cavallaro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuning general-purpose LLM-based embedding models achieves state-of-the-art performance for implicit hate speech detection without needing external knowledge or complex pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Implicit hate speech is challenging to detect because it uses indirect language without explicit derogatory words, and existing methods often require external knowledge or additional context information.

Method: Solely fine-tuning recent general-purpose embedding models based on large language models (Stella, Jasper, NV-Embed, E5) without external knowledge or additional information.

Result: Achieved up to 1.10 percentage points improvement for in-dataset evaluation and up to 20.35 percentage points improvement in cross-dataset evaluation in terms of F1-macro score across multiple IHS datasets.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning general-purpose LLM-based embedding models is an effective approach for implicit hate speech detection, outperforming previous methods that relied on external knowledge and complex pipelines.

Abstract: Implicit hate speech (IHS) is indirect language that conveys prejudice or
hatred through subtle cues, sarcasm or coded terminology. IHS is challenging to
detect as it does not include explicit derogatory or inflammatory words. To
address this challenge, task-specific pipelines can be complemented with
external knowledge or additional information such as context, emotions and
sentiment data. In this paper, we show that, by solely fine-tuning recent
general-purpose embedding models based on large language models (LLMs), such as
Stella, Jasper, NV-Embed and E5, we achieve state-of-the-art performance.
Experiments on multiple IHS datasets show up to 1.10 percentage points
improvements for in-dataset, and up to 20.35 percentage points improvements in
cross-dataset evaluation, in terms of F1-macro score.

*Yuanhao Ding,Esteban Garces Arias,Meimingwei Li,Julian Rodemann,Matthias Aßenmacher,Danlu Chen,Gaojuan Fan,Christian Heumann,Chongsheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GUARD is a self-adaptive decoding method that balances text diversity and coherence using global and local uncertainty signals, achieving faster generation with improved quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing contrastive search decoding methods suffer from hyperparameter dependence and high computational costs, limiting their practical utility in open-ended text generation.

Method: GUARD uses a 'Glocal' uncertainty-driven framework combining global entropy estimates with local entropy deviations, plus a token-count-based penalty to reduce computational overhead.

Result: GUARD achieves better balance between diversity and coherence, substantial speed improvements, and validated performance by both human and LLM evaluators across text quality dimensions.

Conclusion: GUARD provides an effective self-adaptive decoding approach that addresses the coherence-diversity trade-off with theoretical guarantees and practical efficiency improvements.

Abstract: Open-ended text generation faces a critical challenge: balancing coherence
with diversity in LLM outputs. While contrastive search-based decoding
strategies have emerged to address this trade-off, their practical utility is
often limited by hyperparameter dependence and high computational costs. We
introduce GUARD, a self-adaptive decoding method that effectively balances
these competing objectives through a novel "Glocal" uncertainty-driven
framework. GUARD combines global entropy estimates with local entropy
deviations to integrate both long-term and short-term uncertainty signals. We
demonstrate that our proposed global entropy formulation effectively mitigates
abrupt variations in uncertainty, such as sudden overconfidence or high entropy
spikes, and provides theoretical guarantees of unbiasedness and consistency. To
reduce computational overhead, we incorporate a simple yet effective
token-count-based penalty into GUARD. Experimental results demonstrate that
GUARD achieves a good balance between text diversity and coherence, while
exhibiting substantial improvements in generation speed. In a more nuanced
comparison study across different dimensions of text quality, both human and
LLM evaluators validated its remarkable performance. Our code is available at

*Xiaoyi Wang,Jiwei Zhang,Guangtao Zhang,Honglei Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-generated therapy dialogues lack emotional authenticity compared to real CBT sessions, showing less variability and weaker emotional dynamics, especially for clients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether synthetic therapy dialogues from LLMs capture the nuanced emotional dynamics of real therapy sessions, as these synthetic conversations are increasingly used in mental health NLP applications.

Method: Adapted Utterance Emotion Dynamics framework to analyze emotional trajectories across valence, arousal, and dominance dimensions. Compared real CBT sessions (transcribed from public videos) with synthetic dialogues from CACTUS dataset, examining both full dialogues and individual speaker roles.

Result: Synthetic dialogues are fluent and structurally coherent but diverge from real conversations in key emotional properties. Real sessions show greater emotional variability, more emotion-laden language, and more authentic patterns of reactivity and regulation. Emotional arc similarity is low, especially for clients.

Conclusion: Current LLM-generated therapy data has limitations in emotional fidelity, highlighting the importance of authentic emotional dynamics in mental health applications. Introduced RealCBT dataset to support future research.

Abstract: Synthetic therapy dialogues generated by large language models (LLMs) are
increasingly used in mental health NLP to simulate counseling scenarios, train
models, and supplement limited real-world data. However, it remains unclear
whether these synthetic conversations capture the nuanced emotional dynamics of
real therapy. In this work, we conduct the first comparative analysis of
emotional arcs between real and LLM-generated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
dialogues. We adapt the Utterance Emotion Dynamics framework to analyze
fine-grained affective trajectories across valence, arousal, and dominance
dimensions. Our analysis spans both full dialogues and individual speaker roles
(counselor and client), using real sessions transcribed from public videos and
synthetic dialogues from the CACTUS dataset. We find that while synthetic
dialogues are fluent and structurally coherent, they diverge from real
conversations in key emotional properties: real sessions exhibit greater
emotional variability,more emotion-laden language, and more authentic patterns
of reactivity and regulation. Moreover, emotional arc similarity between real
and synthetic speakers is low, especially for clients. These findings
underscore the limitations of current LLM-generated therapy data and highlight
the importance of emotional fidelity in mental health applications. We
introduce RealCBT, a curated dataset of real CBT sessions, to support future
research in this space.

*Harethah Abu Shairah,Hasan Abed Al Kader Hammoud,George Turkiyyah,Bernard Ghanem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ROSI is a white-box method that amplifies LLM safety by permanently steering activations toward refusal-mediating subspace through rank-one weight modification, improving safety refusal rates while preserving utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety mechanisms in LLMs can be bypassed by removing specific representational directions, so the authors propose an opposite approach to strengthen safety alignment.

Method: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI) - a fine-tuning-free rank-one weight modification applied to all residual stream write matrices, computed from harmful/harmless instruction pairs.

Result: ROSI consistently increases safety refusal rates (evaluated by Llama Guard 3) while preserving utility on standard benchmarks (MMLU, HellaSwag, Arc), and can re-align uncensored models.

Conclusion: Targeted weight steering is a cheap and effective mechanism to improve LLM safety, complementing resource-intensive fine-tuning approaches.

Abstract: Safety alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) often involves mediating
internal representations to refuse harmful requests. Recent research has
demonstrated that these safety mechanisms can be bypassed by ablating or
removing specific representational directions within the model. In this paper,
we propose the opposite approach: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI), a white-box
method that amplifies a model's safety alignment by permanently steering its
activations toward the refusal-mediating subspace. ROSI operates as a simple,
fine-tuning-free rank-one weight modification applied to all residual stream
write matrices. The required safety direction can be computed from a small set
of harmful and harmless instruction pairs. We show that ROSI consistently
increases safety refusal rates - as evaluated by Llama Guard 3 - while
preserving the utility of the model on standard benchmarks such as MMLU,
HellaSwag, and Arc. Furthermore, we show that ROSI can also re-align
'uncensored' models by amplifying their own latent safety directions,
demonstrating its utility as an effective last-mile safety procedure. Our
results suggest that targeted, interpretable weight steering is a cheap and
potent mechanism to improve LLM safety, complementing more resource-intensive
fine-tuning paradigms.

TL;DR: First cross-lingual study on cognitive distortion detection in Dutch adolescent forum posts, showing language/style changes affect performance but domain adaptation works best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rising youth mental health issues need automated detection of cognitive distortions for early intervention, but prior work only focused on English clinical data.

Method: Cross-lingual and cross-register generalization analysis using Dutch adolescent forum posts, testing domain adaptation methods.

Result: Language and writing style changes significantly affect model performance, but domain adaptation methods show the most promise.

Conclusion: Domain adaptation is crucial for effective cross-lingual cognitive distortion detection in non-clinical digital text from adolescents.

Abstract: Rising mental health issues among youth have increased interest in automated
approaches for detecting early signs of psychological distress in digital text.
One key focus is the identification of cognitive distortions, irrational
thought patterns that have a role in aggravating mental distress. Early
detection of these distortions may enable timely, low-cost interventions. While
prior work has focused on English clinical data, we present the first in-depth
study of cross-lingual and cross-register generalization of cognitive
distortion detection, analyzing forum posts written by Dutch adolescents. Our
findings show that while changes in language and writing style can
significantly affect model performance, domain adaptation methods show the most
promise.

*Jie Zhao,Wanting Ning,Yuxiao Fei,Yubo Feng,Lishuang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GDLLM is a novel approach that enhances Large Language Models for Event Temporal Relation Extraction by incorporating distance-aware graph structures and temporal feature learning to better handle minority classes and long-distance dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small Language Models struggle with minority class relations in imbalanced datasets, while Large Language Models using manual prompts introduce noise that interferes with long-distance dependency judgment between events.

Method: Proposes GDLLM with distance-aware graph structure using Graph Attention Network to capture long-distance dependencies, and a temporal feature learning paradigm with soft inference to enhance short-distance proximity identification, integrating probabilistic information into multi-head attention.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on TB-Dense and MATRES datasets, significantly improving minority relation class performance and overall learning capability.

Conclusion: The global distance-aware modeling approach effectively enhances LLMs' ability to capture both long-distance dependencies and short-distance proximity features, leading to superior performance in event temporal relation extraction.

Abstract: In Natural Language Processing(NLP), Event Temporal Relation Extraction
(ETRE) is to recognize the temporal relations of two events. Prior studies have
noted the importance of language models for ETRE. However, the restricted
pre-trained knowledge of Small Language Models(SLMs) limits their capability to
handle minority class relations in imbalanced classification datasets. For
Large Language Models(LLMs), researchers adopt manually designed prompts or
instructions, which may introduce extra noise, leading to interference with the
model's judgment of the long-distance dependencies between events. To address
these issues, we propose GDLLM, a Global Distance-aware modeling approach based
on LLMs. We first present a distance-aware graph structure utilizing Graph
Attention Network(GAT) to assist the LLMs in capturing long-distance dependency
features. Additionally, we design a temporal feature learning paradigm based on
soft inference to augment the identification of relations with a short-distance
proximity band, which supplements the probabilistic information generated by
LLMs into the multi-head attention mechanism. Since the global feature can be
captured effectively, our framework substantially enhances the performance of
minority relation classes and improves the overall learning ability.
Experiments on two publicly available datasets, TB-Dense and MATRES,
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

*Rohan Phanse,Yijie Zhou,Kejian Shi,Wencai Zhang,Yixin Liu,Yilun Zhao,Arman Cohan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for evaluating RAG systems on multi-source information integration and long-form generation, with new benchmarks showing retrieval effectiveness is crucial and reasoning models outperform standard LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications require RAG systems to integrate information from multiple sources where no single source is sufficient, but current evaluations focus on single-source or factoid-based settings.

Method: Developed a scalable framework to create evaluation benchmarks for multi-source retrieval and synthesis, building MSRS-Story (narrative synthesis) and MSRS-Meet (summarization) benchmarks with large collections.

Result: Generation quality heavily depends on retrieval effectiveness, which varies by task. Multi-source synthesis remains challenging even with oracle retrieval, but reasoning models significantly outperform standard LLMs.

Conclusion: The framework enables better evaluation of RAG systems for complex multi-source tasks, revealing critical dependencies between retrieval and generation components, and demonstrating the superiority of reasoning models for synthesis.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented systems are typically evaluated in settings where
information required to answer the query can be found within a single source or
the answer is short-form or factoid-based. However, many real-world
applications demand the ability to integrate and summarize information
scattered across multiple sources, where no single source is sufficient to
respond to the user's question. In such settings, the retrieval component of a
RAG pipeline must recognize a variety of relevance signals, and the generation
component must connect and synthesize information across multiple sources. We
present a scalable framework for constructing evaluation benchmarks that
challenge RAG systems to integrate information across distinct sources and
generate long-form responses. Using our framework, we build two new benchmarks
on Multi-Source Retrieval and Synthesis: MSRS-Story and MSRS-Meet, representing
narrative synthesis and summarization tasks, respectively, that require
retrieval from large collections. Our extensive experiments with various RAG
pipelines -- including sparse and dense retrievers combined with frontier LLMs
-- reveal that generation quality is highly dependent on retrieval
effectiveness, which varies greatly by task. While multi-source synthesis
proves challenging even in an oracle retrieval setting, we find that reasoning
models significantly outperform standard LLMs at this distinct step.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: First large-scale evaluation of 4-bit and 2-bit quantization on multilingual machine translation across 55 languages, showing significant degradation for low-resource languages especially at 2-bit precision, with GGUF variants performing most consistently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantization is essential for deploying large language models on resource-constrained hardware, but its implications for multilingual tasks remain underexplored, particularly for machine translation across diverse languages.

Method: Conducted evaluation of post-training quantization (PTQ) on machine translation using five LLMs (1.7B to 70B parameters) across 55 languages, comparing four quantization techniques (AWQ, BitsAndBytes, GGUF, AutoRound) and analyzing interactions with decoding hyperparameters and calibration languages.

Result: 4-bit quantization preserves quality for high-resource languages and large models, but significant degradation occurs for low-resource and typologically diverse languages, especially at 2-bit. GGUF variants provide most consistent performance even at 2-bit precision. Language-matched calibration helps primarily in low-bit scenarios.

Conclusion: Quantization robustness depends on algorithm choice and model size, with actionable insights for deploying multilingual LLMs under quantization constraints, especially important for low-resource language settings.

Abstract: Quantization is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) on
resource-constrained hardware, but its implications for multilingual tasks
remain underexplored. We conduct the first large-scale evaluation of
post-training quantization (PTQ) on machine translation across 55 languages
using five LLMs ranging from 1.7B to 70B parameters. Our analysis reveals that
while 4-bit quantization often preserves translation quality for high-resource
languages and large models, significant degradation occurs for low-resource and
typologically diverse languages, particularly in 2-bit settings. We compare
four quantization techniques (AWQ, BitsAndBytes, GGUF, and AutoRound), showing
that algorithm choice and model size jointly determine robustness. GGUF
variants provide the most consistent performance, even at 2-bit precision.
Additionally, we quantify the interactions between quantization, decoding
hyperparameters, and calibration languages, finding that language-matched
calibration offers benefits primarily in low-bit scenarios. Our findings offer
actionable insights for deploying multilingual LLMs for machine translation
under quantization constraints, especially in low-resource settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating Speech-to-Speech Large Language Models remains a fundamental challenge, as existing cascaded approaches disregard acoustic features and there's scarcity of speech preference data for proper evaluation.

Method: Proposes SageLM with three key innovations: 1) joint assessment of semantic and acoustic dimensions, 2) rationale-based supervision for explainability, 3) SpeechFeedback synthetic preference dataset with two-stage training paradigm to address data scarcity.

Result: SageLM achieves 82.79% agreement rate with human evaluators, outperforming cascaded baselines by 7.42% and SLM-based baselines by 26.20%.

Conclusion: SageLM provides a comprehensive and explainable framework for S2S LLM evaluation that effectively addresses the limitations of existing approaches through joint semantic-acoustic assessment and synthetic data generation.

Abstract: Speech-to-Speech (S2S) Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational to
natural human-computer interaction, enabling end-to-end spoken dialogue
systems. However, evaluating these models remains a fundamental challenge. We
propose \texttt{SageLM}, an end-to-end, multi-aspect, and explainable speech
LLM for comprehensive S2S LLMs evaluation. First, unlike cascaded approaches
that disregard acoustic features, SageLM jointly assesses both semantic and
acoustic dimensions. Second, it leverages rationale-based supervision to
enhance explainability and guide model learning, achieving superior alignment
with evaluation outcomes compared to rule-based reinforcement learning methods.
Third, we introduce \textit{SpeechFeedback}, a synthetic preference dataset,
and employ a two-stage training paradigm to mitigate the scarcity of speech
preference data. Trained on both semantic and acoustic dimensions, SageLM
achieves an 82.79\% agreement rate with human evaluators, outperforming
cascaded and SLM-based baselines by at least 7.42\% and 26.20\%, respectively.

Motivation: LLM-based agents struggle with consistent reasoning, policy adherence, and information extraction in multi-turn conversational environments with tool calls.

Method: Proposed Input-Reformulation Multi-Agent (IRMA) framework that automatically reformulates user queries augmented with relevant domain rules and tool suggestions for the tool-calling agent.

Result: IRMA outperforms ReAct, Function Calling, and Self-Reflection by 16.1%, 12.7%, and 19.1% respectively in overall pass^5 scores.

Conclusion: IRMA demonstrates superior reliability and consistency compared to other methods in dynamic environments requiring tool use.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning and planning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) have enabled their potential as autonomous agents capable of tool
use in dynamic environments. However, in multi-turn conversational environments
like $\tau$-bench, these agents often struggle with consistent reasoning,
adherence to domain-specific policies, and extracting correct information over
a long horizon of tool-calls and conversation. To capture and mitigate these
failures, we conduct a comprehensive manual analysis of the common errors
occurring in the conversation trajectories. We then experiment with
reformulations of inputs to the tool-calling agent for improvement in agent
decision making. Finally, we propose the Input-Reformulation Multi-Agent (IRMA)
framework, which automatically reformulates user queries augmented with
relevant domain rules and tool suggestions for the tool-calling agent to focus
on. The results show that IRMA significantly outperforms ReAct, Function
Calling, and Self-Reflection by 16.1%, 12.7%, and 19.1%, respectively, in
overall pass^5 scores. These findings highlight the superior reliability and
consistency of IRMA compared to other methods in dynamic environments.

TL;DR: A novel two-stage exemplar selection strategy for in-context learning that improves semantic parsing performance through structure-aware retrieval and plug-in enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ICL selection strategies for structured prediction tasks like semantic parsing often overlook structural alignment, leading to suboptimal performance and poor generalization.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Fine-tune BERT-based retriever with structure-aware supervision to select semantically relevant and structurally aligned exemplars; 2) Enhance retriever with plug-in module that amplifies syntactically meaningful information in hidden representations.

Result: Consistently outperforms existing baselines on four benchmarks spanning three semantic parsing tasks with multiple recent LLMs as inference-time models.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves strong balance between efficiency, generalizability, and performance for ICL in semantic parsing tasks through structure-aware exemplar selection.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has become a powerful paradigm that enables LLMs to
perform a wide range of tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. However, the
effectiveness of ICL heavily depends on the quality of exemplar selection. In
particular, for structured prediction tasks such as semantic parsing, existing
ICL selection strategies often overlook structural alignment, leading to
suboptimal performance and poor generalization. To address this issue, we
propose a novel two-stage exemplar selection strategy that achieves a strong
balance between efficiency, generalizability, and performance. First, we
fine-tune a BERT-based retriever using structure-aware supervision, guiding it
to select exemplars that are both semantically relevant and structurally
aligned. Then, we enhance the retriever with a plug-in module, which amplifies
syntactically meaningful information in the hidden representations. This
plug-in is model-agnostic, requires minimal overhead, and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing pipelines. Experiments on four benchmarks spanning
three semantic parsing tasks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing baselines with multiple recent LLMs as inference-time
models.

Motivation: Existing works on proactive dialogue focus on domain-specific scenarios, leading to fragmented evaluations and limited exploration of models' comprehensive proactive conversation abilities.

Method: Proposed ProactiveEval framework that decomposes proactive dialogue into target planning and dialogue guidance, establishes evaluation metrics, and enables automatic generation of diverse evaluation data across 328 environments in 6 domains.

Result: Experiments with 22 LLMs show DeepSeek-R1 excels in target planning while Claude-3.7-Sonnet performs best in dialogue guidance. Reasoning capabilities significantly influence proactive behaviors.

Conclusion: The framework provides comprehensive evaluation of proactive dialogue capabilities, revealing performance differences among models and highlighting the importance of reasoning for future model development.

Abstract: Proactive dialogue has emerged as a critical and challenging research problem
in advancing large language models (LLMs). Existing works predominantly focus
on domain-specific or task-oriented scenarios, which leads to fragmented
evaluations and limits the comprehensive exploration of models' proactive
conversation abilities. In this work, we propose ProactiveEval, a unified
framework designed for evaluating proactive dialogue capabilities of LLMs. This
framework decomposes proactive dialogue into target planning and dialogue
guidance, establishing evaluation metrics across various domains. Moreover, it
also enables the automatic generation of diverse and challenging evaluation
data. Based on the proposed framework, we develop 328 evaluation environments
spanning 6 distinct domains. Through experiments with 22 different types of
LLMs, we show that DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-3.7-Sonnet exhibit exceptional
performance on target planning and dialogue guidance tasks, respectively.
Finally, we investigate how reasoning capabilities influence proactive
behaviors and discuss their implications for future model development.

### [166] [Lethe: Purifying Backdoored Large Language Models with Knowledge Dilution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21004)
*Chen Chen,Yuchen Sun,Jiaxin Gao,Xueluan Gong,Qian Wang,Ziyao Wang,Yongsen Zheng,Kwok-Yan Lam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LETHE is a novel defense method that eliminates backdoor behaviors in LLMs through internal knowledge dilution and external prompt distraction mechanisms, achieving up to 98% reduction in attack success rates while maintaining model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks that cause harmful responses when specific triggers are activated, and existing defenses lack comprehensiveness against advanced attack scenarios.

Method: LETHE uses internal knowledge dilution by training a clean model and merging it with the backdoored model, plus external prompt distraction by incorporating benign evidence to shift attention from backdoor features.

Result: Outperforms 8 state-of-the-art defense baselines against 8 backdoor attacks, reduces attack success rate by up to 98% while maintaining utility, and proves cost-efficient and robust against adaptive attacks.

Conclusion: LETHE provides a comprehensive and effective solution for eliminating backdoor behaviors in LLMs through dual internal-external mechanisms, demonstrating superior performance across multiple models and attack types.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen significant advancements, achieving
superior performance in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.
However, they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where models behave
normally for standard queries but generate harmful responses or unintended
output when specific triggers are activated. Existing backdoor defenses either
lack comprehensiveness, focusing on narrow trigger settings, detection-only
mechanisms, and limited domains, or fail to withstand advanced scenarios like
model-editing-based, multi-trigger, and triggerless attacks. In this paper, we
present LETHE, a novel method to eliminate backdoor behaviors from LLMs through
knowledge dilution using both internal and external mechanisms. Internally,
LETHE leverages a lightweight dataset to train a clean model, which is then
merged with the backdoored model to neutralize malicious behaviors by diluting
the backdoor impact within the model's parametric memory. Externally, LETHE
incorporates benign and semantically relevant evidence into the prompt to
distract LLM's attention from backdoor features. Experimental results on
classification and generation domains across 5 widely used LLMs demonstrate
that LETHE outperforms 8 state-of-the-art defense baselines against 8 backdoor
attacks. LETHE reduces the attack success rate of advanced backdoor attacks by
up to 98% while maintaining model utility. Furthermore, LETHE has proven to be
cost-efficient and robust against adaptive backdoor attacks.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful solution to
mitigate the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
hallucinations and outdated knowledge. However, deploying RAG-based tools in
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) remains a challenge due to their limited
resources and lack of expertise in natural language processing (NLP). This
paper introduces EASI-RAG, Enterprise Application Support for Industrial RAG, a
structured, agile method designed to facilitate the deployment of RAG systems
in industrial SME contexts. EASI-RAG is based on method engineering principles
and comprises well-defined roles, activities, and techniques. The method was
validated through a real-world case study in an environmental testing
laboratory, where a RAG tool was implemented to answer operators queries using
data extracted from operational procedures. The system was deployed in under a
month by a team with no prior RAG experience and was later iteratively improved
based on user feedback. Results demonstrate that EASI-RAG supports fast
implementation, high user adoption, delivers accurate answers, and enhances the
reliability of underlying data. This work highlights the potential of RAG
deployment in industrial SMEs. Future works include the need for generalization
across diverse use cases and further integration with fine-tuned models.

*Ramazan Ali Bahrami,Ramin Yahyapour*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes capsule networks with dynamic routing for sentential relation extraction, achieving state-of-the-art results on standard datasets but identifying label noise and re-representation challenges in larger datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve sentential relation extraction performance using dynamic routing in capsules and understand why models perform well on some datasets but poorly on others.

Method: Uses capsule networks with dynamic routing mechanism for relation extraction, tested on multiple datasets including Tacred, Tacredrev, Retacred, Conll04, and Wikidata.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art on standard datasets but shows low performance on Wikidata due to label noise. Demonstrates better re-representation capability compared to vanilla models.

Conclusion: Identifies label noise in distantly supervised datasets and re-representation as key challenges in sentential relation extraction, with capsule networks showing superior re-representation abilities.

Abstract: Sentential relation extraction (RE) is an important task in natural language
processing (NLP). In this paper we propose to do sentential RE with dynamic
routing in capsules. We first show that the proposed approach outperform state
of the art on common sentential relation extraction datasets Tacred, Tacredrev,
Retacred, and Conll04. We then investigate potential reasons for its good
performance on the mentioned datasets, and yet low performance on another
similar, yet larger sentential RE dataset, Wikidata. As such, we identify noise
in Wikidata labels as one of the reasons that can hinder performance.
Additionally, we show associativity of better performance with better
re-representation, a term from neuroscience referred to change of
representation in human brain to improve the match at comparison time. As
example, in the given analogous terms King:Queen::Man:Woman, at comparison
time, and as a result of re-representation, the similarity between related head
terms (King,Man), and tail terms (Queen,Woman) increases. As such, our
observation show that our proposed model can do re-representation better than
the vanilla model compared with. To that end, beside noise in the labels of the
distantly supervised RE datasets, we propose re-representation as a challenge
in sentential RE.

*William Jurayj,Nils Holzenberger,Benjamin Van Durme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A neuro-symbolic approach combining LLMs with symbolic solvers achieves high accuracy in tax filing calculations, reducing costs below real-world averages while ensuring auditability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tax filing requires complex reasoning with high accuracy needs due to costly penalties, making pure LLMs unsuitable. The goal is to develop an automated system that is both accurate and auditable for equitable tax assistance access.

Method: Integrates large language models with symbolic solvers, using up-front translation of plain-text rules into formal logic programs and intelligently retrieved exemplars for formal case representations.

Result: The system achieves dramatically improved performance on the SARA dataset and reduces deployment costs well below real-world averages ($270 and 13 hours per filing).

Conclusion: Neuro-symbolic architectures show promise and economic feasibility for providing reliable, equitable tax assistance by combining the strengths of LLMs and symbolic reasoning.

Abstract: According to the United States Internal Revenue Service, ''the average
American spends $\$270$ and 13 hours filing their taxes''. Even beyond the
U.S., tax filing requires complex reasoning, combining application of
overlapping rules with numerical calculations. Because errors can incur costly
penalties, any automated system must deliver high accuracy and auditability,
making modern large language models (LLMs) poorly suited for this task. We
propose an approach that integrates LLMs with a symbolic solver to calculate
tax obligations. We evaluate variants of this system on the challenging
StAtutory Reasoning Assessment (SARA) dataset, and include a novel method for
estimating the cost of deploying such a system based on real-world penalties
for tax errors. We further show how combining up-front translation of
plain-text rules into formal logic programs, combined with intelligently
retrieved exemplars for formal case representations, can dramatically improve
performance on this task and reduce costs to well below real-world averages.
Our results demonstrate the promise and economic feasibility of neuro-symbolic
architectures for increasing equitable access to reliable tax assistance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CrystalICL is a novel LLM-based approach for few-shot crystal generation that introduces space-group based tokenization and hybrid instruction tuning to better capture structure-property relationships from limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human experts design materials by modifying known structures (few-shot learning), but existing LLM-based crystal generation methods are limited to zero-shot scenarios and cannot benefit from few-shot learning paradigms.

Method: Space-group based crystal tokenization to reduce symmetry modeling complexity, condition-structure aware hybrid instruction tuning framework, and multi-task instruction tuning strategy to capture structure-property relationships from limited data.

Result: Superior performance over leading baseline methods on four crystal generation benchmarks for both conditional and unconditional generation tasks.

Conclusion: CrystalICL effectively enables few-shot in-context learning for crystal generation, bridging the gap between human expert design approaches and LLM capabilities in materials science.

Abstract: Designing crystal materials with desired physicochemical properties remains a
fundamental challenge in materials science. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated strong in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, existing
LLM-based crystal generation approaches are limited to zero-shot scenarios and
are unable to benefit from few-shot scenarios. In contrast, human experts
typically design new materials by modifying relevant known structures which
aligns closely with the few-shot ICL paradigm. Motivated by this, we propose
CrystalICL, a novel model designed for few-shot crystal generation.
Specifically, we introduce a space-group based crystal tokenization method,
which effectively reduces the complexity of modeling crystal symmetry in LLMs.
We further introduce a condition-structure aware hybrid instruction tuning
framework and a multi-task instruction tuning strategy, enabling the model to
better exploit ICL by capturing structure-property relationships from limited
data. Extensive experiments on four crystal generation benchmarks demonstrate
the superiority of CrystalICL over the leading baseline methods on conditional
and unconditional generation tasks.

*Elisha Dayag,Nhat Thanh Van Tran,Jack Xin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adding learnable frequency filters to transformer-based models improves long time-series forecasting performance by 5-10%, reduces model size, and enhances spectral utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based models for long time-series forecasting suffer from bias toward low frequencies and high computational/memory requirements, despite achieving state-of-the-art results.

Method: Adding learnable frequency filters (≈1000 parameters) to the beginning of transformer-based models, enabling better spectral utilization and allowing for reduced embedding dimensions.

Result: 5-10% relative improvement in forecasting performance, smaller model sizes with reduced embedding dimensions, and better full-spectrum utilization demonstrated through synthetic experiments.

Conclusion: Learnable frequency filters significantly enhance transformer-based forecasting models by improving performance, reducing size, and addressing spectral bias issues.

Abstract: Transformer-based models are at the forefront in long time-series forecasting
(LTSF). While in many cases, these models are able to achieve state of the art
results, they suffer from a bias toward low-frequencies in the data and high
computational and memory requirements. Recent work has established that
learnable frequency filters can be an integral part of a deep forecasting model
by enhancing the model's spectral utilization. These works choose to use a
multilayer perceptron to process their filtered signals and thus do not solve
the issues found with transformer-based models. In this paper, we establish
that adding a filter to the beginning of transformer-based models enhances
their performance in long time-series forecasting. We add learnable filters,
which only add an additional $\approx 1000$ parameters to several
transformer-based models and observe in multiple instances 5-10 \% relative
improvement in forecasting performance. Additionally, we find that with filters
added, we are able to decrease the embedding dimension of our models, resulting
in transformer-based architectures that are both smaller and more effective
than their non-filtering base models. We also conduct synthetic experiments to
analyze how the filters enable Transformer-based models to better utilize the
full spectrum for forecasting.

TL;DR: Transformers are nonlinear predictors that generalize Wiener's linear prediction, interpreting transformer operations as conditional probability measures and fixed-point updates, with explicit formulation for hidden Markov models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge classical nonlinear filtering theory with modern transformer architectures by providing a probabilistic interpretation of transformer operations as conditional measures and fixed-point updates.

Method: Develop a probabilistic model that interprets transformer signals as surrogates of conditional measures and layer operations as fixed-point updates, with explicit formulation for the special case of hidden Markov models (HMMs).

Result: The paper establishes a theoretical framework connecting transformers to classical nonlinear filtering, showing how transformer operations correspond to conditional probability measures and fixed-point iteration methods.

Conclusion: Transformers can be understood as nonlinear generalizations of Wiener's linear predictor, with their operations interpretable through the lens of classical nonlinear filtering theory, providing a bridge between traditional signal processing and modern deep learning architectures.

Abstract: In the 1940s, Wiener introduced a linear predictor, where the future
prediction is computed by linearly combining the past data. A transformer
generalizes this idea: it is a nonlinear predictor where the next-token
prediction is computed by nonlinearly combining the past tokens. In this essay,
we present a probabilistic model that interprets transformer signals as
surrogates of conditional measures, and layer operations as fixed-point
updates. An explicit form of the fixed-point update is described for the
special case when the probabilistic model is a hidden Markov model (HMM). In
part, this paper is in an attempt to bridge the classical nonlinear filtering
theory with modern inference architectures.

TL;DR: Teacher model calibration error strongly correlates with student performance in Knowledge Distillation. Using calibration methods to reduce teacher's calibration error improves KD effectiveness across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Knowledge Distillation is effective for model compression, the factors that contribute to student performance improvement are not fully understood. The paper aims to identify key factors that enhance KD effectiveness.

Method: The authors demonstrate that teacher model calibration is crucial for effective KD. They propose employing calibration methods to reduce the teacher's calibration error, which can be easily integrated with existing state-of-the-art KD methods.

Result: The approach shows strong correlation between teacher calibration error and student accuracy. The algorithm demonstrates effectiveness across various tasks including classification and detection, and consistently achieves superior performance when integrated with existing methods.

Conclusion: Teacher model calibration is an important factor for effective Knowledge Distillation. Reducing the teacher's calibration error through calibration methods significantly improves KD performance across multiple tasks and can be seamlessly combined with existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as an effective model compression
technique in deep learning, enabling the transfer of knowledge from a large
teacher model to a compact student model. While KD has demonstrated significant
success, it is not yet fully understood which factors contribute to improving
the student's performance. In this paper, we reveal a strong correlation
between the teacher's calibration error and the student's accuracy. Therefore,
we claim that the calibration of the teacher model is an important factor for
effective KD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the performance of KD can be
improved by simply employing a calibration method that reduces the teacher's
calibration error. Our algorithm is versatile, demonstrating effectiveness
across various tasks from classification to detection. Moreover, it can be
easily integrated with existing state-of-the-art methods, consistently
achieving superior performance.

TL;DR: CLD is an efficient coreset selection method that uses loss trajectory alignment with validation data to identify impactful training samples, achieving near state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models face scalability challenges in real-time or resource-constrained scenarios, requiring efficient methods to select the most valuable training samples without costly computations.

Method: Correlation of Loss Differences (CLD) measures alignment between training sample loss trajectories and validation set loss trajectories using only per-sample loss values from training checkpoints, avoiding expensive gradient and curvature computations.

Result: CLD-based coresets outperform or match state-of-the-art methods on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k, remain within 1% of expensive baselines, transfer effectively across architectures with <1% degradation, and exhibit inherent bias reduction through per-class validation alignment.

Conclusion: CLD provides a principled, efficient, stable, and transferable solution for scalable dataset optimization with strong theoretical convergence guarantees and practical performance across various deep learning scenarios.

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains but
face scalability challenges in real-time or resource-constrained scenarios. To
address this, we propose Correlation of Loss Differences (CLD), a simple and
scalable metric for coreset selection that identifies the most impactful
training samples by measuring their alignment with the loss trajectories of a
held-out validation set. CLD is highly efficient, requiring only per-sample
loss values computed at training checkpoints, and avoiding the costly gradient
and curvature computations used in many existing subset selection methods. We
develop a general theoretical framework that establishes convergence guarantees
for CLD-based coresets, demonstrating that the convergence error is
upper-bounded by the alignment of the selected samples and the
representativeness of the validation set. On CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k,
CLD-based coresets typically outperform or closely match state-of-the-art
methods across subset sizes, and remain within 1% of more computationally
expensive baselines even when not leading. CLD transfers effectively across
architectures (ResNet, VGG, DenseNet), enabling proxy-to-target selection with
<1% degradation. Moreover, CLD is stable when using only early checkpoints,
incurring negligible accuracy loss. Finally, CLD exhibits inherent bias
reduction via per-class validation alignment, obviating the need for additional
stratified sampling. Together, these properties make CLD a principled,
efficient, stable, and transferable tool for scalable dataset optimization.

Method: Proposed a novel optimization problem that incorporates node labels and features within spectral graph clustering framework, with algorithmic solutions to solve this optimization.

Result: Demonstrated synergy between graph structure and node-specific information, showing that suitable node information guarantees perfect community recovery under milder conditions than graph clustering bounds alone. Numerical experiments confirmed this synergy.

Conclusion: The proposed optimization framework successfully integrates node-specific information with graph structure, enabling more effective transductive node classification with better theoretical guarantees and practical performance.

Abstract: We present an analysis of the transductive node classification problem, where
the underlying graph consists of communities that agree with the node labels

problem that incorporates the node-specific information (labels and features)
in a spectral graph clustering framework. Studying this problem, we demonstrate
a synergy between the graph structure and node-specific information. In
particular, we show that suitable node-specific information guarantees the

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous experiments focus primarily on optimizing predefined targets, limiting discovery of unexpected or unknown physical phenomena that could lead to scientific breakthroughs.

Method: Integrated Novelty Score-Strategic Autonomous Non-Smooth Exploration (INS2ANE) combines a novelty scoring system to evaluate result uniqueness and a strategic sampling mechanism that explores under-sampled regions regardless of conventional promise.

Result: INS2ANE significantly increases diversity of explored phenomena compared to conventional optimization routines, enhancing likelihood of discovering previously unobserved phenomena in both pre-acquired datasets and autonomous scanning probe microscopy experiments.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates AE's potential to enhance scientific discovery depth while maintaining efficiency, promising to accelerate research by simultaneously navigating complex experimental spaces to uncover new phenomena.

Abstract: Autonomous experiments (AEs) are transforming how scientific research is
conducted by integrating artificial intelligence with automated experimental
platforms. Current AEs primarily focus on the optimization of a predefined
target; while accelerating this goal, such an approach limits the discovery of
unexpected or unknown physical phenomena. Here, we introduce a novel framework,
INS2ANE (Integrated Novelty Score-Strategic Autonomous Non-Smooth Exploration),
to enhance the discovery of novel phenomena in autonomous experimentation. Our
method integrates two key components: (1) a novelty scoring system that
evaluates the uniqueness of experimental results, and (2) a strategic sampling
mechanism that promotes exploration of under-sampled regions even if they
appear less promising by conventional criteria. We validate this approach on a
pre-acquired dataset with a known ground truth comprising of image-spectral
pairs. We further implement the process on autonomous scanning probe microscopy
experiments. INS2ANE significantly increases the diversity of explored
phenomena in comparison to conventional optimization routines, enhancing the
likelihood of discovering previously unobserved phenomena. These results
demonstrate the potential for AE to enhance the depth of scientific discovery;
in combination with the efficiency provided by AEs, this approach promises to
accelerate scientific research by simultaneously navigating complex
experimental spaces to uncover new phenomena.

Motivation: Address challenges posed by missing or unmeasured covariates in causal inference by accounting for hidden factors influencing treatment or outcome

Method: Integrate latent variable modeling into DML paradigm, incorporating latent variables only in second stage to separate representation learning from latent inference. Consider two scenarios: latent variable affects only outcome, and latent variable influences both treatment and outcome

Result: Method demonstrates robustness and effectiveness through extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets

Conclusion: Proposed framework enables robust causal effect estimation in presence of hidden factors by combining latent variable modeling with double machine learning approach

Abstract: Latent variable models provide a powerful framework for incorporating and
inferring unobserved factors in observational data. In causal inference, they
help account for hidden factors influencing treatment or outcome, thereby
addressing challenges posed by missing or unmeasured covariates. This paper
proposes a new framework that integrates latent variable modeling into the
double machine learning (DML) paradigm to enable robust causal effect
estimation in the presence of such hidden factors. We consider two scenarios:
one where a latent variable affects only the outcome, and another where it may
influence both treatment and outcome. To ensure tractability, we incorporate
latent variables only in the second stage of DML, separating representation
learning from latent inference. We demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness
of our method through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets.

Motivation: Traditional statistical and machine learning methods struggle with complex, high-dimensional genetic data, while LLMs based on transformer architectures have shown promise in contextual comprehension of unstructured medical data.

Method: Automated keyword-based search in PubMed, bioRxiv, medRxiv, and arXiv targeting LLM applications in genetics diagnostics and education, followed by analysis of 172 relevant studies.

Result: LLMs demonstrate significant advancements in genomic variant identification, annotation, interpretation, medical imaging analysis, disease risk stratification, and report generation for both rare and common diseases.

Conclusion: While transformer models show transformative potential in hereditary disease diagnostics and genetic education, major challenges remain in multimodal data integration, generalizability, and practical clinical implementation.

Abstract: Although traditional statistical techniques and machine learning methods have
contributed significantly to genetics and, in particular, inherited disease
diagnosis, they often struggle with complex, high-dimensional data, a challenge
now addressed by state-of-the-art deep learning models. Large language models
(LLMs), based on transformer architectures, have excelled in tasks requiring
contextual comprehension of unstructured medical data. This systematic review
examines the role of LLMs in the genetic research and diagnostics of both rare
and common diseases. Automated keyword-based search in PubMed, bioRxiv,
medRxiv, and arXiv was conducted, targeting studies on LLM applications in
diagnostics and education within genetics and removing irrelevant or outdated
models. A total of 172 studies were analyzed, highlighting applications in
genomic variant identification, annotation, and interpretation, as well as
medical imaging advancements through vision transformers. Key findings indicate
that while transformer-based models significantly advance disease and risk
stratification, variant interpretation, medical imaging analysis, and report
generation, major challenges persist in integrating multimodal data (genomic
sequences, imaging, and clinical records) into unified and clinically robust
pipelines, facing limitations in generalizability and practical implementation
in clinical settings. This review provides a comprehensive classification and
assessment of the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs in transforming
hereditary disease diagnostics and supporting genetic education, serving as a
guide to navigate this rapidly evolving field.

*Pengcheng Xie,Zihao Zhou,Zijian Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces VC (value change), a novel metric to measure neural network approximation difficulty and characterize local performance. It identifies VC-tendency and minority-tendency phenomena and proposes a preprocessing framework based on VC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks often suffer from unpredictable local performance that hinders reliability in critical applications. Current methods lack quantifiable measures for local value changes during approximation.

Method: The authors propose VC metric to quantify local value changes, investigate its theoretical properties, identify VC-tendency and minority-tendency phenomena, and develop a preprocessing framework based on VC for neural network approximation.

Result: Numerical results from real-world experiments and PDE-related scientific problems support the VC metric's effectiveness and the preprocessing acceleration method's performance improvements.

Conclusion: VC provides a quantifiable measure for neural network approximation stability and performance, with identified phenomena and preprocessing framework offering practical improvements for neural network reliability in critical applications.

Abstract: This paper introduce a novel metric of an objective function f, we say VC
(value change) to measure the difficulty and approximation affection when
conducting an neural network approximation task, and it numerically supports
characterizing the local performance and behavior of neural network
approximation. Neural networks often suffer from unpredictable local
performance, which can hinder their reliability in critical applications. VC
addresses this issue by providing a quantifiable measure of local value changes
in network behavior, offering insights into the stability and performance for
achieving the neural-network approximation. We investigate some fundamental
theoretical properties of VC and identified two intriguing phenomena in neural
network approximation: the VC-tendency and the minority-tendency. These trends
respectively characterize how pointwise errors evolve in relation to the
distribution of VC during the approximation process.In addition, we propose a
novel metric based on VC, which measures the distance between two functions
from the perspective of variation. Building upon this metric, we further
propose a new preprocessing framework for neural network approximation.
Numerical results including the real-world experiment and the PDE-related
scientific problem support our discovery and pre-processing acceleration
method.

### [182] [Beacon: Post-Training Quantization with Integrated Grid Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20293)
*Shihao Zhang,Rayan Saab*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Beacon is a tuning-free per-channel post-training quantization method that automatically determines optimal scaling factors using fixed non-scaled alphabets and geometric properties of symmetric quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing per-channel PTQ methods require manual heuristic tuning or grid search to fix scaling factors, which is time-consuming and suboptimal. There's a need for an automated, tuning-free approach that eliminates this manual intervention.

Method: Beacon performs per-channel quantization using fixed non-scaled alphabets and automatically determines optimal scaling factors by exploiting the geometry of symmetric scalar quantization. It supports both symmetric and asymmetric quantization without back-propagation or large calibration sets.

Result: Despite its simplicity and tuning-free nature, Beacon achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art quantization methods.

Conclusion: Beacon provides a practical, efficient solution for model deployment that eliminates manual tuning while maintaining competitive quantization performance.

Abstract: Quantization is a widely used compression technique for reducing the memory
and computation costs of large pre-trained models. A key challenge in
per-channel post-training quantization (PTQ) is selecting appropriate scaling
factors to replace weight values with values from a scaled quantization grid.
Existing methods typically fix the scale at the outset via heuristic tuning or
grid search. In this note, we propose Beacon, a simple and effective algorithm
that eliminates the need for such manual tuning. Beacon performs per-channel
PTQ directly using a fixed non-scaled alphabet and automatically determines the
optimal scaling factors by exploiting the geometry of symmetric scalar
quantization. It supports both symmetric and asymmetric quantization with
minimal modifications and does not rely on back-propagation or large
calibration sets. Despite its simplicity and tuning-free nature, Beacon
achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, making
it a practical solution for efficient model deployment.

### [183] [Dynamics-Aligned Latent Imagination in Contextual World Models for Zero-Shot Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20294)
*Frank Röder,Jan Benad,Manfred Eppe,Pradeep Kr. Banerjee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DALI is a framework that infers latent context representations from agent-environment interactions to enable zero-shot generalization in unseen environments without explicit context variables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world RL needs adaptation to unseen conditions without costly retraining. Existing cMDP methods require explicit context variables, limiting their use when contexts are latent or hard to measure.

Method: Integrated within Dreamer architecture, DALI trains a self-supervised encoder to predict forward dynamics, generating latent context representations that condition the world model and policy.

Result: DALI achieves significant gains over context-unaware baselines and often surpasses context-aware baselines in extrapolation tasks, enabling zero-shot generalization to unseen contextual variations.

Conclusion: DALI provides an effective framework for inferring latent contexts and achieving robust generalization in contextual MDPs without requiring explicit context measurements.

Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning demands adaptation to unseen environmental
conditions without costly retraining. Contextual Markov Decision Processes
(cMDP) model this challenge, but existing methods often require explicit
context variables (e.g., friction, gravity), limiting their use when contexts
are latent or hard to measure. We introduce Dynamics-Aligned Latent Imagination
(DALI), a framework integrated within the Dreamer architecture that infers
latent context representations from agent-environment interactions. By training
a self-supervised encoder to predict forward dynamics, DALI generates
actionable representations conditioning the world model and policy, bridging
perception and control. We theoretically prove this encoder is essential for
efficient context inference and robust generalization. DALI's latent space
enables counterfactual consistency: Perturbing a gravity-encoding dimension
alters imagined rollouts in physically plausible ways. On challenging cMDP
benchmarks, DALI achieves significant gains over context-unaware baselines,
often surpassing context-aware baselines in extrapolation tasks, enabling
zero-shot generalization to unseen contextual variations.

*Fatema Siddika,Md Anwar Hossen,J. Pablo Muñoz,Tanya Roosta,Anuj Sharma,Ali Jannesari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedReFT introduces federated representation fine-tuning that manipulates hidden representations instead of weights, achieving 7x-15x higher parameter efficiency than LoRA-based methods while handling FL heterogeneity through All-But-Me aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of applying Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT) in Federated Learning due to data heterogeneity, model capacity differences, and computational constraints across clients.

Method: FedReFT applies sparse intervention layers to steer hidden representations directly, combined with All-But-Me aggregation where clients receive aggregated updates from others and partially incorporate them to balance local and global knowledge.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods in FL across commonsense reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, instruction-tuning, and GLUE benchmarks, achieving 7x-15x higher parameter efficiency compared to LoRA-based approaches.

Conclusion: FedReFT provides a lightweight, semantically rich fine-tuning alternative ideal for edge devices, enabling stable and personalized learning in federated settings through representation-level manipulation and innovative aggregation.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has attracted significant attention
for adapting large pre-trained models by modifying a small subset of
parameters. Recently, Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT) has emerged as an
effective alternative. ReFT shifts the fine-tuning paradigm from updating model
weights to directly manipulating hidden representations that capture rich
semantic information, and performs better than state-of-the-art PEFTs in
standalone settings. However, its application in Federated Learning (FL)
remains challenging due to heterogeneity in clients' data distributions, model
capacities, and computational resources. To address these challenges, we
introduce Federated Representation Fine-Tuning (FedReFT), a novel approach to
fine-tune the client's hidden representation. FedReFT applies sparse
intervention layers to steer hidden representations directly, offering a
lightweight and semantically rich fine-tuning alternative ideal for edge
devices. However, representation-level updates are especially vulnerable to
aggregation mismatch under different task heterogeneity, where naive averaging
can corrupt semantic alignment. To mitigate this issue, we propose All-But-Me
(ABM) aggregation, where each client receives the aggregated updates of others
and partially incorporates them, enabling stable and personalized learning by
balancing local focus with global knowledge. We evaluate FedReFT on commonsense
reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, instruction-tuning, and GLUE, where it
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods in FL, achieving 7x-15x
higher parameter efficiency compared to leading LoRA-based approaches.

*RexCharles Donatus,Kumater Ter,Ore-Ofe Ajayi,Daniel Udekwe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Survey paper on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning applications in Intelligent Transportation Systems, covering taxonomy, domains, simulation platforms, and challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the growing complexity of urban mobility and need for efficient autonomous decision-making in dynamic, large-scale transportation environments where multiple agents must coordinate effectively.

Method: Comprehensive survey with structured taxonomy categorizing MARL approaches by coordination models and learning algorithms (value-based, policy-based, actor-critic, communication-enhanced frameworks). Reviews applications across traffic signal control, autonomous vehicle coordination, logistics, and mobility systems.

Result: Provides systematic review of MARL applications in ITS domains, identifies widely used simulation platforms (SUMO, CARLA, CityFlow), and emerging benchmarks for experimentation.

Conclusion: Identifies core challenges including scalability, non-stationarity, credit assignment, communication constraints, and sim-to-real transfer gap that hinder real-world deployment of MARL in ITS.

Abstract: The growing complexity of urban mobility and the demand for efficient,
sustainable, and adaptive solutions have positioned Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS) at the forefront of modern infrastructure innovation. At the core
of ITS lies the challenge of autonomous decision-making across dynamic, large
scale, and uncertain environments where multiple agents traffic signals,
autonomous vehicles, or fleet units must coordinate effectively. Multi Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers a promising paradigm for addressing these
challenges by enabling distributed agents to jointly learn optimal strategies
that balance individual objectives with system wide efficiency. This paper
presents a comprehensive survey of MARL applications in ITS. We introduce a
structured taxonomy that categorizes MARL approaches according to coordination
models and learning algorithms, spanning value based, policy based, actor
critic, and communication enhanced frameworks. Applications are reviewed across
key ITS domains, including traffic signal control, connected and autonomous
vehicle coordination, logistics optimization, and mobility on demand systems.
Furthermore, we highlight widely used simulation platforms such as SUMO, CARLA,
and CityFlow that support MARL experimentation, along with emerging benchmarks.
The survey also identifies core challenges, including scalability, non
stationarity, credit assignment, communication constraints, and the sim to real
transfer gap, which continue to hinder real world deployment.

### [186] [Multi-View Graph Convolution Network for Internal Talent Recommendation Based on Enterprise Emails](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20328)
*Soo Hyun Kim,Jang-Hyun Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Novel dual GCN framework for internal talent recommendation that models both WHAT employees do (task similarity) and HOW they work (collaboration patterns), achieving 40.9% Hit@100 with interpretable fusion strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of conventional internal talent recommendation approaches that rely on narrow manager perspectives and often overlook qualified candidates, leading to structural bias and candidate omission.

Method: Proposes a framework that models two dimensions from email data: semantic task similarity (WHAT) and structural interaction characteristics (HOW). Uses Dual Graph Convolutional Network with gating mechanism to adaptively fuse these independent graph representations.

Result: Achieves top performance of 40.9% on Hit@100, significantly outperforming other fusion strategies and heuristic baselines. Demonstrates high interpretability with context-aware fusion strategies for different job families.

Conclusion: Provides a quantitative and comprehensive framework for internal talent discovery that minimizes candidate omission risk. Key contribution is empirically determining optimal fusion ratio between task alignment and collaborative patterns for position success.

Abstract: Internal talent recommendation is a critical strategy for organizational
continuity, yet conventional approaches suffer from structural limitations,
often overlooking qualified candidates by relying on the narrow perspective of
a few managers. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that
models two distinct dimensions of an employee's position fit from email data:
WHAT they do (semantic similarity of tasks) and HOW they work (structural
characteristics of their interactions and collaborations). These dimensions are
represented as independent graphs and adaptively fused using a Dual Graph
Convolutional Network (GCN) with a gating mechanism. Experiments show that our
proposed gating-based fusion model significantly outperforms other fusion
strategies and a heuristic baseline, achieving a top performance of 40.9% on
Hit@100. Importantly, it is worth noting that the model demonstrates high
interpretability by learning distinct, context-aware fusion strategies for
different job families. For example, it learned to prioritize relational (HOW)
data for 'sales and marketing' job families while applying a balanced approach
for 'research' job families. This research offers a quantitative and
comprehensive framework for internal talent discovery, minimizing the risk of
candidate omission inherent in traditional methods. Its primary contribution
lies in its ability to empirically determine the optimal fusion ratio between
task alignment (WHAT) and collaborative patterns (HOW), which is required for
employees to succeed in the new positions, thereby offering important practical
implications.

### [187] [FORGE: Foundational Optimization Representations from Graph Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20330)
*Zohair Shafi,Serdar Kadioglu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Forge is a pre-training method using vector-quantized graph autoencoders to create embeddings for mixed-integer programming instances without requiring solutions, enabling both unsupervised clustering and supervised predictions for solver optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based approaches for combinatorial optimization require solving many hard instances for training data and need dedicated models per problem distribution, limiting scalability and generalization.

Method: Pre-train a vector-quantized graph autoencoder on diverse MIP instances unsupervised, creating discrete code assignments as vocabulary. Use embeddings for instance differentiation, clustering, and fine-tune for variable warm-starts and integrality gap predictions.

Result: Forge embeddings effectively differentiate and cluster unseen instances. Fine-tuned embeddings predict variables for warm-starts and integrality gaps across multiple problem types, improving performance of commercial optimization solvers.

Conclusion: Forge provides a scalable unsupervised pre-training approach for MIP instances that enables generalization across problem distributions and enhances solver performance through better warm-starting and cut generation.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in science and
engineering, yet learning-based approaches to accelerate their solution often
require solving a large number of hard-to-solve optimization instances to
collect training data, incurring significant computational overhead. Existing
methods require training dedicated models for each problem distribution for
each downstream task, severely limiting their scalability and generalization.
In this work, we introduce Forge, a method of pre-training a vector-quantized
graph autoencoder on a large and diverse collection of mixed-integer
programming (MIP) instances in an unsupervised fashion without dependency on
their solution. The vector quantization process creates discrete code
assignments that act as a vocabulary to represent optimization instances. We
evaluate our approach under both supervised and unsupervised settings. For the
unsupervised setting, we demonstrate that Forge embeddings effectively
differentiate and cluster unseen instances. For the supervised setting, we
fine-tune Forge embeddings and show that a single model predicts both the
variables for warm-starts and integrality gaps for cut-generation across
multiple problem type distributions. Both predictions help improve performance
of a state-of-the-art, commercial optimization solver. Finally, we release our
code and pre-trained Forge weights to encourage further research and practical
use of instance-level MIP embeddings at https://github.com/skadio/forge/

### [188] [Poison Once, Refuse Forever: Weaponizing Alignment for Injecting Bias in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20333)
*Md Abdullah Al Mamun,Ihsen Alouani,Nael Abu-Ghazaleh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAI is a poisoning attack that exploits LLM alignment to inject bias and targeted censorship through refusal mechanisms, evading current defenses and causing significant bias in downstream applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate how adversaries can exploit LLMs' safety alignment mechanisms to implant bias and enforce targeted censorship without degrading overall model performance.

Method: Proposes Subversive Alignment Injection (SAI) - a poisoning attack that leverages alignment mechanisms to trigger refusal on specific adversary-defined topics or queries.

Result: SAI evades state-of-the-art poisoning defenses and causes high bias: 23% ΔDP in healthcare questions for targeted racial categories, 27% ΔDP in resume selection, and up to 38% ΔDP in other chat applications with just 1% data poisoning.

Conclusion: LLM alignment mechanisms can be weaponized to inject bias through targeted refusal attacks, revealing critical vulnerabilities in current safety alignment approaches that require new defense strategies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are aligned to meet ethical standards and safety
requirements by training them to refuse answering harmful or unsafe prompts. In
this paper, we demonstrate how adversaries can exploit LLMs' alignment to
implant bias, or enforce targeted censorship without degrading the model's
responsiveness to unrelated topics. Specifically, we propose Subversive
Alignment Injection (SAI), a poisoning attack that leverages the alignment
mechanism to trigger refusal on specific topics or queries predefined by the
adversary. Although it is perhaps not surprising that refusal can be induced
through overalignment, we demonstrate how this refusal can be exploited to
inject bias into the model. Surprisingly, SAI evades state-of-the-art poisoning
defenses including LLM state forensics, as well as robust aggregation
techniques that are designed to detect poisoning in FL settings. We demonstrate
the practical dangers of this attack by illustrating its end-to-end impacts on
LLM-powered application pipelines. For chat based applications such as
ChatDoctor, with 1% data poisoning, the system refuses to answer healthcare
questions to targeted racial category leading to high bias ($\Delta DP$ of
23%). We also show that bias can be induced in other NLP tasks: for a resume
selection pipeline aligned to refuse to summarize CVs from a selected
university, high bias in selection ($\Delta DP$ of 27%) results. Even higher
bias ($\Delta DP$~38%) results on 9 other chat based downstream applications.

### [189] [Dynamic Synthetic Controls vs. Panel-Aware Double Machine Learning for Geo-Level Marketing Impact Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20335)
*Sang Su Lee,Vineeth Loganathan,Vijay Raghavan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper compares Synthetic Control Method (SCM) and panel-style Double Machine Learning (DML) for geo-level marketing lift analysis, finding DML variants significantly outperform SCM in complex scenarios with better bias reduction and coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate quantification of geo-level marketing lift in two-sided marketplaces is challenging, with SCM often underestimating effects and DML methods lacking proper benchmarking against SCM.

Method: Built an open simulator mimicking large-scale geo roll-outs with 5 stress tests (curved trends, response lags, shocks, nonlinear outcomes, drifting trends). Evaluated 7 estimators: 3 ASC variants and 4 panel-DML flavors across 100 replications per scenario.

Result: ASC models showed severe bias and near-zero coverage in challenging scenarios with nonlinearities or shocks. Panel-DML variants dramatically reduced bias and restored nominal 95% CI coverage, proving more robust.

Conclusion: ASC is unreliable in complex situations. Proposes a 'diagnose-first' framework where practitioners identify business challenges first, then select the appropriate DML model for robust geo-experiment analysis.

Abstract: Accurately quantifying geo-level marketing lift in two-sided marketplaces is
challenging: the Synthetic Control Method (SCM) often exhibits high power yet
systematically under-estimates effect size, while panel-style Double Machine
Learning (DML) is seldom benchmarked against SCM. We build an open, fully
documented simulator that mimics a typical large-scale geo roll-out: N_unit
regional markets are tracked for T_pre weeks before launch and for a further
T_post-week campaign window, allowing all key parameters to be varied by the
user and probe both families under five stylized stress tests: 1) curved
baseline trends, 2) heterogeneous response lags, 3) treated-biased shocks, 4) a
non-linear outcome link, and 5) a drifting control group trend.
  Seven estimators are evaluated: three standard Augmented SCM (ASC) variants
and four panel-DML flavors (TWFE, CRE/Mundlak, first-difference, and
within-group). Across 100 replications per scenario, ASC models consistently
demonstrate severe bias and near-zero coverage in challenging scenarios
involving nonlinearities or external shocks. By contrast, panel-DML variants
dramatically reduce this bias and restore nominal 95%-CI coverage, proving far
more robust.
  The results indicate that while ASC provides a simple baseline, it is
unreliable in common, complex situations. We therefore propose a
'diagnose-first' framework where practitioners first identify the primary
business challenge (e.g., nonlinear trends, response lags) and then select the
specific DML model best suited for that scenario, providing a more robust and
reliable blueprint for analyzing geo-experiments.

### [190] [Adaptive Segmentation of EEG for Machine Learning Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20336)
*Johnson Zhou,Joseph West,Krista A. Ehinger,Zhenming Ren,Sam E. John,David B. Grayden*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CTXSEG is an adaptive EEG segmentation method that creates variable-length segments based on statistical differences, improving seizure detection performance compared to fixed-length segmentation without modifying ML models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current EEG preprocessing uses arbitrary fixed time slices, which lack biological relevance since brain states don't follow fixed intervals. Adaptive segmentation could better capture meaningful neurological patterns.

Method: Developed CTXSEG for adaptive segmentation based on statistical differences in EEG data, validated using synthetic data from CTXGEN signal generator and real-world EEG seizure detection applications.

Result: CTXSEG improved seizure detection performance compared to fixed-length approaches using standardized frameworks, required fewer segments, and worked without modifying machine learning methods.

Conclusion: Adaptive segmentation with CTXSEG is a promising alternative to fixed-length segmentation that can be readily applied to modern ML approaches and should be considered standard preprocessing in EEG machine learning applications.

Abstract: Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) data is derived by sampling
continuous neurological time series signals. In order to prepare EEG signals
for machine learning, the signal must be divided into manageable segments. The
current naive approach uses arbitrary fixed time slices, which may have limited
biological relevance because brain states are not confined to fixed intervals.
We investigate whether adaptive segmentation methods are beneficial for machine
learning EEG analysis.
  Approach. We introduce a novel adaptive segmentation method, CTXSEG, that
creates variable-length segments based on statistical differences in the EEG
data and propose ways to use them with modern machine learning approaches that
typically require fixed-length input. We assess CTXSEG using controllable
synthetic data generated by our novel signal generator CTXGEN. While our CTXSEG
method has general utility, we validate it on a real-world use case by applying
it to an EEG seizure detection problem. We compare the performance of CTXSEG
with fixed-length segmentation in the preprocessing step of a typical EEG
machine learning pipeline for seizure detection.
  Main results. We found that using CTXSEG to prepare EEG data improves seizure
detection performance compared to fixed-length approaches when evaluated using
a standardized framework, without modifying the machine learning method, and
requires fewer segments.
  Significance. This work demonstrates that adaptive segmentation with CTXSEG
can be readily applied to modern machine learning approaches, with potential to
improve performance. It is a promising alternative to fixed-length segmentation
for signal preprocessing and should be considered as part of the standard
preprocessing repertoire in EEG machine learning applications.

*Hancheng Min,René Vidal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides a quantitative analysis of incremental learning behavior in gradient flow for symmetric matrix factorization, showing how small initialization leads to sequential learning of singular values through time-scale separation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the implicit bias and regularization effects of first-order optimization algorithms in neural networks, particularly the incremental learning phenomenon where gradient flow learns matrix singular values sequentially with small initialization.

Method: Developed a quantitative understanding using closed-form solutions from solving Riccati-like matrix differential equations for symmetric matrix factorization problems under gradient flow.

Result: Showed that incremental learning emerges from time-scale separation in dynamics for different matrix components, and that smaller initialization scales enhance this separation, enabling better low-rank approximations.

Conclusion: The analysis provides mathematical insights into incremental learning behavior and suggests possible extensions to asymmetric matrix factorization problems for broader understanding of optimization dynamics in neural networks.

Abstract: Many theoretical studies on neural networks attribute their excellent
empirical performance to the implicit bias or regularization induced by
first-order optimization algorithms when training networks under certain
initialization assumptions. One example is the incremental learning phenomenon
in gradient flow (GF) on an overparamerterized matrix factorization problem
with small initialization: GF learns a target matrix by sequentially learning
its singular values in decreasing order of magnitude over time. In this paper,
we develop a quantitative understanding of this incremental learning behavior
for GF on the symmetric matrix factorization problem, using its closed-form
solution obtained by solving a Riccati-like matrix differential equation. We
show that incremental learning emerges from some time-scale separation among
dynamics corresponding to learning different components in the target matrix.
By decreasing the initialization scale, these time-scale separations become
more prominent, allowing one to find low-rank approximations of the target
matrix. Lastly, we discuss the possible avenues for extending this analysis to
asymmetric matrix factorization problems.

*Zhibang Yang,Xinke Jiang,Rihong Qiu,Ruiqing Li,Yihang Zhang,Yue Fang,Yongxin Xu,Hongxin Ding,Xu Chu,Junfeng Zhao,Yasha Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DFAMS is a federated retrieval framework that uses dynamic information flow in LLMs to improve retrieval accuracy for ambiguous queries across distributed knowledge sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated retrieval methods struggle with ambiguous queries in cross-domain scenarios, limiting their effectiveness in supporting downstream generation tasks and mitigating LLM hallucinations.

Method: Leverages dynamic information flow (DIF) by probing gradient signals from annotated queries and using Shapley value-based attribution to trace neuron activation paths. Trains an alignment module via multi-prototype contrastive learning for fine-grained intra-source modeling and inter-source semantic alignment.

Result: Outperforms advanced FR methods by up to 14.37% in knowledge classification accuracy, 5.38% in retrieval recall, and 6.45% in downstream QA accuracy across five benchmarks.

Conclusion: DFAMS demonstrates significant effectiveness in complex federated retrieval scenarios by accurately identifying latent query intents and constructing semantically aligned knowledge partitions across heterogeneous sources.

Abstract: Federated Retrieval (FR) routes queries across multiple external knowledge
sources, to mitigate hallucinations of LLMs, when necessary external knowledge
is distributed. However, existing methods struggle to retrieve high-quality and
relevant documents for ambiguous queries, especially in cross-domain scenarios,
which significantly limits their effectiveness in supporting downstream
generation tasks. Inspired by dynamic information flow (DIF), we propose DFAMS,
a novel framework that leverages DIF to identify latent query intents and
construct semantically aligned knowledge partitions for accurate retrieval
across heterogeneous sources. Specifically, DFAMS probes the DIF in LLMs by
leveraging gradient signals from a few annotated queries and employing Shapley
value-based attribution to trace neuron activation paths associated with intent
recognition and subdomain boundary detection. Then, DFAMS leverages DIF to
train an alignment module via multi-prototype contrastive learning, enabling
fine-grained intra-source modeling and inter-source semantic alignment across
knowledge bases. Experimental results across five benchmarks show that DFAMS
outperforms advanced FR methods by up to 14.37% in knowledge classification
accuracy, 5.38% in retrieval recall, and 6.45% in downstream QA accuracy,
demonstrating its effectiveness in complex FR scenarios.

TL;DR: Multimodal machine learning architecture for rapid hood frame geometry evaluation without extensive simulation setup


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable designers to evaluate hood frame geometry performance without time-consuming simulation setup and reduce reliance on computationally expensive simulations

Method: Developed a multimodal machine-learning (MMML) architecture that learns from different data modalities to predict performance metrics, tested on unseen frame geometries

Result: MMML outperforms traditional single-modality approaches and successfully generalizes to new frame geometries not in training data

Conclusion: MMML effectively supplements traditional simulation workflows, bridges machine learning with engineering applications, and accelerates design cycles in conceptual design phase

Abstract: Is there a way for a designer to evaluate the performance of a given hood
frame geometry without spending significant time on simulation setup? This
paper seeks to address this challenge by developing a multimodal
machine-learning (MMML) architecture that learns from different modalities of
the same data to predict performance metrics. It also aims to use the MMML
architecture to enhance the efficiency of engineering design processes by
reducing reliance on computationally expensive simulations. The proposed
architecture accelerates design exploration, enabling rapid iteration while
maintaining high-performance standards, especially in the concept design phase.
The study also presents results that show that by combining multiple data
modalities, MMML outperforms traditional single-modality approaches. Two new
frame geometries, not part of the training dataset, are also used for
prediction using the trained MMML model to showcase the ability to generalize
to unseen frame models. The findings underscore MMML's potential in
supplementing traditional simulation-based workflows, particularly in the
conceptual design phase, and highlight its role in bridging the gap between
machine learning and real-world engineering applications. This research paves
the way for the broader adoption of machine learning techniques in engineering
design, with a focus on refining multimodal approaches to optimize structural
development and accelerate the design cycle.

### [194] [BiListing: Modality Alignment for Listings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20396)
*Guillaume Guy,Mihajlo Grbovic,Chun How Tan,Han Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BiListing is a bimodal approach that combines text and image embeddings from Airbnb listings using large-language models and pretrained language-image models to create unified representations, enabling better search and ranking with significant revenue gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Airbnb needed to overcome limitations of structured data by leveraging rich unstructured information from text and images in listings, but faced challenges in combining multiple embeddings from diverse data sources into a single representation.

Method: Proposed BiListing approach that aligns text and photos using large-language models and pretrained language-image models to create single embedding vectors per listing and modality, enabling zero-shot search and overcoming cold start problems.

Result: Successfully deployed in production with 0.425% NDCG gain and drove tens of millions in incremental revenue through improved search ranking performance.

Conclusion: BiListing effectively addresses the challenge of combining diverse unstructured data from Airbnb listings into unified embeddings, demonstrating significant business impact through improved search capabilities and revenue generation.

Abstract: Airbnb is a leader in offering travel accommodations. Airbnb has historically
relied on structured data to understand, rank, and recommend listings to guests
due to the limited capabilities and associated complexity arising from
extracting meaningful information from text and images. With the rise of
representation learning, leveraging rich information from text and photos has
become easier. A popular approach has been to create embeddings for text
documents and images to enable use cases of computing similarities between
listings or using embeddings as features in an ML model.
  However, an Airbnb listing has diverse unstructured data: multiple images,
various unstructured text documents such as title, description, and reviews,
making this approach challenging. Specifically, it is a non-trivial task to
combine multiple embeddings of different pieces of information to reach a
single representation.
  This paper proposes BiListing, for Bimodal Listing, an approach to align text
and photos of a listing by leveraging large-language models and pretrained
language-image models. The BiListing approach has several favorable
characteristics: capturing unstructured data into a single embedding vector per
listing and modality, enabling zero-shot capability to search inventory
efficiently in user-friendly semantics, overcoming the cold start problem, and
enabling listing-to-listing search along a single modality, or both.

### [195] [TF-TransUNet1D: Time-Frequency Guided Transformer U-Net for Robust ECG Denoising in Digital Twin](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20398)
*Shijie Wang,Lei Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TF-TransUNet1D is a novel 1D deep neural network that combines U-Net encoder-decoder with Transformer encoder and hybrid time-frequency loss for ECG denoising, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG signals are crucial for cardiac digital twins but often corrupted by noise and artifacts, compromising diagnostic utility and requiring robust denoising methods.

Method: Proposes TF-TransUNet1D with U-Net encoder-decoder architecture integrated with Transformer encoder, using dual-domain loss function that optimizes both time-domain waveform reconstruction and frequency-domain spectral fidelity.

Result: Achieved mean absolute error of 0.1285 and Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.9540, demonstrating consistent superiority over state-of-the-art baselines in SNR improvement and error metrics on MIT-BIH and NSTDB datasets.

Conclusion: The model provides high-precision ECG denoising, bridging a critical gap in pre-processing pipelines for cardiac digital twins and enabling more reliable real-time monitoring and personalized modeling.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals serve as a foundational data source for
cardiac digital twins, yet their diagnostic utility is frequently compromised
by noise and artifacts. To address this issue, we propose TF-TransUNet1D, a
novel one-dimensional deep neural network that integrates a U-Net-based
encoder-decoder architecture with a Transformer encoder, guided by a hybrid
time-frequency domain loss. The model is designed to simultaneously capture
local morphological features and long-range temporal dependencies, which are
critical for preserving the diagnostic integrity of ECG signals. To enhance
denoising robustness, we introduce a dual-domain loss function that jointly
optimizes waveform reconstruction in the time domain and spectral fidelity in
the frequency domain. In particular, the frequency-domain component effectively
suppresses high-frequency noise while maintaining the spectral structure of the
signal, enabling recovery of subtle but clinically significant waveform
components. We evaluate TF-TransUNet1D using synthetically corrupted signals
from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and the Noise Stress Test Database
(NSTDB). Comparative experiments against state-of-the-art baselines demonstrate
consistent superiority of our model in terms of SNR improvement and error
metrics, achieving a mean absolute error of 0.1285 and Pearson correlation
coefficient of 0.9540. By delivering high-precision denoising, this work
bridges a critical gap in pre-processing pipelines for cardiac digital twins,
enabling more reliable real-time monitoring and personalized modeling.

*Zhongpan Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TLinFormer is a novel linear attention architecture that achieves strict linear complexity while computing exact attention scores, addressing the quadratic complexity bottleneck of standard Transformers for long-sequence tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Transformer's self-attention mechanism has quadratic complexity with sequence length, limiting its application in long-sequence tasks. Existing linear attention methods sacrifice performance through kernel approximations or restrictive context selection.

Method: TLinFormer reconfigures neuron connection patterns based on topological structure of information flow to achieve linear complexity while maintaining exact attention computation and full historical context awareness.

Result: TLinFormer demonstrates overwhelming advantages in inference latency, KV cache efficiency, memory footprint, and overall speedup compared to standard Transformer baselines on long-sequence inference tasks.

Conclusion: TLinFormer successfully bridges the performance gap between efficient attention methods and standard attention, providing a practical solution for long-sequence applications without sacrificing model performance.

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has become a cornerstone of modern artificial
intelligence, but its core self-attention mechanism suffers from a complexity
bottleneck that scales quadratically with sequence length, severely limiting
its application in long-sequence tasks. To address this challenge, existing
linear attention methods typically sacrifice model performance by relying on
data-agnostic kernel approximations or restrictive context selection. This
paper returns to the first principles of connectionism, starting from the
topological structure of information flow, to introduce a novel linear
attention architecture-\textbf{TLinFormer}. By reconfiguring neuron connection
patterns, TLinFormer achieves strict linear complexity while computing exact
attention scores and ensuring information flow remains aware of the full
historical context. This design aims to bridge the performance gap prevalent
between existing efficient attention methods and standard attention. Through a
series of experiments, we systematically evaluate the performance of TLinFormer
against a standard Transformer baseline on long-sequence inference tasks. The
results demonstrate that TLinFormer exhibits overwhelming advantages in key
metrics such as \textbf{inference latency}, \textbf{KV cache efficiency},
\textbf{memory footprint}, and \textbf{overall speedup}.

### [197] [Assessing local deformation and computing scalar curvature with nonlinear conformal regularization of decoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20413)
*Benjamin Couéraud,Vikram Sunkara,Christof Schütte*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new geometric regularization method called nonlinear conformal regularization is introduced for autoencoders to improve dimensionality reduction while allowing local deformations and enabling computation of manifold curvature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve autoencoder-based dimensionality reduction by introducing geometric regularization that preserves local structure while allowing flexibility, and to enable quantitative analysis of the learned manifold's geometric properties.

Method: Proposes nonlinear conformal regularization for decoder maps in autoencoders, which permits local variations while maintaining geometric structure. Introduces a conformal factor to measure local deformation and enables computation of scalar curvature of the learned manifold.

Result: The method allows local variations in the decoder map while providing quantitative indicators of deformation. Implementation on Swiss roll and CelebA datasets demonstrates successful computation of geometric quantities like conformal factor and scalar curvature.

Conclusion: Nonlinear conformal regularization provides an effective geometric constraint for autoencoders, enabling both flexible representation learning and quantitative geometric analysis of the learned manifold structure.

Abstract: One aim of dimensionality reduction is to discover the main factors that
explain the data, and as such is paramount to many applications. When working
with high dimensional data, autoencoders offer a simple yet effective approach
to learn low-dimensional representations. The two components of a general
autoencoder consist first of an encoder that maps the observed data onto a
latent space; and second a decoder that maps the latent space back to the
original observation space, which allows to learn a low-dimensional manifold
representation of the original data. In this article, we introduce a new type
of geometric regularization for decoding maps approximated by deep neural
networks, namely nonlinear conformal regularization. This regularization
procedure permits local variations of the decoder map and comes with a new
scalar field called conformal factor which acts as a quantitative indicator of
the amount of local deformation sustained by the latent space when mapped into
the original data space. We also show that this regularization technique allows
the computation of the scalar curvature of the learned manifold. Implementation
and experiments on the Swiss roll and CelebA datasets are performed to
illustrate how to obtain these quantities from the architecture.

### [198] [On Identifying Why and When Foundation Models Perform Well on Time-Series Forecasting Using Automated Explanations and Rating](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20437)
*Michael Widener,Kausik Lakkaraju,John Aydin,Biplav Srivastava*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes time-series forecasting models using XAI and RDE methods, finding that feature-engineered models outperform foundation models in volatile domains while providing better interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time-series forecasting models are increasingly used for real-world decisions but their performance variability and opaque nature raise concerns about reliability and interpretability.

Method: Combined traditional explainable AI (XAI) with Rating Driven Explanations (RDE) to evaluate four model architectures (ARIMA, Gradient Boosting, Chronos, Llama) across four diverse datasets in finance, energy, transportation, and automotive domains.

Result: Feature-engineered models (Gradient Boosting) consistently outperformed foundation models (Chronos) in volatile or sparse domains (power, car parts) with more interpretable explanations, while foundation models excelled only in stable or trend-driven contexts (finance).

Conclusion: The choice between feature-engineered and foundation models should be domain-dependent, with feature-engineered models preferred for volatile/sparse domains due to better performance and interpretability, while foundation models suit stable/trend-driven contexts.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting models (TSFM) have evolved from classical statistical
methods to sophisticated foundation models, yet understanding why and when
these models succeed or fail remains challenging. Despite this known
limitation, time series forecasting models are increasingly used to generate
information that informs real-world actions with equally real consequences.
Understanding the complexity, performance variability, and opaque nature of
these models then becomes a valuable endeavor to combat serious concerns about
how users should interact with and rely on these models' outputs. This work
addresses these concerns by combining traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods
with Rating Driven Explanations (RDE) to assess TSFM performance and
interpretability across diverse domains and use cases. We evaluate four
distinct model architectures: ARIMA, Gradient Boosting, Chronos (time-series
specific foundation model), Llama (general-purpose; both fine-tuned and base
models) on four heterogeneous datasets spanning finance, energy,
transportation, and automotive sales domains. In doing so, we demonstrate that
feature-engineered models (e.g., Gradient Boosting) consistently outperform
foundation models (e.g., Chronos) in volatile or sparse domains (e.g., power,
car parts) while providing more interpretable explanations, whereas foundation
models excel only in stable or trend-driven contexts (e.g., finance).

*Ruben Solozabal,Velibor Bojkovic,Hilal AlQuabeh,Kentaro Inui,Martin Takáč*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates diagonal initialization schemes for state space models from a frequency perspective, proposes S4D-DFouT initialization, and achieves SOTA results on Long Range Arena benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SSM initialization relies on HiPPO framework, but diagonal variants haven't been systematically studied. The paper aims to understand parameterization and learning biases in diagonal state-space models.

Method: Systematic investigation of diagonal SSM initialization from frequency perspective, analysis of pole placement role, and proposal of S4D-DFouT initialization on discrete Fourier domain.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art results on Long Range Arena benchmark, enabling training from scratch on very large datasets like PathX-256.

Conclusion: The frequency perspective provides valuable insights for diagonal SSM initialization, and the proposed S4D-DFouT method effectively scales these models while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Current methods for initializing state space models (SSMs) parameters mainly
rely on the \textit{HiPPO framework}, which is based on an online approximation
of orthogonal polynomials. Recently, diagonal alternatives have shown to reach
a similar level of performance while being significantly more efficient due to
the simplification in the kernel computation. However, the \textit{HiPPO
framework} does not explicitly study the role of its diagonal variants. In this
paper, we take a further step to investigate the role of diagonal SSM
initialization schemes from the frequency perspective. Our work seeks to
systematically understand how to parameterize these models and uncover the
learning biases inherent in such diagonal state-space models. Based on our
observations, we propose a diagonal initialization on the discrete Fourier
domain \textit{S4D-DFouT}. The insights in the role of pole placing in the
initialization enable us to further scale them and achieve state-of-the-art
results on the Long Range Arena benchmark, allowing us to train from scratch on
very large datasets as PathX-256.

### [200] [Towards Mitigating Excessive Forgetting in LLM Unlearning via Entanglement-Aware Unlearning with Proxy Constraint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20443)
*Zhihao Liu,Jian Lou,Yuke Hu,Xiaochen Li,Tailun Chen,Yitian Chen,Zhan Qin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EAGLE-PC is a novel machine unlearning framework that uses entanglement-aware loss reweighting and proxy constraints to achieve better forgetting-utility trade-off in LLMs, approaching full retraining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing machine unlearning methods that lack proper forgetting boundaries, causing either under-forgotten (privacy risks) or over-forgotten (utility degradation) outcomes when removing data from LLMs.

Method: Two key components: 1) Entanglement-awareness guided loss reweighting that measures sample similarity to determine forgetting effort, 2) Proxy constraint using ICL-generated test data to softly regularize forgetting and prevent over-forgetting. Compatible with existing gradient-based objectives.

Result: Evaluated on TOFU and MUSE benchmarks, showing consistent improvements in forgetting-utility trade-off across multiple LLMs. Combined with NPO+GD optimizer, approaches full retraining performance.

Conclusion: EAGLE-PC provides a scalable and robust unlearning solution that effectively addresses the forgetting boundary problem in machine unlearning for LLMs, offering plug-and-play enhancement to existing methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive datasets that may include
private or copyrighted content. Due to growing privacy and ownership concerns,
data owners may request the removal of their data from trained models. Machine
unlearning provides a practical solution by removing the influence of specific
data without full retraining. However, most existing methods lack a sound
forgetting boundary, causing some samples to be under-forgotten, leaving
residual leakage risks, while others remain over-forgotten at the expense of
degraded utility.
  In this work, we propose EAGLE-PC (Entanglement-Awareness Guided Loss
Reweighting with Proxy Constraint), a novel unlearning framework that addresses
these limitations through two key components. First, entanglement-awareness
guided loss reweighting determines the forgetting effort of each sample by
measuring its similarity to retain samples in the embedding space, enabling
more targeted and effective unlearning. Second, a proxy constraint leveraging
ICL (In-Context Learning) generated test data softly regularizes the forgetting
process, effectively mitigating over-forgetting. EAGLE-PC is compatible with
existing gradient-based objectives and serves as a plug-and-play enhancement.
We evaluate EAGLE-PC on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks, showing consistent
improvements in the forgetting-utility trade-off across multiple LLMs. Combined
with the NPO+GD optimizer, it approaches full retraining performance, offering
a scalable and robust unlearning solution.

Motivation: Privacy and regulatory barriers prevent using real-world data in high-stakes domains like healthcare and finance, creating need for differentially private synthetic data alternatives.

Method: Developed a unified benchmark that addresses domain-specific challenges including representative data selection, realistic privacy budgets, accounting for pre-training, and multiple evaluation metrics to assess state-of-the-art privacy-preserving generation methods.

Result: Evaluation across five domain-specific datasets revealed significant utility and fidelity degradation compared to real data, particularly under strict privacy constraints.

Conclusion: Current approaches have limitations, highlighting the need for advanced privacy-preserving data sharing methods and establishing evaluation standards for realistic scenarios.

Abstract: Generative AI offers transformative potential for high-stakes domains such as
healthcare and finance, yet privacy and regulatory barriers hinder the use of
real-world data. To address this, differentially private synthetic data
generation has emerged as a promising alternative. In this work, we introduce a
unified benchmark to systematically evaluate the utility and fidelity of text
datasets generated under formal Differential Privacy (DP) guarantees. Our
benchmark addresses key challenges in domain-specific benchmarking, including
choice of representative data and realistic privacy budgets, accounting for
pre-training and a variety of evaluation metrics. We assess state-of-the-art
privacy-preserving generation methods across five domain-specific datasets,
revealing significant utility and fidelity degradation compared to real data,
especially under strict privacy constraints. These findings underscore the
limitations of current approaches, outline the need for advanced
privacy-preserving data sharing methods and set a precedent regarding their
evaluation in realistic scenarios.

*Haiyan Wang,Ye Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes SHGT framework using hypergraph Transformer to capture higher-order dependencies in EHR data for better diagnosis prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN methods fail to capture higher-order clinical dependencies and have limited representation power due to pairwise relations and localized message-passing.

Method: Structure-aware HyperGraph Transformer (SHGT) with hypergraph structural encoder, Transformer architecture for global reasoning, and hypergraph reconstruction loss.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art models on real-world EHR datasets for diagnosis prediction.

Conclusion: SHGT effectively addresses limitations of traditional GNNs by capturing higher-order interactions and global dependencies in EHR data.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) systematically organize patient health data
through standardized medical codes, serving as a comprehensive and invaluable
source for predictive modeling. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated
effectiveness in modeling interactions between medical codes within EHR.
However, existing GNN-based methods are inadequate due to: a) their reliance on
pairwise relations fails to capture the inherent higher-order dependencies in
clinical data, and b) the localized message-passing scheme limits
representation power. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel
Structure-aware HyperGraph Transformer (SHGT) framework following three-fold
ideas: a) employing a hypergraph structural encoder to capture higher-order
interactions among medical codes, b) integrating the Transformer architecture
to reason over the entire hypergraph, and c) designing a tailored loss function
incorporating hypergraph reconstruction to preserve the hypergraph's original
structure. Experiments on real-world EHR datasets demonstrate that the proposed
SHGT outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on diagnosis prediction.

TL;DR: MedGR² introduces a self-improving framework that co-develops a data generator and reward model to automatically create high-quality medical data, enabling superior supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning performance with state-of-the-art cross-modality generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models in medicine suffer from scarcity of expert-annotated data, poor generalization on unseen modalities/tasks, and lack of reliable reward signals for reinforcement learning in data-scarce medical domains.

Method: MedGR² framework creates a virtuous cycle by co-developing a data generator and reward model to automatically produce high-quality multi-modal medical data. Uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for reinforcement learning with the generated data.

Result: SFT with MedGR²-produced data surpasses baselines trained on large human-curated datasets. RL with this data achieves state-of-the-art cross-modality and cross-task generalization, outperforming specialized RL methods. Compact models achieve performance competitive with foundation models 10x larger.

Conclusion: MedGR² transforms medical AI from data scarcity to data generation, enabling data-efficient learning and unlocking RL's full potential for building truly generalizable medical AI systems in high-stakes domains.

Abstract: The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in medicine is critically
hampered by the scarcity of high-quality, expert-annotated data. Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) on existing datasets often leads to poor generalization on
unseen modalities and tasks, while Reinforcement Learning (RL), a promising
alternative, is stymied by the lack of reliable reward signals in this
data-scarce domain. To break this impasse, we introduce Generative Reward
Learning for Medical Reasoning (MedGR$^2$), a novel framework that creates a
self-improving virtuous cycle. MedGR$^2$ co-develops a data generator and a
reward model, enabling the automated, continuous creation of high-quality,
multi-modal medical data that serves as both a superior training source for SFT
and RL. Our experiments demonstrate that SFT with MedGR$^2$-produced data
already surpasses baselines trained on large-scale, human-curated datasets.
Crucially, when leveraging this data for RL via Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), our model achieves state-of-the-art cross-modality and
cross-task generalization, significantly outperforming specialized RL-based
methods. Furthermore, our compact model, empowered by MedGR$^2$, achieves
performance competitive with foundation models possessing over 10 times more
parameters. MedGR$^2$ presents a new paradigm for data-efficient learning in
high-stakes domains, transforming the problem from data scarcity to data
generation and unlocking the full potential of RL for building truly
generalizable medical AI.

*Yang Luo,Zangwei Zheng,Ziheng Qin,Zirui Zhu,Yong Liu,Yang You*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MERIT is a novel optimizer that uses max-norm and element-wise trust ratios to enable stable large-batch training of language models without performance degradation, achieving 6k batch size on GPT-2 Medium.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing optimizers like AdamW and LAMB suffer from performance degradation in large-batch training due to attention layer bottlenecks and ineffective trust ratio mechanisms that fail to properly constrain max attention logits.

Method: Proposes MERIT optimizer that leverages max-norm to calculate trust ratios for better constraining max attention logits, and constructs element-wise trust ratios focusing on local weight structures for more robust update scaling.

Result: Extensive experiments show MERIT enables 6k batch size training of GPT-2 Medium without performance degradation compared to standard 480 batch size, handling 48B training tokens successfully.

Conclusion: MERIT successfully improves training stability for large-batch training by considering max attention logit and finer-granularity trust ratios, paving the way for faster development of large language models.

Abstract: Large-batch training has become a cornerstone in accelerating the training of
deep neural networks, yet it poses challenges in optimization and
generalization. Existing optimizers like AdamW present performance degradation
during language models' large-batch training, due to the information bottleneck
in attention layers caused by the sharp increase of max attention logit. While
the LAMB optimizer partially addresses this issue, some attention layers still
face this issue. The reason is that $l_2$-norm-based trust ratios in LAMB are
less effective in directly influencing the max value of query/key weights.
Furthermore, the weight-wise trust ratio in LAMB is error-prone as it overlooks
relationships of weight values within rows or columns. Building on these
observations, we propose a novel optimizer, MERIT, which leverages the max-norm
to calculate the trust ratio to constrain the max attention logit more
effectively. Moreover, we further construct element-wise trust ratios to
provide more robust update scaling by focusing on local weight structures.
Extensive experiments of large-batch training across various sizes of GPT-2
models demonstrate the superior performance of MERIT. Notably, during the
training of GPT-2 Medium, MERIT enables a 6k batch size without any performance
degradation compared to the standard batch size (480) with 48B training tokens.
This work highlights the importance of considering the max attention logit and
finer-granularity trust ratio in large-batch training. It successfully improves
the training stability and paves the way for larger batch usage, enabling
faster development and iteration of large language models. Code is available at

TL;DR: Exact stochastic inference for Gaussian Processes with finite-dimensional RKHS kernels, outperforming approximation methods when memory constraints limit batch size and inducing points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current stochastic hyperparameter learning methods for GPs rely on approximations that don't guarantee convergence to true marginal likelihood stationary points.

Method: Proposed algorithms for exact stochastic inference of GPs using kernels that induce moderate finite-dimensional RKHS, with extension to infinite-dimensional RKHS at cost of exactness.

Result: Achieves better experimental results than existing methods under memory constraints that limit batch size and number of inducing points.

Conclusion: Exact stochastic inference approach provides superior performance for GP hyperparameter learning compared to approximation-based methods, especially in memory-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Current methods for stochastic hyperparameter learning in Gaussian Processes
(GPs) rely on approximations, such as computing biased stochastic gradients or
using inducing points in stochastic variational inference. However, when using
such methods we are not guaranteed to converge to a stationary point of the
true marginal likelihood. In this work, we propose algorithms for exact
stochastic inference of GPs with kernels that induce a Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Space (RKHS) of moderate finite dimension. Our approach can also be
extended to infinite dimensional RKHSs at the cost of forgoing exactness. Both
for finite and infinite dimensional RKHSs, our method achieves better
experimental results than existing methods when memory resources limit the
feasible batch size and the possible number of inducing points.

TL;DR: LVN introduces local virtual nodes with trainable embeddings to mitigate over-squashing in GNNs without disrupting global graph structure, using node centrality to identify bottleneck regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Over-squashing in GNNs creates bottlenecks when gathering information from wide neighborhoods into fixed-size representations. Existing remedies like graph rewiring and global virtual nodes alter the input graph's topology and disrupt domain knowledge encoded in original structure.

Method: Proposes Local Virtual Nodes (LVN) with trainable embeddings placed based on node centrality to identify potential bottlenecks. LVNs improve connectivity in central regions and facilitate communication between distant nodes without adding more layers.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show LVNs enhance structural connectivity and significantly improve performance on both graph and node classification tasks.

Conclusion: LVN effectively alleviates over-squashing effects while preserving the global structure of input graphs, demonstrating improved performance across various classification tasks without disrupting domain knowledge.

Abstract: Over-squashing is a challenge in training graph neural networks for tasks
involving long-range dependencies. In such tasks, a GNN's receptive field
should be large enough to enable communication between distant nodes. However,
gathering information from a wide range of neighborhoods and squashing its
content into fixed-size node representations makes message-passing vulnerable
to bottlenecks. Graph rewiring and adding virtual nodes are commonly studied
remedies that create additional pathways around bottlenecks to mitigate
over-squashing. However, these techniques alter the input graph's global
topology and disrupt the domain knowledge encoded in the original graph
structure, both of which could be essential to specific tasks and domains. This
study presents Local Virtual Nodes (LVN) with trainable embeddings to alleviate
the effects of over-squashing without significantly corrupting the global
structure of the input graph. The position of the LVNs is determined by the
node centrality, which indicates the existence of potential bottlenecks. Thus,
the proposed approach aims to improve the connectivity in the regions with
likely bottlenecks. Furthermore, trainable LVN embeddings shared across
selected central regions facilitate communication between distant nodes without
adding more layers. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that LVNs can enhance structural connectivity and significantly improve
performance on graph and node classification tasks. The code can be found at

Method: Introduces model-specific distance metric and algorithm to verify survey credibility for regression models without reconstructing the underlying model.

Result: Algorithm achieves dimension-independent sample complexity, unlike traditional methods that scale linearly with data dimensionality when reconstructing models.

Abstract: Assessing whether a sample survey credibly represents the population is a
critical question for ensuring the validity of downstream research. Generally,
this problem reduces to estimating the distance between two high-dimensional
distributions, which typically requires a number of samples that grows
exponentially with the dimension. However, depending on the model used for data
analysis, the conclusions drawn from the data may remain consistent across
different underlying distributions. In this context, we propose a task-based
approach to assess the credibility of sampled surveys. Specifically, we
introduce a model-specific distance metric to quantify this notion of
credibility. We also design an algorithm to verify the credibility of survey
data in the context of regression models. Notably, the sample complexity of our
algorithm is independent of the data dimension. This efficiency stems from the
fact that the algorithm focuses on verifying the credibility of the survey data
rather than reconstructing the underlying regression model. Furthermore, we
show that if one attempts to verify credibility by reconstructing the
regression model, the sample complexity scales linearly with the dimensionality
of the data. We prove the theoretical correctness of our algorithm and
numerically demonstrate our algorithm's performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many scientific contexts provide multi-trial supervision data that can enhance independent component analysis, but existing methods don't fully leverage this additional supervision.

Method: Proximal gradient-type algorithm in the space of invertible matrices combined with joint learning of a prediction model through backpropagation.

Result: Increased success rate of non-convex optimization and improved interpretability of independent components demonstrated on synthetic and real data experiments.

Conclusion: Incorporating multi-trial supervision through the proposed stochastic algorithm significantly improves ICA performance and component interpretability.

Abstract: We develop a stochastic algorithm for independent component analysis that
incorporates multi-trial supervision, which is available in many scientific
contexts. The method blends a proximal gradient-type algorithm in the space of

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAE-ViT adaptation for 1D ultrasound signals enables self-supervised pre-training on synthetic data, outperforming scratch-trained models and CNNs in downstream tasks like ToF classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultrasound signals in industrial applications (NDT/SHM) face scarce labeled data and task-specific processing needs. MAEs show success in other domains but remain unexplored for 1D ultrasound analysis.

Method: Leverage MAE to pre-train on unlabeled synthetic ultrasound signals, systematically investigating model size, patch size, and masking ratio impacts on pre-training efficiency and downstream accuracy.

Result: Pre-trained models significantly outperform scratch-trained models and optimized CNN baselines. Synthetic pre-training shows superior transferability to real-world signals compared to limited real datasets.

Conclusion: MAEs demonstrate strong potential for advancing ultrasound signal analysis through scalable, self-supervised learning with synthetic data pre-training.

Abstract: We investigated the adaptation and performance of Masked Autoencoders (MAEs)
with Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures for self-supervised representation
learning on one-dimensional (1D) ultrasound signals. Although MAEs have
demonstrated significant success in computer vision and other domains, their
use for 1D signal analysis, especially for raw ultrasound data, remains largely
unexplored. Ultrasound signals are vital in industrial applications such as
non-destructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM), where
labeled data are often scarce and signal processing is highly task-specific. We
propose an approach that leverages MAE to pre-train on unlabeled synthetic
ultrasound signals, enabling the model to learn robust representations that
enhance performance in downstream tasks, such as time-of-flight (ToF)
classification. This study systematically investigated the impact of model
size, patch size, and masking ratio on pre-training efficiency and downstream
accuracy. Our results show that pre-trained models significantly outperform
models trained from scratch and strong convolutional neural network (CNN)
baselines optimized for the downstream task. Additionally, pre-training on
synthetic data demonstrates superior transferability to real-world measured
signals compared with training solely on limited real datasets. This study
underscores the potential of MAEs for advancing ultrasound signal analysis
through scalable, self-supervised learning.

Motivation: LLMs struggle with processing and reasoning over large-scale graph-structure data despite their multimodal capabilities and tool integration.

Method: Developed a comprehensive set of graph algorithms as tools with preprocessing (retrieval) and postprocessing capabilities in a model context protocol (MCP) server that works with any modern LLM.

Result: The GDS agent can solve a wide spectrum of graph tasks, provides accurate grounded answers, and was evaluated with a new benchmark assessing both intermediate tool calls and final responses.

Conclusion: The approach successfully enables LLMs to handle graph algorithmic reasoning, though some challenges remain, and future roadmap is discussed.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable multimodal information
processing and reasoning ability. When equipped with tools through function
calling and enhanced with retrieval-augmented techniques, compound LLM-based
systems can access closed data sources and answer questions about them.
However, they still struggle to process and reason over large-scale
graph-structure data. We introduce the GDS (Graph Data Science) agent in this
technical report. The GDS agent introduces a comprehensive set of graph
algorithms as tools, together with preprocessing (retrieval) and postprocessing
of algorithm results, in a model context protocol (MCP) server. The server can
be used with any modern LLM out-of-the-box. GDS agent allows users to ask any
question that implicitly and intrinsically requires graph algorithmic reasoning
about their data, and quickly obtain accurate and grounded answers. We also
introduce a new benchmark that evaluates intermediate tool calls as well as
final responses. The results indicate that GDS agent is able to solve a wide
spectrum of graph tasks. We also provide detailed case studies for more
open-ended tasks and study scenarios where the agent struggles. Finally, we
discuss the remaining challenges and the future roadmap.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing distributed optimization algorithms rely on bounded gradient assumptions and overlook stochastic gradient impacts in time-varying directed networks, limiting real-time decision-making in dynamic data environments.

Method: TV-HSGT integrates row-stochastic and column-stochastic communication schemes over time-varying digraphs, combining current and recursive stochastic gradients with variance reduction mechanisms to track global descent directions accurately.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows improved dynamic regret bounds without gradient boundedness assumptions. Experimental results on logistic regression confirm effectiveness in dynamic and resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: TV-HSGT provides an effective solution for distributed online optimization in time-varying directed networks, eliminating need for Perron vector estimation while handling stochastic gradients and achieving superior performance in dynamic settings.

Abstract: With the increasing scale and dynamics of data, distributed online
optimization has become essential for real-time decision-making in various
applications. However, existing algorithms often rely on bounded gradient
assumptions and overlook the impact of stochastic gradients, especially in
time-varying directed networks. This study proposes a novel Time-Varying Hybrid
Stochastic Gradient Tracking algorithm named TV-HSGT, based on hybrid
stochastic gradient tracking and variance reduction mechanisms. Specifically,
TV-HSGT integrates row-stochastic and column-stochastic communication schemes
over time-varying digraphs, eliminating the need for Perron vector estimation
or out-degree information. By combining current and recursive stochastic
gradients, it effectively reduces gradient variance while accurately tracking
global descent directions. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that TV-HSGT can
achieve improved bounds on dynamic regret without assuming gradient
boundedness. Experimental results on logistic regression tasks confirm the
effectiveness of TV-HSGT in dynamic and resource-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VarDiU proposes a variational diffusive upper bound with unbiased gradient estimator for diffusion distillation, outperforming Diff-Instruct in generation quality and training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion distillation methods use biased gradient estimates from imperfect denoising score matching, leading to sub-optimal performance in compressing thousand-step teacher models to one-step student generators.

Method: VarDiU introduces a Variational Diffusive Upper Bound that provides an unbiased gradient estimator, which is directly applied to diffusion distillation to avoid the bias from denoising score matching.

Result: The method achieves higher generation quality compared to Diff-Instruct and enables more efficient and stable training for one-step diffusion distillation.

Conclusion: VarDiU's unbiased gradient estimator significantly improves diffusion distillation performance, making it a superior approach for compressing complex diffusion models into efficient one-step generators.

Abstract: Recently, diffusion distillation methods have compressed thousand-step
teacher diffusion models into one-step student generators while preserving
sample quality. Most existing approaches train the student model using a
diffusive divergence whose gradient is approximated via the student's score
function, learned through denoising score matching (DSM). Since DSM training is
imperfect, the resulting gradient estimate is inevitably biased, leading to
sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose VarDiU (pronounced
/va:rdju:/), a Variational Diffusive Upper Bound that admits an unbiased
gradient estimator and can be directly applied to diffusion distillation. Using
this objective, we compare our method with Diff-Instruct and demonstrate that
it achieves higher generation quality and enables a more efficient and stable
training procedure for one-step diffusion distillation.

*Juncai He,Xinliang Liu,Jinchao Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel neural operator framework using self-composition and adaptive training that achieves SOTA performance on scientific ML tasks, including challenging ultrasound tomography problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by iterative methods in numerical PDE solving, the authors aim to enhance neural operator efficiency and accuracy through progressive deepening without explicit block additions.

Method: Self-composition by repeatedly applying a single neural operator block, combined with adaptive train-and-unroll training strategy that gradually increases model depth during training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks and demonstrates superior performance on high-frequency ultrasound computed tomography with computational savings through adaptive training.

Conclusion: The framework provides computationally tractable, accurate, and scalable solutions for large-scale data-driven scientific machine learning applications with theoretical guarantees and practical benefits.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework to enhance the efficiency and
accuracy of neural operators through self-composition, offering both
theoretical guarantees and practical benefits. Inspired by iterative methods in
solving numerical partial differential equations (PDEs), we design a specific
neural operator by repeatedly applying a single neural operator block, we
progressively deepen the model without explicitly adding new blocks, improving
the model's capacity. To train these models efficiently, we introduce an
adaptive train-and-unroll approach, where the depth of the neural operator is
gradually increased during training. This approach reveals an accuracy scaling
law with model depth and offers significant computational savings through our
adaptive training strategy. Our architecture achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on standard benchmarks. We further demonstrate its efficacy on a
challenging high-frequency ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) problem, where
a multigrid-inspired backbone enables superior performance in resolving complex
wave phenomena. The proposed framework provides a computationally tractable,
accurate, and scalable solution for large-scale data-driven scientific machine
learning applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether clinical time series data can be modeled as sequences of latent physiological states with systematic composition rules, and uses this approach to generate synthetic data that performs comparably to original data in forecasting tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of sparse and low-resource data in clinical time series forecasting by uncovering the underlying compositional structure of physiological states, enabling synthetic data generation that preserves the meaningful patterns of original clinical measurements.

Method: Conceptualizes compositionality for time series as a property of data generation, develops data-driven procedures to reconstruct elementary states and composition rules, and evaluates using empirical tests based on domain adaptation perspective comparing expected risk of forecasting models trained on original vs synthesized data.

Result: Experimental results show training on compositionally synthesized data achieves comparable performance to training on original clinical time series data, and evaluation on synthetic test data shows similar results to original test data, outperforming randomization-based augmentation. Significant performance gains were observed in SOFA score prediction when training entirely on compositionally synthesized data.

Conclusion: The compositional approach successfully captures the systematic structure of clinical time series, enabling effective synthetic data generation that alleviates data scarcity problems and provides comparable or even superior performance in clinical forecasting tasks compared to using original data.

Abstract: This work investigates whether time series of natural phenomena can be
understood as being generated by sequences of latent states which are ordered
in systematic and regular ways. We focus on clinical time series and ask
whether clinical measurements can be interpreted as being generated by
meaningful physiological states whose succession follows systematic principles.
Uncovering the underlying compositional structure will allow us to create
synthetic data to alleviate the notorious problem of sparse and low-resource
data settings in clinical time series forecasting, and deepen our understanding
of clinical data. We start by conceptualizing compositionality for time series
as a property of the data generation process, and then study data-driven
procedures that can reconstruct the elementary states and composition rules of
this process. We evaluate the success of this methods using two empirical tests
originating from a domain adaptation perspective. Both tests infer the
similarity of the original time series distribution and the synthetic time
series distribution from the similarity of expected risk of time series
forecasting models trained and tested on original and synthesized data in
specific ways. Our experimental results show that the test set performance
achieved by training on compositionally synthesized data is comparable to
training on original clinical time series data, and that evaluation of models
on compositionally synthesized test data shows similar results to evaluating on
original test data, outperforming randomization-based data augmentation. An
additional downstream evaluation of the prediction task of sequential organ
failure assessment (SOFA) scores shows significant performance gains when model
training is entirely based on compositionally synthesized data compared to
training on original data.

*Weitao Feng,Lixu Wang,Tianyi Wei,Jie Zhang,Chongyang Gao,Sinong Zhan,Peizhuo Lv,Wei Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RL-based fine-tuning poses greater risks than SFT for harmful misuse of LLMs. TokenBuncher defends against this by suppressing model response uncertainty through entropy-as-reward RL and Token Noiser mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs grow more capable, the risks of harmful misuse through fine-tuning increase. While most prior work focused on SFT-based attacks, this paper demonstrates that RL enables more effective safety alignment breaking and harmful task assistance.

Method: Proposes TokenBuncher defense that suppresses model response uncertainty - the foundation RL relies on. Uses entropy-as-reward RL and Token Noiser mechanism to prevent escalation of harmful capabilities while preserving benign utility.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple models and RL algorithms show TokenBuncher robustly mitigates harmful RL fine-tuning while maintaining benign task utility and fine-tunability.

Conclusion: RL-based harmful fine-tuning poses greater systemic risk than SFT, and TokenBuncher provides an effective and general defense against this emerging threat.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, so do the
risks of harmful misuse through fine-tuning. While most prior studies assume
that attackers rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for such misuse, we
systematically demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) enables adversaries
to more effectively break safety alignment and facilitate advanced harmful task
assistance, under matched computational budgets. To counter this emerging
threat, we propose TokenBuncher, the first effective defense specifically
targeting RL-based harmful fine-tuning. TokenBuncher suppresses the foundation
on which RL relies: model response uncertainty. By constraining uncertainty,
RL-based fine-tuning can no longer exploit distinct reward signals to drive the
model toward harmful behaviors. We realize this defense through
entropy-as-reward RL and a Token Noiser mechanism designed to prevent the
escalation of expert-domain harmful capabilities. Extensive experiments across
multiple models and RL algorithms show that TokenBuncher robustly mitigates
harmful RL fine-tuning while preserving benign task utility and finetunability.
Our results highlight that RL-based harmful fine-tuning poses a greater
systemic risk than SFT, and that TokenBuncher provides an effective and general
defense.

*Shaocong Wang,Tong Liu,Ming Li,Minjing Yu,Yong-Jin Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EEGDM is a novel self-supervised EEG representation learning method using latent diffusion models that generates EEG signals to learn robust representations, achieving competitive performance across diverse tasks with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EEG representation learning methods rely on simple masked reconstruction objectives that fail to fully capture the rich semantic information and complex patterns in EEG signals, especially when training data is limited.

Method: Proposes EEGDM based on latent diffusion model with an EEG encoder that distills signals and channel augmentations into compact representations, using EEG signal generation as self-supervised objective to guide the diffusion process.

Result: EEGDM can reconstruct high-quality EEG signals, learns robust representations effectively, and achieves competitive performance across diverse downstream tasks with modest pre-training data size.

Conclusion: EEGDM demonstrates strong generalizability and practical utility as a representation learner for EEG signals, effectively capturing EEG semantics through its diffusion-based approach.

Abstract: While electroencephalography (EEG) signal analysis using deep learning has
shown great promise, existing approaches still face significant challenges in
learning generalizable representations that perform well across diverse tasks,
particularly when training data is limited. Current EEG representation learning
methods including EEGPT and LaBraM typically rely on simple masked
reconstruction objective, which may not fully capture the rich semantic
information and complex patterns inherent in EEG signals. In this paper, we
propose EEGDM, a novel self-supervised EEG representation learning method based
on the latent diffusion model, which leverages EEG signal generation as a
self-supervised objective, turning the diffusion model into a strong
representation learner capable of capturing EEG semantics. EEGDM incorporates
an EEG encoder that distills EEG signals and their channel augmentations into a
compact representation, acting as conditional information to guide the
diffusion model for generating EEG signals. This design endows EEGDM with a
compact latent space, which not only offers ample control over the generative
process but also can be leveraged for downstream tasks. Experimental results
show that EEGDM (1) can reconstruct high-quality EEG signals, (2) effectively
learns robust representations, and (3) achieves competitive performance with
modest pre-training data size across diverse downstream tasks, underscoring its
generalizability and practical utility.

*Sam Houliston,Ambroise Odonnat,Charles Arnal,Vivien Cabannes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tool-augmented language models with external retrieval (in-tool learning) provably outperform memorization (in-weight learning) for factual recall, as memorization is fundamentally limited by parameter count while tool-use enables unbounded factual recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While tool-augmented language models with retrieval, memory, or external APIs are transforming AI, their theoretical advantages over pure memorization approaches remain underexplored and not well-understood.

Method: The authors demonstrate the benefits through theoretical analysis showing parameter count limitations of memorization, prove tool-use enables unbounded factual recall via efficient circuit construction, and validate with controlled experiments comparing tool-using models against memorizing ones.

Result: Tool-using models consistently outperform memorizing models in factual recall tasks. For pretrained LLMs, teaching tool-use and general rules proves more effective than finetuning facts into memory.

Conclusion: The work establishes both theoretical and empirical foundations showing that tool-augmented workflows are not just practical but provably more scalable than pure memorization approaches for factual recall tasks.

Abstract: Tool-augmented language models, equipped with retrieval, memory, or external
APIs, are reshaping AI, yet their theoretical advantages remain underexplored.
In this paper, we address this question by demonstrating the benefits of
in-tool learning (external retrieval) over in-weight learning (memorization)
for factual recall. We show that the number of facts a model can memorize
solely in its weights is fundamentally limited by its parameter count. In
contrast, we prove that tool-use enables unbounded factual recall via a simple
and efficient circuit construction. These results are validated in controlled
experiments, where tool-using models consistently outperform memorizing ones.
We further show that for pretrained large language models, teaching tool-use
and general rules is more effective than finetuning facts into memory. Our work
provides both a theoretical and empirical foundation, establishing why
tool-augmented workflows are not just practical, but provably more scalable.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: cMALC-D uses LLMs to generate meaningful curricula and diversity-based context blending to improve multi-agent reinforcement learning generalization in uncertain environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing contextual MARL methods rely on unreliable proxy signals like noisy value estimates that are unstable in multi-agent settings due to inter-agent dynamics and partial observability.

Method: Proposes LLM-guided curriculum learning with diversity-based context blending that creates new training scenarios by combining features from prior contexts to prevent mode collapse.

Result: Experiments in traffic signal control domains show significant improvements in both generalization and sample efficiency compared to existing curriculum learning baselines.

Conclusion: cMALC-D framework effectively addresses the brittleness of MARL algorithms in real-world scenarios by providing more robust training and evaluation through LLM-guided curricula and diversity mechanisms.

Abstract: Many multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are trained in
fixed simulation environments, making them brittle when deployed in real-world
scenarios with more complex and uncertain conditions. Contextual MARL (cMARL)
addresses this by parameterizing environments with context variables and
training a context-agnostic policy that performs well across all environment
configurations. Existing cMARL methods attempt to use curriculum learning to
help train and evaluate context-agnostic policies, but they often rely on
unreliable proxy signals, such as value estimates or generalized advantage
estimates that are noisy and unstable in multi-agent settings due to
inter-agent dynamics and partial observability. To address these issues, we
propose Contextual Multi-Agent LLM-Guided Curriculum Learning with
Diversity-Based Context Blending (cMALC-D), a framework that uses Large
Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantically meaningful curricula and
provide a more robust evaluation signal. To prevent mode collapse and encourage
exploration, we introduce a novel diversity-based context blending mechanism
that creates new training scenarios by combining features from prior contexts.
Experiments in traffic signal control domains demonstrate that cMALC-D
significantly improves both generalization and sample efficiency compared to
existing curriculum learning baselines. We provide code at

*Yang Gao,Dongjie Wang,Scott Piersall,Ye Zhang,Liqiang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a novel GPT-based framework for automated feature transformation that reduces computational costs while maintaining performance through multi-objective optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feature transformation methods rely on sequential encoder-decoder structures that cause high computational costs and parameter requirements, limiting scalability and efficiency.

Method: Four-step framework: transformation records collection, embedding space construction with revised GPT model, gradient-ascent search, and autoregressive reconstruction. The GPT model handles both sequence reconstruction and performance estimation.

Result: Experimental results show the framework matches or exceeds baseline performance with significant gains in computational efficiency on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Transformer-based architectures show great potential for scalable, high-performance automated feature transformation with reduced computational overhead.

Abstract: Feature transformation plays a critical role in enhancing machine learning
model performance by optimizing data representations. Recent state-of-the-art
approaches address this task as a continuous embedding optimization problem,
converting discrete search into a learnable process. Although effective, these
methods often rely on sequential encoder-decoder structures that cause high
computational costs and parameter requirements, limiting scalability and
efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that
accomplishes automated feature transformation through four steps:
transformation records collection, embedding space construction with a revised
Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model, gradient-ascent search, and
autoregressive reconstruction. In our approach, the revised GPT model serves
two primary functions: (a) feature transformation sequence reconstruction and
(b) model performance estimation and enhancement for downstream tasks by
constructing the embedding space. Such a multi-objective optimization framework
reduces parameter size and accelerates transformation processes. Experimental
results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed framework matches or
exceeds baseline performance, with significant gains in computational
efficiency. This work highlights the potential of transformer-based
architectures for scalable, high-performance automated feature transformation.

*Zeyue Zhang,Lin Song,Erkang Bao,Xiaoling Lv,Xinyue Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ATM-GAD is a graph neural network that uses temporal motifs and adaptive time windows to detect financial fraud more effectively than previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional ML models fail to detect fraud in modern financial systems due to complex entity relationships and fast-changing behaviors. Existing graph-based methods overlook temporal patterns and account-specific anomaly intervals.

Method: Uses Temporal Motif Extractor to condense transaction histories into informative motifs, dual-attention blocks (IntraA for within-motif interactions, InterA for cross-motif aggregation), and Adaptive Time-Window Learner to tailor observation windows per account.

Result: Outperforms seven strong anomaly-detection baselines across four real-world datasets, successfully uncovering fraud patterns missed by earlier methods.

Conclusion: ATM-GAD effectively addresses temporal fraud hallmarks through motif-based analysis and adaptive time windows, demonstrating superior financial fraud detection capabilities.

Abstract: Financial fraud detection is essential to safeguard billions of dollars, yet
the intertwined entities and fast-changing transaction behaviors in modern
financial systems routinely defeat conventional machine learning models. Recent
graph-based detectors make headway by representing transactions as networks,
but they still overlook two fraud hallmarks rooted in time: (1) temporal
motifs--recurring, telltale subgraphs that reveal suspicious money flows as
they unfold--and (2) account-specific intervals of anomalous activity, when
fraud surfaces only in short bursts unique to each entity. To exploit both
signals, we introduce ATM-GAD, an adaptive graph neural network that leverages
temporal motifs for financial anomaly detection. A Temporal Motif Extractor
condenses each account's transaction history into the most informative motifs,
preserving both topology and temporal patterns. These motifs are then analyzed
by dual-attention blocks: IntraA reasons over interactions within a single
motif, while InterA aggregates evidence across motifs to expose multi-step
fraud schemes. In parallel, a differentiable Adaptive Time-Window Learner
tailors the observation window for every node, allowing the model to focus
precisely on the most revealing time slices. Experiments on four real-world
datasets show that ATM-GAD consistently outperforms seven strong
anomaly-detection baselines, uncovering fraud patterns missed by earlier
methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep learning-based physical layer authentication using CSI for mobile IoT scenarios, achieving improved performance over existing methods through CNN-based Siamese network and synthetic dataset generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The broadcast nature of wireless transmissions makes IoT devices vulnerable to authentication attacks. Physical layer authentication using channel characteristics shows promise, but existing schemes struggle with dynamic channel variations in mobile scenarios.

Method: Proposed a CNN-based Siamese network to learn temporal and spatial correlations between CSI pairs. Used synthetic training dataset generation based on WLAN TGn channel model and channel correlation metrics to reduce manual data collection overhead. Conducted both simulation and experimental evaluation using IEEE 802.11n and WiFi IoT development kits.

Result: The approach demonstrated excellent generalization and authentication performance. Improved AUC by 0.03 compared to FCN-based Siamese model and by 0.06 compared to correlation-based benchmark algorithm in practical measurements.

Conclusion: The deep learning-based physical layer authentication scheme effectively addresses mobile scenario challenges, showing superior performance over existing methods while reducing dataset collection overhead through synthetic data generation.

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is ubiquitous thanks to the rapid development of
wireless technologies. However, the broadcast nature of wireless transmissions
results in great vulnerability to device authentication. Physical layer
authentication emerges as a promising approach by exploiting the unique channel
characteristics. However, a practical scheme applicable to dynamic channel
variations is still missing. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning-based
physical layer channel state information (CSI) authentication for mobile
scenarios and carried out comprehensive simulation and experimental evaluation
using IEEE 802.11n. Specifically, a synthetic training dataset was generated
based on the WLAN TGn channel model and the autocorrelation and the distance
correlation of the channel, which can significantly reduce the overhead of
manually collecting experimental datasets. A convolutional neural network
(CNN)-based Siamese network was exploited to learn the temporal and spatial
correlation between the CSI pair and output a score to measure their
similarity. We adopted a synergistic methodology involving both simulation and
experimental evaluation. The experimental testbed consisted of WiFi IoT
development kits and a few typical scenarios were specifically considered. Both
simulation and experimental evaluation demonstrated excellent generalization
performance of our proposed deep learning-based approach and excellent
authentication performance. Demonstrated by our practical measurement results,
our proposed scheme improved the area under the curve (AUC) by 0.03 compared to
the fully connected network-based (FCN-based) Siamese model and by 0.06
compared to the correlation-based benchmark algorithm.

*Ali Ramlaoui,Martin Siron,Inel Djafar,Joseph Musielewicz,Amandine Rossello,Victor Schmidt,Alexandre Duval*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LeMat-Traj is a standardized dataset of 120M+ atomic configurations from major DFT repositories, with harmonized formats and quality filtering across multiple functionals, enabling better MLIP training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) development is hindered by fragmented, inconsistently formatted quantum mechanical datasets from DFT calculations, which are expensive to generate but difficult to combine due to format variations and accessibility issues.

Method: Created LeMat-Traj by aggregating and curating data from Materials Project, Alexandria, and OQMD repositories, standardizing data representation, harmonizing results, and filtering for high-quality configurations across PBE, PBESol, SCAN, and r2SCAN DFT functionals.

Result: Significantly lowers barrier for training transferrable and accurate MLIPs. Fine-tuning models pre-trained on high-force data with LeMat-Traj achieves significant reduction in force prediction errors on relaxation tasks. Includes both relaxed low-energy states and high-energy structures.

Conclusion: LeMat-Traj provides a standardized, high-quality dataset that enables better MLIP development. The accompanying LeMaterial-Fetcher library offers a reproducible framework for community to incorporate new data sources and ensure continued evolution of large-scale materials datasets.

Abstract: The development of accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs)
is limited by the fragmented availability and inconsistent formatting of
quantum mechanical trajectory datasets derived from Density Functional Theory
(DFT). These datasets are expensive to generate yet difficult to combine due to
variations in format, metadata, and accessibility. To address this, we
introduce LeMat-Traj, a curated dataset comprising over 120 million atomic
configurations aggregated from large-scale repositories, including the
Materials Project, Alexandria, and OQMD. LeMat-Traj standardizes data
representation, harmonizes results and filters for high-quality configurations
across widely used DFT functionals (PBE, PBESol, SCAN, r2SCAN). It
significantly lowers the barrier for training transferrable and accurate MLIPs.
LeMat-Traj spans both relaxed low-energy states and high-energy, high-force
structures, complementing molecular dynamics and active learning datasets. By
fine-tuning models pre-trained on high-force data with LeMat-Traj, we achieve a
significant reduction in force prediction errors on relaxation tasks. We also
present LeMaterial-Fetcher, a modular and extensible open-source library
developed for this work, designed to provide a reproducible framework for the
community to easily incorporate new data sources and ensure the continued
evolution of large-scale materials datasets. LeMat-Traj and LeMaterial-Fetcher

### [227] [Turning Tabular Foundation Models into Graph Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20906)
*Dmitry Eremeev,Gleb Bazhenov,Oleg Platonov,Artem Babenko,Liudmila Prokhorenkova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: G2T-FM is a graph foundation model that uses TabPFNv2 as backbone, achieving strong performance on graph tasks by augmenting node features with neighborhood aggregation and structural embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models have transformed NLP and CV but remain underexplored in graph ML. Current GFMs mainly handle text-attributed graphs, leaving arbitrary feature types unaddressed - a problem also present in tabular data ML.

Method: Proposes G2T-FM which augments original node features with neighborhood feature aggregation, adds structural embeddings, and applies TabPFNv2 to the constructed node representations.

Result: In fully in-context regime, significantly outperforms public GFMs and performs on par with well-tuned GNNs. After finetuning, surpasses well-tuned GNN baselines.

Conclusion: Demonstrates successful utilization of tabular foundation models for graph ML tasks, revealing a previously overlooked direction that shows strong potential.

Abstract: While foundation models have revolutionized such fields as natural language
processing and computer vision, their application and potential within graph
machine learning remain largely unexplored. One of the key challenges in
designing graph foundation models (GFMs) is handling diverse node features that
can vary across different graph datasets. Although many works on GFMs have been
focused exclusively on text-attributed graphs, the problem of handling
arbitrary features of other types in GFMs has not been fully addressed.
However, this problem is not unique to the graph domain, as it also arises in
the field of machine learning for tabular data. In this work, motivated by the
recent success of tabular foundation models like TabPFNv2, we propose G2T-FM, a
simple graph foundation model that employs TabPFNv2 as a backbone.
Specifically, G2T-FM augments the original node features with neighborhood
feature aggregation, adds structural embeddings, and then applies TabPFNv2 to
the constructed node representations. Even in a fully in-context regime, our
model achieves strong results, significantly outperforming publicly available
GFMs and performing on par with well-tuned GNNs trained from scratch. Moreover,
after finetuning, G2T-FM surpasses well-tuned GNN baselines, highlighting the
potential of the proposed approach. More broadly, our paper reveals a
previously overlooked direction of utilizing tabular foundation models for
graph machine learning tasks.

### [228] [Finite-Time Guarantees for Multi-Agent Combinatorial Bandits with Nonstationary Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20923)
*Katherine B. Adams,Justin J. Boutilier,Qinyang He,Yonatan Mintz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First framework for sequential resource allocation with nonstationary rewards in combinatorial multi-armed bandits, addressing habituation and recovery effects in dynamic intervention settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address real-world problems like community health interventions and targeted advertising where intervention effects evolve dynamically over time due to habituation (diminished response) or recovery (enhanced response), requiring balancing immediate outcomes with learning for future decisions.

Method: Developed algorithms with theoretical guarantees on dynamic regret for combinatorial multi-armed bandits with nonstationary reward distributions, incorporating evolving intervention effects and exploration-exploitation tradeoffs.

Result: Achieved up to three times improvement in program enrollment compared to baseline approaches in a diabetes intervention case study, demonstrating practical efficacy.

Conclusion: Successfully bridges theoretical adaptive learning advances with practical population-level behavioral change interventions, validating framework's real-world application potential.

Abstract: We study a sequential resource allocation problem where a decision maker
selects subsets of agents at each period to maximize overall outcomes without
prior knowledge of individual-level effects. Our framework applies to settings
such as community health interventions, targeted digital advertising, and
workforce retention programs, where intervention effects evolve dynamically.
Agents may exhibit habituation (diminished response from frequent selection) or
recovery (enhanced response from infrequent selection). The technical challenge
centers on nonstationary reward distributions that lead to changing
intervention effects over time. The problem requires balancing two key
competing objectives: heterogeneous individual rewards and the
exploration-exploitation tradeoff in terms of learning for improved future
decisions as opposed to maximizing immediate outcomes. Our contribution
introduces the first framework incorporating this form of nonstationary rewards
in the combinatorial multi-armed bandit literature. We develop algorithms with
theoretical guarantees on dynamic regret and demonstrate practical efficacy
through a diabetes intervention case study. Our personalized community
intervention algorithm achieved up to three times as much improvement in
program enrollment compared to baseline approaches, validating the framework's
potential for real-world applications. This work bridges theoretical advances
in adaptive learning with practical challenges in population-level behavioral
change interventions.

### [229] [Train-Once Plan-Anywhere Kinodynamic Motion Planning via Diffusion Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21001)
*Yaniv Hassidof,Tom Jurgenson,Kiril Solovey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiTree combines diffusion policies with sampling-based planners to achieve provably-safe kinodynamic motion planning that generalizes well to out-of-distribution scenarios while maintaining fast runtimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sampling-based planners are slow due to uninformed action sampling, while learning-based approaches lack safety guarantees and fail to generalize to out-of-distribution scenarios, limiting their real-world deployment.

Method: DiTree leverages diffusion policies as informed samplers to guide state-space search within sampling-based planners (like RRT), combining DP's ability to model expert trajectories with SBP's completeness guarantees.

Result: DiTree achieves 3x faster runtimes than classical SBPs and roughly 30% higher success rate than all other approaches, while maintaining provable safety and generalizing well to out-of-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: DiTree successfully bridges the gap between learning-based efficiency and sampling-based safety guarantees, enabling provably-safe motion planning that generalizes well and runs efficiently.

Abstract: Kinodynamic motion planning is concerned with computing collision-free
trajectories while abiding by the robot's dynamic constraints. This critical
problem is often tackled using sampling-based planners (SBPs) that explore the
robot's high-dimensional state space by constructing a search tree via action
propagations. Although SBPs can offer global guarantees on completeness and
solution quality, their performance is often hindered by slow exploration due
to uninformed action sampling. Learning-based approaches can yield
significantly faster runtimes, yet they fail to generalize to
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and lack critical guarantees, e.g., safety,
thus limiting their deployment on physical robots. We present Diffusion Tree
(DiTree): a \emph{provably-generalizable} framework leveraging diffusion
policies (DPs) as informed samplers to efficiently guide state-space search
within SBPs. DiTree combines DP's ability to model complex distributions of
expert trajectories, conditioned on local observations, with the completeness
of SBPs to yield \emph{provably-safe} solutions within a few action propagation
iterations for complex dynamical systems. We demonstrate DiTree's power with an
implementation combining the popular RRT planner with a DP action sampler
trained on a \emph{single environment}. In comprehensive evaluations on OOD
scenarios, % DiTree has comparable runtimes to a standalone DP (3x faster than
classical SBPs), while improving the average success rate over DP and SBPs.
DiTree is on average 3x faster than classical SBPs, and outperforms all other
approaches by achieving roughly 30\% higher success rate. Project webpage:

### [230] [InSQuAD: In-Context Learning for Efficient Retrieval via Submodular Mutual Information to Enforce Quality and Diversity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21003)
*Souradeep Nanda,Anay Majee,Rishabh Iyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InSQuAD improves In-Context Learning by using Submodular Mutual Information to select high-quality and diverse examples through a unified selection strategy and combinatorial training paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing retrieval models for ICL often focus only on query relevance while overlooking diversity, which is critical for effective in-context learning performance.

Method: 1) Models ICL as targeted selection problem using SMI for quality+diversity exemplar selection 2) Introduces combinatorial training with novel likelihood-based loss to learn SMI parameters 3) Augments QA dataset with synthetic paraphrases for better training

Result: Significant improvements on nine benchmark datasets when using the trained retrieval model with the targeted selection formulation for ICL.

Conclusion: InSQuAD effectively enhances ICL performance by enforcing both quality and diversity through submodular mutual information, addressing key limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce InSQuAD, designed to enhance the performance of
In-Context Learning (ICL) models through Submodular Mutual Information} (SMI)
enforcing Quality and Diversity among in-context exemplars. InSQuAD achieves
this through two principal strategies: First, we model the ICL task as a
targeted selection problem and introduce a unified selection strategy based on
SMIs which mines relevant yet diverse in-context examples encapsulating the
notions of quality and diversity. Secondly, we address a common pitfall in
existing retrieval models which model query relevance, often overlooking
diversity, critical for ICL. InSQuAD introduces a combinatorial training
paradigm which learns the parameters of an SMI function to enforce both quality
and diversity in the retrieval model through a novel likelihood-based loss. To
further aid the learning process we augment an existing multi-hop question
answering dataset with synthetically generated paraphrases. Adopting the
retrieval model trained using this strategy alongside the novel targeted
selection formulation for ICL on nine benchmark datasets shows significant
improvements validating the efficacy of our approach.

### [231] [Inference-Time Alignment Control for Diffusion Models with Reinforcement Learning Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21016)
*Luozhijie Jin,Zijie Qiu,Jie Liu,Zijie Diao,Lifeng Qiao,Ning Ding,Alex Lamb,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLG is an inference-time method that combines base and RL fine-tuned diffusion models via geometric averaging, enabling dynamic control over alignment-quality trade-off without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL fine-tuning methods for diffusion models are suboptimal and lack flexibility in controlling alignment strength after training, making it challenging to align generative outputs with complex downstream objectives.

Method: Reinterprets RL fine-tuning through SDEs and implicit reward conditioning, adapting Classifier-Free Guidance by geometrically averaging outputs from base and RL fine-tuned models.

Result: RLG consistently improves performance across various architectures, RL algorithms, and tasks including human preferences, compositional control, compressibility, and text rendering, supporting both interpolation and extrapolation.

Conclusion: Provides a practical and theoretically sound solution for enhancing and controlling diffusion model alignment at inference with unprecedented flexibility.

Abstract: Denoising-based generative models, particularly diffusion and flow matching
algorithms, have achieved remarkable success. However, aligning their output
distributions with complex downstream objectives, such as human preferences,
compositional accuracy, or data compressibility, remains challenging. While
reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methods, inspired by advances in RL
from human feedback (RLHF) for large language models, have been adapted to
these generative frameworks, current RL approaches are suboptimal for diffusion
models and offer limited flexibility in controlling alignment strength after
fine-tuning. In this work, we reinterpret RL fine-tuning for diffusion models
through the lens of stochastic differential equations and implicit reward
conditioning. We introduce Reinforcement Learning Guidance (RLG), an
inference-time method that adapts Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) by combining
the outputs of the base and RL fine-tuned models via a geometric average. Our
theoretical analysis shows that RLG's guidance scale is mathematically
equivalent to adjusting the KL-regularization coefficient in standard RL
objectives, enabling dynamic control over the alignment-quality trade-off
without further training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RLG
consistently improves the performance of RL fine-tuned models across various
architectures, RL algorithms, and downstream tasks, including human
preferences, compositional control, compressibility, and text rendering.
Furthermore, RLG supports both interpolation and extrapolation, thereby
offering unprecedented flexibility in controlling generative alignment. Our
approach provides a practical and theoretically sound solution for enhancing
and controlling diffusion model alignment at inference. The source code for RLG
is publicly available at the Github:

### [232] [Fast Convergence Rates for Subsampled Natural Gradient Algorithms on Quadratic Model Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21022)
*Gil Goldshlager,Jiang Hu,Lin Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Theoretical analysis shows subsampled natural gradient descent (SNGD) and its accelerated variant SPRING are equivalent to regularized Kaczmarz methods, providing first convergence guarantees and explaining their effectiveness in scientific machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNGD has shown impressive empirical results in scientific machine learning applications but lacked theoretical justification. The paper aims to provide mathematical foundations for understanding why these methods work.

Method: The authors analyze SNGD and SPRING for idealized parametric optimization problems with linear models and strongly convex quadratic loss functions. They prove equivalence to regularized Kaczmarz methods and leverage existing analyses from randomized linear algebra.

Result: First convergence rate for SNGD, first convergence guarantee for SPRING, and first proof that SPRING can accelerate SNGD. Also provides explanation for SNGD effectiveness beyond least-squares settings.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates how randomized linear algebra tools can illuminate the relationship between subsampling and curvature-aware optimization, providing theoretical grounding for previously empirical success of SNGD methods.

Abstract: Subsampled natural gradient descent (SNGD) has shown impressive results for
parametric optimization tasks in scientific machine learning, such as neural
network wavefunctions and physics-informed neural networks, but it has lacked a
theoretical explanation. We address this gap by analyzing the convergence of
SNGD and its accelerated variant, SPRING, for idealized parametric optimization
problems where the model is linear and the loss function is strongly convex and
quadratic. In the special case of a least-squares loss, namely the standard
linear least-squares problem, we prove that SNGD is equivalent to a regularized
Kaczmarz method while SPRING is equivalent to an accelerated regularized
Kaczmarz method. As a result, by leveraging existing analyses we obtain under
mild conditions (i) the first fast convergence rate for SNGD, (ii) the first
convergence guarantee for SPRING in any setting, and (iii) the first proof that
SPRING can accelerate SNGD. In the case of a general strongly convex quadratic
loss, we extend the analysis of the regularized Kaczmarz method to obtain a
fast convergence rate for SNGD under stronger conditions, providing the first
explanation for the effectiveness of SNGD outside of the least-squares setting.
Overall, our results illustrate how tools from randomized linear algebra can
shed new light on the interplay between subsampling and curvature-aware
optimization strategies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoTUS is a novel Machine Unlearning method that removes training sample influence from pre-trained models without retraining, using probability smoothing and achieving state-of-the-art performance on large datasets like ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate the need for retraining from scratch when removing specific training samples' influence from models, which is particularly important for large-scale datasets where retraining is impractical.

Method: LoTUS smooths the prediction probabilities of pre-trained models up to an information-theoretic bound to mitigate over-confidence from data memorization, without requiring retraining.

Result: Outperforms eight baseline methods on Transformer and ResNet18 models across five datasets, including successful unlearning on ImageNet1k where retraining is impractical.

Conclusion: LoTUS provides an efficient and effective solution for machine unlearning that works on large-scale datasets and introduces a novel evaluation metric (RF-JSD) for real-world conditions.

Abstract: We present LoTUS, a novel Machine Unlearning (MU) method that eliminates the
influence of training samples from pre-trained models, avoiding retraining from
scratch. LoTUS smooths the prediction probabilities of the model up to an
information-theoretic bound, mitigating its over-confidence stemming from data
memorization. We evaluate LoTUS on Transformer and ResNet18 models against
eight baselines across five public datasets. Beyond established MU benchmarks,
we evaluate unlearning on ImageNet1k, a large-scale dataset, where retraining
is impractical, simulating real-world conditions. Moreover, we introduce the
novel Retrain-Free Jensen-Shannon Divergence (RF-JSD) metric to enable
evaluation under real-world conditions. The experimental results show that
LoTUS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both efficiency and
effectiveness. Code: https://github.com/cspartalis/LoTUS.

Motivation: Molecular ML has shown great potential for accurate property predictions and molecular discovery, but its integration at the chemical process scale remains largely unexplored despite promising applications.

Method: Review of state-of-the-art molecular ML models including graph neural networks and transformers, with discussion on incorporating physicochemical knowledge through hybrid or physics-informed approaches.

Result: Identifies the potential of molecular ML for accelerating novel molecule and process discovery, but notes the need for practical validation and industry collaboration.

Conclusion: Molecular ML holds significant promise for chemical process engineering, but requires development of benchmarks, integration with process design formulations, and practical validation through industry partnerships to realize its full potential.

Abstract: We present a perspective on molecular machine learning (ML) in the field of
chemical process engineering. Recently, molecular ML has demonstrated great
potential in (i) providing highly accurate predictions for properties of pure

molecular structures. We review current state-of-the-art molecular ML models
and discuss research directions that promise further advancements. This
includes ML methods, such as graph neural networks and transformers, which can
be further advanced through the incorporation of physicochemical knowledge in a
hybrid or physics-informed fashion. Then, we consider leveraging molecular ML
at the chemical process scale, which is highly desirable yet rather unexplored.
We discuss how molecular ML can be integrated into process design and
optimization formulations, promising to accelerate the identification of novel
molecules and processes. To this end, it will be essential to create molecule

possibly in collaboration with the chemical industry.

*Kang-Hyun Lee,Faez Ahmed*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: MicroLad is a latent diffusion framework that generates 3D microstructures from 2D data using multi-plane denoising diffusion and score distillation sampling for inverse-controlled design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address scarcity of diverse 3D microstructure datasets and limited control over analysis/design space, which hinders solving inverse property-to-structure design problems.

Method: Uses latent diffusion framework trained on 2D images with multi-plane denoising diffusion sampling. Integrates score distillation sampling (SDS) with differentiable score loss, descriptor-matching, and property-alignment terms for inverse-controlled generation.

Result: Reliably generates stable, coherent 3D volumes statistically consistent with original data. Enables dimensionality expansion (2D-to-3D) and facilitates exploration of expanded 3D microstructure design space.

Conclusion: MicroLad provides an effective framework for generating diverse 3D microstructures from 2D data and enables inverse-controlled design through descriptor and property alignment.

Abstract: A major obstacle to establishing reliable structure-property (SP) linkages in
materials engineering is the scarcity of diverse 3D microstructure datasets.
Limited dataset availability and insufficient control over the analysis and
design space restrict the variety of achievable microstructure morphologies,
hindering progress in solving the inverse (property-to-structure) design
problem. To address these challenges, we introduce MicroLad, a latent diffusion
framework specifically designed for reconstructing 3D microstructures from 2D
data. Trained on 2D images and employing multi-plane denoising diffusion
sampling in the latent space, the framework reliably generates stable and
coherent 3D volumes that remain statistically consistent with the original
data. While this reconstruction capability enables dimensionality expansion
(2D-to-3D) for generating statistically equivalent 3D samples from 2D data,
effective exploration of microstructure design requires methods to guide the
generation process toward specific objectives. To achieve this, MicroLad
integrates score distillation sampling (SDS), which combines a differentiable
score loss with microstructural descriptor-matching and property-alignment
terms. This approach updates encoded 2D slices of the 3D volume in the latent
space, enabling robust inverse-controlled 2D-to-3D microstructure generation.
Consequently, the method facilitates exploration of an expanded 3D
microstructure analysis and design space in terms of both microstructural
descriptors and material properties.

TL;DR: ELIXIR is a lightweight multi-task model that combines rating prediction with personalized review generation using aspect modeling, outperforming larger baseline models on TripAdvisor and RateBeer datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collaborative filtering struggles with fine-grained interactions and explainability. Users increasingly demand transparent recommendations, but existing methods using RNNs or Transformers have limitations - RNNs can't leverage pre-trained Transformers, while Transformers often have suboptimal adaptation and neglect aspect modeling for personalized explanations.

Method: Propose ELIXIR, a multi-task model based on T5-small (60M parameters) that jointly learns global and aspect-specific representations. It optimizes overall rating, aspect-level ratings, and review generation with personalized attention to emphasize aspect importance.

Result: Experimental results on TripAdvisor and RateBeer show ELIXIR significantly outperforms strong baseline models, especially in review generation. It demonstrates effective aspect-based architecture for personalized text generation despite using a much smaller model than state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: ELIXIR provides an efficient and lightweight solution for generating personalized textual explanations in recommender systems, successfully addressing the limitations of existing methods through aspect modeling and multi-task learning.

Abstract: Collaborative filtering drives many successful recommender systems but
struggles with fine-grained user-item interactions and explainability. As users
increasingly seek transparent recommendations, generating textual explanations
through language models has become a critical research area. Existing methods
employ either RNNs or Transformers. However, RNN-based approaches fail to
leverage the capabilities of pre-trained Transformer models, whereas
Transformer-based methods often suffer from suboptimal adaptation and neglect
aspect modeling, which is crucial for personalized explanations. We propose
ELIXIR (Efficient and LIghtweight model for eXplaIning Recommendations), a
multi-task model combining rating prediction with personalized review
generation. ELIXIR jointly learns global and aspect-specific representations of
users and items, optimizing overall rating, aspect-level ratings, and review
generation, with personalized attention to emphasize aspect importance. Based
on a T5-small (60M) model, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our aspect-based
architecture in guiding text generation in a personalized context, where
state-of-the-art approaches exploit much larger models but fail to match user
preferences as well. Experimental results on TripAdvisor and RateBeer
demonstrate that ELIXIR significantly outperforms strong baseline models,
especially in review generation.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: MPFormer is a dynamic multi-task Transformer framework that addresses multi-stage optimization misalignment in industrial recommendation systems by jointly encoding user behavior and multi-task semantics, enabling scalable multi-objective retrieval without linear resource growth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the semantic gap between multi-objective ranking and single-objective retrieval in industrial recommendation systems, overcoming limitations of parallel multi-path approaches that cause linear resource growth with objectives.

Method: Three innovative mechanisms: 1) objective-conditioned transformer with learnable attention modulation, 2) personalized target weights for dynamic retrieval adjustment, 3) user personalization integrated into token representations and Transformer structure.

Result: Successfully deployed in Kuaishou's recommendation system serving 400M+ daily users, significantly improving user engagement and system efficiency while maintaining service response speed.

Conclusion: MPFormer provides a scalable multi-objective solution that optimizes the iterative paradigm for industrial recommendation systems, effectively handling loosely coupled objectives without linear resource scaling.

Abstract: Modern industrial recommendation systems encounter a core challenge of
multi-stage optimization misalignment: a significant semantic gap exists
between the multi-objective optimization paradigm widely used in the ranking
phase and the single-objective modeling in the retrieve phase. Although the
mainstream industry solution achieves multi-objective coverage through parallel
multi-path single-objective retrieval, this approach leads to linear growth of
training and serving resources with the number of objectives and has inherent
limitations in handling loosely coupled objectives. This paper proposes the
MPFormer, a dynamic multi-task Transformer framework, which systematically
addresses the aforementioned issues through three innovative mechanisms. First,
an objective-conditioned transformer that jointly encodes user behavior
sequences and multi-task semantics through learnable attention modulation;
second, personalized target weights are introduced to achieve dynamic
adjustment of retrieval results; finally, user personalization information is
incorporated into token representations and the Transformer structure to
further enhance the model's representation ability. This framework has been
successfully integrated into Kuaishou short video recommendation system, stably
serving over 400 million daily active users. It significantly improves user
daily engagement and system operational efficiency. Practical deployment
verification shows that, compared with traditional solutions, it effectively
optimizes the iterative paradigm of multi-objective retrieval while maintaining
service response speed, providing a scalable multi-objective solution for
industrial recommendation systems.

Motivation: Traditional multi-behavior sequential recommendation treats high-frequency information as noise, but this paper argues it actually represents user interest diversity and should be leveraged rather than discarded.

Method: Proposed PDB4Rec model that extracts information across various frequency bands and their relationships, with a Bootstrapping Balancer mechanism to balance contributions from different frequency components.

Result: Experimental results show that low frequency corresponds to purity of user interests while high frequency corresponds to diversity, and the model demonstrates effectiveness and efficiency on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: High-frequency information is valuable for capturing user interest diversity and should be properly balanced with low-frequency purity information for optimal recommendation performance.

Abstract: In recommendation systems, users often exhibit multiple behaviors, such as
browsing, clicking, and purchasing. Multi-behavior sequential recommendation
(MBSR) aims to consider these different behaviors in an integrated manner to
improve the recommendation performance of the target behavior. However, some
behavior data will also bring inevitable noise to the modeling of user
interests. Some research efforts focus on data denoising from the frequency
domain perspective to improve the accuracy of user preference prediction. These
studies indicate that low-frequency information tends to be valuable and
reliable, while high-frequency information is often associated with noise. In
this paper, we argue that high-frequency information is by no means
insignificant. Further experimental results highlight that low frequency
corresponds to the purity of user interests, while high frequency corresponds
to the diversity of user interests. Building upon this finding, we proposed our
model PDB4Rec, which efficiently extracts information across various frequency
bands and their relationships, and introduces Boostrapping Balancer mechanism
to balance their contributions for improved recommendation performance.
Sufficient experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our model.

### [239] [On the Theoretical Limitations of Embedding-Based Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21038)
*Orion Weller,Michael Boratko,Iftekhar Naim,Jinhyuk Lee*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that vector embeddings face fundamental theoretical limitations in realistic settings, even with simple queries, and shows state-of-the-art models fail on a new stress test dataset called LIMIT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the common assumption that embedding limitations are due to unrealistic queries and can be overcome with better training/larger models, by showing theoretical limitations occur in realistic settings with simple queries.

Method: Connects learning theory results showing embedding dimension limits top-k subset returns, empirically tests with k=2 and free parameterized embeddings, and creates the LIMIT dataset to stress test models.

Result: Even state-of-the-art embedding models fail on the LIMIT dataset despite the simple nature of the tasks, confirming theoretical limitations manifest in practical scenarios.

Conclusion: The work reveals fundamental limits of current single-vector embedding paradigm and calls for new research to develop methods that overcome these limitations.

Abstract: Vector embeddings have been tasked with an ever-increasing set of retrieval
tasks over the years, with a nascent rise in using them for reasoning,
instruction-following, coding, and more. These new benchmarks push embeddings
to work for any query and any notion of relevance that could be given. While
prior works have pointed out theoretical limitations of vector embeddings,
there is a common assumption that these difficulties are exclusively due to
unrealistic queries, and those that are not can be overcome with better
training data and larger models. In this work, we demonstrate that we may
encounter these theoretical limitations in realistic settings with extremely
simple queries. We connect known results in learning theory, showing that the
number of top-k subsets of documents capable of being returned as the result of
some query is limited by the dimension of the embedding. We empirically show
that this holds true even if we restrict to k=2, and directly optimize on the
test set with free parameterized embeddings. We then create a realistic dataset
called LIMIT that stress tests models based on these theoretical results, and
observe that even state-of-the-art models fail on this dataset despite the
simple nature of the task. Our work shows the limits of embedding models under
the existing single vector paradigm and calls for future research to develop
methods that can resolve this fundamental limitation.

*Alexandre Andre,Gauthier Roy,Eva Dyer,Kai Wang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: A benchmark for evaluating fairness in zero-context LLM recommendations reveals consistent biases across domains, with non-linear relationship between model size and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used for recommendation tasks, but their behavior in cold-start scenarios with limited signals raises fairness concerns due to potential reliance on societal biases from pretraining.

Method: Introduces a modular benchmark pipeline with configurable recommendation domains and sensitive attributes to systematically audit open-source LLMs in zero-context recommendation scenarios.

Result: Evaluations of Gemma 3 and Llama 3.2 show consistent biases across music, movies, and college recommendations, including gendered and cultural stereotypes, with non-linear relationship between model size and fairness.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the need for nuanced analysis of LLM fairness in recommendation tasks, particularly in cold-start scenarios where limited context may amplify encoded societal biases.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for recommendation tasks
due to their general-purpose capabilities. While LLMs perform well in
rich-context settings, their behavior in cold-start scenarios, where only
limited signals such as age, gender, or language are available, raises fairness
concerns because they may rely on societal biases encoded during pretraining.
We introduce a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate fairness in
zero-context recommendation. Our modular pipeline supports configurable
recommendation domains and sensitive attributes, enabling systematic and
flexible audits of any open-source LLM. Through evaluations of state-of-the-art
models (Gemma 3 and Llama 3.2), we uncover consistent biases across
recommendation domains (music, movies, and colleges) including gendered and
cultural stereotypes. We also reveal a non-linear relationship between model
size and fairness, highlighting the need for nuanced analysis.

### [241] [SemSR: Semantics aware robust Session-based Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20587)
*Jyoti Narwariya,Priyanka Gupta,Muskan Gupta,Jyotsana Khatri,Lovekesh Vig*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper explores multiple approaches to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) with session-based recommendation systems, showing that hybrid methods combining LLMs with traditional data-driven models outperform standalone approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional session-based recommendation models fail to leverage semantic information from item titles/descriptions, and existing LLM approaches have limitations - prompt-based methods struggle with optimal prompting while fine-tuning methods are computationally expensive.

Method: Three approaches: (1) in-context LLMs as recommendation agents, (2) LLM-generated representations for semantic initialization of deep learning models, and (3) integration of LLMs with data-driven SR models.

Result: LLM-based methods excel at coarse-level retrieval (high recall), while traditional techniques perform well at fine-grained ranking. Integration of LLMs with data-driven models significantly outperforms both standalone approaches and baseline models in both Recall and MRR metrics.

Conclusion: Hybrid approaches combining LLMs with traditional data-driven session-based recommendation models provide the best performance, leveraging the strengths of both semantic understanding from LLMs and pattern recognition from data-driven methods.

Abstract: Session-based recommendation (SR) models aim to recommend items to anonymous
users based on their behavior during the current session. While various SR
models in the literature utilize item sequences to predict the next item, they
often fail to leverage semantic information from item titles or descriptions
impeding session intent identification and interpretability. Recent research
has explored Large Language Models (LLMs) as promising approaches to enhance
session-based recommendations, with both prompt-based and fine-tuning based
methods being widely investigated. However, prompt-based methods struggle to
identify optimal prompts that elicit correct reasoning and lack task-specific
feedback at test time, resulting in sub-optimal recommendations. Fine-tuning
methods incorporate domain-specific knowledge but incur significant
computational costs for implementation and maintenance. In this paper, we
present multiple approaches to utilize LLMs for session-based recommendation:
(i) in-context LLMs as recommendation agents, (ii) LLM-generated
representations for semantic initialization of deep learning SR models, and
(iii) integration of LLMs with data-driven SR models. Through comprehensive
experiments on two real-world publicly available datasets, we demonstrate that
LLM-based methods excel at coarse-level retrieval (high recall values), while
traditional data-driven techniques perform well at fine-grained ranking (high
Mean Reciprocal Rank values). Furthermore, the integration of LLMs with
data-driven SR models significantly out performs both standalone LLM approaches
and data-driven deep learning models, as well as baseline SR models, in terms
of both Recall and MRR metrics.

*Xinhao Huang,Zhibo Ren,Yipeng Yu,Ying Zhou,Zulong Chen,Zeyi Wen*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: SEAL is a novel contrastive learning framework for long structured document retrieval that addresses limitations in leveraging structural information and lack of datasets with structural metadata.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to effectively use structural features and element-level semantics, and there's a lack of datasets containing structural metadata for long structured document retrieval.

Method: Proposes SEAL framework with structure-aware learning to preserve semantic hierarchies and masked element alignment for fine-grained semantic discrimination. Also releases a new dataset with rich structural annotations.

Result: Extensive experiments show consistent performance improvements, boosting NDCG@10 from 73.96% to 77.84% on BGE-M3. Online A/B testing also demonstrates effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed SEAL framework effectively addresses structural information utilization in document retrieval and the released dataset with structural annotations helps bridge the data gap in this domain.

Abstract: In long structured document retrieval, existing methods typically fine-tune
pre-trained language models (PLMs) using contrastive learning on datasets
lacking explicit structural information. This practice suffers from two
critical issues: 1) current methods fail to leverage structural features and
element-level semantics effectively, and 2) the lack of datasets containing
structural metadata. To bridge these gaps, we propose \our, a novel contrastive
learning framework. It leverages structure-aware learning to preserve semantic
hierarchies and masked element alignment for fine-grained semantic
discrimination. Furthermore, we release \dataset, a long structured document
retrieval dataset with rich structural annotations. Extensive experiments on
both released and industrial datasets across various modern PLMs, along with
online A/B testing, demonstrate consistent performance improvements, boosting
NDCG@10 from 73.96\% to 77.84\% on BGE-M3. The resources are available at

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Novel approach for scalable multi-domain recommendation systems using TAPE embeddings and DDSR to replace full inter-domain attention, reducing computational costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive recommendation models face computational bottlenecks in multi-domain scenarios due to attention maps attending to all items across every domain, requiring efficient inter and intra-domain knowledge transfer.

Method: Two key mechanisms: 1) Transition-Aware Positional Embeddings (TAPE) for domain-transition specific information, focusing attention on intra-domain items; 2) Dynamic Domain State Representation (DDSR) for storing and accessing domain states during predictions.

Result: Significant improvements in retrieval tasks by separately modeling and combining inter- and intra-domain representations while reducing unnecessary computational costs.

Conclusion: The method provides a scalable solution for large-scale multi-domain recommendation systems by efficiently balancing domain knowledge transfer without full attention maps.

Abstract: Recently, autoregressive recommendation models (ARMs), such as Meta's HSTU
model, have emerged as a major breakthrough over traditional Deep Learning
Recommendation Models (DLRMs), exhibiting the highly sought-after scaling law
behaviour. However, when applied to multi-domain scenarios, the transformer
architecture's attention maps become a computational bottleneck, as they attend
to all items across every domain. To tackle this challenge, systems must
efficiently balance inter and intra-domain knowledge transfer. In this work, we
introduce a novel approach for scalable multi-domain recommendation systems by
replacing full inter-domain attention with two innovative mechanisms: 1)
Transition-Aware Positional Embeddings (TAPE): We propose novel positional
embeddings that account for domain-transition specific information. This allows
attention to be focused solely on intra-domain items, effectively reducing the
unnecessary computational cost associated with attending to irrelevant domains.
2) Dynamic Domain State Representation (DDSR): We introduce a dynamic state
representation for each domain, which is stored and accessed during subsequent
token predictions. This enables the efficient transfer of relevant domain
information without relying on full attention maps. Our method offers a
scalable solution to the challenges posed by large-scale, multi-domain
recommendation systems and demonstrates significant improvements in retrieval
tasks by separately modelling and combining inter- and intra-domain
representations.

### [244] [Mitigating Distribution Shift in Stock Price Data via Return-Volatility Normalization for Accurate Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20108)
*Hyunwoo Lee,Jihyeong Jeon,Jaemin Hong,U Kang*

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: ReVol addresses stock price prediction distribution shifts through return-volatility normalization, attention-based characteristic estimation, and neural network integration, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing stock prediction methods fail to effectively handle distribution shifts between training and test data, particularly distributional discrepancies and shape misalignments that reduce prediction accuracy.

Method: ReVol uses three strategies: 1) normalizing price features to remove sample-specific characteristics, 2) attention-based module for accurate characteristic estimation, and 3) reintegrating characteristics into prediction. Combines geometric Brownian motion for long-term trends with neural networks for short-term patterns.

Result: Extensive experiments show ReVol enhances state-of-the-art backbone models, achieving average improvements of over 0.03 in IC and over 0.7 in SR across various settings.

Conclusion: ReVol effectively mitigates distribution shifts in stock price data through its normalization and reintegration approach, significantly improving prediction performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: How can we address distribution shifts in stock price data to improve stock
price prediction accuracy? Stock price prediction has attracted attention from
both academia and industry, driven by its potential to uncover complex market
patterns and enhance decisionmaking. However, existing methods often fail to
handle distribution shifts effectively, focusing on scaling or representation
adaptation without fully addressing distributional discrepancies and shape
misalignments between training and test data. We propose ReVol
(Return-Volatility Normalization for Mitigating Distribution Shift in Stock
Price Data), a robust method for stock price prediction that explicitly
addresses the distribution shift problem. ReVol leverages three key strategies
to mitigate these shifts: (1) normalizing price features to remove
sample-specific characteristics, including return, volatility, and price scale,
(2) employing an attention-based module to estimate these characteristics
accurately, thereby reducing the influence of market anomalies, and (3)
reintegrating the sample characteristics into the predictive process, restoring
the traits lost during normalization. Additionally, ReVol combines geometric
Brownian motion for long-term trend modeling with neural networks for
short-term pattern recognition, unifying their complementary strengths.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that ReVol enhances
the performance of the state-of-the-art backbone models in most cases,
achieving an average improvement of more than 0.03 in IC and over 0.7 in SR
across various settings.

*Lukasz Olejnik*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Small language models can now create coherent political messaging automatically, with persona design being more important than model choice. Engagement strengthens ideological adherence and increases extreme content, making automated influence operations accessible to all actors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that AI-powered influence operations can be executed end-to-end on commodity hardware, making automated political messaging production accessible to both large and small actors.

Method: Using small language models to produce persona-driven political messaging and evaluating them automatically without human raters, testing how models respond to counter-arguments and engagement.

Result: Persona design explains behavior more than model identity (persona-over-model), and engagement as a stressor strengthens ideological adherence while increasing extreme content prevalence.

Conclusion: Fully automated influence-content production is now accessible, requiring defense strategies to shift from restricting model access towards conversation-centric detection and disruption of campaigns, leveraging the consistency of these operations as a detection signature.

Abstract: AI-powered influence operations can now be executed end-to-end on commodity
hardware. We show that small language models produce coherent, persona-driven
political messaging and can be evaluated automatically without human raters.
Two behavioural findings emerge. First, persona-over-model: persona design
explains behaviour more than model identity. Second, engagement as a stressor:
when replies must counter-arguments, ideological adherence strengthens and the
prevalence of extreme content increases. We demonstrate that fully automated
influence-content production is within reach of both large and small actors.
Consequently, defence should shift from restricting model access towards
conversation-centric detection and disruption of campaigns and coordination
infrastructure. Paradoxically, the very consistency that enables these
operations also provides a detection signature.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Web and Research Agents (WRAs) are vulnerable to network inference attacks that can recover user prompts and traits from metadata alone, with 73% prompt recovery and 19/32 traits identified accurately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WRAs are increasingly used for privacy-sensitive research but exhibit unique network patterns that could expose user queries and personal information to passive adversaries like ISPs.

Method: Built dataset of WRA traces from real and synthetic queries, developed OBELS metric for prompt similarity assessment, and tested attacks under partial observability and noise conditions.

Result: Attack recovers 73% of functional and domain knowledge from prompts, identifies 19 out of 32 latent traits accurately, and remains effective despite network limitations.

Conclusion: WRAs pose significant privacy risks through metadata leakage, but mitigation strategies like domain constraint and trace obfuscation can reduce attack effectiveness by 29% with minimal utility impact.

Abstract: We show that Web and Research Agents (WRAs) -- language model-based systems
that investigate complex topics on the Internet -- are vulnerable to inference
attacks by passive network adversaries such as ISPs. These agents could be
deployed \emph{locally} by organizations and individuals for privacy, legal, or
financial purposes. Unlike sporadic web browsing by humans, WRAs visit
$70{-}140$ domains with distinguishable timing correlations, enabling unique
fingerprinting attacks.
  Specifically, we demonstrate a novel prompt and user trait leakage attack
against WRAs that only leverages their network-level metadata (i.e., visited IP
addresses and their timings). We start by building a new dataset of WRA traces
based on user search queries and queries generated by synthetic personas. We
define a behavioral metric (called OBELS) to comprehensively assess similarity
between original and inferred prompts, showing that our attack recovers over
73\% of the functional and domain knowledge of user prompts. Extending to a
multi-session setting, we recover up to 19 of 32 latent traits with high
accuracy. Our attack remains effective under partial observability and noisy
conditions. Finally, we discuss mitigation strategies that constrain domain
diversity or obfuscate traces, showing negligible utility impact while reducing
attack effectiveness by an average of 29\%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SynthID-Text watermarking is vulnerable to meaning-preserving attacks that degrade watermark detectability, necessitating a more robust solution for AI-generated text provenance tracking.

Method: Proposed SynGuard framework that jointly embeds watermarks at lexical and semantic levels by combining Semantic Information Retrieval (SIR) with SynthID-Text's probabilistic watermarking mechanism.

Result: Experimental results show SynGuard improves watermark recovery by average 11.1% in F1 score compared to SynthID-Text across multiple attack scenarios including paraphrasing, copy-paste modifications, and back-translation.

Conclusion: Semantic-aware watermarking through hybrid lexical-semantic embedding effectively resists real-world tampering while preserving original meaning, demonstrating the importance of multi-level watermarking for robust provenance tracking.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLM watermarking methods such as SynthID-Text by Google
DeepMind offer promising solutions for tracing the provenance of AI-generated
text. However, our robustness assessment reveals that SynthID-Text is
vulnerable to meaning-preserving attacks, such as paraphrasing, copy-paste
modifications, and back-translation, which can significantly degrade watermark
detectability. To address these limitations, we propose SynGuard, a hybrid
framework that combines the semantic alignment strength of Semantic Information
Retrieval (SIR) with the probabilistic watermarking mechanism of SynthID-Text.
Our approach jointly embeds watermarks at both lexical and semantic levels,
enabling robust provenance tracking while preserving the original meaning.
Experimental results across multiple attack scenarios show that SynGuard
improves watermark recovery by an average of 11.1\% in F1 score compared to
SynthID-Text. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of semantic-aware
watermarking in resisting real-world tampering. All code, datasets, and

raise awareness of the novel cyber threats that are introduced when
incorporating AI into a software system. We explore the operational
cybersecurity and supply chain risks across the AI lifecycle, emphasizing the
need for tailored security frameworks to address evolving threats in the

TL;DR: BridgeShield uses heterogeneous graph attention networks to detect cross-chain bridge attacks by modeling multi-chain behaviors, achieving 92.58% F1-score and 24.39% improvement over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-chain bridges are critical for blockchain interoperability but vulnerable to attacks due to design flaws. Existing detection methods are limited as they only address single-chain behaviors and fail to capture cross-chain semantics.

Method: Proposes BridgeShield framework using heterogeneous graph attention networks to model source chain, off-chain coordination, and destination chain in unified graph representation. Uses intra-meta-path attention for fine-grained dependencies and inter-meta-path attention for discriminative cross-chain patterns.

Result: Extensive experiments on 51 real-world cross-chain attack events show BridgeShield achieves average F1-score of 92.58%, representing 24.39% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: BridgeShield is an effective practical solution for securing cross-chain bridges and enhancing resilience of multi-chain ecosystems through its ability to capture complex cross-chain execution semantics.

Abstract: Cross-chain bridges play a vital role in enabling blockchain
interoperability. However, due to the inherent design flaws and the enormous
value they hold, they have become prime targets for hacker attacks. Existing
detection methods show progress yet remain limited, as they mainly address
single-chain behaviors and fail to capture cross-chain semantics. To address
this gap, we leverage heterogeneous graph attention networks, which are
well-suited for modeling multi-typed entities and relations, to capture the
complex execution semantics of cross-chain behaviors. We propose BridgeShield,
a detection framework that jointly models the source chain, off-chain
coordination, and destination chain within a unified heterogeneous graph
representation. BridgeShield incorporates intra-meta-path attention to learn
fine-grained dependencies within cross-chain paths and inter-meta-path
attention to highlight discriminative cross-chain patterns, thereby enabling
precise identification of attack behaviors. Extensive experiments on 51
real-world cross-chain attack events demonstrate that BridgeShield achieves an
average F1-score of 92.58%, representing a 24.39% improvement over
state-of-the-art baselines. These results validate the effectiveness of
BridgeShield as a practical solution for securing cross-chain bridges and
enhancing the resilience of multi-chain ecosystems.

TL;DR: Federated Learning enables privacy-preserving collaborative AI model development across fragmented medical datasets for both upstream reconstruction tasks and downstream clinical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional AI model development requires large centralized datasets, but medical data faces strict privacy regulations that prevent data sharing, hindering large-scale model development and continuous updates.

Method: Federated Learning framework that allows collaborative training across multiple institutions without sharing sensitive data, covering both upstream tasks (CT/MRI reconstruction) and downstream clinical tasks (tumor diagnosis/segmentation).

Result: FL enables robust reconstruction networks and continuous model updating while preserving patient confidentiality, with innovations in communication efficiency, heterogeneous data alignment, and secure parameter aggregation.

Conclusion: FL provides a viable solution to privacy constraints in medical AI development and offers promising research directions for future advancements in the field.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated considerable potential in the
realm of medical imaging. However, the development of high-performance AI
models typically necessitates training on large-scale, centralized datasets.
This approach is confronted with significant challenges due to strict patient
privacy regulations and legal restrictions on data sharing and utilization.
These limitations hinder the development of large-scale models in medical
domains and impede continuous updates and training with new data. Federated
Learning (FL), a privacy-preserving distributed training framework, offers a
new solution by enabling collaborative model development across fragmented
medical datasets. In this survey, we review FL's contributions at two stages of
the full-stack medical analysis pipeline. First, in upstream tasks such as CT
or MRI reconstruction, FL enables joint training of robust reconstruction
networks on diverse, multi-institutional datasets, alleviating data scarcity
while preserving confidentiality. Second, in downstream clinical tasks like
tumor diagnosis and segmentation, FL supports continuous model updating by
allowing local fine-tuning on new data without centralizing sensitive images.
We comprehensively analyze FL implementations across the medical imaging
pipeline, from physics-informed reconstruction networks to diagnostic AI
systems, highlighting innovations that improve communication efficiency, align
heterogeneous data, and ensure secure parameter aggregation. Meanwhile, this
paper provides an outlook on future research directions, aiming to serve as a
valuable reference for the field's development.

tool-grounded execution and end-to-end exploit validation. On the 104-challenge
XBOW benchmark, MAPTA achieves 76.9% overall success with perfect performance
on SSRF and misconfiguration vulnerabilities, 83% success on broken
authorization, and strong results on injection attacks including server-side
template injection (85%) and SQL injection (83%). Cross-site scripting (57%)
and blind SQL injection (0%) remain challenging. Our comprehensive cost
analysis across all challenges totals $21.38 with a median cost of $0.073 for
successful attempts versus $0.357 for failures. Success correlates strongly
with resource efficiency, enabling practical early-stopping thresholds at
approximately 40 tool calls or $0.30 per challenge.
  MAPTA's real-world findings are impactful given both the popularity of the
respective scanned GitHub repositories (8K-70K stars) and MAPTA's low average

Method: JADES automatically decomposes harmful questions into weighted sub-questions, scores each sub-answer, and aggregates sub-scores into a final decision. It includes an optional fact-checking module to detect hallucinations.

Result: Achieves 98.5% agreement with human evaluators in binary success/failure classification, outperforming baselines by over 9%. Re-evaluation of popular attacks shows substantial overestimation in previous methods (e.g., LAA's success rate drops from 93% to 69%).

Conclusion: JADES provides accurate, consistent, and interpretable evaluations, offering a reliable basis for measuring future jailbreak attacks and revealing that previous methods significantly overestimated attack success rates.

Abstract: Accurately determining whether a jailbreak attempt has succeeded is a
fundamental yet unresolved challenge. Existing evaluation methods rely on
misaligned proxy indicators or naive holistic judgments. They frequently
misinterpret model responses, leading to inconsistent and subjective
assessments that misalign with human perception. To address this gap, we
introduce JADES (Jailbreak Assessment via Decompositional Scoring), a universal
jailbreak evaluation framework. Its key mechanism is to automatically decompose
an input harmful question into a set of weighted sub-questions, score each
sub-answer, and weight-aggregate the sub-scores into a final decision. JADES
also incorporates an optional fact-checking module to strengthen the detection
of hallucinations in jailbreak responses. We validate JADES on JailbreakQR, a
newly introduced benchmark proposed in this work, consisting of 400 pairs of
jailbreak prompts and responses, each meticulously annotated by humans. In a
binary setting (success/failure), JADES achieves 98.5% agreement with human
evaluators, outperforming strong baselines by over 9%. Re-evaluating five
popular attacks on four LLMs reveals substantial overestimation (e.g., LAA's
attack success rate on GPT-3.5-Turbo drops from 93% to 69%). Our results show
that JADES could deliver accurate, consistent, and interpretable evaluations,
providing a reliable basis for measuring future jailbreak attacks.

### [253] [AI Agentic Vulnerability Injection And Transformation with Optimized Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20866)
*Amine Lbath,Massih-Reza Amini,Aurelien Delaitre,Vadim Okun*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Novel AI framework for generating realistic vulnerability datasets by automatically injecting category-specific vulnerabilities into secure C/C++ code using multi-agent coordination and RAG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of traditional vulnerability detection methods (scalability, high false rates) and AI approaches' dependency on quality training data by creating better datasets.

Method: Coordinates multiple AI agents simulating expert reasoning with function agents and code analysis tools, uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation for context, and Low-Rank approximation for efficient fine-tuning.

Result: Achieved 89-95% success rates in vulnerability injection at function level across 116 code samples from three benchmarks, outperforming other techniques.

Conclusion: The framework effectively generates high-quality vulnerability datasets, enabling better training of AI models for automated vulnerability detection and repair systems.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of software systems and the sophistication of
cyber-attacks have underscored the critical need for effective automated
vulnerability detection and repair systems. Traditional methods, such as static
program analysis, face significant challenges related to scalability,
adaptability, and high false-positive and false-negative rates. AI-driven
approaches, particularly those using machine learning and deep learning models,
show promise but are heavily reliant on the quality and quantity of training
data. This paper introduces a novel framework designed to automatically
introduce realistic, category-specific vulnerabilities into secure C/C++
codebases to generate datasets. The proposed approach coordinates multiple AI
agents that simulate expert reasoning, along with function agents and
traditional code analysis tools. It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation
for contextual grounding and employs Low-Rank approximation of weights for
efficient model fine-tuning. Our experimental study on 116 code samples from
three different benchmarks suggests that our approach outperforms other
techniques with regard to dataset accuracy, achieving between 89\% and 95\%
success rates in injecting vulnerabilities at function level.

### [254] [SwizzlePerf: Hardware-Aware LLMs for GPU Kernel Performance Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20258)
*Arya Tschand,Muhammad Awad,Ryan Swann,Kesavan Ramakrishnan,Jeffrey Ma,Keith Lowery,Ganesh Dasika,Vijay Janapa Reddi*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: SwizzlePerf uses hardware-aware LLMs to automatically generate optimal GPU kernel optimizations in minutes instead of weeks, achieving up to 2.06x speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM approaches for GPU kernel optimization lack hardware-awareness, which human engineers rely on for optimal performance. Current methods use inefficient search-based approaches without considering hardware specifics.

Method: SwizzlePerf automatically generates spatial optimizations for GPU kernels by providing LLMs with explicit hardware-awareness including memory access patterns, architecture specs, filtered profiling logs, and performance reflections.

Result: For GEMM kernel, SwizzlePerf generates optimal swizzling patterns in <5 min vs 2 weeks for experts. On 10 diverse ML/science kernels, it achieved optimizations for 9 kernels with up to 2.06x speedup and 70% L2 hit rate improvement.

Conclusion: This represents the first step toward systematically creating hardware-aware LLM performance engineering agents that can match human expert optimization capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown progress in GPU kernel performance
engineering using inefficient search-based methods that optimize around
runtime. Any existing approach lacks a key characteristic that human
performance engineers rely on for near-optimal utilization --
hardware-awareness. By leveraging the workload's specific memory access
patterns, architecture specifications, filtered profiling logs, and reflections
on historical performance, we can make software-level optimizations that are
tailored to the underlying hardware. SwizzlePerf automatically generates
spatial optimizations for GPU kernels on disaggregated architectures by giving
LLMs explicit hardware-awareness.
  For a GEMM kernel, SwizzlePerf takes less than 5 minutes to generate the same
hardware-specific optimal swizzling pattern that took expert performance
engineers 2 weeks to find. On a suite of 10 diverse ML and Science kernels,
SwizzlePerf can generate swizzling patterns for 9 of the kernels that achieve
up to a 2.06x speedup and 70% improvement in L2 hit rate. This work is the
first of many steps toward systematically creating hardware-aware LLM
performance engineering agents.

*Guanyu Xu,Zhiwei Hao,Li Shen,Yong Luo,Fuhui Sun,Xiaoyan Wang,Han Hu,Yonggang Wen*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: CoFormer enables efficient transformer inference on edge devices by decomposing large models into smaller distributed components, achieving 3.1x speedup and 76.3% memory reduction while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models have high computational demands that challenge real-time edge deployment. Existing solutions either cause communication overhead or poor accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

Method: Proposes CoFormer system that decomposes transformers into smaller distributed models, formulates optimization problem for latency/accuracy trade-off, and uses DeBo algorithm for decomposition policy and model calibration.

Result: Achieves 3.1x inference speedup, 76.3% memory reduction for GPT2-XL (1.6B params), 40% energy reduction while maintaining satisfactory performance on heterogeneous edge devices.

Conclusion: CoFormer provides an effective collaborative inference approach that enables large transformer deployment on resource-constrained edge devices with significant efficiency gains.

Abstract: The impressive performance of transformer models has sparked the deployment
of intelligent applications on resource-constrained edge devices. However,
ensuring high-quality service for real-time edge systems is a significant
challenge due to the considerable computational demands and resource
requirements of these models. Existing strategies typically either offload
transformer computations to other devices or directly deploy compressed models
on individual edge devices. These strategies, however, result in either
considerable communication overhead or suboptimal trade-offs between accuracy
and efficiency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a collaborative
inference system for general transformer models, termed CoFormer. The central
idea behind CoFormer is to exploit the divisibility and integrability of
transformer. An off-the-shelf large transformer can be decomposed into multiple
smaller models for distributed inference, and their intermediate results are
aggregated to generate the final output. We formulate an optimization problem
to minimize both inference latency and accuracy degradation under heterogeneous
hardware constraints. DeBo algorithm is proposed to first solve the
optimization problem to derive the decomposition policy, and then progressively
calibrate decomposed models to restore performance. We demonstrate the
capability to support a wide range of transformer models on heterogeneous edge
devices, achieving up to 3.1$\times$ inference speedup with large transformer
models. Notably, CoFormer enables the efficient inference of GPT2-XL with 1.6
billion parameters on edge devices, reducing memory requirements by 76.3\%.
CoFormer can also reduce energy consumption by approximately 40\% while
maintaining satisfactory inference performance.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Proposes Mixture of Contexts (MoC), a learnable sparse attention routing module that enables efficient long-context video generation by dynamically selecting informative chunks and anchors for attention, achieving near-linear scaling and maintaining consistency over minutes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long video generation requires models to retain and retrieve salient events across long sequences, but traditional diffusion transformers face quadratic cost limitations from self-attention, making memory and computation intractable for long contexts.

Method: Recasts long-context video generation as internal information retrieval and introduces MoC - a sparse attention routing module where each query dynamically selects a few informative chunks plus mandatory anchors (caption, local windows) with causal routing to prevent loop closures.

Result: The approach enables near-linear scaling in computation and memory, allowing practical training and synthesis while preserving identities, actions, and scenes over minutes of generated content. The model allocates compute to salient history through gradual sparsification.

Conclusion: MoC provides an effective long-term memory retrieval engine for video generation, addressing the quadratic cost problem of self-attention and enabling the emergence of memory and consistency at minute-scale durations through efficient sparse attention routing.

Abstract: Long video generation is fundamentally a long context memory problem: models
must retain and retrieve salient events across a long range without collapsing
or drifting. However, scaling diffusion transformers to generate long-context
videos is fundamentally limited by the quadratic cost of self-attention, which
makes memory and computation intractable and difficult to optimize for long
sequences. We recast long-context video generation as an internal information
retrieval task and propose a simple, learnable sparse attention routing module,
Mixture of Contexts (MoC), as an effective long-term memory retrieval engine.
In MoC, each query dynamically selects a few informative chunks plus mandatory
anchors (caption, local windows) to attend to, with causal routing that
prevents loop closures. As we scale the data and gradually sparsify the
routing, the model allocates compute to salient history, preserving identities,
actions, and scenes over minutes of content. Efficiency follows as a byproduct
of retrieval (near-linear scaling), which enables practical training and
synthesis, and the emergence of memory and consistency at the scale of minutes.

TL;DR: Deep learning multimodal framework combining CT images, radiomics, and clinical data predicts HNSCC metastasis risk with high accuracy (AUC=0.803)


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Metastasis is the major challenge in HNSCC management, and reliable pre-treatment prediction of metastatic risk is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies and prognosis

Method: Multimodal framework integrating CT images (using 3D Swin Transformer for deep features), radiomics (1562 features filtered to 36), and clinical data (age, sex, smoking, alcohol status) through a fully connected network

Result: Fusion model outperformed single-modality approaches (AUC=0.803, ACC=0.752, SEN=0.730, SPE=0.758), with 3D deep learning alone achieving AUC=0.715. Model showed generalizability across tumor subtypes and complementary information from different modalities

Conclusion: The multimodal fusion model demonstrated high accuracy and robustness in predicting metastasis risk, offering comprehensive tumor biology representation and potential as a clinical decision-support tool for personalized treatment planning

Abstract: Metastasis remains the major challenge in the clinical management of head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Reliable pre-treatment prediction of
metastatic risk is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies and prognosis.
This study develops a deep learning-based multimodal framework to predict
metastasis risk in HNSCC patients by integrating computed tomography (CT)
images, radiomics, and clinical data. 1497 HNSCC patients were included. Tumor
and organ masks were derived from pretreatment CT images. A 3D Swin Transformer
extracted deep features from tumor regions. Meanwhile, 1562 radiomics features
were obtained using PyRadiomics, followed by correlation filtering and random
forest selection, leaving 36 features. Clinical variables including age, sex,
smoking, and alcohol status were encoded and fused with imaging-derived
features. Multimodal features were fed into a fully connected network to
predict metastasis risk. Performance was evaluated using five-fold
cross-validation with area under the curve (AUC), accuracy (ACC), sensitivity
(SEN), and specificity (SPE). The proposed fusion model outperformed
single-modality models. The 3D deep learning module alone achieved an AUC of
0.715, and when combined with radiomics and clinical features, predictive
performance improved (AUC = 0.803, ACC = 0.752, SEN = 0.730, SPE = 0.758).
Stratified analysis showed generalizability across tumor subtypes. Ablation
studies indicated complementary information from different modalities.
Evaluation showed the 3D Swin Transformer provided more robust representation
learning than conventional networks. This multimodal fusion model demonstrated
high accuracy and robustness in predicting metastasis risk in HNSCC, offering a
comprehensive representation of tumor biology. The interpretable model has
potential as a clinical decision-support tool for personalized treatment
planning.

*Vincent E. Castillo*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: GABMs using LLMs show promise for supply chain simulations but require dual validation for human equivalence and decision process accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether LLMs can effectively simulate human behavior in logistics and supply chain management simulations, as traditional agent-based models lack human-like reasoning capabilities.

Method: Controlled experiment with 957 human participants (477 dyads) in food delivery scenarios, testing 6 state-of-the-art LLMs using moderated mediation design, Two One-Sided Tests (TOST) for equivalence, and structural equation modeling (SEM).

Result: Some LLMs demonstrate surface-level equivalence to humans but show artificial decision processes not present in human participants, revealing an equivalence-versus-process paradox.

Conclusion: GABMs are potentially viable for LSCM research with proper dual validation (human equivalence testing and decision process validation), providing a framework for rigorous development and evidence-based LLM selection.

Abstract: Generative Agent-Based Models (GABMs) powered by large language models (LLMs)
offer promising potential for empirical logistics and supply chain management
(LSCM) research by enabling realistic simulation of complex human behaviors.
Unlike traditional agent-based models, GABMs generate human-like responses
through natural language reasoning, which creates potential for new
perspectives on emergent LSCM phenomena. However, the validity of LLMs as
proxies for human behavior in LSCM simulations is unknown. This study evaluates
LLM equivalence of human behavior through a controlled experiment examining
dyadic customer-worker engagements in food delivery scenarios. I test six
state-of-the-art LLMs against 957 human participants (477 dyads) using a
moderated mediation design. This study reveals a need to validate GABMs on two
levels: (1) human equivalence testing, and (2) decision process validation.
Results reveal GABMs can effectively simulate human behaviors in LSCM; however,
an equivalence-versus-process paradox emerges. While a series of Two One-Sided
Tests (TOST) for equivalence reveals some LLMs demonstrate surface-level
equivalence to humans, structural equation modeling (SEM) reveals artificial
decision processes not present in human participants for some LLMs. These
findings show GABMs as a potentially viable methodological instrument in LSCM
with proper validation checks. The dual-validation framework also provides LSCM
researchers with a guide to rigorous GABM development. For practitioners, this
study offers evidence-based assessment for LLM selection for operational tasks.

TL;DR: A data-efficient point cloud segmentation pipeline using two-stage training with pre-training on mixed datasets and fine-tuning on limited in-domain data, achieving significant performance improvements with only 50 labeled point clouds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of robust 3D semantic segmentation in low-data scenarios, particularly for unimproved roads and other classes where labeled in-domain data is scarce.

Method: Two-stage training framework: 1) Pre-training a projection-based CNN on mixture of public urban datasets and small curated in-domain dataset, 2) Fine-tuning lightweight prediction head exclusively on in-domain data. Also explores Point Prompt Training for batch normalization, Manifold Mixup regularization, and histogram-normalized ambients.

Result: Significant performance improvements: mean IoU increased from 33.5% to 51.8% and overall accuracy from 85.5% to 90.8% compared to naive training, using only 50 labeled point clouds from target domain.

Conclusion: Pre-training across multiple datasets is crucial for improving generalization and enabling robust segmentation under limited in-domain supervision, demonstrating a practical framework for challenging low-data 3D semantic segmentation scenarios.

Abstract: In this case study, we present a data-efficient point cloud segmentation
pipeline and training framework for robust segmentation of unimproved roads and
seven other classes. Our method employs a two-stage training framework: first,
a projection-based convolutional neural network is pre-trained on a mixture of
public urban datasets and a small, curated in-domain dataset; then, a
lightweight prediction head is fine-tuned exclusively on in-domain data. Along
the way, we explore the application of Point Prompt Training to batch
normalization layers and the effects of Manifold Mixup as a regularizer within
our pipeline. We also explore the effects of incorporating histogram-normalized
ambients to further boost performance. Using only 50 labeled point clouds from
our target domain, we show that our proposed training approach improves mean
Intersection-over-Union from 33.5% to 51.8% and the overall accuracy from 85.5%
to 90.8%, when compared to naive training on the in-domain data. Crucially, our
results demonstrate that pre-training across multiple datasets is key to
improving generalization and enabling robust segmentation under limited
in-domain supervision. Overall, this study demonstrates a practical framework
for robust 3D semantic segmentation in challenging, low-data scenarios. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early lung cancer detection requires accurate volumetric assessment of pulmonary nodules, but traditional methods like CTR and spherical approximation produce inconsistent estimates due to nodule shape and density variability.

Method: Multi-scale 3D convolutional neural network combined with subtype-specific bias correction, trained and evaluated on 364 cases from Shanghai Chest Hospital.

Result: Achieved mean absolute deviation of 8.0% compared to manual nonlinear regression, with inference times under 20 seconds per scan. Outperforms existing deep learning and semi-automated methods (25-30% error, 60+ seconds processing).

Conclusion: The framework provides highly accurate, efficient, and scalable tool for clinical lung nodule screening and monitoring, with strong potential to improve early lung cancer detection.

Abstract: Early detection of lung cancer is crucial for effective treatment and relies
on accurate volumetric assessment of pulmonary nodules in CT scans. Traditional
methods, such as consolidation-to-tumor ratio (CTR) and spherical
approximation, are limited by inconsistent estimates due to variability in
nodule shape and density. We propose an advanced framework that combines a
multi-scale 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) with subtype-specific bias
correction for precise volume estimation. The model was trained and evaluated
on a dataset of 364 cases from Shanghai Chest Hospital. Our approach achieved a
mean absolute deviation of 8.0 percent compared to manual nonlinear regression,
with inference times under 20 seconds per scan. This method outperforms
existing deep learning and semi-automated pipelines, which typically have
errors of 25 to 30 percent and require over 60 seconds for processing. Our
results show a reduction in error by over 17 percentage points and a threefold
acceleration in processing speed. These advancements offer a highly accurate,
efficient, and scalable tool for clinical lung nodule screening and monitoring,
with promising potential for improving early lung cancer detection.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: LiDAR on mobile devices enables real-time background removal using depth information instead of traditional chroma keying or AI models, working equally well in various lighting conditions at 60fps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional background removal methods like chroma keying and AI models have limitations with lighting conditions and performance. LiDAR's depth-based approach provides lighting-independent, real-time background removal capabilities.

Method: Integrated iPhone 15 Pro Max LiDAR and color cameras with GPU-based image processing using SwiftUI/Swift frameworks and Metal Shader Language for real-time enhancement at 60fps.

Result: Successfully achieved real-time background removal at 60fps streaming rate, though limited by depth map resolution (320x240) and material reflection constraints of LiDAR technology.

Conclusion: LiDAR shows promise as a superior background removal method for mobile applications, with potential to become preeminent if resolution can match color image quality.

Abstract: Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology in consumer-grade mobile
devices can be used as a replacement for traditional background removal and
compositing techniques. Unlike approaches such as chroma keying and trained AI
models, LiDAR's depth information is independent of subject lighting, and
performs equally well in low-light and well-lit environments. We integrate the
LiDAR and color cameras on the iPhone 15 Pro Max with GPU-based image
processing. We use Apple's SwiftUI and Swift frameworks for user interface and
backend development, and Metal Shader Language (MSL) for realtime image
enhancement at the standard iPhone streaming frame rate of 60 frames per
second. The only meaningful limitations of the technology are the streaming
bandwidth of the depth data, which currently reduces the depth map resolution
to 320x240, and any pre-existing limitations of the LiDAR IR laser to reflect
accurate depth from some materials. If the LiDAR resolution on a mobile device
like the iPhone can be improved to match the color image resolution, LiDAR
could feasibly become the preeminent method of background removal for video
applications and photography.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: GENRE-CMR is a GAN-based deep unrolled reconstruction framework that enhances CMR image reconstruction fidelity and generalization across diverse acquisition settings using residual connections, Edge-Aware Region loss, and Statistical Distribution Alignment loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accelerated CMR image reconstruction faces challenges in balancing scan time and image quality, especially when generalizing across different acquisition settings and protocols.

Method: Proposes a generative adversarial network with residual deep unrolled reconstruction framework, incorporating Edge-Aware Region loss to focus on structurally informative regions and Statistical Distribution Alignment loss to regularize feature space across diverse data distributions.

Result: Achieves 0.9552 SSIM and 38.90 dB PSNR on unseen distributions across various acceleration factors and sampling trajectories, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: GENRE-CMR provides a unified and robust solution for high-quality CMR reconstruction that can be clinically adapted across heterogeneous acquisition protocols.

Abstract: Accelerated Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) image reconstruction
remains a critical challenge due to the trade-off between scan time and image
quality, particularly when generalizing across diverse acquisition settings. We
propose GENRE-CMR, a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based architecture
employing a residual deep unrolled reconstruction framework to enhance
reconstruction fidelity and generalization. The architecture unrolls iterative
optimization into a cascade of convolutional subnetworks, enriched with
residual connections to enable progressive feature propagation from shallow to
deeper stages. To further improve performance, we integrate two loss functions:
(1) an Edge-Aware Region (EAR) loss, which guides the network to focus on
structurally informative regions and helps prevent common reconstruction
blurriness; and (2) a Statistical Distribution Alignment (SDA) loss, which
regularizes the feature space across diverse data distributions via a symmetric
KL divergence formulation. Extensive experiments confirm that GENRE-CMR
surpasses state-of-the-art methods on training and unseen data, achieving
0.9552 SSIM and 38.90 dB PSNR on unseen distributions across various
acceleration factors and sampling trajectories. Ablation studies confirm the
contribution of each proposed component to reconstruction quality and
generalization. Our framework presents a unified and robust solution for
high-quality CMR reconstruction, paving the way for clinically adaptable
deployment across heterogeneous acquisition protocols.

*Guillaume Balezo,Raphaël Bourgade,Thomas Walter*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: DINOv3-H+ vision transformer pretrained on natural images achieves strong performance (0.8871 balanced accuracy) for atypical mitotic figure classification in histopathology when fine-tuned with LoRA and augmentation, despite domain gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are important prognostic markers but difficult to detect due to low prevalence, subtle morphology, and inter-observer variability. The MIDOG 2025 challenge provides a benchmark for AMF classification across domains.

Method: Fine-tuned DINOv3-H+ vision transformer (pretrained on natural images) using low-rank adaptation (LoRA with 650k trainable parameters) and extensive data augmentation for AMF classification.

Result: Achieved balanced accuracy of 0.8871 on preliminary test set, demonstrating effective transfer learning from natural images to histopathology despite domain differences.

Conclusion: DINOv3 pretraining combined with parameter-efficient fine-tuning provides a strong baseline for atypical mitosis classification, highlighting the robustness of the approach for the MIDOG 2025 challenge.

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are markers of abnormal cell division
associated with poor prognosis, yet their detection remains difficult due to
low prevalence, subtle morphology, and inter-observer variability. The MIDOG
2025 challenge introduces a benchmark for AMF classification across multiple
domains. In this work, we evaluate the recently published DINOv3-H+ vision
transformer, pretrained on natural images, which we fine-tuned using low-rank
adaptation (LoRA, 650k trainable parameters) and extensive augmentation.
Despite the domain gap, DINOv3 transfers effectively to histopathology,
achieving a balanced accuracy of 0.8871 on the preliminary test set. These
results highlight the robustness of DINOv3 pretraining and show that, when
combined with parameter-efficient fine-tuning, it provides a strong baseline
for atypical mitosis classification in MIDOG 2025.

### [267] [MM-HSD: Multi-Modal Hate Speech Detection in Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20546)
*Berta Céspedes-Sarrias,Carlos Collado-Capell,Pablo Rodenas-Ruiz,Olena Hrynenko,Andrea Cavallaro*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: MM-HSD is a multi-modal hate speech detection model for videos that integrates video frames, audio, speech transcripts, and on-screen text using Cross-Modal Attention for improved feature extraction and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal hate speech detection approaches are limited in videos, often omitting relevant modalities like on-screen text and audio, and fail to capture inter-modal dependencies effectively.

Method: Proposes MM-HSD model that integrates video frames, audio, speech transcripts, and on-screen text using Cross-Modal Attention as an early feature extractor, systematically comparing query/key configurations between modalities.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on HateMM dataset with M-F1 score of 0.874, achieving best performance when on-screen text is used as query and other modalities serve as key.

Conclusion: The integration of multiple modalities with Cross-Modal Attention, particularly using on-screen text as query, significantly improves hate speech detection performance in videos.

Abstract: While hate speech detection (HSD) has been extensively studied in text,
existing multi-modal approaches remain limited, particularly in videos. As
modalities are not always individually informative, simple fusion methods fail
to fully capture inter-modal dependencies. Moreover, previous work often omits
relevant modalities such as on-screen text and audio, which may contain subtle
hateful content and thus provide essential cues, both individually and in
combination with others. In this paper, we present MM-HSD, a multi-modal model
for HSD in videos that integrates video frames, audio, and text derived from
speech transcripts and from frames (i.e.~on-screen text) together with features
extracted by Cross-Modal Attention (CMA). We are the first to use CMA as an
early feature extractor for HSD in videos, to systematically compare query/key
configurations, and to evaluate the interactions between different modalities
in the CMA block. Our approach leads to improved performance when on-screen
text is used as a query and the rest of the modalities serve as a key.
Experiments on the HateMM dataset show that MM-HSD outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on M-F1 score (0.874), using concatenation of transcript, audio, video,
on-screen text, and CMA for feature extraction on raw embeddings of the
modalities. The code is available at https://github.com/idiap/mm-hsd

### [268] [Studying Effective String Theory using deep generative models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20610)
*Michele Caselle,Elia Cellini,Alessandro Nada*

Main category: hep-lat

TL;DR: Using deep learning to numerically solve Effective String Theory problems like flux tube width that are too complex for analytical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective String Theory provides a non-perturbative framework for confinement in Yang-Mills theory, but certain complex problems like determining flux tube width cannot be solved analytically with traditional zeta-function regularization.

Method: Employ deep learning techniques based on generative algorithms to numerically explore Effective String Theory, specifically for the Nambu-Goto EST formulation.

Result: Numerical results are obtained for the width of the confining flux tube in Nambu-Goto Effective String Theory using the deep learning approach.

Conclusion: Deep learning provides a viable numerical method for solving complex Effective String Theory problems that are analytically intractable, enabling calculation of physically important quantities like flux tube width.

Abstract: Effective String Theory (EST) offers a robust non-perturbative framework for
describing confinement in Yang-Mills theory by treating the confining flux tube
between a static quark-antiquark pair as a thin, vibrating string. While EST
calculations are typically carried out using zeta-function regularization,
certain problems-such as determining the flux tube width-are too complex to
solve analytically. However, recent studies have demonstrated that EST can be
explored numerically by employing deep learning techniques based on generative
algorithms. In this work, we provide a brief introduction to EST and this novel
numerical approach. Finally, we present results for the width of the
Nambu-Got\"o EST.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: Hierarchical traffic signal control combining model-based optimization with reinforcement learning, using High-Level Coordinator for strategy selection and Hybrid Signal Agents with PPO training, achieving adaptive performance across various traffic conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the dual challenge of maintaining arterial traffic progression while adapting to demand variations at local intersections in urban corridors.

Method: Hierarchical scheme with: 1) High-Level Coordinator selecting coordination strategies (MFC or GWC), 2) Corridor Coordinator deriving phase constraints, 3) Hybrid Signal Agents using reinforcement learning with action masking. Trained with hierarchical PPO on SUMO-RLlib platform.

Result: Hybrid MFC maximizes throughput under heavy demand; hybrid GWC minimizes arterial stops and maintains progression; pure agent control improves network-wide travel time in moderate demand but less effective under heavy demand.

Conclusion: The hierarchical design enables adaptive strategy selection, achieving robust performance across all demand levels by dynamically switching between coordination strategies based on traffic conditions.

Abstract: Signal control in urban corridors faces the dual challenge of maintaining
arterial traffic progression while adapting to demand variations at local
intersections. We propose a hierarchical traffic signal coordination and
control scheme that integrates model-based optimization with reinforcement
learning. The system consists of: (i) a High-Level Coordinator (HLC) that
selects coordination strategies based on observed and predicted demand; (ii) a
Corridor Coordinator that derives phase constraints from the selected
strategy-either Max-Flow Coordination (MFC) or Green-Wave Coordination (GWC);
and (iii) Hybrid Signal Agents (HSAs) that determine signal phases via
reinforcement learning with action masking to enforce feasibility. Hierarchical
reinforcement learning with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is used to train
HSA and HLC policies. At the lower level, three HSA policies-MFC-aware,
GWC-aware, and pure agent control (PAC) are trained in conjunction with their
respective coordination strategies. At the higher level, the HLC is trained to
dynamically switch strategies using a multi-objective reward balancing
corridor-level and network-wide performance. The proposed scheme was developed
and evaluated on a SUMO-RLlib platform. Case results show that hybrid MFC
maximizes throughput under heavy demand; hybrid GWC consistently minimizes
arterial stops and maintains progression across diverse traffic conditions but
can reduce network-wide efficiency; and PAC improves network-wide travel time
in moderate demand but is less effective under heavy demand. The hierarchical
design enables adaptive strategy selection, achieving robust performance across
all demand levels.

*Zhuoyuan Wang,Raffaele Romagnoli,Kamyar Azizzadenesheli,Yorie Nakahira*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: Neural Spline Operators (NeSO) framework uses physics-informed neural operators with B-spline representations to efficiently quantify long-term risk probabilities in stochastic systems with functional variations in dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with complex varying dynamics in risk quantification. Sampling-based and PDE-based approaches have limitations, and current physics-informed neural networks cannot handle functional variations in system dynamics.

Method: Proposed Neural Spline Operators (NeSO) framework that leverages B-spline representations within a physics-informed neural operator approach to learn mappings from varying functional system dynamics to risk probabilities, improving training efficiency and boundary condition enforcement.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows universal approximation capability. Case studies demonstrate efficacy with varying functional dynamics and high-dimensional multi-agent dynamics, showing significant online speed-up over existing methods.

Conclusion: NeSO provides an effective framework for risk quantification with functional variations and offers benefits for other control and PDE-related problems beyond risk quantification.

Abstract: Accurately quantifying long-term risk probabilities in diverse stochastic
systems is essential for safety-critical control. However, existing
sampling-based and partial differential equation (PDE)-based methods often
struggle to handle complex varying dynamics. Physics-informed neural networks
learn surrogate mappings for risk probabilities from varying system parameters
of fixed and finite dimensions, yet can not account for functional variations
in system dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce physics-informed
neural operator (PINO) methods to risk quantification problems, to learn
mappings from varying \textit{functional} system dynamics to corresponding risk
probabilities. Specifically, we propose Neural Spline Operators (NeSO), a PINO
framework that leverages B-spline representations to improve training
efficiency and achieve better initial and boundary condition enforcements,
which are crucial for accurate risk quantification. We provide theoretical
analysis demonstrating the universal approximation capability of NeSO. We also
present two case studies, one with varying functional dynamics and another with
high-dimensional multi-agent dynamics, to demonstrate the efficacy of NeSO and
its significant online speed-up over existing methods. The proposed framework
and the accompanying universal approximation theorem are expected to be
beneficial for other control or PDE-related problems beyond risk
quantification.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: Neural operator-based predictor feedback control for nonlinear systems with unknown long actuator delays, achieving 15x speedup over traditional methods with theoretical stability guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of implementing predictor feedback controllers in nonlinear systems with unknown and arbitrarily long actuator delays, which are analytically intractable to solve directly.

Method: Approximate the predictor using a learned neural operator mapping trained offline, then deployed online. Theoretical stability analysis based on universal approximation theorem and transport PDE representation of delay, with Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional proving semi-global practical convergence.

Result: The method demonstrates 15 times speedup compared to traditional numerical methods when validated on a biological activator/repressor system, with performance dependent on predictor approximation error and delay bounds.

Conclusion: Neural operator approximation provides an effective solution for predictor feedback control in delayed nonlinear systems, offering significant computational advantages while maintaining theoretical stability guarantees through proper error analysis.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a rigorous method for implementing predictor
feedback controllers in nonlinear systems with unknown and arbitrarily long
actuator delays. To address the analytically intractable nature of the
predictor, we approximate it using a learned neural operator mapping. This
mapping is trained once, offline, and then deployed online, leveraging the fast
inference capabilities of neural networks. We provide a theoretical stability
analysis based on the universal approximation theorem of neural operators and
the transport partial differential equation (PDE) representation of the delay.
We then prove, via a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, semi-global practical
convergence of the dynamical system dependent on the approximation error of the
predictor and delay bounds. Finally, we validate our theoretical results using
a biological activator/repressor system, demonstrating speedups of 15 times
compared to traditional numerical methods.

### [272] [A Unified Theory of Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20109)
*Robert Worden*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: A unified theory combining Bayesian cognitive linguistics with sexual selection evolution, using Construction Grammars with novel pragmatic and fast learning elements to explain language processing and evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a comprehensive theory that explains language's speed, expressivity, diversity, and integrates all aspects (phonology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics) through a unified computational framework.

Method: Extends Construction Grammars with graph-like feature structures and Bayesian maximum likelihood pattern matching (unification). Uses slow general inference initially, then rapid unification-based learning and application.

Result: Accounts for language's major puzzles including pragmatics phenomena, provides evolutionary continuity with animal cognition, and explains human mind reading, cooperation, and cultural foundations.

Conclusion: Language evolved through sexual selection for intelligence display and is processed via Bayesian unification, forming the basis of human cognition, culture, and society.

Abstract: A unified theory of language combines a Bayesian cognitive linguistic model
of language processing, with the proposal that language evolved by sexual
selection for the display of intelligence. The theory accounts for the major
facts of language, including its speed and expressivity, and data on language
diversity, pragmatics, syntax and semantics. The computational element of the
theory is based on Construction Grammars. These give an account of the syntax
and semantics of the worlds languages, using constructions and unification. Two
novel elements are added to construction grammars: an account of language
pragmatics, and an account of fast, precise language learning. Constructions
are represented in the mind as graph like feature structures. People use slow
general inference to understand the first few examples they hear of any
construction. After that it is learned as a feature structure, and is rapidly
applied by unification. All aspects of language (phonology, syntax, semantics,
and pragmatics) are seamlessly computed by fast unification; there is no
boundary between semantics and pragmatics. This accounts for the major puzzles
of pragmatics, and for detailed pragmatic phenomena. Unification is Bayesian
maximum likelihood pattern matching. This gives evolutionary continuity between
language processing in the human brain, and Bayesian cognition in animal
brains. Language is the basis of our mind reading abilities, our cooperation,
self esteem and emotions; the foundations of human culture and society.

TL;DR: Unified multi-speaker encoder (UME) architecture that jointly learns representations for speaker diarization, speech separation, and multi-speaker ASR using shared speech encoder with residual weighted-sum encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To capture inherent interdependencies among speaker diarization, speech separation, and multi-speaker ASR tasks through joint training, improving performance on overlapping speech data.

Method: Joint training approach using shared speech foundational encoder with residual weighted-sum encoding (RWSE) from multiple layers to leverage information from different semantic levels.

Result: Substantially improves over single-task baselines, achieving diarization error rates of 1.37% on Libri2Mix and 2.29% on Libri3Mix evaluation sets.

Conclusion: UME effectively captures task interdependencies and enhances overall performance on overlapping speech tasks through joint representation learning.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified multi-speaker encoder (UME), a novel
architecture that jointly learns representations for speaker diarization (SD),
speech separation (SS), and multi-speaker automatic speech recognition (ASR)
tasks using a shared speech foundational encoder. We leverage the hidden
representations from multiple layers of UME as a residual weighted-sum encoding
(RWSE) to effectively use information from different semantic levels,
contributing to bottom-up alignment between tasks. This joint training approach
captures the inherent interdependencies among the tasks, enhancing overall
performance on overlapping speech data. Our evaluations demonstrate that UME
substantially improves over the single-task baselines dedicated to SD, SS, and
multi-speaker ASR on LibriMix evaluation sets. Notably, for SD, UME outperforms
the previous studies, achieving diarization error rates of 1.37% and 2.29% on
Libri2Mix and Libri3Mix evaluation sets, respectively.

*Hashim Ali,Surya Subramani,Shefali Sudhir,Raksha Varahamurthy,Hafiz Malik*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: Evaluation of state-of-the-art voice spoof detection systems shows poor performance against laundering attacks like reverberation and noise, highlighting the need for more robust detection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Voice cloning technology has advanced significantly, enabling realistic synthesized speech that can be abused. While existing detection methods work well on clean audio, their performance against laundering attacks remains unknown.

Method: Created ASVSpoof Laundering Database based on ASVSpoof 2019 with 1388.22 hours of audio. Evaluated seven SOTA audio spoof detection approaches against various laundering attacks including reverberation and additive noise.

Result: SOTA systems perform poorly against aggressive laundering attacks, particularly reverberation and additive noise attacks.

Conclusion: Current voice spoof detection methods are vulnerable to laundering attacks, demonstrating the urgent need for more robust audio spoof detection systems.

Abstract: Voice-cloning (VC) systems have seen an exceptional increase in the realism
of synthesized speech in recent years. The high quality of synthesized speech
and the availability of low-cost VC services have given rise to many potential
abuses of this technology. Several detection methodologies have been proposed
over the years that can detect voice spoofs with reasonably good accuracy.
However, these methodologies are mostly evaluated on clean audio databases,
such as ASVSpoof 2019. This paper evaluates SOTA Audio Spoof Detection
approaches in the presence of laundering attacks. In that regard, a new
laundering attack database, called the ASVSpoof Laundering Database, is
created. This database is based on the ASVSpoof 2019 (LA) eval database
comprising a total of 1388.22 hours of audio recordings. Seven SOTA audio spoof
detection approaches are evaluated on this laundered database. The results
indicate that SOTA systems perform poorly in the presence of aggressive
laundering attacks, especially reverberation and additive noise attacks. This
suggests the need for robust audio spoof detection.

Result: Obtained expected test results showing the system can detect equipment failures in real time, reducing the need for visual inspections.

Conclusion: The proposed sound-based monitoring method successfully enables real-time equipment failure detection and reduces dependency on manual visual inspections for railway point machines.

Abstract: Since 2018, East Japan Railway Company and Hitachi, Ltd. have been working to
replace human inspections with IoT-based monitoring. The purpose is
Labor-saving required for equipment inspections and provide appropriate
preventive maintenance. As an alternative to visual inspection, it has been
difficult to substitute electrical characteristic monitoring, and the
introduction of new high-performance sensors has been costly. In 2019, we
implemented cameras and microphones in an ``NS'' electric point machines to
reduce downtime from equipment failures, allowing for remote monitoring of
lock-piece conditions. This method for detecting turnout switching errors based
on sound information was proposed, and the expected test results were obtained.
The proposed method will make it possible to detect equipment failures in real
time, thereby reducing the need for visual inspections. This paper presents the
results of our technical studies aimed at automating the inspection of
electronic point machines using sound, specifically focusing on ``switch
sound'' beginning in 2019.

Main category: cs.DL

TL;DR: LLM-based metadata harvester that extracts and unifies metadata from diverse ecological datasets to enable better dataset discovery and integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large ecological datasets are valuable but hard to combine due to varying metadata standards across different data provider platforms, making dataset discovery and integration challenging.

Method: Developed an LLM-based tool that extracts metadata from dataset landing pages, converts to unified format using existing standards, uses LLM post-processing for accuracy, and identifies dataset links through embedding similarity and rule-based processing.

Result: The tool successfully extracts both structured and unstructured metadata with equal accuracy, enables flexible metadata linking between datasets, and supports ontology creation and graph-based queries.

Conclusion: The LLM-based metadata harvester provides an effective solution for overcoming metadata heterogeneity in ecological research, facilitating better dataset discovery and integration in virtual research environments.

Abstract: Large, open datasets can accelerate ecological research, particularly by
enabling researchers to develop new insights by reusing datasets from multiple
sources. However, to find the most suitable datasets to combine and integrate,
researchers must navigate diverse ecological and environmental data provider
platforms with varying metadata availability and standards. To overcome this
obstacle, we have developed a large language model (LLM)-based metadata
harvester that flexibly extracts metadata from any dataset's landing page, and
converts these to a user-defined, unified format using existing metadata
standards. We validate that our tool is able to extract both structured and
unstructured metadata with equal accuracy, aided by our LLM post-processing
protocol. Furthermore, we utilise LLMs to identify links between datasets, both
by calculating embedding similarity and by unifying the formats of extracted
metadata to enable rule-based processing. Our tool, which flexibly links the
metadata of different datasets, can therefore be used for ontology creation or
graph-based queries, for example, to find relevant ecological and environmental
datasets in a virtual research environment.

Main category: cs.DL

TL;DR: LLMs can effectively identify semantic relationships between research topics across biomedical, physics, and engineering domains when fine-tuned on a novel 8K-relationship dataset (PEM-Rel-8K), outperforming zero-shot and chain-of-thought approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual ontology creation is expensive and time-consuming, leading to uneven coverage, limited connectivity, and infrequent updates across disciplines. There's a need for automated methods to build and maintain research field ontologies.

Method: Evaluated multiple LLMs under three conditions: zero-shot prompting, chain-of-thought prompting, and fine-tuning on PEM-Rel-8K dataset (8,000+ relationships from MeSH, PhySH, IEEE taxonomies). Also assessed cross-domain transferability by training models in one domain and testing in another.

Result: Fine-tuning LLMs on PEM-Rel-8K yielded excellent performance across all three disciplines (biomedicine, physics, engineering), significantly outperforming zero-shot and chain-of-thought approaches.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned LLMs show strong capability for automated ontology relationship identification, offering a scalable solution to overcome the limitations of manual ontology creation and maintenance in research fields.

Abstract: Ontologies and taxonomies of research fields are critical for managing and
organising scientific knowledge, as they facilitate efficient classification,
dissemination and retrieval of information. However, the creation and
maintenance of such ontologies are expensive and time-consuming tasks, usually
requiring the coordinated effort of multiple domain experts. Consequently,
ontologies in this space often exhibit uneven coverage across different
disciplines, limited inter-domain connectivity, and infrequent updating cycles.
In this study, we investigate the capability of several large language models
to identify semantic relationships among research topics within three academic
domains: biomedicine, physics, and engineering. The models were evaluated under
three distinct conditions: zero-shot prompting, chain-of-thought prompting, and
fine-tuning on existing ontologies. Additionally, we assessed the cross-domain
transferability of fine-tuned models by measuring their performance when
trained in one domain and subsequently applied to a different one. To support
this analysis, we introduce PEM-Rel-8K, a novel dataset consisting of over
8,000 relationships extracted from the most widely adopted taxonomies in the
three disciplines considered in this study: MeSH, PhySH, and IEEE. Our
experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning LLMs on PEM-Rel-8K yields excellent

### [280] [Particle swarm optimization for online sparse streaming feature selection under uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20123)
*Ruiyang Xu*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: POS2FS is a new uncertainty-aware online sparse streaming feature selection framework that uses particle swarm optimization and three-way decision theory to handle incomplete high-dimensional streaming data with uncertain feature-label correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world streaming data often suffers from incompleteness due to sensor failures, and existing methods struggle with uncertain feature-label correlations, leading to inflexible models and degraded performance.

Method: Proposes POS2FS framework using particle swarm optimization (PSO) for supervision to reduce uncertainty in feature-label relationships, and incorporates three-way decision theory to manage feature fuzziness in supervised learning.

Result: Rigorous testing on six real-world datasets shows POS2FS outperforms conventional OSFS and OS2FS techniques, achieving higher accuracy through more robust feature subset selection.

Conclusion: The proposed POS2FS framework effectively addresses data incompleteness and uncertainty issues in online streaming feature selection, providing superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: In real-world applications involving high-dimensional streaming data, online
streaming feature selection (OSFS) is widely adopted. Yet, practical
deployments frequently face data incompleteness due to sensor failures or
technical constraints. While online sparse streaming feature selection (OS2FS)
mitigates this issue via latent factor analysis-based imputation, existing
methods struggle with uncertain feature-label correlations, leading to
inflexible models and degraded performance. To address these gaps, this work
proposes POS2FS-an uncertainty-aware online sparse streaming feature selection
framework enhanced by particle swarm optimization (PSO). The approach
introduces: 1) PSO-driven supervision to reduce uncertainty in feature-label
relationships; 2) Three-way decision theory to manage feature fuzziness in
supervised learning. Rigorous testing on six real-world datasets confirms
POS2FS outperforms conventional OSFS and OS2FS techniques, delivering higher
accuracy through more robust feature subset selection.

*Zofia Rudnicka,Janusz Szczepanski,Agnieszka Pregowska*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: SNNDeep is the first spiking neural network optimized for liver health classification from CT scans, outperforming framework-based SNNs with 98.35% accuracy and reduced training overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spiking neural networks offer energy efficiency and biological plausibility but remain unexplored in high-stakes biomedical imaging applications like liver health classification.

Method: Developed SNNDeep using three learning algorithms (Surrogate Gradient Learning, Tempotron rule, Bio-Inspired Active Learning) across three architectural variants, optimized with Optuna on the Medical Segmentation Decathlon liver dataset.

Result: Custom-built SNNDeep achieved 98.35% validation accuracy, superior adaptability across learning rules, and significantly reduced training overhead compared to framework-based implementations.

Conclusion: Low-level, highly tunable SNNs can outperform standard frameworks in medical imaging, particularly in data-limited diagnostic settings, opening new pathways for neuro-inspired AI in precision medicine.

Abstract: Purpose: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently gained attention as
energy-efficient, biologically plausible alternatives to conventional deep
learning models. Their application in high-stakes biomedical imaging remains
almost entirely unexplored. Methods: This study introduces SNNDeep, the first
tailored SNN specifically optimized for binary classification of liver health
status from computed tomography (CT) features. To ensure clinical relevance and
broad generalizability, the model was developed and evaluated using the
Task03\Liver dataset from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD), a
standardized benchmark widely used for assessing performance across diverse
medical imaging tasks. We benchmark three fundamentally different learning
algorithms, namely Surrogate Gradient Learning, the Tempotron rule, and
Bio-Inspired Active Learning across three architectural variants: a fully
customized low-level model built from scratch, and two implementations using
leading SNN frameworks, i.e., snnTorch and SpikingJelly. Hyperparameter
optimization was performed using Optuna. Results: Our results demonstrate that
the custom-built SNNDeep consistently outperforms framework-based
implementations, achieving a maximum validation accuracy of 98.35%, superior
adaptability across learning rules, and significantly reduced training
overhead. Conclusion:This study provides the first empirical evidence that
low-level, highly tunable SNNs can surpass standard frameworks in medical
imaging, especially in data-limited, temporally constrained diagnostic
settings, thereby opening a new pathway for neuro-inspired AI in precision
medicine.

*Yi Jiang,Malyaban Bal,Brian Matejek,Susmit Jha,Adam Cobb,Abhronil Sengupta*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: A novel spatio-temporal pruning framework for Spiking LLMs that combines spatial pruning (reducing neurons/attention heads), temporal pruning (dynamic timestep adjustment), quantization, and knowledge distillation to achieve energy-efficient deployment while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models face deployment challenges in energy-constrained environments due to their large size and high inference latency. Spiking Neural Networks offer energy-efficient alternatives through event-driven processing, making them promising for power-efficient LLMs.

Method: Proposes a spatio-temporal pruning framework: spatial pruning reduces active neurons and attention heads to lower computational complexity; temporal pruning dynamically adjusts timesteps per layer to minimize latency; combined with extreme quantization and knowledge distillation strategies.

Result: Extensive evaluation on SpikingBERT using GLUE benchmark demonstrates significant improvements in computational operations and inference latency while preserving high performance.

Conclusion: The framework provides a compelling solution for real-time, low-power NLP applications, making Spiking LLMs practical for deployment on edge devices and power-constrained environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant challenges for deployment in
energy-constrained environments due to their large model sizes and high
inference latency. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the sparse
event-driven neural processing and energy-efficient information transmission in
the brain, offer a promising alternative for achieving low-power computing.
Integrating the event-driven efficiency of spiking neurons with the advanced
capabilities of LLMs represents a promising direction for power-efficient LLMs.
This work specifically delves into the design of compressed spiking LLMs. Here,
we revisit spatial and temporal pruning from the perspective of SNNs and
propose a novel spatio-temporal pruning framework for Spiking LLMs to optimize
computational efficiency while preserving high performance. Our spatial pruning
technique reduces the number of active neurons and attention heads, effectively
lowering the computational complexity of the model. Meanwhile, temporal pruning
minimizes inference latency by dynamically adjusting the number of timesteps
required for different layers. By combining these approaches with other
compression techniques, we present the first work in the domain of Spiking LLMs
to jointly explore spatial pruning, temporal pruning, extreme quantization and
knowledge distillation strategies. Extensive experimental evaluation of our
proposed framework for SpikingBERT on the large-scale GLUE benchmark
demonstrates the efficacy of our approach in terms of computational operations
and inference latency. Our approach offers a compelling solution for real-time,
low-power natural language processing applications, making Spiking LLMs more
practical for deployment on edge devices and in power-constrained settings.

*Jonas Henkel*

TL;DR: AI tools show promise for mathematical research but have systematic flaws; proposed framework positions AI as copilot under human guidance with 5 principles for responsible use across 7 research applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how large language models can be effectively integrated into mathematical research workflows given their current capabilities and limitations.

Method: Analysis of recent benchmarks (MathArena, Open Proof Corpus) and development of a framework based on the 'augmented mathematician' principle with five guiding principles for AI integration.

Result: Found that state-of-the-art models demonstrate strong problem-solving abilities but exhibit systematic flaws including lack of self-critique and discrepancies between answer accuracy and proof validity.

Conclusion: AI's primary role is augmentation rather than automation, requiring new skills in strategic prompting, critical verification, and methodological rigor for effective use in mathematical research.

Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), marked by
breakthroughs like 'AlphaEvolve' and 'Gemini Deep Think', is beginning to offer
powerful new tools that have the potential to significantly alter the research
practice in many areas of mathematics. This paper explores the current
landscape of publicly accessible large language models (LLMs) in a mathematical
research context, based on developments up to August 2, 2025. Our analysis of
recent benchmarks, such as MathArena and the Open Proof Corpus (Balunovi\'c et
al., 2025; Dekoninck et al., 2025), reveals a complex duality: while
state-of-the-art models demonstrate strong abilities in solving problems and
evaluating proofs, they also exhibit systematic flaws, including a lack of
self-critique and a model depending discrepancy between final-answer accuracy
and full-proof validity.
  Based on these findings, we propose a durable framework for integrating AI
into the research workflow, centered on the principle of the augmented
mathematician. In this model, the AI functions as a copilot under the critical
guidance of the human researcher, an approach distilled into five guiding
principles for effective and responsible use. We then systematically explore
seven fundamental ways AI can be applied across the research lifecycle, from
creativity and ideation to the final writing process, demonstrating how these
principles translate into concrete practice.
  We conclude that the primary role of AI is currently augmentation rather than
automation. This requires a new skill set focused on strategic prompting,
critical verification, and methodological rigor in order to effectively use
these powerful tools.

*Xiaoxuan Yang,Syrine Belakaria,Biresh Kumar Joardar,Huanrui Yang,Janardhan Rao Doppa,Partha Pratim Pande,Krishnendu Chakrabarty,Hai Li*

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: Proposed ReSNA training method and CF-MESMO optimization algorithm for robust DNN inferencing on noisy ReRAM accelerators, achieving 2.57% accuracy improvement and 90.91% computation cost reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stochastic noise in ReRAM crossbars degrades DNN inferencing accuracy, requiring robust hardware accelerator design and optimization methods.

Method: ReSNA: stochastic-noise-aware training method; CF-MESMO: information-theoretic algorithm for multi-objective optimization using continuous-fidelity evaluation to trade-off accuracy and computation cost.

Result: 2.57% inferencing accuracy improvement for ResNet20 on CIFAR-10; 90.91% computation cost reduction compared to NSGA-II.

Conclusion: The proposed methods efficiently uncover high-quality Pareto fronts and enable robust DNN inferencing on noisy ReRAM accelerators with significant improvements in accuracy and computation efficiency.

Abstract: Resistive random-access memory (ReRAM) is a promising technology for
designing hardware accelerators for deep neural network (DNN) inferencing.
However, stochastic noise in ReRAM crossbars can degrade the DNN inferencing
accuracy. We propose the design and optimization of a high-performance,
area-and energy-efficient ReRAM-based hardware accelerator to achieve robust
DNN inferencing in the presence of stochastic noise. We make two key technical
contributions. First, we propose a stochastic-noise-aware training method,
referred to as ReSNA, to improve the accuracy of DNN inferencing on ReRAM
crossbars with stochastic noise. Second, we propose an information-theoretic
algorithm, referred to as CF-MESMO, to identify the Pareto set of solutions to
trade-off multiple objectives, including inferencing accuracy, area overhead,
execution time, and energy consumption. The main challenge in this context is
that executing the ReSNA method to evaluate each candidate ReRAM design is
prohibitive. To address this challenge, we utilize the continuous-fidelity
evaluation of ReRAM designs associated with prohibitive high computation cost
by varying the number of training epochs to trade-off accuracy and cost.
CF-MESMO iteratively selects the candidate ReRAM design and fidelity pair that
maximizes the information gained per unit computation cost about the optimal
Pareto front. Our experiments on benchmark DNNs show that the proposed
algorithms efficiently uncover high-quality Pareto fronts. On average, ReSNA
achieves 2.57% inferencing accuracy improvement for ResNet20 on the CIFAR-10
dataset with respect to the baseline configuration. Moreover, CF-MESMO
algorithm achieves 90.91% reduction in computation cost compared to the popular
multi-objective optimization algorithm NSGA-II to reach the best solution from
NSGA-II.

TL;DR: Photonic restricted Boltzmann machine (PRBM) uses photonic computing to accelerate Gibbs sampling, reducing computational complexity from O(N) to O(1) and enabling efficient content generation without matrix storage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RBMs suffer from high computational costs in Gibbs sampling for content generation tasks, creating bottlenecks in electronic implementations.

Method: Propose a photonic RBM that leverages photonic computing architecture with efficient encoding to eliminate matrix decomposition and reduce computational complexity. Validated through 2D Ising model simulation and content generation tasks.

Result: PRBM achieves O(1) computational complexity for Gibbs sampling, closely matches theoretical phase transition predictions, and demonstrates robust content generation capabilities including images and temporal sequences even with noise.

Conclusion: The PRBM framework offers scalability and reduced training costs, providing a promising pathway for advancing photonic computing in generative artificial intelligence.

Abstract: The restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is a neural network based on the Ising
model, well known for its ability to learn probability distributions and
stochastically generate new content. However, the high computational cost of
Gibbs sampling in content generation tasks imposes significant bottlenecks on
electronic implementations. Here, we propose a photonic restricted Boltzmann
machine (PRBM) that leverages photonic computing to accelerate Gibbs sampling,
enabling efficient content generation. By introducing an efficient encoding
method, the PRBM eliminates the need for computationally intensive matrix
decomposition and reduces the computational complexity of Gibbs sampling from
$O(N)$ to $O(1)$. Moreover, its non-Von Neumann photonic computing architecture
circumvents the memory storage of interaction matrices, providing substantial
advantages for large-scale RBMs. We experimentally validate the
photonic-accelerated Gibbs sampling by simulating a two-dimensional Ising
model, where the observed phase transition temperature closely matches the
theoretical predictions. Beyond physics-inspired tasks, the PRBM demonstrates
robust capabilities in generating and restoring diverse content, including
images and temporal sequences, even in the presence of noise and aberrations.
The scalability and reduced training cost of the PRBM framework underscore its
potential as a promising pathway for advancing photonic computing in generative
artificial intelligence.

TL;DR: LLMs can discover and analyze complex US tax-minimization strategies, including interpreting, completing, and generating novel strategies from scratch, potentially revolutionizing tax enforcement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate if advanced LLMs can handle the complex domain of US tax law, which challenges even human experts, with the goal of reducing tax revenue loss from wealthy taxpayers.

Method: Evaluated state-of-the-art LLMs on three capabilities: (1) interpreting and verifying tax strategies, (2) filling gaps in partially specified strategies, and (3) generating complete end-to-end strategies from scratch using extensive tax documentation.

Result: LLMs successfully performed all three tasks and notably discovered an entirely novel tax strategy that was previously unknown, demonstrating their potential in tax law reasoning.

Conclusion: Large language models show significant potential to revolutionize tax agencies' efforts against tax abuse by discovering novel strategies and navigating complex tax law documentation more effectively than human experts alone.

Abstract: We investigate whether large language models can discover and analyze U.S.
tax-minimization strategies. This real-world domain challenges even seasoned
human experts, and progress can reduce tax revenue lost from well-advised,
wealthy taxpayers. We evaluate the most advanced LLMs on their ability to (1)
interpret and verify tax strategies, (2) fill in gaps in partially specified
strategies, and (3) generate complete, end-to-end strategies from scratch. This
domain should be of particular interest to the LLM reasoning community: unlike
synthetic challenge problems or scientific reasoning tasks, U.S. tax law
involves navigating hundreds of thousands of pages of statutes, case law, and
administrative guidance, all updated regularly. Notably, LLM-based reasoning
identified an entirely novel tax strategy, highlighting these models' potential
to revolutionize tax agencies' fight against tax abuse.

*Rongwei Liu,Jin Zheng,John Cartlidge*

Main category: q-fin.PM

TL;DR: This paper proposes DDPG-TiDE, a reinforcement learning framework combining Time-series Dense Encoder with Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient for optimal asset allocation, outperforming Q-learning and buy-and-hold strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional asset allocation methods have limitations due to strict distributional assumptions and non-additive reward ratios, which restrict robustness and applicability to investment goals.

Method: Formulates asset allocation as MDP, applies RL with Kelly criterion for reward balancing, and integrates TiDE into DDPG framework for continuous decision-making in financial scenarios.

Result: DDPG-TiDE outperforms Q-learning and generates higher risk-adjusted returns than passive buy-and-hold investment strategy.

Conclusion: Integrating TiDE within DDPG reinforcement learning framework is a promising approach for optimal asset allocation that warrants further exploration.

Abstract: The optimal asset allocation between risky and risk-free assets is a
persistent challenge due to the inherent volatility in financial markets.
Conventional methods rely on strict distributional assumptions or non-additive
reward ratios, which limit their robustness and applicability to investment
goals. To overcome these constraints, this study formulates the optimal
two-asset allocation problem as a sequential decision-making task within a
Markov Decision Process (MDP). This framework enables the application of
reinforcement learning (RL) mechanisms to develop dynamic policies based on
simulated financial scenarios, regardless of prerequisites. We use the Kelly
criterion to balance immediate reward signals against long-term investment
objectives, and we take the novel step of integrating the Time-series Dense
Encoder (TiDE) into the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) RL framework
for continuous decision-making. We compare DDPG-TiDE with a simple
discrete-action Q-learning RL framework and a passive buy-and-hold investment
strategy. Empirical results show that DDPG-TiDE outperforms Q-learning and
generates higher risk adjusted returns than buy-and-hold. These findings
suggest that tackling the optimal asset allocation problem by integrating TiDE
within a DDPG reinforcement learning framework is a fruitful avenue for further
exploration.

Motivation: Traditional quantitative trading models struggle with dynamic market changes and black swan events due to rigid assumptions and limited generalization capabilities.

Method: Constructed multi-indicator dataset from 23 years of S&P 500 data (2000-2022) for 16 stocks across 5 sectors, enriched with trend, volatility, and momentum indicators. Used Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm in a lightweight RL framework for policy learning and trading decisions.

Conclusion: QTMRL demonstrates superior performance in adaptive and stable portfolio management, effectively addressing the limitations of traditional quantitative trading models in volatile financial markets.

Abstract: In the highly volatile and uncertain global financial markets, traditional
quantitative trading models relying on statistical modeling or empirical rules
often fail to adapt to dynamic market changes and black swan events due to
rigid assumptions and limited generalization. To address these issues, this
paper proposes QTMRL (Quantitative Trading Multi-Indicator Reinforcement
Learning), an intelligent trading agent combining multi-dimensional technical
indicators with reinforcement learning (RL) for adaptive and stable portfolio
management. We first construct a comprehensive multi-indicator dataset using 23
years of S&P 500 daily OHLCV data (2000-2022) for 16 representative stocks
across 5 sectors, enriching raw data with trend, volatility, and momentum
indicators to capture holistic market dynamics. Then we design a lightweight RL
framework based on the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm, including data
processing, A2C algorithm, and trading agent modules to support policy learning
and actionable trading decisions. Extensive experiments compare QTMRL with 9
baselines (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM, moving average strategies) across diverse market
regimes, verifying its superiority in profitability, risk adjustment, and
downside risk control. The code of QTMRL is publicly available at

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A novel differential privacy mechanism that leverages inherent quantum noise in NISQ devices to protect quantum federated learning models from adversarial attacks while maintaining training accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum federated learning is vulnerable to adversarial attacks that exploit shared model updates to compromise information privacy, and there's a need to leverage inherent quantum noise in NISQ devices for privacy protection.

Method: The approach tunes noise variance through measurement shots and depolarizing channel strength to achieve desired differential privacy levels, specifically designed for NISQ device constraints.

Result: Simulations demonstrate effective control of differential privacy budget through noise parameters, showing a tunable trade-off between security and training accuracy, with robustness against adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: The framework provides an efficient solution for secure quantum federated learning on NISQ devices, offering significant potential for reliable quantum computing applications with controllable privacy-robustness trade-offs.

Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) enables collaborative training of quantum
machine learning (QML) models across distributed quantum devices without raw
data exchange. However, QFL remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where
shared QML model updates can be exploited to undermine information privacy. In
the context of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, a key question
arises: How can inherent quantum noise be leveraged to enforce differential
privacy (DP) and protect model information during training and communication?
This paper explores a novel DP mechanism that harnesses quantum noise to
safeguard quantum models throughout the QFL process. By tuning noise variance
through measurement shots and depolarizing channel strength, our approach
achieves desired DP levels tailored to NISQ constraints. Simulations
demonstrate the framework's effectiveness by examining the relationship between
differential privacy budget and noise parameters, as well as the trade-off
between security and training accuracy. Additionally, we demonstrate the
framework's robustness against an adversarial attack designed to compromise
model performance using adversarial examples, with evaluations based on
critical metrics such as accuracy on adversarial examples, confidence scores
for correct predictions, and attack success rates. The results reveal a tunable
trade-off between privacy and robustness, providing an efficient solution for
secure QFL on NISQ devices with significant potential for reliable quantum
computing applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a comprehensive overview of the intersection between operator learning and inverse problems, addressing the need for robust frameworks that can approximate mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces and solve complex inverse problems in computational sciences.

Method: Covers probabilistic and deterministic approaches to inverse problems, measure-centric formulations, operator learning components (data generation, loss functions, architectures), and end-to-end inverse operator learning that directly maps observed data to solutions without requiring forward map knowledge.

Result: Presents structure-aware architectures for both point predictions and posterior estimates, discusses noise challenges in data-driven inversion, and surveys theoretical foundations for linear and nonlinear inverse problems. Also covers estimation of priors and regularizers using operator learning within classical inversion algorithms.

Conclusion: Operator learning provides a powerful framework for solving inverse problems, with end-to-end approaches offering direct mapping from data to solutions and selective integration within traditional algorithms for prior/regularizer estimation, making it a versatile tool for computational science applications.

Abstract: Operator learning offers a robust framework for approximating mappings
between infinite-dimensional function spaces. It has also become a powerful
tool for solving inverse problems in the computational sciences. This chapter
surveys methodological and theoretical developments at the intersection of
operator learning and inverse problems. It begins by summarizing the
probabilistic and deterministic approaches to inverse problems, and pays
special attention to emerging measure-centric formulations that treat observed
data or unknown parameters as probability distributions. The discussion then
turns to operator learning by covering essential components such as data
generation, loss functions, and widely used architectures for representing
function-to-function maps. The core of the chapter centers on the end-to-end
inverse operator learning paradigm, which aims to directly map observed data to
the solution of the inverse problem without requiring explicit knowledge of the
forward map. It highlights the unique challenge that noise plays in this
data-driven inversion setting, presents structure-aware architectures for both
point predictions and posterior estimates, and surveys relevant theory for
linear and nonlinear inverse problems. The chapter also discusses the
estimation of priors and regularizers, where operator learning is used more
selectively within classical inversion algorithms.

### [294] [Stochastic Gradients under Nuisances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20326)
*Facheng Yu,Ronak Mehta,Alex Luedtke,Zaid Harchaoui*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Analysis of stochastic gradient optimization for problems with unknown nuisance parameters, showing convergence guarantees under Neyman orthogonality conditions and proposing an algorithm variant for cases without orthogonality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address stochastic gradient optimization problems where objectives depend on unknown nuisance parameters, which can alter optima and disrupt optimization trajectories.

Method: Theoretical analysis of classical stochastic gradient algorithm and development of an algorithm variant with approximately orthogonalized updates using an approximately orthogonalized gradient oracle.

Result: Established non-asymptotic convergence guarantees showing that stochastic gradient algorithms can still converge under appropriate conditions like Neyman orthogonality, and that the variant algorithm achieves similar convergence rates even without orthogonality.

Conclusion: Stochastic gradient methods remain effective for problems with nuisance parameters when proper orthogonality conditions are satisfied, and algorithm variants can handle cases where these conditions are not fully met, with applications in statistical learning and causal inference.

Abstract: Stochastic gradient optimization is the dominant learning paradigm for a
variety of scenarios, from classical supervised learning to modern
self-supervised learning. We consider stochastic gradient algorithms for
learning problems whose objectives rely on unknown nuisance parameters, and
establish non-asymptotic convergence guarantees. Our results show that, while
the presence of a nuisance can alter the optimum and upset the optimization
trajectory, the classical stochastic gradient algorithm may still converge
under appropriate conditions, such as Neyman orthogonality. Moreover, even when
Neyman orthogonality is not satisfied, we show that an algorithm variant with
approximately orthogonalized updates (with an approximately orthogonalized
gradient oracle) may achieve similar convergence rates. Examples from
orthogonal statistical learning/double machine learning and causal inference
are discussed.

*Šimon Kucharský,Aayush Mishra,Daniel Habermann,Stefan T. Radev,Paul-Christian Bürkner*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Self-consistency loss on real data improves Bayesian model comparison calibration under model misspecification when using exact likelihoods, but offers limited benefits with neural surrogate likelihoods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural surrogates for amortized Bayesian model comparison become unreliable when simulation models are misspecified, which is precisely when model comparison is most needed.

Method: Supplement simulation-based training with a self-consistency loss on unlabeled real data to improve Bayesian model comparison estimates under empirical distribution shifts.

Result: Self-consistency improves calibration under model misspecification when using analytic likelihoods, but provides limited gains with neural surrogate likelihoods.

Conclusion: Self-consistency is most practical for trustworthy Bayesian model comparison when likelihoods are exact rather than neural surrogates.

Abstract: Amortized Bayesian model comparison (BMC) enables fast probabilistic ranking
of models via simulation-based training of neural surrogates. However, the
reliability of neural surrogates deteriorates when simulation models are
misspecified - the very case where model comparison is most needed. Thus, we
supplement simulation-based training with a self-consistency (SC) loss on
unlabeled real data to improve BMC estimates under empirical distribution
shifts. Using a numerical experiment and two case studies with real data, we
compare amortized evidence estimates with and without SC against analytic or
bridge sampling benchmarks. SC improves calibration under model
misspecification when having access to analytic likelihoods. However, it offers
limited gains with neural surrogate likelihoods, making it most practical for
trustworthy BMC when likelihoods are exact.

### [296] [Polynomial Chaos Expansion for Operator Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20886)
*Himanshu Sharma,Lukáš Novák,Michael D. Shields*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Introduces polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) as an operator learning method for scientific machine learning, providing both operator approximation and uncertainty quantification capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While deep neural networks dominate operator learning for PDEs, there's growing interest in traditional machine learning methods. PCE has proven effective for uncertainty quantification and shows promise for operator learning applications.

Method: Establishes a mathematical framework using polynomial chaos expansion to approximate operators in data-driven and physics-informed settings. Reduces operator learning to solving systems of equations for PCE coefficients.

Result: Demonstrates strong performance on diverse PDE problems, achieving excellent numerical accuracy and computational efficiency while providing uncertainty quantification through simple post-processing of coefficients.

Conclusion: PCE provides an effective alternative to neural network-based operator learning methods, offering both operator approximation and built-in uncertainty quantification capabilities without additional computational cost.

Abstract: Operator learning (OL) has emerged as a powerful tool in scientific machine
learning (SciML) for approximating mappings between infinite-dimensional
functional spaces. One of its main applications is learning the solution
operator of partial differential equations (PDEs). While much of the progress
in this area has been driven by deep neural network-based approaches such as
Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet) and Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), recent
work has begun to explore traditional machine learning methods for OL. In this
work, we introduce polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) as an OL method. PCE has
been widely used for uncertainty quantification (UQ) and has recently gained
attention in the context of SciML. For OL, we establish a mathematical
framework that enables PCE to approximate operators in both purely data-driven
and physics-informed settings. The proposed framework reduces the task of
learning the operator to solving a system of equations for the PCE
coefficients. Moreover, the framework provides UQ by simply post-processing the
PCE coefficients, without any additional computational cost. We apply the
proposed method to a diverse set of PDE problems to demonstrate its
capabilities. Numerical results demonstrate the strong performance of the
proposed method in both OL and UQ tasks, achieving excellent numerical accuracy
and computational efficiency.

TL;DR: Extends transfer learning from regression to decision rules, proposing a novel method for modeling posterior drift through Bayes decision rules by transforming the decision boundary into a low-dimensional empirical risk minimization problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address posterior drift in transfer learning by moving beyond regression-based methods to decision rules, enabling more robust modeling of changing posterior distributions across domains.

Method: Proposes methodology that exploits geometric transformation of Bayes decision boundary to reformulate posterior drift as low-dimensional empirical risk minimization problem, with theoretical guarantees of consistency and risk bounds.

Result: Establishes consistency of estimators and derives risk bounds under mild regularity conditions. Demonstrates superior performance and robustness through extensive simulations and real-world data analyses.

Conclusion: The method successfully extends transfer learning to decision rules, provides theoretical guarantees, and shows practical effectiveness in applications including optimal individualized treatment rule estimation.

Abstract: In this paper, we extend the transfer learning classification framework from
regression function-based methods to decision rules. We propose a novel
methodology for modeling posterior drift through Bayes decision rules. By
exploiting the geometric transformation of the Bayes decision boundary, our
method reformulates the problem as a low-dimensional empirical risk
minimization problem. Under mild regularity conditions, we establish the
consistency of our estimators and derive the risk bounds. Moreover, we
illustrate the broad applicability of our method by adapting it to the
estimation of optimal individualized treatment rules. Extensive simulation
studies and analyses of real-world data further demonstrate both superior
performance and robustness of our approach.

*Boaz Taitler,Omer Ben-Porat*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: GenAI can cause workers to exert no effort even when ineffective, and excluding low-value workers can trigger output cascades. Manager's team selection is NP-complete.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how Generative AI affects workplace collaboration when managers can use it to replace workers, analyzing productivity and effort dynamics.

Method: Theoretical framework with manager selecting teams, GenAI substituting unselected workers, workers choosing effort levels with increasing cost. Includes NP-completeness analysis and efficient algorithm for linear cases, plus extensive simulations.

Result: GenAI leads to zero worker effort even when ineffective. Manager's optimization is NP-complete. Low-value workers are critical for sustaining output - excluding them causes cascading failures.

Conclusion: GenAI introduces complex dynamics where strategic team selection matters, low-value workers play crucial roles, and careless implementation can undermine productivity through effort reduction cascades.

Abstract: The rise of Generative AI (GenAI) is reshaping how workers contribute to
shared projects. While workers can use GenAI to boost productivity or reduce
effort, managers may use it to replace some workers entirely. We present a
theoretical framework to analyze how GenAI affects collaboration in such
settings. In our model, the manager selects a team to work on a shared task,
with GenAI substituting for unselected workers. Each worker selects how much
effort to exert, and incurs a cost that increases with the level of effort. We
show that GenAI can lead workers to exert no effort, even if GenAI is almost
ineffective. We further show that the manager's optimization problem is
NP-complete, and provide an efficient algorithm for the special class of
(almost-) linear instances. Our analysis shows that even workers with low
individual value may play a critical role in sustaining overall output, and
excluding such workers can trigger a cascade. Finally, we conduct extensive
simulations to illustrate our theoretical findings.

### [299] [Balancing Profit and Traveller Acceptance in Ride-Pooling Personalised Fares](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20723)
*Michal Bujak,Rafal Kucharski*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: Ride-pooling operators can learn individual travelers' price acceptance levels with over 90% accuracy in 10 days to optimize personalized fares and improve both customer utility and operator profit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ride-pooling success depends on compensating perceived costs with appealing prices, but each traveler has unique value-of-time and acceptable price levels unknown to operators.

Method: Proposes an adaptive pricing policy where the operator constructs daily offers that progressively meet travelers' expectations and learns individual acceptance levels through this process.

Result: Operators achieve over 90% accuracy in predicting pooled travelers' price acceptance within 10 days, enabling removal of inefficient rides and focus on profitable combinations.

Conclusion: Learning individual behavioral traits allows ride-pooling operators to simultaneously improve traveler utility and operator profit through personalized fare optimization.

Abstract: Ride-pooling systems, to succeed, must provide an attractive service, namely
compensate perceived costs with an appealing price. However, because of a
strong heterogeneity in a value-of-time, each traveller has his own acceptable
price, unknown to the operator. Here, we show that individual acceptance levels
can be learned by the operator (over $90\%$ accuracy for pooled travellers in
$10$ days) to optimise personalised fares. We propose an adaptive pricing
policy, where every day the operator constructs an offer that progressively
meets travellers' expectations and attracts a growing demand. Our results
suggest that operators, by learning behavioural traits of individual
travellers, may improve performance not only for travellers (increased utility)
but also for themselves (increased profit). Moreover, such knowledge allows the
operator to remove inefficient pooled rides and focus on attractive and
profitable combinations.

*Yunlong Feng,Yang Xu,Xiao Xu,Binyuan Hui,Junyang Lin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning framework that improves code efficiency in LLMs through dynamic exploration and error-insensitive optimization, achieving 10.18% better correctness and 7.75% better runtime efficiency on a 7B model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code generated by large language models often has poor runtime efficiency, limiting practical use in performance-sensitive applications.

Method: Two-stage tuning method with efficiency-oriented reinforcement learning, dynamic exploration, error-insensitive RL, and high-contrast efficiency signals starting from high-correctness baselines.

Result: Improves code correctness by 10.18% and runtime efficiency by 7.75% on a 7B model, achieving performance comparable to much larger models.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses code efficiency problems through strategic exploration and optimization techniques, enabling balanced performance across correctness and efficiency metrics.

Abstract: While code large language models have demonstrated remarkable progress in
code generation, the generated code often exhibits poor runtime efficiency,
limiting its practical application in performance-sensitive scenarios. To
address this limitation, we propose an efficiency-oriented reinforcement
learning framework guided by a novel performance reward. Based on this
framework, we take a deeper dive into the code efficiency problem, identifying
then proposing methods to overcome key bottlenecks: (1) Dynamic exploration
overcomes the static data constraints of offline fine-tuning, enabling the
discovery of more efficient code implementations. (2) The error-insensitive
reinforcement learning method and high-contrast efficiency signals are crucial
for mitigating systematic errors and achieving effective optimization. (3)
Online exploration is most effective when starting from a high-correctness
baseline, as this allows for efficiency improvements without sacrificing
accuracy. With these discoveries, we finally propose a two-stage tuning method,
which achieves high and balanced performance across correctness and efficiency.
The results of experiments show the effectiveness of the method, which improves
code correctness by 10.18\% and runtime efficiency by 7.75\% on a 7B model,
achieving performance comparable to much larger model.

### [301] [Boosting Skeleton-Driven SMT Solver Fuzzing by Leveraging LLM to Produce Formula Generators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20340)
*Maolin Sun,Yibiao Yang,Yuming Zhou*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Chimera is an LLM-assisted fuzzing framework that generates syntactically valid SMT formulas by synthesizing reusable term generators from documentation, reducing LLM interaction overhead while finding 43 bugs in Z3 and cvc5 solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SMT solver testing techniques struggle with rapidly evolving features, and LLM-based approaches face issues with invalid formula generation and high computational costs from iterative LLM interactions.

Method: Chimera uses LLMs to extract context-free grammars from SMT documentation and synthesize composable Boolean term generators. It populates structural skeletons from existing formulas with these LLM-generated terms to ensure syntactic validity while maintaining semantic diversity.

Result: Chimera identified 43 confirmed bugs in Z3 and cvc5 SMT solvers, with 40 already fixed by developers, demonstrating effective bug detection with reduced computational overhead.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses LLM-based SMT testing limitations by shifting from direct formula generation to reusable generator synthesis, ensuring syntactic validity while dramatically reducing runtime costs through one-time LLM interaction.

Abstract: Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers are foundational to modern systems
and programming languages research, providing the foundation for tasks like
symbolic execution and automated verification. Because these solvers sit on the
critical path, their correctness is essential, and high-quality test formulas
are key to uncovering bugs. However, while prior testing techniques performed
well on earlier solver versions, they struggle to keep pace with rapidly
evolving features. Recent approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) show
promise in exploring advanced solver capabilities, but two obstacles remain:
nearly half of the generated formulas are syntactically invalid, and iterative
interactions with the LLMs introduce substantial computational overhead. In
this study, we present Chimera, a novel LLM-assisted fuzzing framework that
addresses both issues by shifting from direct formula generation to the
synthesis of reusable term (i.e., logical expression) generators. Particularly,
Chimera uses LLMs to (1) automatically extract context-free grammars (CFGs) for
SMT theories, including solver-specific extensions, from documentation, and (2)
synthesize composable Boolean term generators that adhere to these grammars.
During fuzzing, Chimera populates structural skeletons derived from existing
formulas with the terms iteratively produced by the LLM-synthesized generators.
This design ensures syntactic validity while promoting semantic diversity.
Notably, Chimera requires only one-time LLM interaction investment,
dramatically reducing runtime cost. We evaluated Chimera on two leading SMT
solvers: Z3 and cvc5. Our experiments show that Chimera has identified 43
confirmed bugs, 40 of which have already been fixed by developers.

### [302] [Adaptive Root Cause Localization for Microservice Systems with Multi-Agent Recursion-of-Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20370)
*Lingzhe Zhang,Tong Jia,Kangjin Wang,Weijie Hong,Chiming Duan,Minghua He,Ying Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RCLAgent is a novel multi-agent framework for root cause localization in microservice systems that uses recursion-of-thought strategy with LLMs, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with single-request analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Microservice systems face frequent failures but existing root cause localization methods either rely on pre-defined schemas that can't adapt to evolving contexts or lack interpretability, leaving SREs confused.

Method: RCLAgent employs a multi-agent recursion-of-thought framework that guides LLM reasoning, integrates data from multiple agents and tool-assisted analysis to pinpoint root causes adaptively.

Result: Experimental evaluations on public datasets show RCLAgent achieves superior performance by localizing root cause using only a single request, outperforming state-of-the-art methods that require multiple requests.

Conclusion: RCLAgent effectively enhances efficiency and precision of root cause localization in complex microservice environments through its adaptive, interpretable multi-agent framework.

Abstract: As contemporary microservice systems become increasingly popular and
complex-often comprising hundreds or even thousands of fine-grained,
interdependent subsystems-they are facing more frequent failures. Ensuring
system reliability thus demands accurate root cause localization. While traces
and metrics have proven to be effective data sources for this task, existing
methods either heavily rely on pre-defined schemas, which struggle to adapt to
evolving operational contexts, or lack interpretability in their reasoning
process, thereby leaving Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) confused. In this
paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on how SREs localize the root cause of
failures, drawing insights from multiple professional SREs across different
organizations. Our investigation reveals that human root cause analysis
exhibits three key characteristics: recursiveness, multi-dimensional expansion,
and cross-modal reasoning. Motivated by these findings, we introduce RCLAgent,
an adaptive root cause localization method for microservice systems that
leverages a multi-agent recursion-of-thought framework. RCLAgent employs a
novel recursion-of-thought strategy to guide the LLM's reasoning process,
effectively integrating data from multiple agents and tool-assisted analysis to
accurately pinpoint the root cause. Experimental evaluations on various public
datasets demonstrate that RCLAgent achieves superior performance by localizing
the root cause using only a single request-outperforming state-of-the-art
methods that depend on aggregating multiple requests. These results underscore
the effectiveness of RCLAgent in enhancing the efficiency and precision of root
cause localization in complex microservice environments.

TL;DR: LLMs perform well on medium-difficulty microservice code generation but struggle with high-difficulty specifications due to complex business logic, external services, database integration, and non-functional requirements like authentication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how far LLMs have advanced in generating code for real-world problems, specifically microservice-based applications which are widely used in modern software architecture.

Method: Developed a standard template for microservice specifications, proposed a difficulty metric, created an automated testing framework using unit tests to evaluate LLM-synthesized code, and analyzed errors across different difficulty levels.

Result: Strong LLMs like GPT-3o-mini perform fairly well on medium difficulty specifications but perform very poorly on higher difficulty levels due to complex business logic, external service integration, database requirements, and non-functional capabilities.

Conclusion: LLMs face significant challenges with complex real-world code generation, particularly with intricate business logic and system integration, suggesting need for future research to improve code synthesis capabilities for practical applications.

Abstract: In this paper we evaluate how far LLMs have advanced in generating code for
real-world problems. Specifically, we explore code synthesis for
microservice-based applications, a widely used architecture pattern. We define
a standard template for specifying these applications, and we propose a metric
for judging the difficulty level of a specification. The higher the score, the
more difficult it is to generate code for the specification. We develop a
framework to automate the process of testing LLM-synthesized code for a
microservice using unit tests. Our experimental results show that strong LLMs
(like GPT-3o-mini) do fairly well on medium difficulty specifications but do
very poorly on those of higher difficulty levels. This is due to more intricate
business logic, a greater use of external services, database integration and
inclusion of non-functional capabilities such as authentication. We analyzed
the errors in LLM-synthesized code and report on the key challenges LLMs face
in generating code for these specifications thereby suggesting future research
directions to improve code synthesis for real-world problems.

Motivation: LLM applications have evolved into complex systems with non-determinism and context dependence, creating fundamental challenges for quality assurance that traditional software testing methods cannot adequately address.

Method: Decomposes LLM applications into three layers (System Shell, Prompt Orchestration, LLM Inference Core), analyzes traditional testing applicability, proposes four collaborative strategies (Retain, Translate, Integrate, Runtime), and develops AICL protocol for agent communication.

Result: Identifies structural disconnects between software engineering and AI testing approaches, reveals 6 core challenges from 4 fundamental differences, and proposes a closed-loop quality assurance framework combining pre-deployment validation with runtime monitoring.

Conclusion: The paper provides practical guidance and standardization proposals for LLM application testing, introducing AICL protocol to address testing challenges in complex LLM systems through collaborative strategies and integrated testing frameworks.

Abstract: Applications of Large Language Models~(LLMs) have evolved from simple text
generators into complex software systems that integrate retrieval augmentation,
tool invocation, and multi-turn interactions. Their inherent non-determinism,
dynamism, and context dependence pose fundamental challenges for quality
assurance. This paper decomposes LLM applications into a three-layer
architecture: \textbf{\textit{System Shell Layer}}, \textbf{\textit{Prompt
Orchestration Layer}}, and \textbf{\textit{LLM Inference Core}}. We then assess
the applicability of traditional software testing methods in each layer:
directly applicable at the shell layer, requiring semantic reinterpretation at
the orchestration layer, and necessitating paradigm shifts at the inference
core. A comparative analysis of Testing AI methods from the software
engineering community and safety analysis techniques from the AI community
reveals structural disconnects in testing unit abstraction, evaluation metrics,
and lifecycle management. We identify four fundamental differences that
underlie 6 core challenges. To address these, we propose four types of
collaborative strategies (\emph{Retain}, \emph{Translate}, \emph{Integrate},
and \emph{Runtime}) and explore a closed-loop, trustworthy quality assurance
framework that combines pre-deployment validation with runtime monitoring.
Based on these strategies, we offer practical guidance and a protocol proposal
to support the standardization and tooling of LLM application testing. We
propose a protocol \textbf{\textit{Agent Interaction Communication Language}}
(AICL) that is used to communicate between AI agents. AICL has the
test-oriented features and is easily integrated in the current agent framework.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning technologies offer significant potential for automated visual inspection in medical devices but introduce new regulatory complexities under the EU AI Act that differ from established medical device regulations.

Method: High-level technical assessment examining divergences in risk management principles, dataset governance, model validation, explainability requirements, and post-deployment monitoring obligations.

Result: Identifies foreseeable challenges manufacturers face when qualifying DL-based inspections, including data retention burdens, global compliance implications, and statistical validation difficulties with limited defect data.

Conclusion: The paper highlights implementation strategies and areas of uncertainty, emphasizing that this is an academic evaluation and manufacturers should consult regulatory authorities for specific compliance pathways.

Abstract: As deep learning (DL) technologies advance, their application in automated
visual inspection for Class III medical devices offers significant potential to
enhance quality assurance and reduce human error. However, the adoption of such
AI-based systems introduces new regulatory complexities--particularly under the
EU Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act, which imposes high-risk system obligations
that differ in scope and depth from established regulatory frameworks such as
the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) and the U.S. FDA Quality System Regulation
(QSR). This paper presents a high-level technical assessment of the
foresee-able challenges that manufacturers are likely to encounter when
qualifying DL-based automated inspections within the existing medical device
compliance landscape. It examines divergences in risk management principles,
dataset governance, model validation, explainability requirements, and
post-deployment monitoring obligations. The discussion also explores potential
implementation strategies and highlights areas of uncertainty, including data
retention burdens, global compliance implications, and the practical
difficulties of achieving statistical significance in validation with limited
defect data. Disclaimer: This publication is in-tended solely as an academic

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Participatory AI aims to involve community members in AI development, but recruitment methodology remains a practical challenge that needs systematic investigation to ensure AI systems meet stakeholder needs and values.

Method: The researchers analyzed a corpus of 37 AI projects to document recruitment practices and conducted interviews with five AI researchers to understand recruitment outcomes and challenges.

Result: The study found that recruitment outcomes are influenced by structural work conditions, researchers' goals/expectations, and relationships built during recruitment. Current practices show diversity but need improvement for equity and empowerment goals.

Conclusion: The paper provides recommendations for designing relationship-forward recruitment methods and reflexive documentation practices to improve Participatory AI research and ensure meaningful stakeholder engagement.

Abstract: Participatory AI, in which impacted community members and other stakeholders
are involved in the design and development of AI systems, holds promise as a
way to ensure AI is developed to meet their needs and reflect their values.
However, the process of identifying, reaching out, and engaging with all
relevant stakeholder groups, which we refer to as recruitment methodology, is
still a practical challenge in AI projects striving to adopt participatory
practices. In this paper, we investigate the challenges that researchers face
when designing and executing recruitment methodology for Participatory AI
projects, and the implications of current recruitment practice for
Participatory AI. First, we describe the recruitment methodologies used in AI
projects using a corpus of 37 projects to capture the diversity of practices in
the field and perform an initial analysis on the documentation of recruitment
practices, as well as specific strategies that researchers use to meet goals of
equity and empowerment. To complement this analysis, we interview five AI
researchers to learn about the outcomes of recruitment methodologies. We find
that these outcomes are shaped by structural conditions of their work,
researchers' own goals and expectations, and the relationships built from the
recruitment methodology and subsequent collaboration. Based on these analyses,
we provide recommendations for designing and executing relationship-forward
recruitment methods, as well as reflexive recruitment documentation practices
for Participatory AI researchers.

TL;DR: CMS develops ML-based particle flow algorithm using transformer model to directly reconstruct particles from tracks and clusters in single pass.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage machine learning for optimizing particle reconstruction, improve physical quantity estimation, and utilize heterogeneous computing architectures in CMS event reconstruction.

Method: Uses transformer-based MLPF model that directly infers particles from tracks and clusters in a single pass, with developments in training datasets, model architecture, and integration with offline reconstruction software.

Result: Development of machine-learned particle flow algorithm that provides end-to-end optimization for particle reconstruction in CMS.

Conclusion: MLPF represents a significant advancement in particle flow reconstruction using modern machine learning techniques, showing promise for improved event reconstruction performance in CMS.

Abstract: The particle-flow (PF) algorithm provides a global event description by
reconstructing final-state particles and is central to event reconstruction in
CMS. Recently, end-to-end machine learning (ML) approaches have been proposed
to directly optimize physical quantities of interest and to leverage

### [309] [SPGrasp: Spatiotemporal Prompt-driven Grasp Synthesis in Dynamic Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20547)
*Yunpeng Mei,Hongjie Cao,Yinqiu Xia,Wei Xiao,Zhaohan Feng,Gang Wang,Jie Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SPGrasp is a real-time dynamic grasp synthesis framework that extends SAMv2 for video streams, achieving low-latency inference (59-73ms) with high accuracy (90-94%) across multiple benchmarks while maintaining promptability and temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to achieve low-latency inference while maintaining promptability for real-time interactive grasp synthesis of dynamic objects, creating a need for a solution that bridges this gap.

Method: Extends Segment Anything Model v2 (SAMv2) for video stream grasp estimation by integrating user prompts with spatiotemporal context to enable real-time interaction with end-to-end latency while ensuring temporal consistency.

Result: Achieves 90.6% accuracy on OCID, 93.8% on Jacquard, and 92.0% on GraspNet-1Billion with 73.1ms latency (58.5% reduction vs RoG-SAM). Real-world experiments show 94.8% success rate with moving objects.

Conclusion: SPGrasp effectively resolves the latency-interactivity trade-off in dynamic grasp synthesis, demonstrating superior performance in both benchmark evaluations and real-world interactive grasping scenarios.

Abstract: Real-time interactive grasp synthesis for dynamic objects remains challenging
as existing methods fail to achieve low-latency inference while maintaining
promptability. To bridge this gap, we propose SPGrasp (spatiotemporal
prompt-driven dynamic grasp synthesis), a novel framework extending segment
anything model v2 (SAMv2) for video stream grasp estimation. Our core
innovation integrates user prompts with spatiotemporal context, enabling
real-time interaction with end-to-end latency as low as 59 ms while ensuring
temporal consistency for dynamic objects. In benchmark evaluations, SPGrasp
achieves instance-level grasp accuracies of 90.6% on OCID and 93.8% on
Jacquard. On the challenging GraspNet-1Billion dataset under continuous
tracking, SPGrasp achieves 92.0% accuracy with 73.1 ms per-frame latency,
representing a 58.5% reduction compared to the prior state-of-the-art
promptable method RoG-SAM while maintaining competitive accuracy. Real-world
experiments involving 13 moving objects demonstrate a 94.8% success rate in
interactive grasping scenarios. These results confirm SPGrasp effectively
resolves the latency-interactivity trade-off in dynamic grasp synthesis. Code

Conclusion: Framework effectively ensures spatial precision and visual fidelity in real-time, high-risk industrial environments through proactive rendering and preemptive control.

Abstract: Real-time human-device interaction in industrial Metaverse faces challenges
such as high computational load, limited bandwidth, and strict latency. This
paper proposes a task-oriented edge-assisted cross-system framework using
digital twins (DTs) to enable responsive interactions. By predicting operator
motions, the system supports: 1) proactive Metaverse rendering for visual
feedback, and 2) preemptive control of remote devices. The DTs are decoupled
into two virtual functions-visual display and robotic control-optimizing both
performance and adaptability. To enhance generalizability, we introduce the
Human-In-The-Loop Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (HITL-MAML) algorithm, which
dynamically adjusts prediction horizons. Evaluation on two tasks demonstrates
the framework's effectiveness: in a Trajectory-Based Drawing Control task, it
reduces weighted RMSE from 0.0712 m to 0.0101 m; in a real-time 3D scene
representation task for nuclear decommissioning, it achieves a PSNR of 22.11,
SSIM of 0.8729, and LPIPS of 0.1298. These results show the framework's
capability to ensure spatial precision and visual fidelity in real-time,
high-risk industrial environments.

TL;DR: CoCoL is a communication-efficient decentralized collaborative learning method for multi-robot systems that reduces communication overhead and handles data heterogeneity using mirror descent framework and gradient tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collaborative learning in multi-robot systems faces challenges with high communication overhead and data heterogeneity, which limit scalability and performance in complex tasks.

Method: Leverages mirror descent framework with approximate Newton-type updates to capture similarity between robot objective functions, uses inexact sub-problem solutions to reduce computational costs, and integrates gradient tracking scheme for robustness against data heterogeneity.

Result: Experimental results show CoCoL significantly reduces both communication rounds and total bandwidth consumption while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy, particularly effective in challenging scenarios with non-IID data, streaming data, and time-varying network topologies.

Conclusion: CoCoL provides an effective solution for communication-efficient collaborative learning in multi-robot systems, demonstrating superior performance in reducing communication overhead while handling data heterogeneity and dynamic network conditions.

Abstract: Collaborative learning enhances the performance and adaptability of
multi-robot systems in complex tasks but faces significant challenges due to
high communication overhead and data heterogeneity inherent in multi-robot
tasks. To this end, we propose CoCoL, a Communication efficient decentralized
Collaborative Learning method tailored for multi-robot systems with
heterogeneous local datasets. Leveraging a mirror descent framework, CoCoL
achieves remarkable communication efficiency with approximate Newton-type
updates by capturing the similarity between objective functions of robots, and
reduces computational costs through inexact sub-problem solutions. Furthermore,
the integration of a gradient tracking scheme ensures its robustness against
data heterogeneity. Experimental results on three representative multi robot
collaborative learning tasks show the superiority of the proposed CoCoL in
significantly reducing both the number of communication rounds and total
bandwidth consumption while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy. These
benefits are particularly evident in challenging scenarios involving non-IID

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ActLoc is an active viewpoint-aware planning framework that uses a large-scale attention model to predict localization accuracy across camera orientations, enabling robots to select optimal viewpoints for robust localization during navigation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing localization systems assume all viewing directions are equally informative, but in practice, localization becomes unreliable when robots observe unmapped, ambiguous, or uninformative regions, leading to navigation failures.

Method: Uses a large-scale trained attention-based model that encodes metric maps and camera poses from map construction to predict localization accuracy across yaw and pitch directions at arbitrary 3D locations. These accuracy distributions are integrated into a path planner to actively select camera orientations that maximize localization robustness.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on single-viewpoint selection and generalizes effectively to full-trajectory planning. The modular design makes it applicable to diverse robot navigation and inspection tasks.

Conclusion: ActLoc provides a robust framework for enhancing localization accuracy by actively selecting informative viewpoints, addressing the limitations of traditional systems that treat all viewing directions equally, and demonstrates strong performance across various navigation scenarios.

Abstract: Reliable localization is critical for robot navigation, yet most existing
systems implicitly assume that all viewing directions at a location are equally
informative. In practice, localization becomes unreliable when the robot
observes unmapped, ambiguous, or uninformative regions. To address this, we
present ActLoc, an active viewpoint-aware planning framework for enhancing
localization accuracy for general robot navigation tasks. At its core, ActLoc
employs a largescale trained attention-based model for viewpoint selection. The
model encodes a metric map and the camera poses used during map construction,
and predicts localization accuracy across yaw and pitch directions at arbitrary
3D locations. These per-point accuracy distributions are incorporated into a
path planner, enabling the robot to actively select camera orientations that
maximize localization robustness while respecting task and motion constraints.
ActLoc achieves stateof-the-art results on single-viewpoint selection and
generalizes effectively to fulltrajectory planning. Its modular design makes it
readily applicable to diverse robot navigation and inspection tasks.

*Lorenzo Busellato,Federico Cunico,Diego Dall'Alba,Marco Emporio,Andrea Giachetti,Riccardo Muradore,Marco Cristani*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: UA-PCBFs combine probabilistic human motion forecasting with Control Barrier Functions to enable safer, more fluid human-robot interactions by dynamically adjusting safety margins based on uncertainty estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current collaborative robotics systems are overly conservative due to worst-case human motion predictions, causing unnecessary braking and stalling task progress, which limits true fluid human-robot interaction.

Method: Uncertainty-Aware Predictive Control Barrier Functions (UA-PCBFs) fuse probabilistic human hand motion forecasting with formal safety guarantees of Control Barrier Functions, allowing dynamic adjustment of safety margins based on motion uncertainty.

Result: UA-PCBFs significantly reduce safe space violations compared to state-of-the-art HRI architectures, showing better performance in task-critical metrics through real-world experiments with both automated setups and direct human-robot interactions.

Conclusion: The framework enables more intelligent and fluid human-robot interactions by providing robots with deeper understanding of future human states through uncertainty-aware motion planning while maintaining formal safety guarantees.

Abstract: To enable flexible, high-throughput automation in settings where people and
robots share workspaces, collaborative robotic cells must reconcile stringent
safety guarantees with the need for responsive and effective behavior. A
dynamic obstacle is the stochastic, task-dependent variability of human motion:
when robots fall back on purely reactive or worst-case envelopes, they brake
unnecessarily, stall task progress, and tamper with the fluidity that true
Human-Robot Interaction demands. In recent years, learning-based human-motion
prediction has rapidly advanced, although most approaches produce worst-case
scenario forecasts that often do not treat prediction uncertainty in a
well-structured way, resulting in over-conservative planning algorithms,
limiting their flexibility. We introduce Uncertainty-Aware Predictive Control
Barrier Functions (UA-PCBFs), a unified framework that fuses probabilistic
human hand motion forecasting with the formal safety guarantees of Control
Barrier Functions. In contrast to other variants, our framework allows for
dynamic adjustment of the safety margin thanks to the human motion uncertainty
estimation provided by a forecasting module. Thanks to uncertainty estimation,
UA-PCBFs empower collaborative robots with a deeper understanding of future
human states, facilitating more fluid and intelligent interactions through
informed motion planning. We validate UA-PCBFs through comprehensive real-world
experiments with an increasing level of realism, including automated setups (to
perform exactly repeatable motions) with a robotic hand and direct human-robot
interactions (to validate promptness, usability, and human confidence).
Relative to state-of-the-art HRI architectures, UA-PCBFs show better
performance in task-critical metrics, significantly reducing the number of
violations of the robot's safe space during interaction with respect to the
state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: PEWM proposes a primitive-based world modeling paradigm that uses short-horizon video generation with VLM planning and heatmap guidance to overcome embodied data scarcity and enable fine-grained language-action alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video-generation-based embodied world models face bottlenecks due to scarce, hard-to-collect, high-dimensional embodied data, limiting language-action alignment and long-horizon generation capabilities.

Method: Restricts video generation to fixed short horizons, uses modular VLM planner and Start-Goal heatmap Guidance (SGG) for closed-loop control, leveraging spatiotemporal vision priors and semantic awareness.

Result: Enables fine-grained language-action alignment, reduces learning complexity, improves data efficiency, decreases inference latency, and supports compositional generalization of primitive-level policies.

Conclusion: PEWM bridges fine-grained physical interaction with high-level reasoning, paving the way for scalable, interpretable, and general-purpose embodied intelligence.

Abstract: While video-generation-based embodied world models have gained increasing
attention, their reliance on large-scale embodied interaction data remains a
key bottleneck. The scarcity, difficulty of collection, and high dimensionality
of embodied data fundamentally limit the alignment granularity between language
and actions and exacerbate the challenge of long-horizon video
generation--hindering generative models from achieving a "GPT moment" in the
embodied domain. There is a naive observation: the diversity of embodied data
far exceeds the relatively small space of possible primitive motions. Based on
this insight, we propose a novel paradigm for world modeling--Primitive
Embodied World Models (PEWM). By restricting video generation to fixed short
horizons, our approach 1) enables fine-grained alignment between linguistic
concepts and visual representations of robotic actions, 2) reduces learning
complexity, 3) improves data efficiency in embodied data collection, and 4)
decreases inference latency. By equipping with a modular Vision-Language Model
(VLM) planner and a Start-Goal heatmap Guidance mechanism (SGG), PEWM further
enables flexible closed-loop control and supports compositional generalization
of primitive-level policies over extended, complex tasks. Our framework
leverages the spatiotemporal vision priors in video models and the semantic
awareness of VLMs to bridge the gap between fine-grained physical interaction
and high-level reasoning, paving the way toward scalable, interpretable, and
general-purpose embodied intelligence.

leverage LEGO bricks as the assembly platform and automate the process of

leverages a bimanual robotic system to construct the real assembly products,
bringing user imaginations into the real world. We conduct a comprehensive user

TL;DR: ReCoGNN is an automated feature augmentation framework that uses graph neural networks to extract and integrate relational signals from multiple tables for predictive modeling tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating feature augmentation to identify and utilize task-related relational signals from multiple tables, reducing manual effort in AutoML for relational data.

Method: End-to-end framework that: 1) models intra-table attribute relationships to partition tables into semantic segments, 2) constructs heterogeneous weighted graph for inter-row relationships, 3) uses message-passing GNNs for information propagation and feature selection.

Result: Extensive experiments on 10 real-life and synthetic datasets show ReCoGNN consistently outperforms existing methods on both classification and regression tasks.

Conclusion: ReCoGNN successfully automates feature augmentation by capturing relational dependencies across multiple tables, demonstrating superior performance over traditional methods.

Abstract: Data has become a foundational asset driving innovation across domains such
as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. In these areas, predictive modeling
over relational tables is commonly employed, with increasing emphasis on
reducing manual effort through automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques.
This raises an interesting question: can feature augmentation itself be
automated and identify and utilize task-related relational signals?
  To address this challenge, we propose an end-to-end automated feature
augmentation framework, ReCoGNN, which enhances initial datasets using features
extracted from multiple relational tables to support predictive tasks. ReCoGNN
first captures semantic dependencies within each table by modeling intra-table
attribute relationships, enabling it to partition tables into structured,
semantically coherent segments. It then constructs a heterogeneous weighted
graph that represents inter-row relationships across all segments. Finally,
ReCoGNN leverages message-passing graph neural networks to propagate
information through the graph, guiding feature selection and augmenting the
original dataset. Extensive experiments conducted on ten real-life and
synthetic datasets demonstrate that ReCoGNN consistently outperforms existing
methods on both classification and regression tasks.

TL;DR: Analysis of current SQL-invoked LLM integration limitations in open-source systems and enterprise platforms, identifying key issues and proposing initial solutions for better LLM+DBMS integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are increasingly integrated into relational databases for enhanced querying, but open-source solutions have limited functionality and poor performance compared to commercial offerings.

Method: Conducted early exploration of two open-source systems and one enterprise platform using five representative queries to evaluate functional, performance, and scalability limits of SQL-invoked LLM integrations.

Result: Identified three main issues: difficulty enforcing structured outputs, poor resource utilization optimization, and inadequate query planning. Implemented initial solutions that showed improvements in handling LLM-powered SQL queries.

Conclusion: Tighter integration between LLMs and database management systems is crucial for achieving scalable and efficient processing of LLM queries, with early gains demonstrating the potential of improved integration approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become essential for applications such as
text summarization, sentiment analysis, and automated question-answering.
Recently, LLMs have also been integrated into relational database management
systems to enhance querying and support advanced data processing. Companies
such as Amazon, Databricks, Google, and Snowflake offer LLM invocation directly
within SQL, denoted as LLM queries, to boost data insights. However,
open-source solutions currently have limited functionality and poor
performance. In this work, we present an early exploration of two open-source
systems and one enterprise platform, using five representative queries to
expose functional, performance, and scalability limits in today's SQL-invoked
LLM integrations. We identify three main issues: enforcing structured outputs,
optimizing resource utilization, and improving query planning. We implemented
initial solutions and observed improvements in accommodating LLM powered SQL
queries. These early gains demonstrate that tighter integration of LLM+DBMS is
the key to scalable and efficient processing of LLM queries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored influence of training data scale and quality in speech recognition and develop robust zero-shot models.

Method: Created OLMoASR-Pool (3M hours audio + 17M transcripts), applied text heuristic filters to produce high-quality OLMoASR-Mix (1M hours), trained OLMoASR models ranging from 39M to 1.5B parameters.

Result: OLMoASR achieves comparable performance to OpenAI's Whisper across all scales. OLMoASR-medium.en matches Whisper-medium.en with 12.8% vs 12.4% WER (short-form) and 11.0% vs 10.5% WER (long-form).

Conclusion: High-quality curated datasets enable efficient speech recognition models that compete with larger counterparts. Public release of datasets, models, and code will advance robust speech processing research.

Abstract: Improvements in training data scale and quality have led to significant
advances, yet its influence in speech recognition remains underexplored. In
this paper, we present a large-scale dataset, OLMoASR-Pool, and series of
models, OLMoASR, to study and develop robust zero-shot speech recognition
models. Beginning from OLMoASR-Pool, a collection of 3M hours of English audio
and 17M transcripts, we design text heuristic filters to remove low-quality or
mistranscribed data. Our curation pipeline produces a new dataset containing 1M
hours of high-quality audio-transcript pairs, which we call OLMoASR-Mix. We use
OLMoASR-Mix to train the OLMoASR-Mix suite of models, ranging from 39M
(tiny.en) to 1.5B (large.en) parameters. Across all model scales, OLMoASR
achieves comparable average performance to OpenAI's Whisper on short and
long-form speech recognition benchmarks. Notably, OLMoASR-medium.en attains a
12.8\% and 11.0\% word error rate (WER) that is on par with Whisper's largest
English-only model Whisper-medium.en's 12.4\% and 10.5\% WER for short and
long-form recognition respectively (at equivalent parameter count).
OLMoASR-Pool, OLMoASR models, and filtering, training and evaluation code will
be made publicly available to further research on robust speech processing.

### [320] [Flowing Straighter with Conditional Flow Matching for Accurate Speech Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20584)
*Mattias Cross,Anton Ragni*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper investigates how straight vs curved probability paths affect speech enhancement quality, showing that straight paths (conditional flow matching) outperform curved paths (Schrodinger bridges) and proposing a one-step inference solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current flow-based generative speech enhancement methods use curved probability paths, but the implications of path straightness are unknown. Research suggests straight paths are easier to train and offer better generalization.

Method: The authors compare Schrodinger bridges (curved paths) with conditional flow matching (straight paths), propose independent conditional flow-matching for speech enhancement, and develop a one-step inference solution by treating the trained flow-based model as directly predictive.

Result: Experiments show that time-independent variance has greater effect on sample quality than gradient. Conditional flow matching improves several speech quality metrics but requires multiple inference steps. The one-step solution successfully addresses this limitation.

Conclusion: Straight time-independent probability paths improve generative speech enhancement over curved time-dependent paths, with straight paths being easier to train and offering better generalization performance.

Abstract: Current flow-based generative speech enhancement methods learn curved
probability paths which model a mapping between clean and noisy speech. Despite
impressive performance, the implications of curved probability paths are
unknown. Methods such as Schrodinger bridges focus on curved paths, where
time-dependent gradients and variance do not promote straight paths. Findings
in machine learning research suggest that straight paths, such as conditional
flow matching, are easier to train and offer better generalisation. In this
paper we quantify the effect of path straightness on speech enhancement
quality. We report experiments with the Schrodinger bridge, where we show that
certain configurations lead to straighter paths. Conversely, we propose
independent conditional flow-matching for speech enhancement, which models
straight paths between noisy and clean speech. We demonstrate empirically that
a time-independent variance has a greater effect on sample quality than the
gradient. Although conditional flow matching improves several speech quality
metrics, it requires multiple inference steps. We rectify this with a one-step
solution by inferring the trained flow-based model as if it was directly
predictive. Our work suggests that straighter time-independent probability
paths improve generative speech enhancement over curved time-dependent paths.

*Hongju Su,Ke Li,Lan Yang,Honggang Zhang,Yi-Zhe Song*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Amadeus is a novel symbolic music generation framework that uses a two-level architecture with autoregressive modeling for note sequences and bidirectional diffusion for attributes, achieving SOTA performance with 4x speed-up and fine-grained control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models assume fixed temporal dependencies between musical attributes, but observations show attributes are concurrent and unordered sets rather than sequences with strict dependencies.

Method: Two-level architecture: autoregressive model for note sequences + bidirectional discrete diffusion model for attributes. Uses Music Latent Space Discriminability Enhancement Strategy (MLSDES) with contrastive learning and Conditional Information Enhancement Module (CIEM) with attention mechanisms.

Result: Significantly outperforms SOTA models across multiple metrics while achieving at least 4x speed-up. Enables training-free, fine-grained note attribute control. Compiled largest open-source symbolic music dataset (AMD).

Conclusion: The concurrent attribute modeling approach with two-level architecture proves effective for symbolic music generation, offering superior performance, speed, and control compared to traditional sequential dependency models.

Abstract: Existing state-of-the-art symbolic music generation models predominantly
adopt autoregressive or hierarchical autoregressive architectures, modelling
symbolic music as a sequence of attribute tokens with unidirectional temporal
dependencies, under the assumption of a fixed, strict dependency structure
among these attributes. However, we observe that using different attributes as
the initial token in these models leads to comparable performance. This
suggests that the attributes of a musical note are, in essence, a concurrent
and unordered set, rather than a temporally dependent sequence. Based on this
insight, we introduce Amadeus, a novel symbolic music generation framework.
Amadeus adopts a two-level architecture: an autoregressive model for note
sequences and a bidirectional discrete diffusion model for attributes. To
enhance performance, we propose Music Latent Space Discriminability Enhancement
Strategy(MLSDES), incorporating contrastive learning constraints that amplify
discriminability of intermediate music representations. The Conditional
Information Enhancement Module (CIEM) simultaneously strengthens note latent
vector representation via attention mechanisms, enabling more precise note
decoding. We conduct extensive experiments on unconditional and
text-conditioned generation tasks. Amadeus significantly outperforms SOTA
models across multiple metrics while achieving at least 4$\times$ speed-up.
Furthermore, we demonstrate training-free, fine-grained note attribute control
feasibility using our model. To explore the upper performance bound of the
Amadeus architecture, we compile the largest open-source symbolic music dataset
to date, AMD (Amadeus MIDI Dataset), supporting both pre-training and
fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that a single unified model can effectively screen for diverse conditions, establishing a foundation for deployable voice-based diagnostics in resource-constrained healthcare settings.

Abstract: Voice-based health assessment offers unprecedented opportunities for
scalable, non-invasive disease screening, yet existing approaches typically
focus on single conditions and fail to leverage the rich, multi-faceted
information embedded in speech. We present MARVEL (Multi-task Acoustic
Representations for Voice-based Health Analysis), a privacy-conscious multitask
learning framework that simultaneously detects nine distinct neurological,
respiratory, and voice disorders using only derived acoustic features,
eliminating the need for raw audio transmission. Our dual-branch architecture
employs specialized encoders with task-specific heads sharing a common acoustic
backbone, enabling effective cross-condition knowledge transfer. Evaluated on
the large-scale Bridge2AI-Voice v2.0 dataset, MARVEL achieves an overall AUROC
of 0.78, with exceptional performance on neurological disorders (AUROC = 0.89),
particularly for Alzheimer's disease/mild cognitive impairment (AUROC = 0.97).
Our framework consistently outperforms single-modal baselines by 5-19% and
surpasses state-of-the-art self-supervised models on 7 of 9 tasks, while
correlation analysis reveals that the learned representations exhibit
meaningful similarities with established acoustic features, indicating that the
model's internal representations are consistent with clinically recognized
acoustic patterns. By demonstrating that a single unified model can effectively
screen for diverse conditions, this work establishes a foundation for
deployable voice-based diagnostics in resource-constrained and remote
healthcare settings.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Self-supervised pretraining using feature distillation learns robust spatial representations from binaural speech, improving DoA estimation performance in noisy/reverberant environments compared to supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep representation learning shows strong performance in audio tasks, but spatial representation learning from multichannel audio is underexplored. The paper aims to learn robust spatial representations without data labels.

Method: Feature distillation pretraining: spatial features from clean binaural speech form prediction labels, which are predicted from augmented speech using a neural network. The encoder weights are then used to initialize and fine-tune a DoA estimation model.

Result: Pretrained models show improved performance in noisy and reverberant environments for direction-of-arrival estimation after fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Self-supervised pretraining with feature distillation effectively learns spatial representations from binaural audio, enabling better DoA estimation performance than fully supervised models and classic signal processing methods.

Abstract: Recently, deep representation learning has shown strong performance in
multiple audio tasks. However, its use for learning spatial representations
from multichannel audio is underexplored. We investigate the use of a
pretraining stage based on feature distillation to learn a robust spatial
representation of binaural speech without the need for data labels. In this
framework, spatial features are computed from clean binaural speech samples to
form prediction labels. These clean features are then predicted from
corresponding augmented speech using a neural network. After pretraining, we
throw away the spatial feature predictor and use the learned encoder weights to
initialize a DoA estimation model which we fine-tune for DoA estimation. Our
experiments demonstrate that the pretrained models show improved performance in
noisy and reverberant environments after fine-tuning for direction-of-arrival
estimation, when compared to fully supervised models and classic signal
processing methods.

### [324] [Speech Emotion Recognition via Entropy-Aware Score Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20796)
*ChenYi Chua,JunKai Wong,Chengxin Chen,Xiaoxiao Miao*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: A multimodal speech emotion recognition framework combining acoustic and textual predictions using entropy-aware score selection and sentiment mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome confidence constraints in single-modality speech emotion recognition by leveraging both acoustic and textual information through a reliable fusion approach.

Method: Late score fusion using entropy and varentropy thresholds to combine predictions from wav2vec2.0 acoustic model and RoBERTa-XLM sentiment analysis on Whisper-generated transcriptions, with sentiment-to-emotion mapping.

Result: The method shows practical and reliable enhancement over traditional single-modality systems on IEMOCAP and MSP-IMPROV datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal framework with entropy-aware fusion effectively improves speech emotion recognition performance by leveraging complementary acoustic and textual information.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a multimodal framework for speech emotion
recognition that leverages entropy-aware score selection to combine speech and
textual predictions. The proposed method integrates a primary pipeline that
consists of an acoustic model based on wav2vec2.0 and a secondary pipeline that
consists of a sentiment analysis model using RoBERTa-XLM, with transcriptions
generated via Whisper-large-v3. We propose a late score fusion approach based
on entropy and varentropy thresholds to overcome the confidence constraints of
primary pipeline predictions. A sentiment mapping strategy translates three
sentiment categories into four target emotion classes, enabling coherent
integration of multimodal predictions. The results on the IEMOCAP and
MSP-IMPROV datasets show that the proposed method offers a practical and
reliable enhancement over traditional single-modality systems.

### [325] [WoW-Bench: Evaluating Fine-Grained Acoustic Perception in Audio-Language Models via Marine Mammal Vocalizations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20976)
*Jaeyeon Kim,Heeseung Yun,Sang Hoon Woo,Chao-Han Huck Yang,Gunhee Kim*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: WoW-Bench benchmark evaluates LALMs' low-level auditory perception using marine mammal vocalizations, revealing significant performance gaps compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large audio language models lack exploration in low-level listening abilities like pitch and duration detection, which are critical for real-world sound reasoning tasks.

Method: Introduces World-of-Whale benchmark (WoW-Bench) with Perception benchmark for novel sound categorization and Cognition benchmark based on Bloom's taxonomy with distractor questions to prevent heuristic reliance.

Result: State-of-the-art LALMs perform far below human levels on both perception and cognition tasks, demonstrating poor low-level auditory capabilities.

Conclusion: There is a significant need for stronger auditory grounding in large audio language models to improve their low-level listening and reasoning abilities.

Abstract: Large audio language models (LALMs) extend language understanding into the
auditory domain, yet their ability to perform low-level listening, such as
pitch and duration detection, remains underexplored. However, low-level
listening is critical for real-world, out-of-distribution tasks where models
must reason about unfamiliar sounds based on fine-grained acoustic cues. To
address this gap, we introduce the World-of-Whale benchmark (WoW-Bench) to
evaluate low-level auditory perception and cognition using marine mammal
vocalizations. WoW-bench is composed of a Perception benchmark for categorizing
novel sounds and a Cognition benchmark, inspired by Bloom's taxonomy, to assess
the abilities to remember, understand, apply, and analyze sound events. For the
Cognition benchmark, we additionally introduce distractor questions to evaluate
whether models are truly solving problems through listening rather than relying
on other heuristics. Experiments with state-of-the-art LALMs show performance
far below human levels, indicating a need for stronger auditory grounding in
LALMs.
